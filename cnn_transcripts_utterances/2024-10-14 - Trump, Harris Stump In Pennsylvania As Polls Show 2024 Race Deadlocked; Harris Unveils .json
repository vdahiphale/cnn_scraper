New polling shows the 2024 presidential race remains very, very close and maybe getting even closer with just 22 days to go.Also this hour, Vice President Harris is out with a new plan to create more economic opportunity for black men as their support among that key voting group appears to be lagging compared to past Democratic presidential candidates. Plus, a man is arrested for allegedly threatening FEMA workers in North Carolina's hurricane disaster zone. We're tracking the potential danger and the disruptions to relief operations amid Trump-fueled misinformation about the federal storm response. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. We begin in the make-or-break battleground of Pennsylvania, where Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are both fighting for votes tonight. Our correspondents are on the scene of competing Trump and Harris campaign events. First, Priscilla Alvarez reports on the state of the race heading into the final three weeks before Election Day. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Tonight, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump on a sprint to Election Day with both candidates beginning a week-long stretch crisscrossing swing states. First, in Pennsylvania, where the race remains deadlocked. Harris, trying to lock in her coalition, unveiled new economic proposals appealing to black voters. That plan includes forgivable loans to black entrepreneurs of up to $20,000, promoting apprenticeships, and legalizing recreational marijuana. Taken together, it's a sweeping proposal aimed at trying to persuade black voters, in particular black men, amid signs of lagging enthusiasm. Harris, recognizing the ground her campaign still needs to cover in an interview with The Shade Room. KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Black men are no different from anybody else. They expect that you have to earn their vote. And that's why I'm out here, doing the work that I'm doing, about talking with folks, listening with folks, because I'm running for president of the United States. And it is incumbent on me to earn the support.",

But, as you know, margins are everything, especially in a race this close.So, if you look at The New York Times/Siena poll looking at black voters in this season, well, you see here overall support, Harris at 78 percent among African-American likely voters, Donald Trump at 15 percent. I said only a 15 percent, except that like what you see here is a narrower margin between the Democrat and the Republican than we have seen in recent cycles. And you look at it broken out by gender there as well, black men specifically, Wolf, from The New York Times poll, 70 percent support of Harris, Trump gets 20 percent of them. Now, if you compare those numbers to the 2020 exit polls, you'll see the difference I'm talking about here. So, there, you see that Biden had a 75 percentage point advantage over Trump among African-American voters overall, 87 percent to 12 percent. Even among black male voters, you see Biden's numbers at 79 percent. You just saw in The New York Times poll, Kamala Harris is at 70 percent. So, if that's where the voters end up on Election Day, if she's at 70 percent with black male voters and she's at 83 percent, as The New York Times have, with black female voters, she'll be well below where Joe Biden was performing with these voters just four years ago. And that becomes a problem, a math problem for her, because she has to look elsewhere in the electorate to make up for that.",

And she's looking to really make sure that she's going to outlets that are, you know, where the audience is, is a smart thing to do.But I think, you know, the, the problem that Trump has here is that he's leaning on low propensity voters, voters who, by definition, don't turn out to vote all that often. So, this is where the Harris field operation comes into play. This is where this could be the margin because what Trump needs is for black men and other voters who don't frequently turn out to vote to turn out to vote for him, that's a harder thing to do.",

That's one big pot.The other pot is these Republicans and independents, who may be Republican-leaning, Wolf, who are not in favor of Donald Trump. Think of it as a Nikki Haley voter that we saw in the primaries. Think of it, some of these white college educated Republican voters in the suburbs. This voter is why I think she's going on Fox News. I mean, A, it's an attention dominance scheme, right, try to just, hey, she's never done this before, sit down with Fox News, the Democratic nominee and make a big splash in a game when you have 21 days left of trying to dominate the attention. But I think as a targeting perspective, they are still trying to reach what they did with the Liz Cheney endorsement, you know, that country over party.

So, you know, it buys her a day or two kind of, you know, in the sort of prominence of the national narrative.But more importantly, if you think about the Republican primary, there were a not insignificant number of Republican voters who voted for other Republicans, did not vote for Donald Trump. A lot of those people watch Fox News.

I mean, it appears that he's moving forward to potentially win the Electoral College. If I were advising the vice president, I would probably focus a bit more on the economy, more on immigration, more on foreign policy, the issues where she actually has a deficit, the top three, four, five issues that most voters actually care a lot about. President Biden, when he was running in this race, attempted to focus on these things, and it really didn't move the needle much, Wolf, because I think most voters are concerned about other issues. Now, that isn't to minimize rhetoric that may not be healthy for democracy or healthy for the way we engage in electoral politics, but you do have to win this thing.

We saw certainly in the CNN focus groups right after the debate, we saw people say that that really bothered them, these moderate independent voters.So, I don't think you can say, I don't think you can look at the last two years in this country and say that there is not electoral impact. I think moderate swing voters are deeply disturbed by this kind of language. And the more they hear it from Trump, the more they remember January 6th, they remember that's not what we do as Americans, the notion that there would be a free and fair election and would not -- there would not be a peaceful transfer of power runs against everything that we believe in as Americans.

It's about wealth, it's about health, and it's about freedom. And those are the core components of this agenda. It was great to see that today.

You are the president of all people and you help all Americans.Donald Trump has not understand that. Wolf, when's the last time he's done an interview with CNN or MSNBC? He's always on Fox and Sean Hannity so, that, you know, Hannity can give him, spoon feed him questions. But Kamala Harris has shown that she is going where all of Americans are, if that means going on Fox or on CNN, she's going to do a town hall with you all soon, on MSNBC. She's done interviews there. She's done interviews on black media. She has been all over the place. On late night, she goes everywhere. Donald Trump doesn't do that. He's scared. That's why he's scared to get on the debate stage with her again. We are focused on talking with the American people and Vice President Harris has shown that she has the conviction, the strength, the leadership in order to lead this great nation.",

This is one of the U.S.'s most advanced anti-ballistic missile systems, the THAAD system, as it's known, Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, and it comes with, or requires, about a hundred troops to operate it. So, those troops will soon make their way to Israel. Although the Pentagon isn't being specific on timing, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin did tell his Israeli counterpart they would be there, quote, in the coming days.This is capable of intercepting short, medium, and long range ballistic missiles in their final dive towards their target, so about a hundred miles or slightly more out. And, crucially, it can detect it even farther out than that, more than ten times farther out. And it can work with the Navy destroyers that are in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. And Israel's already complicated and advanced aerial defense system, though not perfect, it has shown its capabilities to intercept Iranian barrages. And that, of course, is the concern here. Israel has vowed that it would retaliate for that barrage of Iranian ballistic missiles earlier this month and that has caused Iran to say it will respond to any attack.

And now as you mentioned, Wolf, we have the arrest of this 44-year-old William Parsons to be clear, we do not know his motive. We do not know if he was influenced by misinformation, but the sheriff's office down there in Rutherford County, North Carolina, one of the hardest hit by Hurricane Helene, has laid out how on Saturday they got a phone call warning them that Parsons was armed and he had made comments about potentially harming FEMA workers. And when they finally located him just a short while later, he was in a vehicle not far away from a relief site where people have been getting donations and he had a rifle and a couple of handguns and has since been arrested and charged with a misdemeanor for going armed to the terror of the public. That is the name of the charge. Wolf, at that point, FEMA quickly when they got wind of this threat, they quickly pulled out their field crews. They wanted them only to be operating in secure facilities. But you can imagine they're on high alert. I asked a captain with the sheriff's office there in North Carolina what his message is to those FEMA workers who are worried. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CAPT.

We're in and around the city of Chengdu. It's known for spicy hot pot, its mountainous landscape, and giant pandas. We're actually going to go meet now with some of the folks from the Smithsonian National Zoo from D.C. who are flown here, and are part of that transition team to bring Bao Li and Qing Bao back to the U.S. We can't go back there. But that's where Bao Li and Qing Bao are. They're in quarantine. And those you saw there were the zookeepers from the National Zoo, as well as some caretakers from China. MARIEL LALLY, SMITHSONIAN'S NATIONAL ZOO PANDA KEEPER: So they both have pretty different personalities. Bao Li has a huge personality, so he's very vocal. He's very energetic when he's always kind of like up doing something. Qing Bao is the polar opposite. She can be almost always found in a tree or sleeping on her climbing structure. CULVER: The panda pair will fill a void at the Smithsonian's National Zoo in Washington, D.C. For the past 11 months, the panda exhibit has sat empty. Now as part of the terms of this Smithsonian's exchange program with China, late last year, the zoo's three pandas were sent back here to Chengdu.",
