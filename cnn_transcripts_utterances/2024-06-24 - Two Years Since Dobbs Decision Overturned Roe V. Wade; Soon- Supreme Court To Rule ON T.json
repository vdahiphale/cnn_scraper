This is, you know, a monumental day, especially four abortion rights supporters who are marking this. But I guess also for opponents who worked very, very hard at to take this down. The reality is it has set abortion up as a critical issue in the 2024 campaigns both and the presidential race, but also across the map. How do you see this playing out right now as you report in the halls of Congress, because it does seem like a place where Republicans still aren't sure exactly how to message around this? STEPHEN NEUKAM, CONGRESSIONAL REPORTER, AXIOS:  Yeah, I think that's right. They still are having trouble sort of finding their footing. We've seen national Republicans tried to sort of pivot to the idea that this is a states right, issue, right? And that this isn't something for federal lawmakers to worry about. Look, when it comes to the presidential election, so much of this is, and you know, this is already baked in. It's Trump, it's Biden, it's about turnout and with the KFF polling and what we know sort of generally as that the abortion issue is one that turns out women voters, young voters, this is something that Democrats are going to hammer and hammer as we get closer to November.",

There was a huge question about how he was going to handle this issue of a possible federal ban. Was he going to come out in support of it or against it?He spoke at that sort of Joni Ernst, the senator from Iowa that we just saw there was speaking at this annual gathering here in Washington of social conservatives, the types of people who worked really hard to get this into place, to lead to the fall of Roe. Donald Trump spoke to them over the weekend and he talked about what happened under his presidency to transform the federal bench. Let's watch.

And just a few hours, hearings pick back up in Donald Trump's classified documents case on the agenda, a request from prosecutors to gag the former president. They argue that he could endanger the lives of FBI agents working on the case if he is free to speak out. On Friday, the former president's legal team tried to convince Judge Aileen Cannon that the appointment of special counsel, Jack Smith, should be invalidated because he's part of a shadow government. Judge Cannon didn't seem to buy it, telling the defense team, quote, that sounds very ominous, a shadow government. But what does that mean? The defense dodged the question. Let's bring in former federal prosecutor, Andrew Cherkasky, for more on this. Andrew, good morning. We've seen criticism from Judge Cannon for, quote/unquote, slow- walking the case. What do you make of how she handled how this played out on Friday?",

I think its too early to critique what judge cannon does or does not do simply by allowing the litigation of this very important issue, you have to look at Jack Smith for what it is. It's an appointment by the attorney general means that Jack Smith isn't confirmed by the Senate as most U.S. officers in high-level positions are like us attorneys.So there is a feeling among some in the country, certainly within the Trump camp that look at Jack Smith as an outsider, somebody who's essentially interfering through their lens with the presidential process both when he was in office, as well as the upcoming election. And that this is an outsider who's making critical decisions about the future of the next president.",

      "sentences": "Well, a federal judge is qualified certainly to sit on virtually any type of case, if they're not disqualified by the nature of some sort of conflict of interests that they might have. Simply the idea that she has perhaps a more minimal amount of time in trial, either as a judge or as a litigator is something that I guess could impact the overall credibility that certain people give her, but she is a confirmed federal judge. And so, you have to be sensitive around that issue.Now, the idea of whether some other judges thought she was most appropriate for this case or not, whether she should have been using are relying more upon her more junior, but more experienced magistrates in the process. Those were all fair critiques that I think could be had both ways. But in terms of a black and white looking at this case, is there something that automatically he says that judge cannon isn't qualified or that she's automatically the type that should be that should have conflicted herself off the case, I don't see that. There's not as many arguments for that as I think Donald Trump perhaps had on the Judge Merchan side of things with family that were closely connected with the opposing party, so to speak. So the critique of Judge Cannon much more based on her experience and perhaps based on the idea that because she was nominated for the bench by Donald Trump, that she has some affinity or some sort of leaning towards him. But, you know, I -- again, I go back to what I said in my earlier answer. The fact that she's having hearings, that she's entered aiming motions and arguments from the defense does not automatically mean that she's bias or that she's unwilling to go with the law. It means that she's willing to hear these arguments out. And go slow as a lot of complex litigation does.",

So, Andrew, the author, of course, looming thing that quite frankly has most of my attention this week is this looming ruling from the Supreme Court on immunity for former President Trump in the January 6 case that jackpot smith has brought here. I'm curious what you make of how the court has been conducting its business in recent days and what it says about whether it will be this week that we will learn whether or not he will have immunity.",

And that's something that could ultimately send these cases back to the trial level for further fact-finding, even the New York case that has resulted in a conviction at this point could go back and hear arguments that the new standard, whatever the Supreme Court sets is that should cause that case to be re-evaluated as a question whether it should ever been brought in the first place all right.",

And its over 20 states are doing it now. Sometimes you don't even know if you're pregnant. The ban takes effect. And so, they worst women to flee from across state lines and even criminalize doctors and women themselves. For me, you're hearing this shifting depending on which audience there in. But to me, we've got to take them at their word, believe them for what they say and it is truly about up ban across the country. It is truly about going after our reproductive rights with IVF, as well as contraception. And so this attack on women, we've got to believe them when they say what they say, they're going to do. And I do believe its going to make a difference at for voters when they go to the polls. You know, Kasie, as you said for me, and so many families in this country, this is not about politics, this is not about policy, this is personal. You know, my -- my family, my son my daughter-in-law, have told me I can share their story because they want me to fight for IVF. They went through two rounds of IVF. The first round on Christmas about two years ago my daughter-in-law called me while I was making Christmas dinner and said, mom, something's not right. Her water prematurely broke. We took her to the first emergency room, which is why this Supreme Court case on EMTALA is so important. That first one basically said, we can't go home. She could have died from sepsis, you know, fortunately and unfortunately, I know are mortality numbers in this country and we ended up going to another hospital. She got the care she needed and then last year, my grand daughter was born. We're going to continue to fight for this. And so people got to pay attention. This is the anniversary. This marks a moment for us to step up and say we're going to show our power at the ballot box. And Democrats in the House and the Senate have worked to pass legislation but this is where our vote counts because we've got to have the votes in order to pass these protections.",

But he's also going to talk about the future and there will be a starkcontrast between a future under Joe Biden who cares about all Americans who wakes up every day thinking about how he can lift us all up, and someone who is very much focused on retribution and setting wants to be a dictator on day one.
