Highly classified Pentagon documents leaked on social media casts serious doubt on Ukraine's ability to end the war against Russia anytime soon. They see weaknesses in Ukraine's weaponry and air defenses could lead to a stalemate for months to come.CNN's Oren Liebermann reports on the investigation into who leaked the documents and why. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): Top U.S. officials trying to get ahead of the damage caused by a leak of highly sensitive documents. LLOYD AUSTIN, U.S. DEFENSE SECRETARY: I will tell you that we take this very seriously and we will continue to investigate and turn over every rock until we find the source of this and the extent of it. LIEBERMANN (voiceover): Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, promising results from an investigation just getting underway. While Secretary of State Antony Blinken, worked to reassure foreign nations. ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: We have engaged with allies and partners at high levels over the past -- the past days. Including to reassure them about our own commitment to safeguarding, intelligence and of course, our commitment to our security partnerships. LIEBERMANN (voiceover): The Department of Justice is handling the criminal investigation of the leaks, while DOD is part of a broader look into how the leaks have impacted national security. The leaks have reached across the globe, revealing us spying on adversaries including Russia and China but also on U.S. allies and partners among them Israel, South Korea and many more. Some of the documents reviewed by CNN, offer sensitive details on Ukraine's military capabilities or lack thereof. Including critical shortages of air defenses and overall casualty assessments. After more than a year of war. Ukrainian officials downplayed the significance of the leaks saying some of the information wasn't secret at all. But a source close to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy says the military has already changed some of its plans because of the leaks. In a new set of leaked documents obtained by the Washington Post, the U.S. learned Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi was considering providing 40,000 rockets to Russia for its war in Ukraine. But to do so quietly to avoid problems with the West. Since Egypt is one of the largest recipients of U.S. military aid. CNN has not seen the documents and cannot confirm their authenticity. The Egyptian state media called the report and informational absurdity while the Kremlin called it another hoax and the U.S. says, they've seen no signs of Egypt providing lethal aid to Russia. But it underscores the far-reaching consequences of the leaks. SEN. CHRIS MURPHY (D-CT): I want a briefing on the logistics right on how this information got out there. But we also need to get briefings on the substance. LIEBERMANN (voiceover): The leaked documents appear to be part of a daily intelligence briefing prepared for the Pentagon's Senior Leaders, official said the documents can be accessed by hundreds if not thousands of people across the government with the proper security clearance. (END VIDEOTAPE) LIEBERMANN (on camera): It's not just a question of the number of people who had access to information like this, but how it's disseminated either through tablets rigged to have top secret information on them. Also, printed out as we've seen through the documents, and simply forwarded via emails. Either in whole or in excerpts depending on the classification level. Some of that creates an electronic track that can be looked after and investigated, but not all of it. And that adds to the complications in investigating something like this and trying to figure out the motive behind it. Oren Liebermann, CNN at the Pentagon.",

The judge said bringing up the insurrection would be too prejudicial, and that this lawsuit is not about whether Fox influenced the storming of the U.S. Capitol. The judge who said he has been receiving death threats also, restricted some evidence Fox wanted for its defense. The Right-Wing network is being sued for promoting false claims about Dominion machines rigging the 2020 presidential election. Fox calls the lawsuit a meritless assault on press freedoms.

The judge at one point became notably frustrated with the network for not being forthcoming, fully transparent about Rupert Murdoch's role at the company. For years, Fox lawyers have maintained that Rupert Murdoch doesn't have an official role at Fox News. He's the chairman of Fox Corporation, but that the lawyers had said he didn't have an official role at Fox News. It was only disclosed recently that he is actually an officer at the company. And the judge not very happy about this, making it clear in court he said at one point, you have a credibility problem to the fox legal team and so, not good for them heading into this trial.",
