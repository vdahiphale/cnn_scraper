And overnight, Kelly acknowledged the call, tweeting out this picture with a simple message, \"Thank you, Arizona.\" SANCHEZ (voice over): Results, so far, show Democrats and Republicans will have 49 seats each in the chamber, leaving two races to determine who controls the U.S. Senate. In Nevada, the Senate race between Republican Adam Laxalt and Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto is virtually tied. A win in Nevada, which secure democratic control of the upper chamber, and that would make the Senate race in Georgia that runoff between Herschel Walker and incumbent Raphael Warnock, it would make it less important, but neither of them received more than 50 percent of the vote.

What it is instead, according to White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, is an opportunity for each leader to really sharpen their senses of the other's red lines, their perspectives, and where, perhaps, there are areas that they can work going forward.

And that trigger the stock market's best day since 2020.We learned on Thursday that the consumer price index rose 7.7 percent from last October. Normally, that would not be a reason to cheer, but this was much better than expected. It was actually the coolest annual inflation reading in nine months. EGAN (voice over): Stock surge on Thursday on the news with the NASDAQ skyrocketing more than seven percent. And for the week, markets finished sharply higher. Investors hope that this inflation report is a sign that the Federal Reserve's medicine is working, and that the Fed may finally be able to start dialing back on its interest rate hikes. And aggressive Fed has weighed on markets this year, especially tech. The NASDAQ is still down nearly 30 percent this year. But the Fed may need to see further evidence that inflation is really cooling off before it backs off on the supersize interest rate hikes. Remember, economists, investors, and even the Fed had been fooled by just how stubborn inflation has been. And we do get another inflation reading on Tuesday with the October producer price index, and that measures what companies pay. Despite hint of a slowdown, overall inflation is still near 40-year highs, and that is making it tough for both businesses and everyday Americans. We just learned that consumer sentiment in early November took a surprise hit falling back and near record lows. That is in large part because of this high cost of living and surging borrowing costs. With mortgage rates spiking to 20-year highs and credit card rates hitting record highs.",

I think most economists you talk to will tell you probably not 2023, hopefully 2024. But it is -- it is an open question. And a lot of it is going to be contingent, like you said, on what the Federal Reserve does. As the Fed raises interest rates, it theoretically should be slowing down demand. And that should help those inflation rates to cool off. We really haven't seen that sharp pullback in demand yet, though. And so, it does look like we've got a little bit more of a path forward here with the Fed. They're probably going to continue raising rates into next year.

I mean, I still think it's an open question whether or not he'll come. But, you know, if -- what you're looking at is to get those hardcore Republican voters who are still, you know, supportive of President Trump out. You know, he could be good for the Walker campaign on that front. You know, independent voters are less likely to come out simply to support Herschel Walker. So, he may not be losing much on that front if President Trump comes. SANCHEZ: Shannon, someone who performed very well on Tuesday night is the incumbent Republican governor of Georgia, Brian Kemp. In 2018, he only defeated Stacey Abrams by about 50,000 votes. This time, it was a much more convincing victory. And it's expected that he might get closer to the Warnock campaign around.

And behind all of that. You're talking pretty intense cold temperatures that are going to be here for a while. Let's talk about the short term. We've still got some of those rain showers lingering from the remnants of that storm up across the Northeast. States like Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, all looking at rain showers this morning. Those should finally push out by the end of the day today. The secondary system, this is over areas of the Southeast. You're talking states like Kentucky, Tennessee, stretching down into Alabama, Mississippi, and yes, even some snow showers on the backside of that. There across portions of Indiana and Illinois. And it's because those cold temperatures are already in place. That snow will continue across areas of the Midwest. Even as that system slides off to the east in the come next 24 to 48 hours. Here is a look at all of that cold air. Take a look at the entire map. No matter where you look, you're talking about temperatures either at or below normal, and it's going to stay that way for at least the next week. The big drop for the Northeast comes after today. So, New York, a high of 71 today, dropping back to only 50 by the time we get to Monday. But a place like Chicago, it's already begun, and you're going to keep those temperatures well below normal, like I said for at least the next five to seven days. And it's not even just northern states. Even areas down south are going to be looking at cool temperatures. Take Atlanta, for example. The average high this time of year is 65. We will be above that for today with a high of about 68. But get out, enjoy it while it lasts because it's not going to be there for the remainder of the upcoming week. In fact, take a look Sunday morning, the temperature barely above the freezing mark, Boris and Amara. And the rest of the week, those temperatures remain below normal for an extended period of time.",

So, the lead team member on this expedition, a guy by the name of Mike Barnette, he had a friend who was a former NASA astronaut, he showed him this video. And that made them convinced that this is indeed what they had found. They brought it to NASA, and NASA confirmed it, announcing the findings just this week.
