And so, we'll see when he arrives the extent to which that message is received. Certainly, Secretary of State Blinken, over the last week, he has been shuttling from one Arab country in the region to another, visiting everywhere from Saudi Arabia to Qatar, the UAE, Egypt, Jordan, et cetera. And so, when President Biden comes here, he'll be coming on the heels of those efforts. Now, the question for me is, what exactly will the President have to announce when he is here.

I say a limited deal because Israel has in its prisons, 43 Palestinian women and 190 minors, youth, 17 -- 16 - 15-year-olds. Most of them who have thrown stones or Molotov cocktails at Israeli soldiers, all of them are from the West Bank and are from Gaza. To the best of my knowledge, none of them are Hamas operatives and also to the best of my knowledge, none of them have killed Israelis. So, if there was a deal like this that Hamas was willing to accept, I know that there are people in the Israeli war cabinet who would say yes to it, bringing home as many of those hostages as we can before the Israeli military incursion into Gaza. The question is whether Anah Palas will agree to it. To the best of our knowledge, formal negotiations are taking place, but unfortunately, they seem to be a bit convoluted. The leading party in the negotiation of the Qataris, and they speak directly with Hamas -- Hamas leadership is in Qatar, so it's easy for them to talk to them. But my understanding is that they're not talking directly to the Israelis. They are speaking to the Americans, apparently someone from Secretary Blinken's team stayed in Doha to negotiate. So, it's rather convoluted because the Qataris are speaking to the Americans who are speaking to the Israelis who go back to the Americans while the Qataris are speaking to the Hamas people in Doha but not the Hamas people in Gaza. As a result of the American involvement, I believe we had a situation of Ismail Haniyeh, the Hamas leader in Doha, flying to Tehran and getting the Iranian foreign ministry involved in the negotiations. This further complicates it. But I have to be honest, I don't really know what's happening at the official level. I will get some information tomorrow morning from an Israeli source. This is my assessment of what's going on. And the window of opportunity is very small and very short in time. So, I appeal to those involved to speed up the talks, to do what's necessary to bring home as many as possible. I appeal to President Biden and the Americans to apply pressure on Qatar. They're hosting the Hamas leadership. The Qataris should issue a demand and automate into Hamas to release the hostages or as many as possible or else the Hamas leadership should be exiled from Doha. I know that the Qataris will demand an Israeli ceasefire. That's negotiable for a short period of time, but the Israelis are dedicated to their primary military mission, which is to ensure that Hamas will not be governing in Gaza tomorrow nor will be a threat to Israel ever again. This is an imperative, a result of the terrorist attack that took place last Saturday.",

They took maximum advantage of their familiarity with the local terrain. They already had long experience fighting with the Israelis when they drove the Israeli occupation out of the South, finally in May of 2000. Since then, of course, their abilities have only increased. They've received, according to the Israelis, as many as 150,000 missiles and rockets from the Iranians. And what we've been seeing in the last few days is that they are using very sophisticated, guided missiles to target Israeli positions that are making precise hits. These are not random missiles fired in the general direction of the Israelis. They are hitting tanks. They are hitting precise targets. The rockets that have been fired from south Lebanon since the 7th of October have been by and large fired by Palestinian groups like Islamic Jihad, like the military wing of Hamas. Those are sort of the crude rockets of the past, not what Hezbollah is using now. And let's keep in mind that Hezbollah was a partner in the war in Syria, fighting alongside the forces of the Assad regime. They proved to be much more effective fighters than the Syrian army itself. And in the course of the war in Syria, they gained very practical experience in urban warfare. So, this is a battle-hardened military force that I've seen them in action. They're highly disciplined. They are not a rag-tag militia in any sense of the word. So, if a front opens to the north of Israel along this border, this will be a war of a whole different magnitude. However, the Israelis have made it clear that if Hezbollah does become involved in a war with Israel, that the price will be high. Yoav Galant, the Israeli defense minister, recently said that in the event of a war between Israel will -- in his words, bomb Lebanon back into the Stone Age. He's not talking about Hezbollah, he is talking about Lebanon itself, the country. And therefore, obviously the stakes are very high for all sides, but Hezbollah at the moment seems to be skirting just below what the Israelis are calling the threshold of escalation. Enough attacks just to keep everybody's nerves on edge, but not quite enough to spark a full war. Zain.",

The attack will not be launched as long as President Biden is in the region, but he's supposed to leave it on Thursday. So, I cannot imagine anything else but a land incursion, a land attack. It might be complemented with continued -- not might.

Well, in troubled times that demand U.S. attention. What's happening on Capitol Hill is being watched not only in America, but around the world, as well. So, for more on this, we want to bring in CNN Senior Political Analyst John Avlon. John, always great to see you. So, before we get to the actual math of this all, can you explain to our viewers -- many of them around the world, why Jim Jordan is as controversial as he is, why his speakership would be something unprecedented?",

This isabout Jim Jordan, who would be the most extreme speaker, really in living memory, at least. And I say that because he has been directly implicated in coordinating and meeting with members of the Trump White House and its flunkies to participate in the overthrow of the election. Liz Cheney has said that he knew more than any other member of Congress at that time. He has the lowest legislative record of almost any member of Congress, no bipartisan accomplishments per se. And so, this is a potential elevation of the most far right extreme person in the caucus, endorsed by Donald Trump, without any ability or desire to reach out. And the idea that he can unify the Republican caucus wouldn't be worth a laugh if we weren't at this point where some folks seem to be believing there'll be a new Jim Jordan. Spoiler alert, there won't. This is someone who a former Republican speaker from his home state of Ohio called a legislative terrorist because he was more interested in destroying than building. And this person is potentially going to be who Republicans put forward as speaker. Well, they are putting him forward. We'll see if he gets that.",

They should want to have nothing to do with this, let alone anyone who is a self-styled moderate or independent-minded Republican. He can only afford to lose four votes. Right now, according to the latest whip count, there are slightly more than that who say they are firmly opposed on reasons like, as Congressman Ken Buck has said, the fact that Jim Jordan won't acknowledge reality that Donald Trump lost the election. That election lies sort of a litmus test among folks on the far right, hard for perhaps people to understand overseas. But there are others whose -- who say they are inclined to vote against him. But he has said he will go multiple rounds. I cannot see right now how that math will go unless people say, look, this is so pathetic to not be able to have a speaker that will back Jim Jordan. That will lead to more dysfunction and division of the future, not less. Mark my words.",

But this is the problem in our politics in the United States.They're also afraid of losing a primary to folks in the far right. And they're in many cases more likely to lose a primary than a general election, except those 18 you mentioned. So, this is a structural problem in U.S. politics. This should go at least -- Kevin McCarthy is nowhere near as polarizing and extreme as Jim Jordan is. He went 15 rounds for McCarthy, it should go, you know, 45 rounds for Jim Jordan. It shouldn't even mean getting to a vote. And I personally -- someone who is from the center, right, worked for a Republican once upon a time, I believe in both parties, just reasoning together, it would be nice to see the center right have as much spine as folks on the far right. But they seem incapable of doing that. And there's another alternate reality here that is not impossible, where you could have a very conservative, but still reasonable and widely respected Republican come forward, maybe not get votes from folks on the far right but get enough Democrats to become speaker. That would actually be a return to governance of the national interest. That should not be idealistic pie in the sky stuff. That's how government is supposed to work in a democracy. And that is how -- I think there still is a chance this could be the result. But it's going to require the center having some spine, which is something they're not in practice of doing recently.",
