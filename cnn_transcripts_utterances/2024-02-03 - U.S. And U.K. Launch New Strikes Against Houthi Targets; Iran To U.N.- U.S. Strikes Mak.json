The U.S. and the United Kingdom have launched a new round of air strikes against Houthi rebels in Yemen hitting at least 30 targets across nearly a dozen different locations. Now, this comes just a day after the U.S. launched retaliatory strikes against Iran-backed militant groups in both Syria and Iraq following that deadly drone attack on U.S. soldiers in Jordan last weekend. The U.S. says that it hit 85 targets linked to Iran-backed militants in the first round of strikes. Iranian officials now warning the United States is making what they call a strategic mistake that could fuel further conflict in the region. Let's get straight to CNN's Oren Liebermann who had been reporting on all of this from the Pentagon. So Oren, what are you learning about these latest strikes? These 30 different strikes against the Houthis today?",

      "sentences": "Alex, we just got more information in a joint statement from several countries. Strikes led by the U.S. and the U.K., the third time we have seen those two countries carry out kinetic strikes effectively attacked together, backed by a number of other countries -- Australia, Bahrain, Denmark, Canada, the Netherlands, New Zealand and again the U.K. and the U.S.Here in their joint statement they say, \"Our aim remains to deescalate tensions and restore stability in the Red Sea. But let us reiterate our warning to Houthi leadership, we will not hesitate to continue to defend lives and the free flow of commerce in one of the world's most critical waterways in the face of continued threats. So what did we learn about the strikes themselves? 36 Houthi targets across 13 locations in Yemen. So you see there again larger strikes than we have seen the U.S. carry out on its own. Here using the U.K. and those other countries supporting as well a number of different locations as well as dozens of targets. Today's strikes specifically went after what they called deeply-buried weapons storage facilities. That is the second time we have seen them target underground weapons storage facilities, as well as missile systems and launchers, air defense systems and radars. So a broad, powerful attempt to try to go after the Houthis' ability to target and threaten, frankly, international shipping lanes in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, some of the most critical waterways there. Alex, I'll point out just one more thing about this statement. It specifically mentions one incident that has truly caught the eye of this coalition. And that is the January 27th attack on the Marshall Islands flag oil tanker the Marlin Luanda. The reason that's important is because the Houthis successfully hit that ship, set it on fire forcing it to issue a distress signal. The U.S. and other countries responding to that incident and that underscores the threat and the danger here that the U.S. and this coalition see in these ongoing Houthi attacks on commercial vessels and on U.S. warships.",

Right here, this country is the one because it controls access to the Red Sea, which is this body of water right here. And this is the Gulf of Aden right in this area. So the key elements here as Oren was pointing out, at least 30 targets were struck, 10 locations. An underground weapons facility was among those targets. That is a key point here because when you're looking at this, there's a thing called hardened and deeply-buried targets. This could be one of those where you have a storage facility that may have had some concrete and placed over it. Very hard to hit from a targeting perspective. This might be one of those things. The other thing is that these of course, are the weapons that are used by the Houthis to target international shipping in this particular area right here.",

And it has an aerial refueling capability, has precision-guided missiles which are really important. And it also has a 20-millimeter cannon that can handle all of these different types of weapons including laser guided bombs, one of these (INAUDIBLE) weapons doing the direct attack munitions. And it can be used not only for combat air patrol, but also for ground attack.And that's precisely what this particular weapons system did for these attacks in Yemen.",

And we all know the Chinese economy is not going so well, right? But we've also heard the Houthis saying we haven't gotten any pressure. So you know, obviously the (INAUDIBLE) being applied as a lever over Iran from China or India. They're not threatening anything serious enough for Iran really to go hard on the Houthis.

That United States is part of the problem in the region and rather overlooks the fact that Iran has -- is widely seen as essentially convincing, if you will, the Houthis to begin these attacks on shipping in the Red Sea. So what Iran is saying by the United States trying to, along with allies and partners, trying to keep these busy, important economic shipping routes open through the Red Sea, is going to make it harder to find peace across the whole region. And by implication, I think we can understand the Iranians mean in Gaza with Hamas which is also a proxy of Iran. But this is quite a strong comment coming from the Iranian foreign minister to put this in such blunt terms.

That was a big covert program.This would be more of an overt use of cyber to go alongside the kinetic action. The most interesting question, which we don't know the answer to yet, is did they do this inside Iran. Because for the kinetic activity, they were very careful to stay outside of Iran borders. The next step up could be targeting IRGC, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps operations outside of Iran and particularly IRGC officers.

They did give top Iranian commanders who might have been advising these groups, several days to get out of the way. So what they're likely striking now are weapons that were too heavy to move. Facilities that are built in place. So that it will frustrate future attacks, but it's not going to prevent them. I would argue that even if the fighting in Gaza stops, basically Iran has these groups programmed, primed across the region, ready for whatever provocation that it decides is a reason to attack U.S. interests. So this might slow them down but from the perspective of the Iranian in Tehran who have sort of a long view of this, this is the long war and the long game.

U.S. officials have repeatedly said these actions by the Houthis can really risk and threaten the global economy because, again, it just affects the way that commercial vessels are operating in that region.

And the Iraqi government is saying that the actions last night by the United States were a violation of sovereignty, a violation of the U.N. charter. And this will probably further add to these discussions that are already under way for the United States to draw down its 2,500-troop presence inside of Iraq. Which, we'll remember, all troops were pulled out in 2011. It was only a couple of years later that ISIS began to take huge swaths of Iraq. U.S. troops went back in to take on and stamp out the ISIS threat, which took quite a while. So the Iraqi government, being leaned on by Iran, is really going to double down on that message. Iran's aim here is to get the United States out of the region. And it will further the military actions on the ground by targeting U.S. troops or with its proxies and further it politically by pressuring the Iraqi government to pressure the United States to pull its troops out quickly.

It's a little bit of a chicken-and-egg thing. Because if you can get that ceasefire, you might get more quiet in the Red Sea and among these Hezbollah groups both in Lebanon and in Iraq and Syria. And you might get that because the Palestinian issue and particularly the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza has been the inciting issue. But the second part of this is that there are a lot of election politics underway. You've been hearing Republicans and former President Trump make the case that President Biden has been too cautious.

When he had the opportunity to go do that on several occasions, he got concerned about escalation as well. So they are all related.

Of course, Trump terminated that. And now Iran is continuing its nuclear weapons program. So that's one major problem out there. But again, it's the alliances that we need to build in the area. Isolating Iran. Unfortunately, the George W. Bush administration decided to take out Saddam Hussein, who was a major enemy of Iran. But that's yesterday and that's gone. So now we need to rebuild those alliances. We need to strengthen the Iraqi government and allow that to be a bullwork against Iran. So this is part of the long-term strategy. It's not going to be solved quickly. To get into a land war with Iran would be a major and significantly greater effort than we had to do in both -- Iraq as well as Afghanistan.",
