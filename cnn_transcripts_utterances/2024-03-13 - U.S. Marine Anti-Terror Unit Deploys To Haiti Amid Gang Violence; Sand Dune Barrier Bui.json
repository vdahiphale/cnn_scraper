      "sentences": "A U.S. Marine Anti-terrorism Unit is on its way to Haiti amid mounting chaos there. For weeks now, rampant gang violence has paralyzed the Caribbean nation, prompting the country's prime minister to resign earlier this week.Haiti is now hoping to have a transitional council in place to pave the way for new elections. But the country's top gang leader, whose fighters control much of the capital, Port-au-Prince, says that his coalition will not recognize any new government. CNN's Natasha Bertrand is live for us at the Pentagon. Natasha, what more can you tell us about this group of Marines that's going and what their mission is? NATASHA BERTRAND, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY &amp; POLICE CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Boris, so this is what's known as a FAST Unit and that stands for U.S. Marine Fleet Anti-terrorism Security Team. Essentially, what it is, is a dedicated security and anti-terrorism task force, essentially that is able to be deployed at a very quick pace, very rapidly around the world in areas where they need to augment securities. So for example, in Haiti right now, the U.S. embassy is still up and running. And so these Marines are going to be tasked with supporting embassy security. The U.S. military did evacuate a number of non-essential personnel from the embassy in Haiti's capital on Sunday, however, they are aiming to keep the embassy open to the extent possible. But of course, it is a very dangerous environment. So that's why they need this additional security from, we are told, dozens of Marines who are going to be part of this unit in order to ensure the safe operation of that embassy. Because roughly 80 percent of Haiti's capital at this point is being run by the gangs now. And it remains unclear just when Kenya is actually going to be able to deploy that police force of roughly 1,000 personnel to Haiti. Which is what the Haitian prime minister was over in Kenya trying to organize when this takeover over by the gangs occurred. And so obviously the U.S. military is going to try to augment the presence there to allow U.S. personnel at the embassy to keep operating and wait and see essentially how this all plays out. As you said, they are hoping that a transitional government can be put in place very soon.",

From Malibu, California, to New England beach front residents are watching helplessly as the ocean relentlessly eats their pristine sandy landscapes.Homeowners in one Massachusetts seaside town took drastic measures. They built a $600,000 sand-dune barrier to shore up the beach. And the mighty Atlantic Ocean washed that thing away almost entirely in a single day. We have CNN chief climate correspondent, Bill Weir, in Salisbury, where residents are now wondering what happens next -- Bill?",

      "sentences": "Exactly, Brianna. And this is really a story sort of 50 years in the making. On a day like this, you can see why they love it so.Residents who've been coming here since the '70s said you used to get tired taking your kids down to the water, the beach was so wide. But year-by a year, tide by tide, it's gotten higher and higher. And because in Massachusetts, much of this beach is private -- it belongs to these homeowners -- the state won't replenish that. So they chipped together, got 600,000 bucks, brought in 15,000 tons of sand. It would -- when they completed it, just for reference, it would have filled all of this under -- under the stairs here. It was supposed to last three years. Lasted one storm. Lasted one day. Not all of the residents actually opted in on the sand. And you can see the result of that here. This house, the waves went into the living room. And so now they're looking at a $300,000 loss of sand in one storm hoping that their luck changes in this as a whole. But  --is saying, at least Massachusetts is officially preparing for feet of sea level rise. This is just the result of nine inches of sea level rise. And so while some don't believe the climate science I've talked to here, others are coming around to the idea that they have to think about this place in a whole new way.",

They get three bucks a car that comes and that's supposed to replenish those beaches. They'd like to see the same here.But this is one of 79 towns in Massachusetts that are in this coastal surge zone. And it would cost tens of billions of dollars to defend all of them. And so -- but they make the point here that there's $2 billion worth of property values just along this beach and a lot of those taxes pay for cops and teachers and the infrastructure of the town. So this is a microcosm of this coastal debate. What do you do? What is managed retreat look like in the United States, where retreat is usually not part of the vocabulary. And at what point are you pouring sort of wasted money fighting against time and tide? How much sand can you afford?",

Quote, \"We are an organization that welcomes diverse viewpoints. Music is the soul of South by Southwest and it has long been our legacy. We fully respect the decision these artists made to exercise their right to free speech.\" And they go on to say, \"We have and will continue to support human rights for all.
