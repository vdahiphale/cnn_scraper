The soul of a nation, reveling in the first coronation of a British monarch in seven decades. King Charles III will be crowned on Saturday in Westminster Abbey, where his royal ancestors have also held the orb and held the auburn scepter. Then he and his wife Queen Camilla will head back to Buckingham Palace to appear on that iconic balcony. Of course, anointing a sovereign is a serious undertaking dating back to 1066. We're camped out along the procession route in central London. Royal supporters telling us the mood is electric. So the flags are out, the bunting is up, and people are ready to party. The prince and princess of Wales have been down the path to toast Prince William's father. Our very end own Anna Stewart is in the center of all of it. Not at the pub. She joins us live from outside Westminster Abbey.",

So, few people can really remember what it all looks like. But tomorrow we will see the biggest military procession. We will see everyone gathering at Westminster Abbey, heads of state, members of the royal family here in the U.K. but also from abroad, for what is a very solemn and sacred ritual to anoint a new king. Now, quite aside from that we also, as you said have all the excitement of the royal fans who are already sort of lining them out. Already getting their camps up. Making sure that they have the best spot for the procession tomorrow. And actually some of them, Becky, were incredibly lucky. I think we've got some pictures to show you. Because that king and the prince and princess of Wales made a surprise visit. A little walk about a short time ago. Up and down the Mall, speaking to some of those well-wishers. Many hands are shaken, lots of selfies were taken. You can see plenty of flags. People have flown in from all of the world to be here for what will be a moment in history that I suspect they will never forget. It's a busy day for that king. He's also hosted a lunch at Buckingham Palace, the commonwealth, prime ministers and visiting dignitaries. And there's also a glittering dinner reception I'm told tonight at Buckingham Palace. All that, and then I suspect an early night ahead of tomorrow because it will be an incredibly busy day for King Charles. Many changes of outfits, and that includes robes and crowns. Changes of carriages and a long procession to make to Westminster Abbey and back again.",

In this case it was a massive manhunt across a huge swath of this country involving some 600 heavily, heavily armed police in full tactical gear. Many wearing balaclavas, driving vehicles that you might not immediately recognized as police vehicles. It looked a lot more like they ought to belong to the military. And they were fanned out across the country. We saw them surging in the line across or alongside a highway. We saw them manning checkpoints and we saw them in the towns and the hamlets around where the shots were actually fired. They managed to apprehend this suspect more than an hour away from where those shots were initially fired. And things were so tense initially, though, when this manhunt was going on that we actually met one man inside one of these villages who, in the early hours, actually was arrested himself by police because they mistakenly believed he may have himself been the gunman.

Yesterday the government proposed legislation that would put a two-year moratorium on the issuing of new gun licenses until they can't figure out how best to prevent something like this in the future. Today, though, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic was much more direct, much more forward, much more ambitious with his plans in light of this latest shooting, vowing to go even further to de-arm the Syrian or the Serbian, excuse me, population. We know that there are hundreds of thousands of guns floating around this country legal and illegal, and he wants to get them largely that number down as low as he possibly can. And so, he is proposing tight gun restrictions and mandatory buyback programs for people who cannot abide by the new restrictions. He also, Becky, wants to put an armed police officer inside of every single school.

So he is making this very, very personal, going after these two men and saying they're the ones that are responsible for not supplying enough ammunition to his troops on the frontline. And it comes after months and months and months of fighting for Bakhmut where Wagner troops have been at the vanguard of the fight, at the front lines, losing a lot of lives. That's something that we've been hearing from Ukrainian officials. But Ukrainian officials have actually told us today that, look, Prigozhin has been short. The Wagner fighters have been short of artillery ammunition. That's something that we have seen. But they are also saying if they don't, if the Russians don't sort out their ammunition shortage then this could be, as they described, a turning point. They wouldn't expect it to come immediately or too quickly, but it could be the moment where the battle again shifts back into Ukraine's favor. Ukraine has been losing ground there, meter by meter, every day. But the city, the town itself of Bakhmut is now very much destroyed. But Prigozhin has put this battle within the Kremlin on the front line for President Putin now. He's made it a real challenge. And not only has he gone after the defense minister and the chief of staff, he's also just hired the deputy defense minister who was fired from his job, the Russian deputy defense minister fired from his job just last week. So the rift is there. It's big and significant. And potentially turns into a battlefield lost just when Putin needs it.",

And I think that what it comes down to is that, \"Thinking Out Loud\" and \"Let's Get It On\" has a very similar and common four-chord progression. So for those of you that don't play music, there are these four chords that are found in many songs as it turns out. And the defense was able to lay it out very clearly for the jury that this four-chord progression was found in songs that predate Marvin Gaye and Ed Townsend's hit single from 1973, \"Let's Get It On.\" So in the sense that, yes, this is a creative arrangement of art that was copyrighted in this deposit copy of \"Let's Get It On,\" but this was also commonplace in songs before and that Marvin Gaye and Ed Townsend were not the first to create it. And obviously, the jury they felt really strongly about that, siding with them. And, you know, this is a pivotal moment for the music industry, because as Ed Sheeran pointed out, if it hadn't gone this way, going forward musicians like in theory would have had to ask the Townsend family for permission, therefore stifling creativity when it comes to those four chords.
