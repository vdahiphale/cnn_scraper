      "sentences": "You are live in the CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.First, he bans several prominent journalists from Twitter. Now, Elon Musk says they can return to Twitter but there are conditions. Musk tweeted late last night the people have spoken, and posted this poll, which once again falsely claimed a journalist doxed his location or shared his exact real-time location. That didn't happen. More than half voted in favor of immediately restoring the accounts while accounts of some of the other journalists who were suspended are now publicly viewable again on Twitter. They cannot actually post anything until they delete tweets that Musk claims violate Twitter rules by sharing his location. Again they did not share his location. CNN's Donie O'Sullivan is one the journalists who was suspended and has not agreed to Musk's condition, and he joins us now. Donie, help us out here. You have decided to appeal this decision. How does that work? Is Musk like the judge in all of this? Is he like Judge Judy? DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It certainly seems like that is the case, Jim. Look, this saga seems to be dragging out quite a bit but of course it is important because, you know, while Twitter is a private company, Musk can do whatever he wants, he's also claiming that he is a kind of free speech absolutist. So to be going around banning journalists that might be critical of him or just reports on him, is a bit rich. I want to show you what happens now if I log in to my account. I think we have an image of it here. It's basically a demand to remove something I tweeted earlier in the week, which was talking about how Elon had banned an account of a competitor, an emerging competitor to Twitter called Mastodon, and in that I included a link to their account. And if you followed that link, you could eventually make your way to the jet tracking account. So at the moment, I decided to appeal it because, you know, I haven't broken Twitter's new rules. So we'll see what happens but I'm not too confident given the current regime running Twitter.",

It doesn't sound like he is going to comply with these demands. It's sort of like the modern-day equivalent of Surrender Dorothy in \"The Wizard of Oz.\" But can share your thoughts on what has transpired? And this whole idea of sharing real-time locations and so on. Can you help our viewers understand this, why that was not going on and why he would make that kind of accusation?O'SULLIVAN: Yes. Jim, you know, if you or I owned a private jet, I don't think we'd love the idea of people being able to track us either. But, you know, look, this is publicly available information. Again, back to the point, we didn't actually share his live coordinates or I think he called them assassination coordinates.",

I think it gives us all pause as to wonder, as journalists, why maybe, you know, do we want to even go back on this platform? Why do we spend so much on it? What are the alternatives? But, look, I do think very important point here is, you know, I have a platform. I'm talking to you on CNN right now. I can use other social media that's preferred. You know, a lot of independent freelance journalists around the world, particularly outside of the U.S., they need to be on Twitter to get work and to find work and to publish their work. So the chilling effect that this might have on them and also, by the way, people who cover Musk's other companies, like SpaceX and Tesla, we've seen over the past 24 hours, Linette Lopez who has covered Musk for a long time also getting banned. It's not clear why she was banned. So the precedent isn't good here.",

But those are the three that we're learning about so far.And again, this is not binding. The Justice Department doesn't have to do what this committee asks them to do. But it is significant because the lawmakers on the committee feel like there is evidence of wrongdoing. Essentially they believe there's evidence that Donald Trump committed these crimes and maybe other ones. And they're going to lay that out in their public hearing on Monday then essentially urge the Justice Department to take action. What I've been talking to members of the committee about is they said they couldn't just turn a blind eye to what they felt was evidence of criminal activity. They felt those were for the historical record and for the Justice Department, if they want to put it all on the table before they wind down their work.",

Thanks for the update.Joining us now, CNN political commentator S.E. Cupp, and special correspondent for \"Vanity Fair,\" Molly Jong-Fast. She also hosts the podcast \"Fast Politics.\" Molly, I want to ask you about all these Trump investigations in a moment. But let's go back to Elon Musk and this 180 that he's doing. I mean, I guess it's almost a 180. He's sort of holding these Twitter accounts hostage a little bit at this point until they meet his demands. What kind of a world are we living in where Elon Musk is happy to restore the accounts of Donald Trump and Marjorie Taylor Greene and folks like that but people like, you know, Donie O'Sullivan are getting suspended just for doing their jobs? MOLLY JONG-FAST, SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT, VANITY FAIR: Well, you know, he's a capricious billionaire. And that's what capricious billionaires do. I mean, I think he's going to have trouble getting people who are going to want to go to mars with him now because I think he seems like a person who just is operating by his own rules. Of course, it is a private company. He owns it. You know, he can, theoretically, do whatever he wants. I mean, ultimately, I think there was a choice, really, to run Twitter like a public utility, which would, I think, have been much better than to, you know, right now Twitter is just run completely by the whims of Elan Musk. But it is still within his rights theoretically.",

But now, we've seen easily hundreds all day long. And here to our right, somebody just decided to go a different way. Somebody came and told them that it was easier to do it this way. A couple just trying to get to the other side. Most of the people we've talked to today have been Venezuelans. Many of them have just gotten off from a bus after a long bus ride from southern Mexico. They get here and they want to try their luck. Some get to the front of the line. They talk to the agent and the agent tells them that this is not the time. That it might be better to wait until Wednesday. So we talk about misinformation. People think that after Title 42 ends next Wednesday, it might be an open gate for everybody. That seems to be the message. I don't know if they're trying to discourage the people from entering altogether or just telling them to wait until Wednesday. But the migrants are telling us the Border Patrol are telling them to wait until Wednesday, otherwise they could be deported from other points of entries. They could end up in McAllen, they could end up in Tijuana. And that is something that many are not trying to risk right now. There is a lot of misinformation. We hear people here telling the Venezuelans, the Cubans, that it's OK to get in because the U.S. has no good relationship with those countries. Hence, they cannot deport them back because they would not be taken by other countries. Some they said they want to take their chances. And others, the worst thing for them to happen is to be sent back to their countries of origin. They want to try their luck here, where city officials in Juarez are seeing something they say hadn't seen before. They've seen the deportees come over but not this large number of migrants.

And by that time, the climate crisis could reach a tipping point. (on camera): The Biden administration has set an aspirational goal of getting a commercial fusion reactor up and running in a decade. But scientists say it's more likely to take two to three decades. They still need to figure out how to generate enough power for widescale consumption. And figure out how to harvest that power and get it to the power grid. Rene Marsh, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Two soccer powerhouses.For France, it's a opportunity to be back-to-back champions with Kylian Mbappe lead the way. For Argentina, it's the final chance for Lionel Messi to bring home the World Cup title. CNN's Patrick Snell joins me now. Patrick, it's been a glorious World Cup. Give us a preview of how big this match up will be. These are the two biggest stars in the sport, arguably, right now. PATRICK SNELL, CNN ANCHOR, \"WORLD SPORT\": They really are, Jim. From a footballing perspective, the last month has been fascinating. And there's an added plot to it, Jim, they're also club teammates in the domestic French league. So, it will be awkward for one of them when they get back to training after the World Cup, whichever way this goes. So much history on the line. Argentina are looking to win the sport's biggest prize for the first time in 36 years. France, it's been just four years since they triumphed in 2018 in Russia. You can see the stats. Messi, at 35, Jim, said it's his last World Cup. Kylian Mbappe is just 23 years of age. All of the narratives around those two. But it's Messi I want to home in on first. He experienced the pain of defeat, Jim, in the World Cup final, when they lost to the Germans in Rio. And his international manager, Lionel Scaloni, saying, look, we've got to give him the perfect sendoff in his last-ever tournament game. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LIONEL SCALONI, ARGENTINA COACH (through translation): Regarding what Messi said about this being his last game, let's hope in this one, we can win the cup. That would be great. The most important thing is to enjoy it. And there's no better scenario for it than a World Cup final. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
