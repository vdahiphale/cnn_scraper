We're tracking what's next in the former president's legal battles as he's fundraising, fundraising off his unprecedented mug shot.Also this hour, Russia says it's recovered flight recorders from the plane crash believed to have killed failed mutiny leader Yevgeny Prigozhin. CNN is investigating the final moments of the flight as the Kremlin is denying accusations that Vladimir Putin was behind it all. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM. Tonight, prosecutors in Fulton County, Georgia are pushing ahead with their case against Donald Trump and his 18 co-defendants after the former president's dramatic arrest and defiant mug shot. CNN's Sara Murray is following all of the developments for us. Sara, what are the next steps in this case?",

I mean, one of the steps is that all of the defendants in this case have to be arraigned. We know the district attorney's office has asked for these arraignment to take place the week of September 5. The judge has not yet weighed in on a timeline for.This is also something that in Georgia can happen remotely either on Zoom or you're able to waive arraignments if the judge allows it. So we're waiting to see if this is a situation where Donald Trump could be appearing in a courtroom in the next couple of weeks or if essentially he and the other defendants are able to waive these initial steps. Now, we're also learning from a new filing from the district attorney that she is ready to get the ball rolling on sharing discovery. She said essentially that the defendants in this case should supply the district attorney's office with a large USB drive and that by mid- September, she's willing to hand over the first batch of the discovery materials. The other fight that's playing out is whether this case and whether all the defendants in this case are going to be showing up in the Fulton County court system or if this is going to move to federal court. We have this big hearing coming up on Monday where Mark Meadows team is going to make their case for why they believe that this should be removed to federal court. We're expecting there to be live witnesses as part of this sort of evidentiary portion of this hearing. One of the witnesses that Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis has called is Brad Raffensperger who, of course, was pressured by Donald Trump to find the votes needed for Trump to win the 2020 election in Georgia, which he of course lost. We've seen similar moves by Jeffrey Clark and Cathy Latham, other defendants in this case to also try to move to federal court. So we're going to be looking for signals of what the judge in this case might have to say more broadly about the pool of defendants, Wolf.",

And the judge has already said, OK, we can get the ball rolling, we can move ahead in October 2023. One of the things the judge said in this order, though, is at this time, these deadlines do not apply to any co- defendant, making clear that he's going to set this trial date but for Ken Chesebro only.Now today, just within the last hour or two, we also saw Sidney Powell, another one of these attorneys who was working with Donald Trump in the aftermath of the election, again, go to court and say she also would like a speedy trial. So we're waiting for the judge to weigh in on the timeline for her. This calls into question what the timeline is going to be for all the rest of the defendants in this case. The DA's office has said hey, we're ready to go, we can bring everyone to trial in October 2023, a timeline other attorneys have thought is unrealistic.

And it's depending on how the judge sees it, it could be very difficult to indicate to the judge that he was doing things that were what's called necessary and proper to his office, and that's what the law requires. A judge in New York rejected, you might remember Donald Trump's attempt to move the New York case to federal court on that theory.And we may be seeing Mark Meadows having an uphill battle demonstrating that the things he did here for Donald Trump regarding the election were necessary and proper to his exercise of his legitimate office.

If he meets that responsibility, and while it's an uphill battle, it is an area of law that is very friendly, usually, to federal officials. It's not a slam dunk for Fani Willis. That's why she's bringing in her witnesses like Brad Raffensperger who will say presumably, listen, Mark Meadows was on that call to me where Donald Trump demanded 11,780 non-existent votes at the end of the process.There was nothing necessary or proper about that. So she can persuade the judge Meadows hasn't met his legal burden. It's going to be a battle. And we'll just see how it turns out.",

I think the other part that was surreal is that, you know, it was really a parade of surrenders throughout the course of this week. It wasn't just Donald Trump having to show up at jail, it was Rudy Giuliani, it was Mark Meadows, you know, it was the people who were in his inner circle around the 2020 election and then people who fanned out from that who tried to essentially carry out his bidding.

And they've been brought to a forensic lab where the Russians are saying that DNA testing is going on to confirm whether or not the 10 names that were on the flight manifest, of course, including that of Wagner boss, Yevgeny Prigozhin, whether those were really the people who were actually on the plane. At the same time, we have for the first time now heard from the Kremlin spokesman, from Dmitry Peskov, he was on a conference call with journalists earlier today. And he ripped into some of the speculation that was going on that possibly or maybe the Kremlin might even behind the downing of the aircraft. He called that what he said an absolute lie and essentially accused western media of doing that. One of the little sort of nuances of that conference call that was quite interesting is he was also asked whether Vladimir Putin himself might attend the funeral of Yevgeny Prigozhin and he said that timings for that are so unclear at this point in time that he simply couldn't comment on. However, what we are seeing now, Wolf, inside Russia and also among Vladimir Putin's allies is more people now commenting on this case. In fact, Alexander Lukashenko, the Belarussian strong man, he came out now and he said he couldn't imagine that Vladimir Putin could have been behind the downing of the aircraft but he also said that he had warned Yevgeny Prigozhin to be very careful. Also interesting what's going on inside Russia where you do have sort of smaller memorials to Yevgeny Prigozhin and the others who were killed popping up in various Russian cities, we were listening to some of the things that folks were saying around those memorials, people who are laying down flowers and other ways commemorating Yevgeny Prigozhin saying that they believe that someone like him could not be replaced in an organization like Wagner. That of course right now is the big discussion that is sort of going on is that if the leadership of Wagner was really decapitated in this plane crash, in other words, Yevgeny Prigozhin and some of his very important deputies that Wagner could very much become a very different company than it has been in the past, Wolf.",

But Prigozhin is somebody who's different, Prigozhin helped create Putin.He was essentially running Russia's foreign policy in Africa. He was supporting dictatorships. He was, you know, stealing gold and diamonds. He was part of the creation of Putin's legend. Remember that he ran the internet campaign that tried to help elect Donald Trump in the United States in 2016. And so, assassinating him or arranging for his plane to be blown up or suggesting maybe that someone would like to get rid of him however it happened marks, you know, a different -- it's a different moment -- it's a different -- it's a different kind of death.

They want to give him a break after the busy week.And I think part of that is it's because it was a very deflating process for Donald Trump. We know that he did not want to go to Georgia yesterday.

Now, I also just want to share with you, Wolf, some reporting I have behind the scenes about that mug shot. I was told by his team that they had talked about it before he went and took it and they gamed out what they wanted him to look like.

I also want to share just -- you know, I was in a motorcade with the former president and his aides yesterday as they were traveling to the jail and back to the airport. And I was picking up on the vibe that they weren't really sure how it was going to go yesterday. We know that when the last time he was arraigned earlier this month in DC, he was pretty somber. He didn't take questions when talking to reporters, even though he said he would. And I thought that was going to be the vibe yesterday, and again, we didn't hear him take questions from reporters either.

So we have to move on.And at the same time, the candidates themselves have to say, if it ain't happening, I got to get out of this race, don't stay a minute longer than you absolutely have to in this race. And if you do, the rest of the Republican Party is going to be pretty upset because we know that when it's one-on-one, in a Republican primary, Trump would lose. So my sense is, you've already seen a winnowing of the field, which I think is great. We're down to eight candidates other than Trump. We saw that on the stage the other night. I think later in November, December, if you're still in those low single digits, you know, great effort, everybody, but you got to get out of the race and clear the field. You get five or six going to Iowa, three or four coming to New Hampshire. And then you're down to a one-on-one race very quickly after New Hampshire. That is exactly how you beat Donald Trump in the primary. And you let the Republicans kind of bring a futuristic message, a healing of America message to that general election that's going to happen.

Obviously, their path here is to kind of get some of those Trump voters, a lot of those Trump voters don't believe he's guilty of anything. They think it's all political. So you have to understand, you know, when you're on that stage, you don't even had to sign a pledge that did support Trump. Right now, whether that pans out ultimately or not, who knows?And between now and a year from now, right, when we decide, really and figure out who this candidate -- who this nominee is going to be, you know, what's he guilty of? Where are the court cases? I mean, so many things are going to change in the race. So, you know, you can try to answer that question now. I think it's a more important question around March of next year. Where is Biden, right? And I keep asking that question, a lot of us are. Where's his health? The Hunter Biden stuff is very real and is not going away anytime soon. There's a lot of pressure by other Democrats realizing that maybe five more years of Joe Biden isn't in the best interest of the Democrat party. So even that side of the ticket is going to have a lot of pressures that changed his thing from now and then. So again, it's I'm not saying it's not a worthwhile question, but so many variables will change between now and the time we have to figure that out. And I'm still very much a believer, if the candidates themselves have the discipline to get out of the race, Trump loses. It's really quite that simple. It's not complicated math. He cannot hold over 50 percent of the vote in a challenge race. He's not holding it in Pennsylvania. He's not holding it New Hampshire. He's not holding it in Iowa. Just amongst Republicans, he can barely hold 42 percent. So that leaves a majority of, you know, the base Republicans that not with this guy saying thank you for your service, nothing personal. But we're moving on.",

What I think is very important, is that there be a line of communication with the North Koreans, whether it's our military, the U.N. Command, other countries, NGOs, human rights groups, civil society groups. And this is why I was a bit disappointed that the Biden administration renewed what the Trump administration did, and that's a travel ban that was going to expire in September, but they renewed it.And I think that's a mistake, because that's the way we communicate with the North Koreans, American civil society groups, food groups, vaccines, ways that we can go people to people humanitarian efforts that would precede the enormous geopolitical differences that we have with the North Koreans.",
