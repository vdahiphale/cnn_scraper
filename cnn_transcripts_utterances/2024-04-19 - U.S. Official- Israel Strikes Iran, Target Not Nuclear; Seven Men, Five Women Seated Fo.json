      "sentences": "Good morning. I'm Jim Acosta, in for Kasie Hunt.We begin with breaking news. A U.S. official confirming to CNN that Israel carried out a military strike inside Iran late last night. An Iranian news agency reporting there were three explosions heard near an army base in the Isfahan province, that's about 270 miles south of Tehran. The Israeli military is not commenting on the attack and it's not immediately clear what was targeted. This appears to be in retaliation for Iran's failed missile and drone attack on Israel last weekend. The International Atomic Energy Agency says there's no damage to Iran's nuclear sites, and it is monitoring the situation very closely. Paula Hancocks is in Beirut with the latest. Paula, get us up to speed. What do you know?",

      "sentences": "Well, Jim, at this point, we have been hearing from Iranian officials throughout state- run media in Iran. And really the message that they are giving at this point is that there was no damage, and that it is business as usual. We understand from the state media reports that they shot down three drones in this particular area and was seeing really street scenes of a business as usual, on state-run media, really an effort to downplay what happened overnight and trying to prove that nothing was affected.We heard from a state media also saying that the nuclear facilities are secure and that its this point that is no concern. It's a very different message to what we have been hearing in recent days. In fact, just hours before the strike happened on our air, we had the Iranian foreign minister saying that if Israel does carry out another strike against a radiant terror and Iranian assets than the response would be even more than what we saw last weekend with unprecedented attack of more than 300 drones and missiles against Israeli territory. And this is what we have been hearing in recent days, that if Israel were to retaliate, then there would be an even more significant response so at this point we don't know what is going to happen. We can assess from what we are seeing from the Iranian side that is being downplayed, but they don't consider this a significant attack and certainly when you compare it to the visuals of what we saw last weekend, it does not seem to be on that kind of level. So the hope certainly among many is that these fears of a wider regional conflict may have been averted at this point, but it all comes down to Tehran now, Jim, it depends if Iran believes that this was a low level enough attack that it doesn't feel it has to respond -- Jim.",

Nick, if you can pick up where apologists left off there, you know, it sounds like there's a lot of hope inside the diplomatic community internationally that perhaps this tit for tat will not continue. But I guess there are no guarantees that that will happen.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, that whole sort of confrontation to this point for the most part has been about proxies. Iranian proxies in Syria, Lebanon, Hezbollah key there and Iraq being used to hit Israel and its allies with some degree of deniability, they could turn it on, turn it off, but leave the Iranian homeland, so to speak, not something that could be a target.Also, Israel using covert operations inside of Iran to hit nuclear scientists, to hit key targets and damage Iran's infrastructure, but not have to stand up and claim public responsibility. That taboo is now gone certainly. And you may argue the cat is now out of the bag. It cannot be turned round. We're in a new phase potentially of this confrontation, but it's clearly a face tonight, we've seen neither side really wants to embrace. This is not a new era of direct confrontation either once. And, Jim, it's important to just remind ourselves here how nobody now, right now, it seems of the three major parties involved in this seems to want over war. It's clear the Biden administration absolutely does not want that as we head into an election season. It's clear Israel sees real pressing problems still in Gaza, potentially invading refer, which is going to need to deal with before it potentially sparks a huge and bloody messy confrontation that many Israeli hardliners think it needs with Hezbollah to its north, and Iranian proxy and Iran not that strong militarily, I think its fair to say the apogee of its powers is potentially behind it, economically struggling, with internal dissent issues, too. So, all three, perhaps not wanting confrontation now, you may see increased tension with Israel and Iran's proxy hairs belonged to the north and the months ahead, because there are so many in Israel who believed that, quote, problem needs to be dealt with. But it would be utterly catastrophic when that confrontation comes. And so, my takeaway without the big caveat of accepting how unpredictable and volatile this whole region has always been, is that we may be seeing this chapter tonight coming to certainly a lesser volume in the days ahead.",

And the psychological barrier was crossed.Last night, Israel hitting Iran inside of Iran basically, now, changes the game in terms of how this shadow war is seen. It's no longer in the shadows. It's now out in the open. I do think that the strike itself was limited. It was targeted on military sites, potentially, and also calibrated to send a message to Iran that Israel, we can hit, any strike, any site, we want, including the here are your nuclear sites. So that was very limited. And in that way, in the immediate term, we can breathe easy. But in the big picture, we're heading in the wrong direction.",
