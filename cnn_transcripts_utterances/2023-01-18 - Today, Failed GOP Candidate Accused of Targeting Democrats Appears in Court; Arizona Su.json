Because when he was arrested, they thought that he looked almost proud and unapologetic, as he was taken into custody for aggravated battery with a deadly weapon and for shooting at their homes, where some of them were inside. The district attorney here in Albuquerque says that he will be prosecuting this personally. It is a personal issue for him because he views this as a defense of democracy. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We didn't necessarily notice because it wasn't needed as much as it was during the pandemic. And that's where some of the holes really became quite obvious.So, this is not just any report by any Washington think tank. This is a report that is co-authored by real political and managerial and public health luminaries, including the former director of the CDC, Dr. Julie Gerberding, who ran the center from 2002 to 2009. They point out some things that are kind of within the CDC that need to change. It is notoriously siloed, one center is doing one thing, one center is doing another, they're assigned different things and they don't really cooperate or talk with each other as much as they should. Some of the things really the CDC can't do on its own, as you alluded to, that includes funding from Congress in a different way, not just more funding but in a different way. Right now, they are so limited as to what they're allowed to do. For example, when there was a case of polio in the Orthodox Jewish community in New York this summer, they wanted to just hire a woman there who is a great public health advocate who knew everybody who could really help and they couldn't. They weren't allowed to pay her to help because of the way that budge is constrained. An interesting note from Dr. Gerberding on the presentation of this report about where the CDC is, it is headquartered in Atlanta. Many people have said that that's a strength to be away from D.C. But she said she doesn't think so. She said, if you're going to play the game, you have got to be in the game, and the game is not played in Atlanta, unless, of course, you're a fan of baseball. So, that is -- or a fan of that baseball team. That, as a longtime atlanta resident, as I am, was very hard to hear. But it's interesting. Does the CDC need to be moved to Washington, where, of course, all the powerbrokers are. Bianna, John?",
