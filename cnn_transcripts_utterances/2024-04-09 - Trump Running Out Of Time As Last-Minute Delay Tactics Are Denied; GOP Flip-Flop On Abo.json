A judge in yet another criminal trial, the classified documents case, just issuing a separate ruling, this time siding with the special counsel, Jack Smith. And the unbelievable 180 inside the Republican Party. The GOP running as fast as they can away from a major court ruling today that bans nearly every abortion in the state of Arizona. So why are they so afraid of that? Isn't that what they said they wanted? And a CNN investigation this hour into one of the single deadliest events in Gaza, tonight, casting major doubt on Israel's official version of the events. Let's go OUTFRONT. (MUSIC)",

Trump denied at every turn tonight as he tries to stall that case. Just moments ago, another key decision coming out in a separate Trump trial as well. This in just the past hour, a ruling in Trump's Mar-a- Lago classified documents case, who gave Jack Smith a partial win, siding with his requests to withhold real names of witnesses in court documents, but there are many \"buts\" here, but one of them in particular is huge. Judge Cannon still has not announced a trial date for that classified documents case coming under intense criticism that she's doing exactly what Trump wants in delaying the case. Now, we're going to have more on that breaking ruling in just a moment. Paula Reid is breaking some more details here at this moment. But again, this is a result of a last-minute hearing for Trump in New York today, a very terse rejection. Today, Trump's legal team arguing to an appeals court judge that his hush money case should be delayed, while the former president challenges a gag order. The decision though was swift. Moments after the hearing ended, the judge and these two terms pages rejecting Trump's argument and at the very end, lots of lines you could have put for your reasoning and she only needed two. This application for an interim stay of the proceedings pending resolution of the article 78 proceeding is denied. Justice Cynthia Kim then signing merrily with her initials here CSK. Cynthia Kern, I'm sorry. So as of tonight, Trump's first criminal trial with 34 counts is full steam ahead to begin on Monday. Trump will become the first U.S. president to face criminal prosecution and the jury pool in Manhattan is already set for this jury selection will begin in on Monday, and everyone who scheduled to show up on Monday has known they're showing up on Monday so they know who they are. Paula Reid is OUTFRONT. And, Paula, the New York case about to make history tonight. Even as Judge Cannon and Florida, again, refuses to set a trial date.",

And that is whether to reveal the names of witnesses and she said for now those names will remain secret. But this has caused a lot of tension between the special counsel's office and Judge Cannon after Cannon push for more transparency and said she was going to reveal more information in this case.But tonight, she conceded that the special counsel is right. If she were to reveal the names of these witnesses, Erin, we've reported some of these witnesses are low-level employees at Trumps club that could potentially subject them to risk and harassment? Now, Cannon, she's been under a lot of scrutiny for her approach to this case. She still has over a dozen motions outstanding. And as you noted, the biggest decision she hasn't made is where to put this case on the calendar. We were in court with her well over a month ago. To your arguments on that issue, and she's still has not set a date. Now, Erin, I get a lot of questions amid this tension, the scrutiny about whether the special counsel will move to try to get cannon removed from this case. Now, there's no indication in their filings that they're going to do that at this point. But if they were, that's difficult, that's a high bar. They would need a record of mistakes or missteps. And right now, her record sorters pretty thin, but you can bet if they do attempt that in the future, this backtrack will likely be part of the record.",

So I want to know two things. Do you have an opinion about the case and you have a hardship? You have an opinion that's so strong that you can't be a fair and impartial juror. And what the judge is going to do is literally have the panel members raise their hand up to see if either they have a strong opinion or they have a hardship.

He's not saying I get to say this because I want to influence the jurors.So that's why you can have them on two separate tracks, get the jury started, get the trial started could have that happen. And then yes, its actually important to have the briefing and everything occur very quickly on the gag order in order to potentially release him or not for what he wants to say publicly, but its not about what he wants to say directed at the court or at the jurors that the trial.

Republicans now sprinting away from one of the issues that is defined that party for decades, an issue the Republican presidential candidates down to local lawmakers have campaigned on again and again, a crucial litmus test for the entire Republican Party.The issue is abortion and Republicans are now tripping over themselves after the Arizona Supreme Court rolled abortion rights back to 1864, upholding a 160-year-old abortion ban. It outlaws nearly all abortion in the state unless necessary to save the mother's life, that means rape, incest, all that not included, just the mother's life. The law actually sends abortion providers up to prison, to prison for up to five years. Now that is one of the toughest laws in the country. And now some Republicans who have claimed to be against abortion rights are doing all they can to distance themselves from today's decision. So let's just start at ground zero on this one in Arizona with Kari Lake who is running for Arizona's open Senate seat. Today, she released a statement which reads, and I quote, I oppose today's ruling and I am calling on Katie Hobbs and the state legislature to come up with an immediate common sense solution that Arizonans can support. OK, that would be fine if she just was breaking her silence on this issue. You might say, oh, who'd ever heard of a law from 1864? Well, Kari Lake had and, in fact, she had ardently supported this very law from 1864. Here she is talking about it two years ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And it's that position that in conversations tonight, senior White House officials, senior Biden campaign officials say is going to be the galvanizing issue for voters and it's going to help them establish a very clear contrast between what their candidates will do and what former President Trump is outlining.One campaign official described it to me as a state level Dobbs, referring of course, to the case in 2022 that helped the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, sparking protests across the country and giving Democrats a strong showing in the 2022 midterms, and campaign officials cite polling in Arizona that show that 62 percent of Arizonans believed that abortion should be legal in all or most cases. But the challenge for Biden in that state is going to be how many other issues voters will have to consider their. Take what \"The Wall Street Journal\" found just last month when it polled voters across swing state bates, including in Arizona. Abortion was actually the only issue where Biden bested Trump. You'll see in other cases like on the economy, immigration and fitness for office, President Trump was about 20 points higher than President Biden. Even so, they're going full court press on this issue alone. Vice President Harris will be in Tucson later this week and they're going to be many more surrogates visiting Arizona and other swing states to talk about this.",

Again for another outstanding report in that, Katie and her investigative team.I want to go down to the Democratic Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, member of the Foreign Relations Committee. Senator, I appreciate your time. After the World Central Kitchen airstrike, you had said conditions may need to be put on U.S. aid to Israel. Now, you've been able to see the CNN investigation. I know you just saw it here for the first time yourself. But it contradicts the IDF's official account of how at least 118 people were killed after they lined up for food aid in Gaza, shows that the gunfire started at least seven minutes earlier than the IDF actually said. Heavy automatic gunfire and calling into question their full account. What's your reaction, Senator? SEN. CHRIS COONS (D-DE):  Erin, what's clear both from the reporting I just saw on CNN and from dozens of previous incidents, is that far too many civilians have died in the six months of this conflict against Hamas, and far too many aid workers have died, nearly 200. The World Central Kitchen incident riveted the attention of many here in Congress because Jose Andres is known to many of us. But frankly, many other incidents like the one you were just documenting in which more than 100 died also have shown that the chaos in Gaza, the civilian deaths in Gaza, and the difficulty delivering humanitarian aid has gotten to a point where there needs to be changes made. In the last few days, more aid trucks have gotten into Gaza than at any point in six months. I think more than 400 today. And the Netanyahu government has announced an intention to open the Erez gate in the north, which if that's done could make a significant impact on the hunger bordering on famine in the north of Gaza, as well as the Ashdod port and a route through Kerem Shalom, for trucks from Jordan. This is long overdue and I think it's time for us to see some significant changes like this.",

And that brings us to what really is a new gold rush in America. People -- regular Americans, not just investors, big investors are big banks are rushing to buy actual gold, physical gold amid inflation concerns. Look at Costco. Costco is only started selling gold bars last year for proof. Okay? So this is the situation. They start selling a year ago, and Wells Fargo is now estimated that Costco is now selling up to $200 million a month in gold bars. Now I just want to -- it sounds enormous. It is by comparison, Costco sold $100 million in gold bars for the entire quarter that ended last November. So, an entire quarter, $100 million. And now running at $200 a month. Bank of America now projecting that the price of an ounce of gold, which hit seven straight record highs lately, will hit $3,000 by the end of the year. OUTFRONT now, Suze Orman, one of the world's best-known personal finance advisors and the founder of Secure Save and the host of the \"Women and Money\" podcast. So, Suze, I lay all this out because it comes from a place of a lot of very real fears of inflation and prices going up and feeling like your money doesn't go as far and people are rushing into gold. Are you shocked when you hear things like this? A hundred million dollars, first of all, they weren't even selling me a year ago. Then they sell them, one-quarter hundred million dollars.

Now here you're in Costco and people are in line and they're running out of it and they're only let people buying five apiece and all of a sudden, this frenzy starts and everybody wants to be a part of it, especially when they see the price going up and the price has gone up 13 percent so far this year. What they are not thinking about, however is that its one thing to buy gold and get a physical bar. It's another thing to have to sell it and that is not what they are thinking about. You have to have it surveyed -- all these things. Where do you go? Where do you keep it? Is it ensured, is it not? And so there's a lot of things I think people really need to think about when you're buying physical gold. Listen, if you want to be invested in gold, you can do it through an ETF. You can do it many ways. But to buy the actual commodity, I'm not sure is something that people should be doing.",
