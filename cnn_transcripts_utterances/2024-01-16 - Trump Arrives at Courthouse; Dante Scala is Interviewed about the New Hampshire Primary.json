And I think what we saw in the civil case, the judge there, you know, he kind of entertained the cameras. He allowed the pool spray at the top. He understood access. He would kind of play to the cameras, joked a little. Still questions about whether that was even appropriate. He knew what he was going to get as soon as Trump stood up to address the court. He let him go on for a little while.But federal court is different. I mean these judges, they don't play. They don't engage in antics. If they lay out rules and you blow past them, they are going to cut you off, potentially even drag you out of court. Now, you could argue that that would feed into the larger narrative. Maybe that's the three-dimensional chess they're playing here. But, again, the big question is why today. There's no role. There's no camera. Will he get a return on his investment more so than going to New Hampshire or going to the border? Unclear. We'll see.",

Now Iran claims it was going after a spy base they say was being used by the Mossad, Israel's spy agency. They say it was in Erbil in northern Iraq. Iran also says it fired ballistic missiles at what it called a terrorist headquarters in Idlib, in northern Syria. And there were other strikes in Syria as well. These were the strikes in Erbil, in the Iraqi/Kurdistan region.With us now, CNN military analyst, retired Air Force Colonel Cedric Leighton. Cedric, I glossed over what I think is the most significant part there. Iran says it conducted air strikes. We're not talking about proxies. We're not talking about Hezbollah or the Houthis. We're talking about Iran that did this. How significant? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: That's huge, John. And good morning to you. Yes, the big thing here is that the Iranians themselves are in essence taking the veil off and they're going in and they're making these not only declarations but they're actually taking action, and they're admitting to it. So those are two main factors in this particular case. There were a lot of reports as this was going on that some U.S. facilities might have been hit, like the U.S. consulate in Erbil. As far as we know, that is not the case. But the Iranians came pretty close and it was one of those things that really points to the fact that the tinderbox that is the Middle East is definitely going into a slow burn right now.",

He was already facing first-degree murder charges in the deaths of three women whose bodies were discovered near Long Island's Gilgo Beach more than a decade ago.CNN's Jean Casarez has been following this story for years. Now, Jean, talk to us about this fourth possible killing. JEAN CASAREZ, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: This is a huge development because we have known from almost the beginning that Maureen Brainard- Barnes, who was found on Gilgo Beach, very close in proximity to the other three who he has already been charged with, authorities said that Heuermann was a prime suspect in her murder. But it wasn't until moments ago that this indictment was unsealed and he is now charged with second degree intent to kill/murder of Maureen Brainard-Barnes. Now, let me tell you a little bit about her. She was 25 years old. She was a sex worker, as the others were also. She was last seen in 2007. And when she was still alive, there was communication with a burner phone that authorities believe was traced to Heuermann and her cell phone. But then in 2007, I believe it was June, she was never seen again after that. But days after that, her own cell phone was used. Her family didn't have it. And someone was calling her voicemail to check voice messages. Well, after that, the investigation went cold. But in 2010, when her remains were found in close proximity when the others were found too, she was restrained with three different belts. And there was one hair on a belt. And when they finally started testing it, once this investigation was reopened in 2022, there was damage to that hair. So they could not determine whose hair it was. It had to go in for more sophisticated testing. We now know that through that testing they believe that it was Heuermann's wife, Asa Ellerup, her hair. And her hairs were found on virtually all of the victims. But she was out of town for the other three when it's believed they were murdered. And now we have confirmation through legal documents they found credit card receipts that in 2007 she was in Atlantic City with her family for two weeks when it's believed that the murder happened. There are other things in this 16-page indictment that he, before she went missing, he got shredding device for his computer. Apparently it didn't work. But now the issue is going to be bail, because this is someone now charged with four counts of murder. The prosecution, of course, requesting no bail.",
