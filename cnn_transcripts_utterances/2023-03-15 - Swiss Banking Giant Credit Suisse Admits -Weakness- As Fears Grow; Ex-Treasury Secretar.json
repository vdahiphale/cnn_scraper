And so, in a sense, without the Fed raising interest rates, monetary conditions have tightened. And the question the Fed is going to have to ask itself is have monetary conditions tightened, sufficiently, that we are responding to the inflation threat, without any further rate increases, or without a further rate increase this month? And I don't think we can know the answer to that question with confidence. And every day, we're getting new information, as we see what happens, to banks, as we see how businesses, are responding, to these developments. Certainly, the 50 basis points that I and others thought was a viable option, before all of this financial difficulty? That has to be off the table.

But we are still also seeing very substantial rates of inflation. And if those substantial rates of inflation continue, they will erode people's purchasing power, and their ability to spend.

I do think there's a little bit of moral hazard here. The short answer in terms of why this bank or these two banks actually, Silicon Valley and Signature, get, quote- unquote, special treatment is that federal regulators deemed them to be in the category of systemic risk. So they granted an exemption, a special set of circumstances, for these institutions because they thought they didn't really want to have a domino effect. They were trying to avoid so- called financial contagion and this spreading. So, that's the short answer. But I frankly agree with Eric's, you know, question in terms of the theory behind it.

And similarly to how there has been a general consensus saying we should diversify our investment portfolios, people are starting to think about diversifying their checking and savings accounts as well.So they're not keeping the current FDIC limit in any one place.
