Less than a month until the caucuses. And that is translating into more face time with caucusgoers, more money going to ads, more money going to bolster every campaign's ground game to get Iowans to turn out and caucus on January 15th.And this morning CNN has some new insight into what that means and translates to for Donald Trump's campaign. Call it an Iowa test case for potentially a bigger, broader strategy to come. Let's get straight to it. CNN's Alayna Treene joins us now with this new reporting. Alayna, what are you learning?",

      "sentences": "Yes, well, Kate, the Trump campaign has really set up an extensive ground game in Iowa and they're hoping they can use this new model that they've been working on in a potential general election if this strategy is successful in the state. And the strategy is essentially this, Kate, they are trying to expand the electorate in Iowa in Donald Trump's favor. Trump's advisers tell me, and some of his allies as well, that they've really been focused on turning out and finding and creating first time caucusgoers. And while the polls and other candidates are really looking and betting on existing Iowa caucus voters to come out for them on January 15th, Trump's team is really trying to create a whole new slate of voters to come out for him in Iowa.And they're really looking to continue to build momentum in this final week. He's going to be in Iowa today. Then he has a short break for the holidays and then he'll be aggressively campaigning in this state, in the leadup to the caucus in January. And look, I mean, when I talk to Donald Trump's team, they tell me that they do have a threshold in mind for what they're hoping to hit in these caucuses in January. They say they want to reach about 12 points. They think that if they can win by 12 points in Iowa, that will essentially set a record for Donald Trump and help give him the momentum that the campaign wants him to have as he heads into the rest of primary season. Now, I also just want to point your attention to, Kate, some of the other candidates who are there today and how Donald Trump is trying to attack them. We know that Ron DeSantis, Nikki Haley, Vivek Ramaswamy, all crisscrossing the state as well in this attempt to really, you know, court these voters in the final days before the caucuses. But one thing that was really interesting is how Donald Trump is going after Ron DeSantis. We know that DeSantis had received an endorsement, huge endorsement, from Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds and kind of to go after DeSantis on that, the Trump campaign had released an ad showing Reynolds' past support for Donald Trump. And she criticized that ad last night on Fox News saying that Donald Trump was misleading Iowa voters. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. KIM REYNOLDS (R-IA): Now he's using me to mislead Iowans as if I'm endorsing him. And I want to be clear, you know, I - you know, I supported President Trump in 2016. I voted for him. I supported him in 2020. I agreed with his policies. But it's a different day. It's a different time. And we need a leader that doesn't have - that's not distracted. And that person is Ron DeSantis.

The Biden team sees abortion rights as a winning issue. The polls seem to show the same.CNN's Arlette Saenz joins us now from the White House this morning.

      "sentences": "Well, Sara, Vice President Kamala Harris' announcement that she will be making this Reproductive Freedoms Tour really signals how much of a focus the Biden team will be placing on the issue of abortion heading into 2024. Now, this will kick off in the state of Wisconsin, a battleground state, on January 22nd. That is a date of historical significance. That is a - it is the day that the Supreme Court made that landmark decision on Roe versus Wade. And Harris, over the past year and a half, after Dobbs was overturned, she has been hitting the road really to talk about abortion rights, hoping that this is an issue that can galvanize voters, not just in the midterms, but also heading into the 2024 election.The Biden campaign team believes very firmly every time you talk to them that the issue of abortion rights is a winning issue for them. They point to the fact that this helped candidates back in 2022 during the midterms, that there has been enthusiasm and high turnout with voters, specifically on the issue of abortion rights. And if you take a look at polling, recent polling CNN conducted last month found that Americans are more closely aligned with Democrats on the issue of abortion than with Republicans. The Biden campaign has also signaled that they want to use this as a wedge between their campaign and former President Donald Trump. We have really seen them on the attack against the former president specifically on the issue of abortion over the last week. Of course, 2024 also has other moments in abortion that will be key on the calendar. That includes when the Supreme Court hears and potentially decides on a case relating to medication abortion. So, this is an issue that will certainly be carried throughout the year heading into November as the Biden campaign is hoping that they can really galvanize voters with this issue of abortion rights and they are hoping that this tour by Vice President Kamala Harris will be a part of those efforts to turn out those types of voters.",

And this is an issue of policy.The problem is, is it's substantively false. Nikki Haley did not support a gas tax hike. She didn't pass one. In fact, South Carolina legislators had to wait for her to leave office before they actually got what they wanted, which was not what she wanted. In fact, she said she was against that but would only consider it if it was attached to a much bigger income tax reduction. So, the ads are not true but I think that's the effort to sort of paint her as establishment, someone who will speak to conservative voters, but ultimately, in the end, do what's best for bureaucrats and special interests, which is just not true.",

You could also see it as something of a weakness that Trump maybe doesn't believe he has enough of the, you know, the typical voters and he needs new voters. That's typically a Democrat strategy, right, to go after first time voters and younger voters. So, it is very interesting.

So, very close to it. Everyone safely out of the way.And there had been fears for the town itself because, as you say, this was not entirely unexpected, but these events that remain extremely unpredictable. The question was, Kate, which way that lava, you can see on those live pictures coming into us, was going to flow and whether it would head straight for that town. In fact, what we're hearing is it's instead been heading north and east. So, the immediate fears for the town, its residents, the infrastructure have be allayed. The fear now is what happens to the toxic fumes that have been emerging from this volcano. This is an eruption that appears to be lessening in violence, but that was extremely strong overnight. [09:20:03] It started just after 10:00 p.m., the lava, the force of the lava prizing opening that crack to 4 kilometers wide. And at some points overnight, 200 cubic meters of lava emerging from it every single second. So, a very powerful eruption and a bigger one than authorities had been expecting. And what happens then is that the toxic fumes emerge from that fissure and people have been -- authorities have been warning people not to try and come and have a look - or try and get closer to the volcano than they are already, closing many of the roads. But the fears are, Kate, at this stage, given how close Reykjavik, the Icelandic capital is, that some of those fumes could even head towards the capital there, causing disturbances. So, as we just watch those images, some fears allayed, but some still remain, Kate.",

And geologists and scientists have identified for several weeks now this underground tunnel, it's a corridor of magma underground that's roughly 15 kilometers long. It traversed underneath the town of Grindavik. That's why we saw the cracks in the ground. And they evacuated the town in the middle of the month last month.And they also identified some of the most at-risk areas. This area highlighted in orange was actually the area of most concern. There is the town of Grindavik. And they actually identified it perfectly because that's where the fissure opened up and the magna started to spew up. That's the latest information we're getting from the Icelandic Meteorological Service. This is a topographical map. You can see some mountainous terrain. So this is going to help push the lava away from the town of Grindavik. And also the good news here, talking about toxic fumes from this eruption. The winds are out of the northeast, so that's also going to push that away from the populated areas of Grindavik. Now, look at this video. This is showing that large fissure, which is 4 kilometers long. But scientists and geologists have already noted this downturn in the magna activity recently. This isn't indicating so much that the volcano isn't done erupting, Kate, it's actually indicating to the scientists that the magma is reaching some sort of an equilibrium. So, we can kind of see this slow magma transfer here for the next several days. In fact, only about a quarter of the amount of magma compared to last night is spewing out of this fissure. So, only about a third of the entire 4 kilometer length crack is actually active at this moment. Kate.",
