Republican Governor Greg Abbott is expected to sign the bill passed by state lawmakers yesterday. The ACLU is calling it, quote, one of the most radical anti-immigrant laws ever. And is vowing to sue the Governor. CNN's Rosa Flores is live for us in Houston with more details. Rosa, what more can you tell us about this legislation?",

      "sentences": "Well, Pamela, the jury got the case just before lunch, and they just started deliberating, so it could be a matter of hours. It could be days. And once this federal case wraps up, then his state case will begin.Now, in this federal case, he is facing two charges that the jury will have to decide on whether he assault on the immediate family member of a federal official. And the attempted kidnapping of a federal official. And David DePape's defense attorneys really wanted the jury to focus on two words -- federal official. Because they argue that David DePape did not go to then House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's home because of her official duties, because of her job as House Speaker at the time. They argue that he went there because she was a top Democrat and she was spreading lies on behalf of the political party. And so they said that his acting on account of politics is different than acting on account -- on account of her official duties and her official title. They wanted the jury to make that distinction very clearly. On the other hand, the prosecution said he very much went to then House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's house because of her official title. He said they showed videos of after the arrest and also played audio from his interview with investigators where he said she was the leader of the pack. That this was a suicide mission and that he was sick of all of the lies coming out of Washington, DC. Now if he's convicted on these charges, as well as those charges from the state case, he faces decades in prison -- Pamela.",

I mean, they -- this is something right after October 7th. In a very unusual move, we actually had director Wray get on a call with a bunch of reporters and talked about just how much this had grown just out of nowhere. And so the one of the concerns that they have, Brianna, is the thing that we saw during the rise of ISIS. Where people sitting around consuming some of this stuff. Decide that they're going to act out and do something. And something in America, obviously, there's a lot of access to guns. It's very easy to do. And so that's a huge concern for them.But also just the fact that they've known for years and for a long time that there are people who were associated with Hamas here, mostly doing fundraising. And so the concern is, you know after October 7th, you have to worry that Hamas might do some kind of attack here in the United States. Not something that they've seen so far, but it is a concern. And that's one reason why he mentioned there's a number of people who are associated with Hamas who are now under investigation.",

Was the fact that every time we heard from the director or from someone who was trying to describe how the threat had changed from October 7th, they got interrupted. The Republicans on that panel didn't really want to hear that. They wanted to yell at Alejandro Mayorkas, who they were trying to -- they've been trying to impeach. Yesterday during a vote they decided to refer it to the committee. But a lot of their focus today was on Mayorkas and trying to you really holding to account for what they say is the poorest border. And what they say were problems associated with the border. And so that's what you saw a lot of what this folk -- this hearing became about today.",
