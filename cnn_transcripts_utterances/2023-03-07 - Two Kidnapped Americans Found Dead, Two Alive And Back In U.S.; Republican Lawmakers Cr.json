A little later, we'll talk about solutions, what works and what does not when it comes to keeping fentanyl away from her kids. First, our top story, what happened to those four Americans who are kidnapped in Mexico? Tonight, two of them are back on U.S. soil being treated at a hospital but their two friends were killed. They traveled to Mexico so one of the group could get cosmetics or jury, and more and more Americans are doing that. And the Capitol Police Department want Fox's Tucker Carlson to stop lying about January 6th, so does the family of Officer Brian Sicknick who died as a result of the insurrection. Republican senators also calling Carlson's conspiracy theories about January 6th, quote, B.S., a lie and disgusting. Why doesn't Fox support police? Also, Michelle Obama talking about the day she moved out of the White House and why she sobbed uncontrollably. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MICHELLE OBAMA, FORMER U.S. FIRST LADY (voice over):  And then we went to Andrews Air Force Base, said goodbye to the military, got on Air Force One. And when those doors shut, I cried for 30 minutes straight, uncontrollable sobbing, because that's how much we were holding it together for eight years. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
