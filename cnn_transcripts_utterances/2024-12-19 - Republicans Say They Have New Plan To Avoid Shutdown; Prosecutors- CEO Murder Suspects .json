      "sentences": "-- on Capitol Hill, where the United States could be just minutes away from a vote to avoid a government shutdown, lawmakers are facing a very real deadline. The federal government is set to shut down at the end of the day tomorrow. And here's the thing, we have no idea which way this vote is going to go. Democrats are not feeling this new deal, which they say was made up by Republicans on their own. And there's even some doubt over whether this new deal, supported by Donald Trump, has the necessary support among House Republicans.Here's what the proposal reportedly includes. It's a clean extension, three months for federal government funding. This includes a two year suspension of the debt limit. It also includes a farm bill extension and a $110 billion disaster relief package. Now, just moments ago, as I noted, President-elect Trump supported this writing on Truth Social, quote, \"Success in Washington. Speaker Mike Johnson and the House have come to a very good deal for the American people,\" unquote. But the question is, do Republicans have the votes? Will House Democrats vote for this? If this deal does not pass the House and the Senate before tomorrow night, a shutdown would put key government services on hold and it would mean no pay for hundreds of thousands of federal employees right before Christmas. We weren't even talking about a shutdown until yesterday because Speaker Johnson had previously negotiated a bipartisan deal and that fell apart when Elon Musk and Donald Trump came out yesterday and publicly opposed that deal. CNN's teams are spread out across the capital tonight. Let's start with Manu Raju and Lauren Fox. Manu, Republicans say they have a deal, but the question is, do they have the votes?",

      "sentences": "It's an open question. And actually, Jake, it seems a bit uncertain that they'll actually get this over the finish line, as not only are Democrats sounding very skeptical, they're downright opposed to this plan. But there are also Republicans who don't like this as well, including the idea of suspending the national debt limit for two years. That is what's under this plan. It came as a result of Donald Trump.Remember, Republicans for many years, including in this Congress, fought tooth and nail for any clean extension of the debt limit. They wanted cuts to come alongside it. Ultimately, they actually did cut a plan that took months to negotiate last year to raise the national debt limit, actually make it until January of next year, January of 2025, when the debt limit would be breached. That would cause Donald Trump to raise alarm bells just yesterday, demanding that any 11th hour, any deal to avoid a government shutdown needs to include some sort of debt level -- debt limit increase, a debt limit suspension. Mike Johnson, the Speaker of the House, acquiesced to the demands and is trying to get Republicans in line. But there are Republicans like Congressman Chip Roy of Texas who are fundamentally opposed to the idea of suspending the national debt limit, saying this earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. CHIP ROY (R-TX): You can't lift the debt ceiling or suspend the debt ceiling without actual structural reform to save money. That's the bottom line. If you're just going to go add, say limiting, you know, increasing your credit card limit while you don't do anything to actually constrain spending. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So you're seeing, Jake, Donald Trump is trying to force Republicans to bend to his will. He's going to have success in large part. But getting Republican unity is a totally different question.And here's the other wrinkle, Jake. It looks likely that under the process to facts fast track to the floor, they'll need two thirds of the full House to get this passed. That means 290 votes. So that means they need to get a significant number of Democrats in addition to Republicans. A huge question uphill climb at the moment to get this out of the House.",

I don't believe in that, but he does, and I respect that.And so, I think the one thing Donald Trump is going to have to come to terms with is he doesn't have the majority he had when he was president the first time. We had pretty sizable majorities or maybe were in the minority at a point. But when we were in the majority, it's like, look, he ended up have knowing and being able to cut deals with Democrats. He actually could play the role of bringing Republicans along to deals he cut with Democrats. Now what he's doing, it seems to be, is alienating everybody, trying to rely on just Republican votes and yet alienating the majority makers in the Republican Party. It's going to be a harsh awakening for him. Maybe he changes in January, but I mean, this is not a good start. And this ultimately is really setting that government off for a really bad January.
