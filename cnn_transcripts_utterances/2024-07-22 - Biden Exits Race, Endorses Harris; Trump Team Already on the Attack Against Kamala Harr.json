So, President Biden has ended his re-election campaign and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris. There is less than a month to the Democratic Convention, just over 100 days until the election itself.This is where things stand right now, insofar as we know. We will hear from Vice President Harris today. She says she intends to earn and win the nomination. In less than 24 hours, she has picked up a ton of endorsements, and the Democrats have raised a ton of money. We have new information about what is happening behind the scenes around her, and if anyone might take her on, because just seconds ago, right on CNN, Senator Joe Manchin said he is pursuing the process. We're trying to figure out what that means. We have new reporting on what pushed President Biden over the edge with two of his closest advisers telling him his path to victory was basically nonexistent. We'll start very quickly there.

These are members of Congress. These are governors, labor leaders, civil rights leaders.I spoke to the head of the Congressional Black Caucus, and he told me in their conversation, it was abundantly clear to him that she understands that the next coming weeks are going to be a real test, that just because President Biden endorsed her, that it isn't going to be a core a nation, that she will have to really put in the work in the days ahead. One thing she does have on her side, though, is that she has built in support from key Democratic coalitions. I've been traveling on the campaign trail with her the last several weeks, and Democratic voters showed a real excitement for the prospect of Harris at the top of the ticket. But still, Senator Manchin, he might throw a last minute intrigue into this contest. Take a listen to what he said earlier this morning on our air. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. JOE MANCHIN (I-WV):  You would like to see some sort, you know, have some debates, have something. There's plenty of time. We act like there's no time at all. I have been very humbled by people calling and asking, would you be considered -- would you consider, would you talk about? Also, my main thing is that we have a voice. I want the middle to have a voice. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

This is just an example of a bit of a lag time between a large -- a major political party shifting gears a bit. And I wouldn't expect that to last more than another day or so. It really does take some time for a large group of political operatives or politically-minded people to change their strategy across the country.And so, we're going to hear more in the hours and days to come of attacks on Harris and less on attacks about whether Biden should step down from office, which he's clearly unlikely to do before the end of his term.",

So, the Biden says it's Kamala Harris, I'd say most of those people are going to vote for her.And remember what vice presidents do. They do a lot of political work for their president.

So, he has to start calling delegates, calling into state delegations.By the way, there're state delegation meetings going on all over the country. One is in Maryland today. There was one in New Hampshire yesterday. He has to call those delegates and say, I'm a better equipped to challenge Donald Trump than is Kamala Harris. That's a hard job to do.
