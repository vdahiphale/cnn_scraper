If you take a look at what we saw in Japan just over the last three days. Now, if you want to see wild swings, you take a look of what we saw in Japan. Actually, that's the open. It's positive.

If we've got the market open for tech stocks, we'll take a look at those, because, again, that's you've got to watch. That's going to dictate the direction throughout the session. You see we're green, and that's helping us today. Watch that in the close. And then the final thing, of course, is what's going on with the U.S. economy. Data watching mode.

Now a new report this morning shows that new, restrictive laws aren't actually slowing down the number of abortions in the United States.CNN medical correspondent Meg Tirrell is here with more on this. What are these numbers telling you? They seem to be a bit surprising considering all the states that have started restricting abortions.",

      "sentences": "Yes, absolutely. What they show is that nationally the number of abortions through the formal health care system, so those provided in clinics, doctor's offices, hospitals, or through telemedicine, through virtual clinics, have actually been increasing.These data look at the first three months of 2024. And what they find is that on average there were about 99,000 abortions provided in the United States each month. Now, in one of those months it actually topped 100,000. That's a 14 percent increase compared with the first three months of 2023. So, you are seeing that overall, even though abortion has been restricted quite a bit in a number of states, the overall number has been increasing. A lot of that could be due to the increasing use of telehealth and getting medication abortion. These data also track the proportion of all abortions obtained through telemedicine. That was 4 percent in April of 2022. That's now up to 20 percent in March of 2024. And we know that medication abortion already is the most common way people access abortion. It accounts for two- thirds of abortions. So, people can get those in-person from a doctor or a clinic, but also through telemedicine. And we're seeing that quite a bit. Now, we know that 14 states have implemented almost total bans on abortion since Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022. An additional four states have six-week bans. The most recent one to go into place was Iowa. And what you are seeing is that a lot of folks are traveling from those states to other states to access abortion.",

      "sentences": "Yes. Well, one of those states that has seen an influx of patients has been Minnesota because under Governor Tim Walz it is seen as one of the more protective states for accessing abortion. In January of 2023, so after Roe v. Wade was overturned, he signed a law enshrining the right to access abortion in that state. Then in April of 2023, he put into place what's known as the shield law, which protects clinicians in the state from being prosecuted by other states for providing abortion care and also potentially can protect people who had come to Minnesota to access abortion.I also talked with the Guttmacher Institute, which is a research and policy organization that supports abortion rights. They pointed out he has also supported insurance paying for abortions in the state. And so he has kind of a more complex understanding of what is needed beyond just the legality of it. Of course, when Kamala Harris visited a - an abortion clinic in March of this year, the first time it's thought that a sitting vice president or president has done that. She chose Minnesota. And Governor Tim Walz was there as well.",

It's competitive within the team. And I think just as this has built and grown, the players are feeling so excited. Any tired legs they might have are kind of falling by the wayside.

It has been really for as long as the team has existed, I think. Winning so many championships. Winning so many World Cups. So many Olympics. The team has always been looked at as, we must win or it's deemed a failure. And I think that through the last couple of years the team has had a chance to rebuild a little bit. Like I said, get this new manager. There is this new generation of talent emerging. And I almost feel like some of that pressure was lifted off of the team this past year. We - there was some doubt cast on them in the media about how they would perform this tournament. And as it's gone on, they've just kind of shed all of that doubt. They've lifted themselves up and they've used their talent and their connection to each other. And this newfound trust they found with the manager, Emma Hayes.

The power really is in the collective.Obviously, I am very gung-ho for pay equity, for pay equality across all sport. I think that it takes players stepping up and speaking out in order to make things like that happen. And what I learned through the journey of the U.S. women's national team, being part of that, is you have to push for what you want. You have to ask for more. And players, like the players on the U.S. team, we were in a privileged position where we could step up safely and ask for that. We have great labor laws here in the U.S. And I think it's now our obligation to help players from other countries who are not as protected as we were and continuing to push for that is showing in the quality of the game that is going on at a tournament like the Olympics right now.",
