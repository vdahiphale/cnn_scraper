Twenty-six-year-old Gabriella Gonzalez was shot in the head the day after she returned from Colorado where she went for an abortion, according to the arrest warrant.

Gabriella Gonzalez told police, according to an arrest warrant, that she had told police multiple times that she was beaten up by Harold Thompson.During the time of the shooting, there was an active family violence strangulation warrant against Thompson that had to do with a March incident, and according to that arrest warrant, Thompson said to police that Gabriella Gonzalez was pregnant with his child during that incident. So let's go back to Wednesday. That is when Dallas police got a 911 call. They rushed to a parking lot and there on the ground they discovered 26-year-old Gabriella Gonzalez shot and killed. They looked at the surveillance footage, and in that footage they found Harold Thompson walking with Gonzalez shortly before the deadly shooting. And in that footage they also saw him attempting to try to put her in a chokehold. She shrugged that off. That is when Thompson pulled out a gun and shot her. When she hit the ground, he continued to shoot at Gonzalez. Let's go back to the arrest warrant. In it, police detail, quote, \"further investigation revealed that Gonzalez went to Colorado to get an abortion and returned the night before. It is believed that the suspect was the father of the child. The suspect did not want the complainant to get an abortion.\" Court documents show that Thompson has refused to give a statement. He has been charged with murder and assault of a household member. A judge has denied him bond for both of those offenses. He is to be appointed a public defender. Alex?",

In a new court filing, a senior Border Patrol official projects up to 14,000 migrants could try to enter the U.S. per day in the coming weeks, which could strain already overcrowded border facilities. But that surge has not yet happened. Instead, authorities say that the long lines of migrants have mostly vanished at many border crossings. CNN's Polo Sandoval is in El Paso, Texas.

Let's start on that point, and you briefly touched on it, which is what is projected to be up to 14,000 encounters a day, according to a senior federal official in some of those recently filed documents.That would be a significant uptick from the average 9,000 encounters that we're experiencing right now. So we'll have to see exactly whether or not that message coming from the Biden administration resonates for migrant groups on the other side of the border to see if they will weigh all their options to see if they will risk it and cross illegally into the United States and to see what that means for border communities like El Paso. And then the other question, though, is what we are probably likely to see in those communities some thousands of miles from here, places like Denver, places like New York City that many of the migrant groups here tell us continue to be some of the most popular destinations for those asylum seekers that are processed and then released subject to the eventual outcome of their asylum proceedings. And that really is what's going to be the shared focus here, not only what's happening and what will happen on the border, but also what we may see in places like New York City that have sheltered well over 60,000 asylum seekers in the last year alone. And that's led to a really rocky relationship between New York City officials and some of the neighboring communities. [14:05:05] As we've reported before, Mayor Eric Adams now coming up with these programs and these proposals to shuttle some asylum seekers that volunteer to take part in this program to neighboring communities. So this is really a constantly evolving situation. But for now, the situation on the border, at least in this part of the border, it is certainly not the chaotic scene that officials were afraid would happen in the days following the lifting of Title 42, Alex.",

This is the place from which many migrants cross into the U.S. They were lined up up until Thursday when Title 42 ended, and we saw hundreds of them just waiting to be processed by Border Patrol.But Friday morning and all day we saw the last group of migrants being taken into custody, a few other migrants were rushing in, trying to talk to the National Guardsmen, the state troopers, and the immigration agents who were in this place to see if they would let them cross through this fencing, but they were not successful. And as you can see now, there is nobody risking to get into the United States. What we heard from the migrants yesterday in particular was that they did try to be here before the end of Title 42, knowing that the new policies could result on a faster deportation with severe consequences. So perhaps the message is getting through to the migrants who are thinking about going into the United States and just enforcing existing laws is working. However, we know that there are still hundreds of migrants coming north. We have reporters in Central America who are following more migrants coming up. The Mexican government still estimates that there are thousands of migrants in this country trying for the opportunity -- waiting for the opportunity to get into the United States. The question now is, are they going to continue coming to places like this to turn themselves in to Border Patrol, or are they going to risk going through places more remote and avoid detention?

But ultimately, they believe that some of the planning that they've put in place will help as more migrants come to the U.S. amid the lifting of Title 42. Now, President Biden has faced political pressure from both sides of the aisle. There have been Democrats within his own party who have warned that they believe that the administration has not sufficiently prepared for the lifting of Title 42. The president has also faced criticism from Republicans who have tried to highlight this moment as a political vulnerability for President Biden. One of those lawmakers, Pete Sessions, the congressman from Texas, compared the scenes that are playing out down at the border to the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan.

And so that's what we know at this point. I must stress the Israelis have yet to comment on this, but certainly this comes after five days of intense barrages of missiles out of Gaza and Israeli air strikes on Gaza, and today, of course, the main fatalities were two Palestinians from Gaza -- or rather one Palestinian from Gaza who had a work permit who was injured in Israel as a result of one of those rockets.

WEDEMANsurprises. And when things seem like they're going far to the left, they change direction rather quickly. We knew that the Egyptians all along were involved as they always are in these crises in trying to cease the fire, trying to bring the two sides, obviously not into direct communications, but to send messages back and forth and to make these things happen. So in a sense, it's gone as far as it can go. Neither side can keep this up for too long. Islamic Jihad has only so many commanders it can have assassinated, so many rockets it can fire. Israel can only take so much of the paralysis of the southern part of the country.

Obviously, we saw it at the town hall earlier this week. DeSantis, though, is continuing to avoid that. In fact, as he was leaving this event today, I tried to get him to weigh in on one of those attacks. Trump has repeatedly brought up the fact that DeSantis as a Congressman voted against ethanol subsidies here. That's a huge issue.

Then there's the glorious bridges that sit in the Bay and welcome you into the shining city on a hill. The endlessly diverse neighborhoods from Chinatown to the Mission to the Italian enclave of North Beach to the pristine Presidio which gives the city its lungs, and down to the Pacific that rests below, inviting you in, and then biting your skin with its ice cold touch.

Sara, I'm so glad that you're doing this. Like you, this is a city that I love, that is fascinating, that the nuanced and complex. But lately we have been hearing a lot more about high- profile crimes in the city. Is crime actually higher in San Francisco?",

      "sentences": "When you talk about those high-profile crimes, usually we're talking about murder, and just recently you saw the stabbing death of the Cash App founder, Bob Lee. When you look at murder itself, when you look at homicide itself, San Francisco's numbers compared to other cities of its size are really low.They had 56 murders between 2021 for that year, and then 2022 the same number. Look at Indianapolis, Indiana. They had four times that number of homicides. You look at Jacksonville, Florida, they had almost three times the number of homicides. So violent crime and particularly homicides are low in San Francisco. The issue is that people are running into things like aggression on the streets from people who have mental illness, or people who are doing drugs openly in the street, doing things like heroin or taking fentanyl in the streets, and they can't avoid it. San Francisco's only seven by seven square miles, as you know, and so it's really quite hard to avoid. And you have the other thing that happened, which of course was COVID. But unlike other cities, San Francisco has had a much harder time recovering from that. And so it's hard to avoid some of the issues. And I can tell you the number one thing I hear every time I go to the city is watch where you park your car. If you're going to drive, watch where you park your car, because almost everyone that I know that lives there or that has visited there, including, by the way, the mayor of the city, has had their car broken into. So people are just leaving their windows down or their leaving signs on the window saying, it's open, don't break the window, there's nothing inside. So that really aggravates, as you might imagine, the residents.",

If you just take things like your car being stolen or your car being broken into, those are everyday things that really make your life very, very miserable. And so you cannot, as I said earlier, get away from some of the things that are extremely aggravating, but also can be really scary in the city. And it is in your face partly because a lot of the homeless tents thatsprung up in 2020 during the pandemic, during the emergency of the pandemic, and when you look at that, there were more deaths by drug overdoses than there were COVID deaths in San Francisco. And some people will say, look, we really dealt with COVID well. But then you had this other thing happen where, and you're seeing pictures now, of the tent cities that sprung up. Then the city got involved and said, OK, we're going to make little squares, and you see those little squares there, and we're going to have a certain number of tents and this is going to be a place where you can be at this point in time. That has been cleared out. But I can tell you, we talked to so many people, Alex. We talked to the mayor. We talked to the ex-mayor, a mayor that is known as The Mayor Willie Brown, one of the most famous mayors of San Francisco. But we also talked to residents who are housed and people who consider themselves residents who are unhoused. And they told us with candor what was going on in the streets. And one on the things we heard over and over and over again is that they came to San Francisco from out of town because they knew the drugs were cheap and they knew it was easier to live on the streets there, and there were services that were available to them. And so there's a lot of talk about policy here. We talked to mothers whose sons, they have been searching for years for them out on the streets who got addicted to drugs at a young age. But it's so available, and that is what is hard for those who live in the city and have watched the city in some ways deteriorate, Alex.",
