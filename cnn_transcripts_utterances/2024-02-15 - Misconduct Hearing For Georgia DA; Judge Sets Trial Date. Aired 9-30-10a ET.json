There's zero evidence whatsoever that Joe Biden or the administration had anything to do with this prosecution.Second of all, Donald Trump said, quote, \"this is not a crime.\" There's a fair debate about how serious this is. But this is a crime if proven as alleged in the indictment. There's some question about whether it would be just a misdemeanor, falsification of business records, or a higher-level felony. But under any reasonable construction, if proven, this is a crime. And the third thing Donald Trump said that I noted is he said, there's absolutely no case here. This is a debatable case. It will be tried to a jury. But this is a case that has a good faith basis. There's a basis of fact in the indictment. It will be up to a jury.

Prior to starting, any testimony, the state would just like the address, I guess, the (INAUDIBLE) matter is an issue for the court as it relates to what was represented during the previous hearing, as it relates to witness testimony, specifically the testimony of the former law partner of Nathan Wade, that being Mr. Terrence Bradley, and what the court - or what the state would like the court to understand and realize that is that in preparation for this hearing and speaking to witnesses and doing the additional research as it relates to the comments that were represented by counsel, specifically council for Mr. Roman, Ms. Merchant, that we've been able to determine that the claims that the defendant, as asserted and did assert during the last hearing on Monday, are not only legally meritless, but are factually unsupported by the statements that Ms. Merchant made to the court. What I would say are - they're patently false. They are egregious misrepresentations of what is believed that Mr. Bradley would say or even knows. And what I would bring to the courts attention, in my speaking with the defense council for Mr. Bradley, Mr. Chopra, is that anything that he -- any knowledge of anything he would have would be protected under the attorney-client privilege. He would assert that. And that privilege has not the waved by Mr. Wade. More importantly, a representation was made to the court that Ms. Merchant spoke to Mr. Bradley and that Mr. Bradley represented that he had firsthand knowledge from speaking to several witnesses that he would be able to impeach with the statements she represented, that there was a relationship prior to Mr. Wade being appointed special prosecutor and that there was issues with cohabitation that you would be able to directly impeach those witnesses. That is patently false in speaking with Mr. Chopra. Those are misrepresentations that are not true. They are for the purpose of harassment and undue burden to the district attorney. And we'd ask to renew our motion to quash. And the only hearing we should be having is the hearing as it relates to sanctions or the defense counsel's lack of candor that's required by not only statutory law, but professional rules and responsibility and case law. And we ask that we move into a hearing that -- that is related to the sanctions do to the misrepresentation and flagrant falsehoods that have been spread throughout the world in an effort to affect this case and to keep it from moving forward.
