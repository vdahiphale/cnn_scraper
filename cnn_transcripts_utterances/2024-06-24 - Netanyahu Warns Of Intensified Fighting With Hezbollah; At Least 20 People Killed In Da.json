Tonight, Benjamin Netanyahu says that mostintense [AUDIO GAP:00:45-47] he warns that Israel's -- conflict with Hezbollah could be about to intensify. We'll bring you the very latest. Then attacks by armed gunmen leave at least 20 people dead and dozens more injured in Russia's southernmost Dagestan Province. Plus, Joe Biden and Donald Trump are preparing to go head-to-head on CNN's debate stage. So, how do their strategies compare? We'll have that, of course, and much more just ahead. But first, tonight, Israel's Defense Minister is in high-stakes talks in Washington right now after a major announcement by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about a shift in the Gaza war. Mr. Netanyahu says the intense phase -- this is what he says. \"The intense phase of fighting, Hamas is about to end\", suggesting operations in Rafah are perhaps winding down. He says that doesn't mean the war is over, but he told an Israeli news channel that Israeli forces could soon be redeployed near the Lebanon border amid escalating hostilities with Hezbollah. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, PRIME MINISTER, ISRAEL (through translator): After the intense phase is finished, we will have the possibility to move part of the forces north, and we will do this, first and foremost for defensive purposes, and secondly, to bring our evacuated residents home. If we can, we will do this diplomatically, if not, we will do it another way. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He's sitting down right now with Secretary of State, Antony Blinken. Also today, Mr. Netanyahu is walking back comments that raged families of hostages in Gaza. In that interview, we just mentioned, he suggested Israel could strike a partial deal with Hamas to free some of the hostages. He now says the war will continue until all hostages are returned. The families of three hostages meantime have authorized the release of new video of their loved ones kidnapping from music festival, if you remember, on October the 7th, and we warn you, the images we are about to show you are graphic. The video taken by Hamas shows the hostages in the back of a pickup truck being driven through southern Israel. One can be seen with his blood -- with his face bloodied there, and his arm apparently blown off. Some of the video has already been seen by the public. But now the hostages' families, one more footage released to help increase pressure for a deal that would bring them home. So much for us to discuss this, let's get all the very latest from our Paula Hancocks who is in Jerusalem, Kylie Atwood is at the U.S. State Department. So, Paula, I mean, let me start with the politics first of all, that we've heard that interview from Prime Minister Netanyahu. Because these are the clearest comments so far from the prime minister about the war, and it seems from his words and that this was on the record of course, in that interview that he's setting the stage for a confrontation with Hezbollah. Just talk us through what we heard from him.",

What -- from the U.S. side, Imean, what is Yoav -- Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, who is in Washington, of course. What is he hoping to get out of the U.S. support backing for this phase C part of the war? KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Certainly, yes, I think that's a fair assessment, but I also think the flip side of that is that U.S. officials are trying to really understand what this phase C would actually look like. State Department spokesperson -- I just asked him in the briefing here, you know, if the United States would support what Prime Minister Netanyahu said over the weekend, which is that, there will continue to be mowing of the grass in Gaza even after this intense period of the conflict comes to a close. They'll continue essentially strikes in Gaza. The U.S. is not saying that they support that, the spokesperson said that that's a recipe for continued conflict that would lead to more insecurity even for Israel. So, they're being pretty firm on that. We'll have to watch and see what this dialogue between the Defense Minister from Israel, the Secretary of State today, also the Secretary of Defense here in Washington tomorrow actually look like. But there are also a number of other issues that they're going to be talking about. You know, clarity from the Israelis in terms of what they are hoping to accomplish in transitioning to the north, to this conflict with Hezbollah, and of course, not leaving Gaza behind and looking at it, you know, altogether is off the table. The U.S. is going to be discussing with Gallant how to increase the security in Gaza to get that humanitarian assistance in there, continues to have troubles getting in, and also what those day after plans look like. So, this spokesperson said to me that there are some more serious conversations with Israelis at this point about day after dialogue, because Israelis have been sort of resistant to dive into that, but now they are starting to engage. But it's still very unclear what the day after this conflict in Gaza would look like as you have had U.S. officials and many other officials talking about the security situation in Gaza being tremendously bad at this point, with looting, with gangs and the like, creating just a really challenging situation increasingly so.",

If full- scale war breaks out, that war will spread well beyond the frontier on both sides. (voice-over): Last week, Israeli generals approved a plan to attack Lebanon, while Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah recently warned if it comes to war, the group will fight Israel on land, sea and air, and also inside Israel itself. The Iranian-backed group's sophisticated attacks have surprised Israeli officials, including precision strikes on surveillance posts on the border, shooting down high-flying Israeli drones and knocking out anti-missile and anti-drone defenses, and posting online more than nine minutes of what it claimed was drone footage of sensitive military and civilian infrastructure in and around the city of Haifa.

We're joined by Colin Clarke; the director of Policy and Research at the Soufan Group in New York. Colin, great to have you back on the show. Let me start off really from what we heard just in the last what? Twenty four hours or so from that interview that Prime Minister Netanyahu did with Israeli television. I mean, it's clearest yet really, message yet, and we heard this from our correspondent in Jerusalem about where he wants to take this war that's shifting its attention to Hezbollah. What do you make of this? COLIN CLARKE, DIRECTOR, POLICY &amp; RESEARCH, THE SOUFAN GROUP: It's hard to say, but you're absolutely right. There's multiple audiences at the -- on the receiving end of his message. There's the Israeli public, there's Hezbollah, of course, there's the Lebanese public, and I think there's the international community, most importantly, the United States and others. The U.S. and the French have been accelerating diplomatic efforts to kind of quell this roiling -- these roiling tensions unsuccessfully so far. But it seems clear that Netanyahu is determined to keep rolling, but when one looks at how poorly Gaza has gone for the Israel defense forces, it's really questionable that he would go forward with some kind of war with Hezbollah. But at the end of the day, politics is what's going to drive conflict. And so, we may end up there eventually.",

We saw Vice President Kamala Harris who has really been a leading voice for the Biden administration earlier today at a campaign event in Maryland, saying that our fundamental freedoms are really at risk. And she certainly put the blame firmly at Donald Trump's feet. And then we have this new campaign ad from the Biden team that features a woman from Louisiana, who says in the ad that she was turned away from two separate emergency rooms after she suffered from a miscarriage at 11 weeks of pregnancy. And she said all of that was the direct result of Donald Trump and his decisions. Now, all of this is just part of a wide-ranging campaign wide effort from Democrats, from the Biden administration and the campaign to really try to highlight this issue. We are seeing a number of surrogates that are going to be found across the country, really to hone in on this specific message. And that certainly is a reminder of how much, as you said, Democrats believe this is a really potent and salient message that can mobilize voters and it certainly has mobilized voters for them in the past. Now, we don't expect to see President Biden himself much, if at all in the coming days because he's hunkered down at Camp David for debate prep, but we certainly expect that this very issue of abortion rights and reproductive rights is something that the team is really preparing for, and they're counting on this being one of the issues, one of the top issues really where they can really draw one of the sharpest contrast possible between the current president and the former president.",

      "sentences": "Right. Well, we've been waiting for Trump to be more presidential, in inverted commas, ever sincehe burst onto the scene politically about eight years ago. I think the thinking is that it would make a lot more sense for Trump to behave in a more conventional fashion in this debate, given that the last first debate that Biden and Trump had, he was, as you say, absolutely unhinged four years ago. And it did very much damage his attempt to cling on to the White House. Biden was able to pose as the sober force of continuity, someone who could get the country back on track right in the middle of the pandemic. So if Trump comes out full guns blazing, he's just going to play into a lot of the prejudices that a lot of swing voters have against him that is simply not suitable for a turn to the Oval Office. So that, I think, is the thinking. As you say, though, Donald Trump can change in an instant. He never really behaves in a conventional way. He's shattered every single convention of the presidency, the decorum of campaigning. So I wouldn't put too much stock in this idea that he's going to show up and be meek and presidential.",

Like you said, because itshows a stark contrast for undecided voters between those two men. But as you write in your piece for cnn.com, you say \"Trump is also hedging against a stronger than expected Biden, showing by suggesting his opponent will be, 'jacked up' on drugs to ensure a strong performance.\" And just to add some context here, this is what we've been hearing from Republicans ahead of this debate.

      "sentences": "Well, there's nothing more absurd. Every election cycle than the game of raising and lowering expectations before a debate, Trump, as usual,is taking it to extremes. What you saw there is just how ridiculous a lot of the conservative media coverage is of politics in the United States. I don't think that would be acceptable in most other democracies around the world. But that's the way it is over here. Trump has got himself into a little bit of a problem because he's been, for months, and even years, portraying Biden as completely incapable, someone who's suffering from dementia, who's lost his cognitive ability. And about a week before the debate, it seems to have occurred to the Trump campaign is, you know, what happens if Biden shows up and does OK? We've completely lowered the expectations and walked into the president's trap. So now not only are people on conservative media in the president's campaign, the former president himself suggesting that Biden would have to be on drugs to perform well, they're now saying, well, he's actually a pretty worthy debater. He's been at this ever since President Nixon was in office. We're not underestimating him at all. So they seem to have realized that Trump has walked into a little bit of a trap. None of this really matters if the debate goes badly for Biden, if it goes well for Biden afterwards. But this is what happens before a debate. The underlying question here, though, of course, though, is that a majority of Americans do believe the president is too old to serve a second term. So it's a legitimate, I think, sort of argument for the former president's campaign to make just the way they've gone about it could be counterproductive.",

Florida judge Eileen Cannon is holdingtwo pre-trial hearings today in the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case. The second hearing is expected to begin in the next hour. Special counsel Jack Smith's office will argue over a potential gag order for the former president. Earlier today, Donald Trump's attorney accused Smith's office of being unlawfully funded. Well, democracy, liberalism and political autonomy, some of the biggest issues dominating this historic election year, which I sat down with CNN's Fareed Zakaria to discuss. And these themes and more are also focused on Fareed's latest book, Age of Revolutions, Progress and Backlash from 1600s to the Present, which is out now. I started by asking for it about the geopolitical challenges we face. Have a listen to our discussion. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Xi Jinping talks a great deal about how he doesn't want Western ideas of individualism, liberalism, democracy, liberty. Of course, the Iranian mullahs talk about all the time. So, you know, one of the things I was struck by when doing the research and talking to people about it is the degree to which, you know, you now have an axis that is not just opposed to Western power, but to Western ideas, because they worry that these Western ideas will come into their societies and destabilize their grip on power.",

And we've seen that shift already in the rise of the far right in countries like my own, Portugal, but also Germany.

Imean, it's the strongest it's been in decades. And yet, Biden has the lowest approval ratings of any president in history. And it's because the election is not being contested on economics. It's being contested on culture, on immigration, on work issues. And on those issues, Biden has been playing catch up. He has not found a way to be a commanding presence. The energy is more on Trump's side. I don't know that that'll last. It's a long way to the election. But right now, if you were to look at the polls, you would have to guess that, were the election held tomorrow, Trump would win. And that should give us all, and particularly people in Europe and Asia, foreign ministers, thought about what should they be prepared for. Look, we don't know. Trump is an entirely transactional, narcissistic politician. But his core beliefs do seem to center around two things. One, he thinks that free trade is a bad idea and that it, you know, that it -- the United States gets ripped off. And two, he thinks that other countries piggyback on American security and America gets ripped off. It's a very isolationist, Fortress America mentality. Now, how will that translate? He has, you know, there are other Republicans who disagree with him, even those who support him. Will he be able to enact as he wasn't able to do much about some of these views when he was president the last time around? But it does worry me that his core beliefs are these very isolationists, unilateral views, and it could force countries to have to start thinking to themselves, well, we've got to take care of our own security.
