She, in fact, will jump on another plane to France as she is set to be there for the state visit tomorrow.But the first lady, at the start of the week, spent hours in that courtroom sitting behind hunter Biden. At times, she would have to listen to the re-airing of many of the sorted details of his struggles with addiction. A very tumultuous period for the Biden family. She could also be on hand today when other members of the Biden family testify. Sources have said that the defense could potentially call her granddaughter, Naomi Biden, up to the witness stand. And what the first lady's office has stressed to me is that she wanted to ensure she could be at this trial as much as humanly possible. Her communications director, Elizabeth Alexander, told me last night, \"it's something that a lot of parents, and maybe mothers especially feel, that when your children need you, it doesn't matter how old they get, they're always your children and you always want to be there to support them.\" I think what this also all shows is how central she is to the president and his family. The president has often referred to her as the glue of the family. That is something that you're seeing play out as she continues to maintain this continued presence at this trial of their only living son.",

I would say Doug Burgum actually. Doug, I think, brings a lot to the ticket. I think he's pretty even keel.

So, I think, to Jim's point, I agree with it. I mean I think there are those events where you have to show that you're presidential. I think this is a stage that Biden, if he stays away from kind of, I guess, the Trump playbook, which is to attack the opponents and attack everybody trying to get him or his family in this case with Biden, that he is going to remain even keeled. That, you know, I am the guy that actually can still lead this country in contrast to the other one who's on Dr. Phil and talking about retribution.

Now, a Secret Service agent tells CNN they're anticipating up to 12,000 protesters in the area. President Biden will still be oversees this weekend. Also, a popular YouTuber is facing federal charges for directing this scene, I mean straight out of a video game. Stright out of \"Grand Theft Auto,\" anything like that. Twenty-four-year-old Alex Choi was arrested and after filming this video of an airborne helicopter shooting a moving Lamborghini with fireworks and faces up to ten years in prison if convicted. And a high school football team in northern California gets a big surprise when their practice is quite literally interrupt did by a bear. This video was posted to the team's Instagram with the caption, \"the possibilities at a football practice in Truckee are vast. Snow, lightning, storms, hail or a black bear making its way through the old wetlands of Meadow Lake.\" Thankfully, everyone on the team is OK, but now the Truckee Wolverines can say with confidence they have gone head the head with a bear on the football team. I'm sure all of their dreams are now fully accomplished. Kate.",

Among the world's wealthiest nations, the United States remains the absolute worst when it comes to maternal deaths. A truly failing grade when you see the data given that in some cases the U.S. has a maternal mortality rate double or triple what other wealthy nations experience. Take a look at this comparison. In the United States there are about 22 deaths of pregnant women or new mothers for every 100,000 births. And for black women in America the death rate is much higher, 50 deaths for every 100,000 births. Joining us right now is Christy Turlington Burns. She's the founder and president of Every Mother Counts, an organization with a mission of raising awareness about the maternal health crisis around here in the United States and around the world. And when you compare it -- it's great to see you again, Christy. When you compare it to other nations, Norway serving up -- serving up a maternal mortality rate of zero. We've talked about this for years. This has been the mission of your organization. CHRISTY TURLINGTON BURNS, FOUNDER &amp; PRESIDENT, EVERY MOTHER COUNTS: Yeah.",

And I think the sobering part about this report, which we're so excited about because anything that brings awareness and elevates this issue is really important to us. But when you think about some of the countries that were highlighted, France, Germany, Norway, Sweden, these are the countries that have the best outcomes.And when we look at those examples of what we're not doing here, two of the main things that stand out for us are the lack of integration of midwives. We underutilize that as a cadre of care that is quality and respectful and equitable. And then the other piece is paid leave. You know, all of the countries that are talked about in the report are countries that, you know, a minimum of 14 weeks are offered. In some cases, 86 weeks. Can you imagine? Here in the United States, I think two weeks.",

It's just a deeper, more holistic level that it's very hard for providers to provide that kind of time and care here in the United States.I mean, we have a shortage of all providers here in the United States right now, OB's and midwives.
