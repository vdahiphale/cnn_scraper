Tonight, special counsel Jack Smith ends hiselection subversion and classified documents cases against President-elect Donald Trump. We'll bring you the latest details in just a few minutes. Then a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hezbollah may be closer than ever. We'll be live in the region to discuss the potential path to at least temporary peace. Plus, foreign ministers gather for the G7 in Italy, the Middle East and Ukraine are top of the agenda. But first, breaking news. We're just telling you about special counsel Jack Smith says he will drop the 2020 federal election subversion case and the classified documents case against Donald Trump in filing to dismiss the felony charges facing Trump in the election case. Smith wrote, \"this outcome is not based on merit or strength of the case against the defendant, and he pointed to the Justice Department policy, of course, that bars the prosecution of a sitting President. Trump had vowed to fight, if you remember, Smith, once he returned to the White House next year. Our Jack Cohen -- Zach Cohen, has been following the case and bring us all the latest. So, Zach, talk us through this. Both cases because you know, tossing them both out this -- you know, these are cases that he has been working diligently, doggedly for, for so long for, right? Talk us through this.",

      "sentences": "Yes, sort of the culmination of two years of work by Jack Smith and the federal prosecutorson his team coming to an end. It seems today in the D.C. case, that case that revolves around the criminal charges against Donald Trump for his alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election results. Jack Smith announcing in a filing today that he is moving to dismiss that case, essentially trying to bring it to an end here before Donald Trump is inaugurated. And he makes very clear in this court filing that it is the result of the 2024 election, the one that Donald Trump just won, that has really changed the game for him and the way that this case could ultimately not proceed. Jack Smith writes that Donald Trump will be inaugurated as President on January 20th, and because of the longstanding Justice Department protocol, not to federally prosecute a sitting President, Jack Smith, making the case that he has to end his election subversion case against Donald Trump. But as you mentioned in the intro, Jack Smith also writing that this decision is not because of the merits of the case that he and his team have put together against Donald Trump. He argues that the charges against him and the case that they built that garner those charges are still just as legitimate as they were prior to today's motion to dismiss. In the classified documents case, he similarly cites the 2024 election and Donald Trump's victory in that, saying that Justice Department protocol means that he cannot continue his federal prosecution of Trump. But interestingly, in that case where Donald Trump had two co-defendants, two former employees at his Mar-a-Lago resort, that were also charged with allegedly attempting to obstruct the investigation, the prosecution against them will continue because they, unlike Donald Trump, will not be the sitting President starting on January 20th. So, ultimately, this does mean that Donald Trump is -- the two federal cases against him are effectively over, though, I will note that in both cases, Jack Smith is filing to dismiss without prejudice, which does technically leave the door open for the cases to be reinstated after Trump leaves office.",

I mean, instead, and you pointed this, I'm just going to read it out again, that \"prohibition is categorical and does not turn on the gravity of the crimes charged. The strength of the government's proof or the merits of the prosecution, which the government stands fully behind.\" So, those words quite carried a lot of weight.

      "sentences": "Isa, not surprising at all. I think we all saw this coming. Look, the special prosecutor has a number ofthings to consider at this point in time. The first thing he considered was our country and how difficult it would be for our country to operate in contravention of all established principles at the Department of Justice, to be prosecuting someone who is going to be the sitting President of the United States. And so, he put that ahead of everything else, and he moved to dismiss. Now, both Judge Chutkan and the judges in the 11th circuit have to grant this motion. I see no reason why they wouldn't. And so, these cases will be dismissed as he asked for, without prejudice. He also made a strong point to say in there that, he's not saying anything about the strength or the weakness of the case. That has yet to be determined, that's up to ultimately a jury in any criminal case. But by saying that he is sort of positioning himself for what he expects to come once the former President becomes the sitting President, and any actions might be taken against him as it regards the 11th circuit case, not surprised by his decision there either. Remember there are two other private citizens involved in that matter. He did not move to dismiss his appeal as to those people. However, what remains to be seen is what will happen come January when the Department of Justice changes, and there are new people in the Department of Justice who will be handling that appeal. Will they move forward with it, or will they then seek to dismiss it against those individuals as well? And also, will the then sitting President pardon those two individuals and take care of those criminal cases forever and for all time to come. The one reason the department would continue to move forward is that the issue there is the appointment of special counsel, that's going to come up regardless of who sits in the White House. And that's an issue that is under consideration, and courts have decided one way or the other, most -- not the way that was decided down here in Southern District of Florida as to that issue.

Just yesterday, 250, a really high number, both sides are really ramping up their strikes on each other. And that is typical of what we saw in 2006 just before the two sides signed a ceasefire deal there. So, I think there's that part of it, the atmospherics. But you also have the French-U.S. diplomacy here. You know, the French at the moment saying that there's a possibility that Macron and Biden could co-announce a ceasefire in the coming 36 hours. So, that's part of the mood music, but this different to before. I -- you know, there's a real potential for a political victory here for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. If he can get a deal and get people, all those 60,000 people who were evacuated from the north of Israel back in October last year, get them back. That's a political win for him. So, there's a lot that's shaping this. And I think one of the points you picked up on there, what Itamar Ben-Gvir; National Security Minister said continue with the fight against Hezbollah. That's his message for the Prime Minister. The Foreign Minister has described this deal as one where Hezbollah needs to go back north of the Litani River, 30 miles north of the border. That's the old U.N. agreement. But also, he said that Hezbollah mustn't be able to rebuild and become a force in the region again. That's a sovereignty issue for Lebanon. It's hard to see how Israel can be involved in that. But it does feel despite these points that we're getting close. And we understand that the Prime Minister Netanyahu will  meet with the constituent member parties of his coalition, clearly with an idea to persuade them of why they should vote the way that he wants it to go. And I think his office at the moment is conveying a sense that this will happen. So, I think there's a lot around this at the moment that makes it feel different, it could slip-up, but it seems to be edging close.",

Stephen, let me start the breaking news then that we just heard. We're now hearing the special counsel, Jack Smith, kind of is leaving the door -- the open possibility of charges against Trump could be brought again. And in the filing, I'm just going to read out what it says here. In the 2020 election case, it said, Trump's inauguration sets out our two fundamental compelling national interests. On one hand, the constitution's requirement that the president must not be unduly encumbered in fulfilling his weighty responsibilities. And on the other hand, the nation's commitment to the rule of law and the longstanding principle that no man in this country is so high that he's above the law. You know, as maybe not surprising to many of us that this has come given, of course, the president-elect -- that Trump has won, but what are Americans to make of the news given, you know, the competing interests that, you know, Jack Smith has rights about?",

The American people and President Trump want an immediate end to the political weaponization of our justice system, and we look forward to uniting our country. I mean, the last line should send, perhaps, shivers down the spine of anyone, really, who works in the Justice Department. I mean, we're talking about the weaponization of the Justice Department.

Trump has already said he will fire people, not just Jack Smith, had he still been there, but people inthe Justice Department who helped and who worked for him. He has argued that the Justice Department has weaponized against him, a fact that, you know, doesn't take into account the crimes he's alleged to have committed the most heinous crimes against democracy, if you're trying to defy the will of voters. And just last week he appointed or nominated an attorney general, Pam Bondi, who is on the record as saying prosecutors will be prosecuted, investigators will be investigated. She has openly said that they will try and go after people that investigated Trump, even though they were pursuing the rule of law, they got their indictments through a grand jury and they brought cases in the legal system. But this is a huge victory for Trump and a validation of the strategy of his lawyers to delay all of these cases with the help of many conservative judges until the election. Trump had to do his part, of course, and he won the election. And in one way democracy has spoken because the voters voted for Trump.",

Dominique Pelicot has been on trial alongside 50 men since October. He is accused of arranging for the men to visit his house in Southern France and rape his unconscious wife, Gisele, over a period of nearly 10 years.
