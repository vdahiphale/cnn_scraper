I'm Becky Anderson. This is \"Connect the World\". Your headlines this hour, Hamas confirms one of its commanders was killed in an Israeli airstrike on a U.N. building in Rafah on Wednesday. Italy's competition authority fines TikTok millions for failing to sufficiently protect minors. And next up Donald Trump set to be back in court in Florida. Well, the stock markets open in New York in about 30 minutes time futures indicating a relatively robust start to the trading day the numbers from the Producer Price Index have just dropped, showing wholesale prices actually accelerating a little faster than expected in February jumping six tenths of 1 percent higher than the forecast three tenths of 1 percent doesn't seem to be bothering the markets that much we will check back in as they open bottom of the hour. Well we are moments away from SpaceX is starship rocket latest launch attempt after two catastrophic explosions. Will it be third time lucky for the most powerful rocket ever built? Well, these are live pictures from Boca Chica in Texas where the rocket is on the launch pad and set for liftoff. Two previous attempts as I say last year ended in high altitude explosions. Today's aim is to make it through an hour long test flight before splashdown in the Indian Ocean. The system designed to be fully reusable intended for space exploration and tourism as well as taking astronauts back to the moon as part of NASA's Artemis program. Our CNN Space Expert Kristin Fisher has been following all of this and she joins me now. So let's just set this in context. How critical is today's mission for SpaceX, Kristin? KRISTIN FISHER, CNN SPACE &amp; DEFENSE CORRESPONDENT: It's a big one, Becky and it's one that NASA is going to be watching very closely because they need this rocket it is the centerpiece it is the human landing system for its Artemis program. This is the spacecraft that they're going to use to return NASA astronauts to the surface of the moon for the first time since the end of the Apollo program. And as you know, NASA and the United States believe it is in a race with China to get there and build a base on the south pole of the moon. So that's what's at stake here. SpaceX has made quite a few improvements to this spacecraft since the previous two flight tests ended in those rapid unscheduled disassembles or explosions is most people call it. And it's pretty remarkable that this flight is even happening today, Becky, because SpaceX just got its launch license yesterday at around 5 pm Eastern time, so less than 24 hours ago from the FAA. So, you know, SpaceX has really been saying, we want to move faster. We want to do these test flights in more rapid succession so that we can help NASA achieve its goal of landing astronauts on the surface of the moon within the next few years. SpaceX has said the regulators specifically the FAA are kind of holding us up and slowing us down. So if SpaceX is indeed able to launch today, less than 24 hours after it got its launch license from the FAA. That's going to be a big sign to NASA and members of Congress to say, hey, look, see, we really are we're not waiting on the hardware. The hardware is ready to go. We're really waiting on the FAA and the regulators to give us the green light, Becky.",

And this was on one of the last remaining food distribution centers in Rafah at a time when obviously, hunger is widespread, oftentimes that is turning into famine, and this isn't a one off either. The aid agency, the U.N. aid agency says that some 150 of its facilities have been hit since the war began. And it's not like Israel doesn't know where they are. They are given the coordinates every single day, including in this case as well. And so UNRWA is calling this a blatant disregard for international humanitarian law, while the Israelis are calling it a precise strike that killed a Hamas commander. Only later, when CNN asked did they confirm that precise strike was on an UNRWA food distribution center. Now, the Israelis have also announced plans now to move the 1.4 million people currently taking shelter in Rafah ahead of its planned invasion, it says that it's going to move them to what it's calling humanitarian enclaves elsewhere, and provide food, water, housing and hospital care as well. But a lot of people will hear that and roll their eyes because of course well Israel has failed to get enough aid into this territory already. An Israeli official previously said that it would take two weeks to build up just the troops in that area in order to launch that kind of invasion, how long it takes to move 1.4 million people though. It's really anyone's guess, Becky.",

It didn't hit anything. We're also getting a word of another Houthi missile launch again in the Gulf of Aden again, didn't hit anything. But it really illustrates the danger here. And we know that danger is often being disproportionately carried by Filipino seafarers who make up some 1/5 of the global crew members for commercial ships around the world. They make up the majority of the Galaxy Leader crew that was taken hostage back in November and are still being held hostage in Yemen. And they also make up the majority of the True Confidence crew which was hit last week, resulting in three people killed the very first three people killed. Most of the Filipino survivors of that ship arrived back in Manila this week watch. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MCLEAN (voice-over): This was the burning wreckage of the cargo ship True Confidence after it took a direct hit from a Houthi missile last week. Video from the Indian Navy shows troops winching the stranded crew into a helicopter later tending to injuries. One had burns to his face, and other later had his leg amputated.

MCLEAN (voice-over): New data shared with CNN by maritime security firm Ambrey Analytics shows the extent of the Houthis attacks on commercial ships since November, almost 100 incidents at least 23 of them missile or drone attacks that left physical damage to a vessel. One ship the RUBYMAR was sunk. De Vega believes most of the Galaxy Leader crewmen are still being held on board the ship, which has become a local tourist attraction off the coast of Hodeidah in Yemen. November the Houthis promised to treat the crew members as their guests are in weekly contact with their families is being fed and there is no indication of abuse. De Vega says the only proper treatment is to release them. (END VIDEOTAPE) MCLEAN (on camera): So Becky, international standards dictate that when these crew members go to these designated hostile environments like the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, that they should A, be paid double what they normally are and B, they should be given very clearly the opportunity not to go and instead be repatriated to their home countries at the expense of the company. Now, Eduardo de Vega that Filipino Diplomat you saw there says that in this case, at least early indications are that they were given that chance. But according to the Financial Times, the ownership of that ship changed from American registration to Liberian registration, just days before the attack were carried out. And obviously, that would have put a lot more risk on these crew members. And what is not clear at this point is whether the crew members were aware of that fact, in fact, De Vega says that as a general rule, crew members likely are not aware of the ownership of the ship that they're actually on though, given the risk that they're carrying, especially these days. They should be ideally. We've also reached out to the previous owner, the previous American owners of that ship, Becky that declined to comment for this story.",

This will be a disruptive thing because it's fully reusable, both the booster and the Starship vehicle that will dramatically bring down the price of launching things into orbit and beyond by quite a large factor, more so than I think the lay public realizes. And that's going to be a game changer from launching satellites to having the building the infrastructure to build colonies on the moon or even some kind of basis.

Just 30 seconds away -- excuse me the landing on the booster. You see the fans rotating those hypersonic -- are guiding us through the atmosphere back towards our splashdown site. Again, we're going for a hard split for a splashdown, a soft splashdown. So for landing burn, we're going to expect to see the 13 center engines light, rapidly bring down the boosters velocity and then just the three in the center for splashdown. Let's see if that'll work. Again, if you have a few engines and acquisition of signal, we'll see if we can get some other video of that.

So there's no lag if you will, basically what happens is the starship apps actually flies away from the booster, which is starting to slow down. And of course, that's important because you liked those engines, you keep it from re-contacting. You don't want any kind of collision. But that all looks like it went flawlessly.

And his analogy was look, every time we get on the 737, we don't throw it away after one flight, you know, there would be no airlines. And so we've got to get into that same mode. And of course, all the experts in the field and I have to admit, at the time, I was skeptical too, when he said he's going to recover first stages, actually fly them back and land them either back at the launch site or on a drone ship. And he failed many, many times and learned from all those failures. And finally, now it's routine. And so you're going to see the same thing with the Falcon super heavy that just launched the day, a version of it in the future will also come back and be fully reusable. Starship, you can think of it I mean, it's going to be a space shuttle, it's going to have humans on board one day, it's going to come back and be re-useful. But it's going to be more reusable than the space shuttle it was the space shuttle many parts of it, including the engines had to be pretty much rebuilt in order for it to reasonable. This is disruptive because it's going to be inexpensive.",

Donald Trump's lawyers will ask the judge to dismiss the case. Trump speaking to reporters before entering court. And the judge who is ruling on whether the district attorney handling the Trump election subversion case should be removed tells CNN he expects to make the decision this week. Georgia Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee said quote, I plan to stick to my timeline. Fani Willis is the Attorney responsible for prosecuting Former President Trump and 14 of his co-defendants. Yesterday, Judge McAfee dismissed several of the election subversion charges Trump and his co-defendants were facing. And in other international news just days before Russia's presidential election, Ukrainian forces appear to be sending a message to voters despite what Russian President Vladimir Putin may claim. The war isn't going entirely his way. Over the past two days, at least three Russian oil refineries some of the biggest in the country have come under attack from Ukrainian drones. According to Ukrainian defense sources, a fourth refinery has also been targeted, but for now no official word of Ukrainian involvement. Well, at this oil facility South East of Moscow, at least two people were reportedly injured and Russian officials confirmed a fire broke out overnight and was later put out. According to Ukrainian sources the drone attacks are intended to limit Moscow's oil revenue and in that way, impact the Kremlin's funding for the wall. Well in Nigeria gunmen who kidnapped almost 300 schoolchildren are now threatening to kill them if they are not paid more than $600,000. Last week, our men on motorbikes abducted the kids from this school in Kaduna; while Nigeria's President says the kidnappers will be brought to justice his government is refusing to pay the ransom. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MOHAMMED IDRIS MALAGI, NIGERIA'S INFORMATION MINISTER: Government is not taking any excuses. The president has directed that security agencies must as a matter of urgency ensure that these children and all those who have been kidnapped are brought back in safety and also in the process to ensure that not a dime is paid for ransom.
