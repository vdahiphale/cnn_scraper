He also blamed the Biden administration. He said that the Biden administration was ignoring mental health issues, that instead they were trying to take away guns and put further restrictions on them when instead they should be focusing on mental health. This is what we are expecting to hear from the 2024 contenders. I talked to a number of sources with these various GOP 2024 hopefuls or these already declared candidates, who said that if they're person decides to mention these shootings these recent shootings, that they would be in the in the frame of being a mental health issue, not a gun issue. But it is something we're going to be watching very closely. And it goes to show you, when you look at this lineup of who is coming here today, former President Donald Trump, his former Vice President Mike Pence. It is every major player in major 2024 Republican contender. And it goes to show you just how powerful this voting bloc is. [14:40:58] It is an important voting bloc for Republicans, especially as we see that primary field beginning to take shape. So we're watching today to see how exactly they walk that line. Do they address this recent spate of mass shootings more and more frequent? And do they have any suggestion of how this might work in terms of gun reform? But as I said, from the sources that I am talking to, this will likely be addressed only as a mental health issue, not a gun issue, which, of course, is unsurprising given where we are today.",

      "sentences": "The family of Louisville bank shooter Connor Sturgeon says his brain will be tested for the neurodegenerative brain disease known as CTE.A friend of the family tells CNN surgeon had a history of what has been described as significant concussions while playing sports in high school. They say his condition was so serious, in fact, that he eventually had to wear a helmet to protect his head while playing basketball. The family says it was even known that classmates called him Mr. Concussion. CNN's chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, joining us now. So, Sanjay, we know you have done a lot of work here and a lot of reporting on CTE. What would we expect to find here? What should we know about this? DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, the idea of sort of drawing a cause and effect here between CTE and this sort of -- this sort of behavior is a very challenging thing to do, as you might imagine. CTE itself is something -- you know, I've been working here 21 years. When I first started, CTE wasn't something people really knew much about. We've learned a lot since then. It stands for chronic traumatic encephalopathy. And it's kind of an Alzheimer's-like syndrome that has caused by repeated blows to the head, the concussions that people talk about. When you get a concussion, it's the whole brain that is sort of affected by that, as opposed to a focal area of the brain. And it's that, those repeated blows that have really been associated with concussions. We have a better idea of how this disease progresses over time. There are different stages. And the progression can happen over years. So stage one could be hardly any symptoms at all. Stage two is when people start to possibly have behavioral outbursts, severe depression. Stage three, you get even more symptoms layered on this, including memory loss. Stage four is obviously the most advanced, when you might even have psychotic symptoms. Again, drawing cause and effect here is a very challenging thing to do in all aspects of medicine, but this is well. It's better defined than it was two decades ago, but we're still learning a lot about it.",

Typically, when you -- when you talk about the behavioral sort of associations with CTE, we do talk about violent behavior, impulse control, aggression.Most commonly, Bianna, it is aggression that is directed inward. People are more likely to take their own lives than take someone else's life. That is typically what is seen. And they have been these really tragic stories. Junior Sayout (ph), for example, if someone who comes to mind. But people may also remember people like Aaron Hernandez, for example, and Philip Adams. These are two former football players who were diagnosed with CTE at the time of their death. Philip Adams had severe stage two CTE and Hernandez had stage three. And you remember, I mean, these are people who were charged with murder. You know, Philip Adams killed six people before he killed himself. Aaron Hernandez killed somebody and then killed himself. Again, the cause and effect here very difficult to draw. And I just want to be clear, no one is saying, I think, that even if you have CTE -- and there are a lot of people out there who do worry about this or have been diagnosed or are worried about developing a diagnosis of this -- there's nothing to suggest that they will necessarily have violent behavior like this. But is it a possibility? Yes. Is this something that is going to be used increasingly as possible legal defenses? Yes. So we'll see.

We were part of a group of nearly 1,000 that left the camp you saw there at dawn.But given the lag and how long the journey takes, at any given time, there could be 6,000 people in the jungle, making this particular route. And so far this year, we've seen seven times as many perform this particular trek in the first quarter of this year, as we did in the first quarter of last year. And last year set a record of a quarter of a million people crossing the Darien Gap. So at this rate, we could be looking at well over a million doing it this year. It's important because so many of them are children. Their ultimate destination is the U.S./Mexican border and all the issues that potentially brings for migration into the United States. But also, too, their volume causes them problems themselves. They often end up in traffic jams. Frankly, we ourselves found ourselves caught in hundreds of migrants waiting to get through a particular choke point. The number of them means it's slower. It means they're at greater risk. It means the children are more exposed, potentially, to exhaustion. Have less -- a lack of food, dehydration. So this is a growing problem. And it's one that a cartel on the Colombian and Panamanian border clearly making a lot of money off. They control the Colombian side of the route.

Being a man in his thirties, who sprained his ankle, fellow Venezuelans made a stretcher for him. They have a 12-year-old girl who's disabled, who, a complete stranger, 27, also from Venezuela, carries her for days because her mother has completely underestimated the dangers of the trek. And be it, frankly, the love we saw for a sick kid from Venezuela, Louvar (ph), whose father was trying to carry on despite the enormous respiratory difficulties. We're having strangers were trying to help them out. Everybody was looking out for each other. And it's that remarkable generosity, as I mentioned, that makes you feel what an extraordinary gift these people would be in whatever country they finally settled from.
