And universities across the United States and around the world grappling with how to handle protests over the war in Gaza that full report, is coming up. Plus dozens are killed after heavy rains in Kenya cause a dam to burst we are live in one of those hardest hit areas this hour. Negotiations for a long awaited and desperately needed ceasefire are set to be gaining momentum on what is the U.S. Secretary of State, now seventh visits to the region since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. Antony Blinken meeting with regional foreign ministers and other top diplomats at especial world economic forum meeting in Riyadh. It will all happening, of course, is a Hamas delegation and is meeting with negotiators in Cairo to discuss a new framework for a ceasefire, Blinken, urging Hamas to accept that deal. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: A major effort that's been made over the last couple of months to get to that ceasefire, to get the hostages out. And right now, as you said, Hamas has before it a proposal that is extraordinarily, extraordinarily generous on the part of Israel. And in this moment, the only thing standing between the people of Gaza and a ceasefire is Hamas. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The sources, that question is currently dividing the U.S. State Department. All countries receiving U.S. weapons must make assurances that they are in fact using them in a matter consistent with human rights law. Next week, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken -- tell Congress if he finds Israel's assurances credible. Kylie Atwood joining us with more on this now from the State Department so, Kylie brings us up to speed here in terms of those concerns about how Israel is in fact using these weapons. KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, that's right. So as you said, the State Department our reporting is that they are divided on this topic. There isn't a consensus opinion as to whether the assurances from Israel, that they are using American made weapons in accordance with international law are frankly legitimate. That's according to a State Department official, who spoke with our colleague, Jennifer Hansler. And the context here is that the Biden administration, President Biden signed a national security memorandum late last year that requires all of the countries that are using American made weapons to provide assurances that they are, in fact using those weapons in a credible way. And then the State Department assesses what has been provided to them from those countries. Now, after that is done, it's the Secretary of State who has to make an assessment as to the credibility and reliability of those reports coming from those countries, and then provides his assessment to Congress. That is due next week on May 8, so all of this is going to come to ahead when we see what the final assessment that the State Department provides to Congress actually looks like. And we should know that State Department Spokesperson Matt Miller, when he was asked about this reporting, that there isn't a consensus opinion on this right now, said that the State Department doesn't speak to classified documents that are purportedly leaked out. He also said that when there are these complicated topics, it's not a typical for the Secretary to receive a diverse number of opinions on it. So essentially saying that, you know, dissents from within disagreements are normal when they're trying to determine the right decision on a certain policy, a certain determination. So we'll have to watch and see where this goes. But this is obviously the backdrop, as you guys were just talking about while the Secretary is in Saudi Arabia right now, trying to push ahead, that ceasefire and of course secure the release of more hostages.",

It was when the two came together in some parts of the university when they clashed and when things got violent. They were yelling at each other, they were pushing each other at times. It was violent, both verbally and physically. You know, we were here all day long and saw those tensions and that energy from a lot of these protesters. We spoke to people on both sides of this issue. And you know when I asked about the violence, when I would ask the pro-Palestinian group about the violence that we were seeing, what they kept pointing me to what was going on in Gaza and then when I would speak to the pro-Israeli protesters here and ask them about the violence.

And eventually, yesterday, those protesters were pushed out of campus by those security guards, but we did see campus police in riot gear who were essentially helping those security guards, but they did not get involved with the protesters.

The only reason why it's there is because it was blocked by the fence. There have been frantic search and rescue operations throughout the day to try and pull up survivors so far in this region in Mai Mahiu, just about 30 miles northwest of Kenya. 35 people have been confirmed dead, but the Governor of Nakuru County telling CNN that the actual death toll could be several dozens more. They just don't know for sure, because in this valley down here and heading down that way, they are still people feared still trapped under the rubble and they may not be able to pull them out because they are trying to go to places where they it's easiest to get people out to pull survivors, send them to hospital. This is probably the worst devastation that Kenya has seen since these rains began back in March. Across the nation, more than 100 people have been killed. And the government has had to postpone the reopening of schools for at least a week nationwide to avoid endangering the lives of learners. But here we've met people who've lost family members. One man whose car was slipped down this way said his wife escaped, but he's missing two children and his mother and is not sure where they are. And these are stories you're hearing all across the nation as these rains are forecast to continue.

There's that village near Bakhmut -- that Russia claims to have taken northwest of Avdiivka, Ukraine's commander in chief of the army, Oleksandr Syrskyi of the weekend, also saying that they had to pull back from a cluster of three villages in that area to preserve personnel. So you can see that the momentum in that area northwest of Avdiivka is on the Russian side, they're heading towards higher ground. It's not strategic right now. But it could be and that's not the only area of the frontline where we're seeing them gain momentum up in the Kharkiv region. There are reports that they're progressing in the direction of Kupiansk, that's an area just for context that Ukraine conducted a very successful counter offensive in the autumn of 2022, and has pretty much managed to hold steady since then, with a few small exceptions. So you can see that the difference that these months of delay have made. President Zelenskyy coming out in a press conference just today with Jens Stoltenberg, the NATO Secretary General saying that essentially speed is of the essence that he's not letting up, even with the passage through Congress of that aid bill in keeping the pressure up on the U.S. and his allies to get those weapons to the frontline.

It is of course, on the back foot its first task is to stabilize the front lines and then look ahead to what analysts believe maybe no offensive operations this year, but perhaps moving towards some kind of renewed counter offensive in 2025.
