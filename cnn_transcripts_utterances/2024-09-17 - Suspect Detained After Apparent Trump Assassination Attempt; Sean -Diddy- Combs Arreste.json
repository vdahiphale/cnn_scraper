We're now learning the suspect, Ryan Wesley Routh, may have been laying in wait for nearly 12 hours along the tree line at the Trump International Golf Club before he was spotted by a Secret Service agent and fled in a car.The moment of Routh's arrest a short time later caught on a body cam video. You can see him with his hands up as officers quickly handcuff him. He appeared in court Monday and was charged with two federal gun related crimes. Officials say additional charges may be possible. The Secret Service says the suspect did not have a line of sight on Trump and the Palm Beach County sheriff says the suspect, quote, \"didn't even get close to getting a round off.\" Trump is praising the Secret Service and other law enforcement for their actions and is publicly recounting what appears to be a second attempt on his life. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I was playing golf with some of my friends who was on a Sunday morning, and very peaceful, very beautiful weather. Everything was beautiful. Nice place to be. And all of a sudden we heard shots being fired in the air. And I guess probably four or five, and it sounded like bullets, but what do I know about that? But Secret Service knew immediately they were bullets. And they grabbed me. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They probably to get a picture of him as a person because sometimes we know that online persona could be different than the person. So they're doing both of those things to develop a bigger picture of who he was. I mean, it's a political assassination. So the implied motive is always in a political assassination as always you don't want that person to ascend to power or you want them out of power. I mean, Hinckley was a one-off because he shot Reagan because he was obsessed with an actress and so that was I think an outlier.

He brought food with them. He brought everything he needed to carry out this attack. So, I mean, I think that the security at the golf course was probably not an issue because, you know, golf courses are huge. I live on a golf course here in California. I mean, you couldn't possibly encapsulate it. You know, they had a fence up. He was outside that fence pointing the rifle through the fence, and like I said, he went in under the cover of darkness.

These cases can be very complex.The allegations involved from the civil lawsuits involve multiple locations. They involve multiple people.

So there's some inconsistency in the ways in which these governments have been responding.Chancellor Scholz of Germany just recently signed a deal with the Kenyan government to bring thousands of workers to Italy through legal paths and to perform work in a labor economy in which there are significant shortages. So in fact, I think really the question is, there's more of an anti-immigration crisis in Europe today, and we've been -- we've seen far-right political groups shaping elections and discussions around these questions in Europe for over a decade now. And it seems that opposition leaders been unable or rather leaders have been unable to kind of counter these narratives, and instead are going down the road of pandering and kind of mainstreaming these particular groups. And what we see across the board is a kind of scapegoating of immigrants and blaming them for the social ills that the countries are facing rather than tackling the real issues at hand.

And here we are, all these years later, now in the recent election, yes, Keir Starmer's center, center left government won, but the party that came third was of course Nigel Farage's Reform Party, an outgrowth of the UKIP and Brexit Party with, you know, 14 percent of the vote.So that immigration question is still extraordinarily important. What is so complex about what Keir Starmer doing here is that the scale of the question he's talking about when it comes to immigration in the U.K. and the crossings of the channel compared to the Mediterranean just simply don't compare. Secondly, the vast majority of people that come into the U.K. do so through legal paths, to study and to work in those particular areas. And he himself struck down the Rwandan deportation scheme which was the scheme by the previous government to deport migrants and have them processed in Rwanda. And what he's talking to Meloni here, the prime minister of Italy, about is the contract deal that she's just signed with Albania to take migrants that are rescued in the Mediterranean and to process them offshore and to outsource the control over migration to a third party country in which human rights record is appalling. So there's a huge contradiction here and as much as he's claiming to do this out of sort of interest for the question and so on, the fact is that he is ramping up anti-immigration rhetoric and encouraging a kind of security response rather than dealing with the humanitarian issues. And even one could argue, yet again, instrumentalizing the question of migration and making into a problem that it actually really is not when it comes to contemporary U.K. society, Lynda.",
