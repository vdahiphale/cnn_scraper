Look, there is an impression in this country that Liz Truss is a prime minister who is no longer in control of her own government, and yesterday, she didn't do a whole lot to dispel that notion.Her brand-new chancellor, on the job for only a few days, stood in the House of Commons to announce that almost all of the measures that were announced in her now-infamous mini-budget were being scrapped. So that now includes a planned basic income tax cut, a planned cut to the dividends tax, a planned income tax cut for the highest earners, and a plan to cancel corporate -- a corporate tax hike. So the estimated total savings here is about $36 billion U.S. dollars -- money that the government hadn't actually accounted for in the first place. Now, some smaller, less expensive items did survive the cull, but even her very signature promise to subsidize energy bills -- that is only going to survive in its current form until April. The markets, though -- they seem to like this. The U.K. stock index -- the FTSE 100 -- it was up. The pound gained ground against the dollar as well. It's almost at the level that it was when Liz Truss first took office now. But all of this leaves Liz Truss in a pretty awkward position because the signature campaign promises that got her -- that won her the leadership in the first place have clearly not worked. She is now having to rely on the ideas that were campaigned on by her leadership opponent, Rishi Sunak. And so, a lot of people in this country are asking the question what is the point? A handful of conservative MPs have already called for her resignation. A recent poll shows that the opposition Labor Party is twice -- twice, Christine, as popular as the conservatives. And just this morning, a junior cabinet minister was asked how many chances Liz Truss has left, and his answer was not very many -- Christine.",
