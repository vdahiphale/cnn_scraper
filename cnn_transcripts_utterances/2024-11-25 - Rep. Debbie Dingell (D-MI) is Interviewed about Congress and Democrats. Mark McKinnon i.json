The issue centers around Delaware Congresswoman-elect Sarah McBride. McBride is set to become the first openly transgender lawmaker to serve in Congress when the new term begins in January. But just two weeks after her election, Republican Congresswoman Nancy Mace introduced a new rule effectively banning McBride from using women's restrooms on Capitol Hill. Mace posting about the topic more than 300 times on social media in a span of a couple of days. This weekend, McBride pushed back. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP.-ELECT SARAH MCBRIDE (D-DE): I didn't run for the United States House of Representatives to talk about what bathroom I use. I didn't run to talk about myself. I ran to deliver for Delawareans. And while Republicans in Congress seem focused on bathrooms and trans people and specifically me, I'm focused on rolling up my sleeves, diving into the details, setting up my office, and beginning the hard work of delivering for Delawareans on the issues that I know keep them up at night.

They have a very slim majority in the House and in the Senate, which is going to make it difficult, I fear - or not I fear, because we're going to stop them on - if they're doing bad legislation.What I really want to see us do is work on the problems that Americans care about every single day. And I will work across the aisle with them. But we - it's not one little thing, Kasie, it's many things. I mean, we clearly have - the Democratic Party's got to talk to men better.

Let's, you know, elections have consequences, as Obama said, and let's let this roll on.And I think that this appointment process with Trump has been an interesting example. I mean, it's - I think it's surprising a lot of people. There's - you know, no matter what side of the aisle you're on, when you look at his appointments, there's something for everybody to love and something for everybody to hate. And what I'm really struck by is the speed. You know, we talked before about how Trump was really an accidental candidate in 2016. And it reminds me of the movie \"The Candidate.\" During the last scene you remember Robert Redford turns around after he surprisingly wins and goes, what do we do now? Well, that's not the case this time for Trump. And what I'm really struck by is the speed with which, you know, all the appointments are already made. We're two and a half weeks in, and the major appointments are made, which is surprising. And to some degree, the Gaetz thing really kind of worked for them because it just became that shiny object. It's like, OK, you know, we got that out of the way. We got the big controversy out of the way. And, sort of, you know, made a few people mad, made a few people happy. But it's out of the way.
