You're the fourth generation of your family to call Memphis home. How is your city doing today? REP. STEVE COHEN (D-TN): I think the city is doing pretty well. It's been an unnerving experience to see one of our fellow citizens who was such a nice, innocent, free spirited young man murdered by the Memphis Police Department. My first job out of law school was working as a civilian attorney for the Memphis Police Department nearly 50 years ago. And I taught officers in the academy, I worked on cases that were disciplinary actions. And so I know the police department. At least I knew it 50 years ago. It's much better than it was. It still needs a lot more work. We've got a new U.S. attorney. We've got a new district attorney general and a new chief of police. And they've done an excellent job of getting on this early and showing that the city and the federal government with its location here in West Tennessee want to bring about justice. And the federal government wants to help and will help. I know that. But it's unnerving and it's terribly sad.",

There were at least four other officers on the scene that stood around and did nothing. The duty to render aid is a major part of a police officer's job to protect and serve. And those officers did not do that. [19There were probably other officers involved. There was an officer back at the scene who was, I think, a sixth member of the Scorpion Unit who didn't go to the scene. He was the person who drove up in the first video that had his body camera -- camcorder working. And he said, I hope they stomp him. I'm afraid what he said was indicative of the attitude of the Scorpion Unit and maybe police in general, but more likely the Scorpion Unit specifically to take their aggressions out and take the law into their own hands. And this is always wrong. So I think -- I don't know how they've been trained. I'm sure they've been trained well, but I don't know if this group particularly learned their lesson and they acted on basically blue testosterone and ego. But it started with that. When they grabbed him out of the car, it wasn't, excuse me -- excuse me, but show us your driver's license. And why did you run that light or why did you run out of the lane or whatever? We saw them all giving what probably were George Santos type descriptions of what occurred earlier when they were saying we did out of traffic, he was in the wrong lane, he reached for my gun. These were alibis that they were posting knowing they were videoing and they were laying out their defense. And I couldn't trust any one of them because they didn't take their oath of office to heart and they just beat him to hell. And there were three of them, two of them, one kicked him, one punched him and one hit him with a stick, a baton, and the other two helped. All five are rotten apples. And I commend the police chief for doing what she did. But she and Mayor Strickland, both of whom, want to do right. They had the toughest job of coming forward. They need to clean the department of bad apples. They need to get intensive training. They need to make sure de-escalation comes first. I've had a bill for about eight years in the Congress that George Floyd saying that we need to have training of officers in other ethnic differences and to look at de-escalating intense situations. The Memphis Police Department trains, but they need to make it more of a regular part of the curriculum that is undertaken and observed, and protocol taken out by the officers to deescalate. There was no effort to deescalate.",

The federal government has monies available starting this next spring with grants the Memphis Police Department should apply for to hire officers in high population areas. We need to have more money to pay officers so we can get a better grade of officer. And we had some differences with the police association over compensation, over health benefits, over retirement benefits. And a lot of police officers left Memphis and went to higher payingjobs in Dallas and other cities that could afford to pay more. We need to be able to pay more and compete with other cities to get the best and brightest. I don't know if these five guys, they certainly were hired more recently when the benefits were the least. So we may not be getting the cream of the crop. Obviously they were not the cream of the crop. That's one. And then secondly, you just have to have more intensive training and you have to have better supervision. Your commanders have to stress this. I'd like to see a return of the old community oriented policing where the neighborhoods know the policemen. The police people, women and men, are in the communities making friends, helping people and getting tips. And we don't do enough of that. Rather, we have Scorpion Units out to pounce on people. I mean, they pounced on him when he got out of the car. Throwing him. They were so nervous, you wonder if they were hyped up on something. They were out of control and not very professional at all. But we need to have officers the neighborhood knows, and who know the neighborhood. And I think that's a more effective manner of policing.",

It's always relevant to have the discussion. Race plays a major part in policing, and there's no doubt about that. But what we have seen with this beating is the manifestation of toxic police culture and a mob mentality.

They believe, partly perhaps as a campaign to draw their forces away from the other focus of Russian violence, which has been the City of Bakhmut, and also part of that ongoing campaign to try to capture what remains in Ukrainian hands of the rest of Donetsk Province. So this will come in at a time when the Ukrainian Ambassador to France says that, in his estimation, there's now some 300-plus tanks that have been promised by NATO and other Western allies to the Ukrainian war effort. Now, some of these may arrive in a matter of weeks. Many of them, though, will be months away, and it is not yet clear whether they are going to be able to come and bring them in quickly enough to make a significant difference, either to Ukrainian potential plans to conduct a counteroffensive, to try to retake territory captured by Russians in the last 11 months, or indeed to defend against what is expected to be a new Russian offensive in the spring -- Pam.",

Both attacks took place in your places of worship; one at a synagogue, the other at a mosque. The suspect in the second attack is a 13-year-old boy. A local community leader says he was neighbors with the 16-year-old who was shot and killed by Israeli Police earlier this week. And still ahead for you on this Saturday, my conversation with the US Surgeon General and Senator Chris Murphy together, why they are worried about the erosion of community in our country and how they believe it is fueling loneliness. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHRIS MURPHY (D-CT): We have lost something as a society as so much of our life has turned into screen to screen communication. (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [19:47:52] BROWN: Followers just aren't the same as family. It is something we all know, but it is easy to forget with all the time we spend online. And as we spend more time on screens and less in our communities, the cost is becoming more apparent. I sat down with Senator Chris Murphy and Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy, to address how this loss of connection is something that may be fueling the in America. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

It is a signal or body sends us, a natural signal when we are lacking something that we need for our survival, and that is exactly human connection. It is something we need for our survival.Many people have felt lonely, and many may not feel comfortable admitting it, but almost all of us have had that experience and some people may manifest it as sadness or withdrawal. In others, it may manifest is irritability or anxiety. It shows up in different ways. Many of us often know when something is off. What I would recommend people do is a couple of things. One is to remember that small doses of human connection can make a big difference. Even spending two minutes, three minutes on the phone with someone you love, just to say I'm thinking about you, I want to know how you're doing makes a difference, picking up the phone, when somebody calls, even if you don't have time to talk to them, even for 10 seconds to say, you know what, I don't have time right now, but I'll call you back.",

      "sentences": "But it turns out, it makes a huge difference in how you feel, and one last thing which is often underappreciated is the power of service. It turns out when we help other people, that helps strengthen our sense of connection, not only to them, but our connection to ourselves.You know, as Senator Murphy was mentioning, when we lose our sense of self-worth, when we don't think we have value, that is when we start becoming disconnected from who we really are. But when we serve other people, we remind ourselves that we have value to bring to the world. So that is why kindness and generosity and service and love are really the bedrock upon which we have to rebuild connection in our lives and in society.",

We have lost something, as a society, as so much of our life has turned into screen to screen communication. It just doesn't give you the same sense of value and the same sense of satisfaction as talking to somebody or seeing someone. And so I think that is just a really important reminder is that you've got to make sure to the extent you can that you build into your day, time to spend in person, preferably even on the phone with people that you work with, with people in your family. I just think we're learning that it's not a coincidence that we are a lonelier society, the more and more of our time that we're spending online or looking at screens.",
