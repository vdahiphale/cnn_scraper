We just had Ro Khanna on, who mentioned you and your book. So, it's clearly got everyone's attention, even including those in Congress who are talking about this. I want to ask you about, just first of all, the surgeon general's warning label that would warn parents of these harms of social media.

JONATHAN HAIDT, AUTHOR, \"THE ANXIOUS GENERATION\": That's right. So, we kind of got tricked into letting our kids develop a phone-based childhood because the millennial generation in the 1990s, they grew up with computers and the internet and they were fine. And it was exciting. Almost all of these things start out nice. TikTok. Everything starts out nice, but it gradually gets taken over by people with bad intent and it - most of them become harmful. So, between 2010 and 2015 is when everything changes for American kids. They go from having flip phones, which they used to text and call each other, to having smartphones with front-facing cameras, high-speed internet. They can be online all day.

I mean the death toll, the suffering toll, is so much greater than any consumer product.
