I'm Becky Anderson, in London.And we are following breaking news out of Iran for you, where the government is expressing condolences over the deaths of President Ebrahim Raisi and the country's foreign minister and seven others in a helicopter crash. Now, the bodies of those killed will be transported to a staging area in the city of Tabriz. Iranian officials say the helicopter with nine people on board ran into trouble amid heavy fog on Sunday afternoon. Images of the crash site in Iran's east Azerbaijan province show the remote mountainous area where the aircraft went down. The president and other officials have been attending an inauguration ceremony of a new dam near the border with Azerbaijan. Iranian state TV is airing Islamic prayers between news broadcasts after word of the president's death and the country's supreme leader is vowing there will be no disruption in Iran's work. Well, Ivan Watson following regional reactions from Hong Kong. First, let's bring in Paula Hancocks with more from Abu Dhabi and we are just, Paula, getting the first images of the removal of the bodies from the crash site. What more do we know at this point?",

      "sentences": "That's right, Becky, we're hearing this and seeing this from the Iranian Red Crescent that they are transporting the bodies from that location where the helicopter crashed and taking them to the closest city of Tabriz.At this point, they say now that the official search and rescue operation is over and now it is moving really towards a mourning period in Iran itself. Now, we have heard from the Iranian government. There was an urgent meeting of the government a little earlier this Monday morning. And what we did see as well was the seats where President Raisi usually sits had a black sash across the chair to show mourning as well. Now, we heard from the government saying they expressed their condolences over the deaths of the nine people on board, saying they praised President Raisi as hardworking and tireless and specified there wouldn't be the slightest disturbance in the administration of affairs in Iran. Now, there were nine people on board this helicopter. It was part of a three helicopter convoy that had moved from the area close to the border with Azerbaijan. And we know that two of those helicopters did land safely. But the helicopter that was carrying the president, it was carrying the foreign minister, one of the local governors, also an imam, security officials, pilots and crew did, we can see their crash into the side of a mountain. Now, it is an area that is very mountainous. It is an area that is inhospitable when it comes to transport. And we have heard from the rescue teams themselves over those 16 hours that it took them to find this location, that it was extremely difficult conditions. There was low fog, there was very little visibility, the temperatures were lower than they usually are at this time of the year. In fact, the rescue teams themselves said that they couldn't put a helicopter into the air to try and help them with the search because it was simply too dangerous. So that really speaks to the conditions that this helicopter was flying in. In fact, Turkey, giving the use of a heat drone certainly helped in the search and rescue initially. But conditions will certainly be one thing that is looked at closely when it comes to the investigation. Becky.",

And taking a look at Iranian state media, you can already hear anchors dressed in black television presenters talking about stability right now, about how the Islamic revolution is not just one person. This is a tragedy. This is a setback that Ebrahim Raisi is a martyr to be mourned, but that the Islamic Republic of Iran is stronger than that and will move forward. So that's one of the messages that's being sent by the government.The constitution spells out that the vice president, who was not elected in 2021, he was appointed and is, you know, relatively speaking, a little known individual named Mohammed Mokhtar. He will serve as a kind of interim president while a council of the heads of the three branches of government, the judiciary, the parliament, and now this interim president, they will be tasked with setting up elections in some 50 days' time. Important to stress that Ebrahim Raisi was not the most powerful individual in the Iranian government. That, of course, is the supreme leader Ali Khamenei, who himself is an octogenarian. There has been speculation about his succession plan somewhere down the road. Instead, the succession now for the president has been hastened as a result of this tragic turn of events.",

That is the supreme leader's position and the sort of the security infrastructure who effectively, you know, let's be quite clear, run national security and the ideological direction of this country.So let's just concentrate there for a moment. I think what you're saying here, it's safe to assume there will be no change to the ideological direction of this country, nor will the loss of these two men, the president, the foreign minister, have a huge impact on Iran's influence around the region and the wider world, correct?",

And also, obviously, the strategic direction of the country is directed by the supreme leader in his office.I think the more serious thing for the regime is the questions that will be asked by people about how this happened. I mean, why they were traveling, as has been said, in such aged, sort of, equipment, you know, the helicopters, why they were traveling actually in the fog in a mountainous area. I mean, these sort of things are going to be rife conspiracy theories in Iran, as you know, which don't need much to get going. So people will start to ask questions about how this happened and what it means actually about the way in which the country operates, what the state of its economy is, what the state of the administration is. So I think a lot of these things will start to come out. And you're already seeing things on social media and other sources in Iran, where people are beginning to question what this tells us about the Islamic Republic itself and its current situation.",

      "sentences": "Well, my own view is, is that if the regime is sensible, of course, they will try and speed through a succession fairly quickly and run some sort of mock election. I mean, they won't want to bring crowds out onto the street. I mean, you're quite right about that. They won't want to run an election, so to speak. If anything, it will be an even more lackluster election than the one that got Raisi into office in the first place and the subsequent parliamentary elections.So they'll want to make this quick, simple, clean, avoid any possible opportunity for crowds to get out on the street. But I think the damage about all this and the questions, it just sort of reinforces a sense among the wider population of the general malaise that's afflicting the Islamic Republic. I mean, this is important. And if you think about it in the context of the recent confrontation with Israel, where they made a lot of tub-thumping noises about how powerful they were as a regional player, this actually dents that argument somehow. I mean, it doesn't look good for them. And at the end of the day, I think the longer term problems for the regime are probably going to be more serious than any immediate consequence. But we know from even the reactions of some people in Iran that, you know, Raisi's death is not being widely mourned. So let's put it that way. I mean, there are people who are not at all unhappy about what's happened.",

And he's a similar, if anything, has got even more puritanical views than Abdullahian had, I mean, in the sense of his ideological convictions are pretty tight with the regime. So I actually see in the foreign ministry side of things probably much less change really going on. I mean, I think the continuity there will be pretty seamless.",

And this is one of the biggest conglomerates that reports directly to the Supreme Leader, is not subject to tax or excise. It carries tremendous political and economic weight because it has the Supreme Leader behind it. And Mr. Mokhber was one of the people running it. And this is where he comes from. He's somebody who's very trusted by the Supreme Leader. But, again, these are not people who are going to, who have a vision, who are people who are going to change things or are going to envision some new way to develop Iran's economy. Their job is most importantly to follow the orders of the Supreme Leader. As somebody once said, you know, the Supreme Leader says where the rails or the track goes, and their job is to just put the rails there. And this is his job. He's not going to be somebody who's going to change things much. And he and the vice president, the speaker of the parliament, Mr. Ghalibaf, and the head of the judiciary, Mr. Ejraei, for the next 50 days are going to arrange a new presidential election, which will have to be held by, if I'm not mistaken, 8th of July.",

There was also artillery shelling in that area, and it's been going on for about a week now.The last fully functioning hospital in that part of Gaza says that there were dozens of bodies that came in and many more injured. But some of those wounded ended up dying because they say that they are running out of supplies. They simply do not have everything that they need. The IDF also says that it hit dozens of targets in and around the Rafah area. We know, of course, at last word that there have been some 800,000 people who have fled Rafah searching for safety in other parts of the territory. Some have gone to that humanitarian zone along the coast. But given the lack of infrastructure to accommodate that volume of people, many others have gone elsewhere. And an overnight strike in the early hours of yesterday morning that killed some 35 people at last count really shows just how difficult it is to find any measure of safety right now in Gaza. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MCLEAN (voice-over): Put the blanket up. It's a woman, rescuers say, as they recover a body from the rubble of a collapsed building. People in the Nuiserat refugee camp in central Gaza say an Israeli airstrike hit around 3 a.m. Sunday morning. Eyewitnesses say they only heard a single explosion. It was big enough to leave five houses mostly flattened. Suddenly, while we were asleep, an airstrike hit, this man says. Some were killed, some were injured and others are still under the rubble. We were displaced from Rafah and came here to find safety. As bombing and ground campaigns ramp up in parts of northern Gaza and in Rafah in the south, central Gaza is where scores of people have fled to find refuge. Many have found none. This is safety. You can film around you all of the safety, he says. This is a genocide. They're killing the Palestinian people and the Palestinian cause. That's what they're doing. There was no prior warning, says this woman who's searching for her sister's body. She says she already lost her mother and three other family members in a similar strike in October. With only basic tools, rescue efforts are painstakingly slow. It's very difficult to pull out people alive from under the rubble. We try to do what we can with our own hands, he says. Onlookers watch as bodies are pulled out one by one, first a woman, then two Children from the same building. Inside the morgue, bodies cover the floor. Some literally piled on top of one another. According to the local hospital, the strike killed dozens, including women and Children. Many more were injured and some are still missing. The IDF did not comment on this specific strike beyond insisting it follows international law as it tries to dismantle Hamas. The renewed military push has throttled even more aid deliveries and made finding enough food even harder. The American built floating pier is receiving its first trucks packed with aid. But on Saturday, they didn't get far. People managed to climb aboard the convoy, spilling boxes onto the side of the road. Some people were even willing to fight for whatever was inside. We want to eat. We're hungry. We've become poor, this man says. Enough with this misery. A second convoy was completely swarmed. Within minutes, all of the boxes are gone. Why are you filming? This woman asks. Perhaps to show the world just how desperate the people of Gaza have become after seven months of war. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Of course, we know that he discussed the usual U.S. Talking points on Rafah and on aid when he met in Israel with the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.But he also brought up what seems to be a sore spot not only between the U.S. And Israel, but also between Netanyahu and his opposition rival, Benny Gantz. And that is connecting the military operation for some kind of an end game and a day after plan that does not involve the status quo of Israeli control. Kristie.",

They are trying to undermine his credibility and trying to persuade the jurors not to believe what he told them about the hush money payments to the adult film actress Stormy Daniels.The defense at that point, when they're done with Cohen, the prosecutors will get another bite at the apple. They'll be able to pose some questions to him as well. But after five weeks of testimony, they don't have any other witnesses to call. They are going to, at that point, rest their case. And then it's on the defense. They can put on a case. They can put on some witnesses if they want. But they don't have to. The burden is, of course, on the prosecutors to affirmatively prove their case to the jury. So, they may have one or two witnesses on the defense side. Donald Trump's lawyers have not said definitively whether or not he is going to testify in his own defense. It is possible, but seems rather unlikely. Looking later into the week, the judge has signaled that closing arguments could begin as soon as Tuesday. Then, of course, there would be jury instructions. And then what we've all been waiting for, jury deliberations. Not exactly sure which day that would begin, but the end is near for this historic trial, the first ever trial of a former U.S. president. Marshall Cohen, CNN, New York. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
