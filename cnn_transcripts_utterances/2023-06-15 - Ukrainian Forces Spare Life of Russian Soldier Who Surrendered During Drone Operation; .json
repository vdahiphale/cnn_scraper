According to The Post, Trump Lawyer Chris Kaise, who is still a member of Trump's defense team, wanted to strike a deal with the Justice Department last fall, this as an attempt to try to help Trump avoid charges that could put him in prison for decades.Now, this plan was allegedly crafted after the FBI found more classified documents during the August FBI search at Mar-a-Lago. But Trump ultimately rejected the advice. And we should note that CNN spoke to sources close to Trump's legal team who are casting doubt on whether there was ever really an opportunity to settle. Also, just into our newsroom, a new rally is now on the books for Trump. The 2024 GOP frontrunner will host a campaign event in Pickens, South Carolina on July 1st. It is his first rally since being federally indicted. Let's now bring in CNN's Paula Reid now for more on what else CNN is learning. Good morning, Paula. Paula, we also just heard from within the last day or so A.G. Merrick Garland. What is he saying?",

I mean, they have been under relentless attack by the former president, who has been ramping up his rhetoric in the wake of this indictment.The attorney general also emphasizing how the special counsel operates independently. Under the regulations, the point of a special counsel is to take over an investigation where the Justice Department could have a conflict of interest. They operate under the same rules as the Justice Department, but, ultimately they are an independent body. And while they do technically answer to the attorney general, the Garland staff has repeatedly said over the past few months they like to remind us that under the regulations, any prosecutorial decision by a special counsel is granted broad deference by the attorney general. And if any decisions are overruled by the attorney general, he has to inform Congress. And, Rahel, I think that's part of an effort to prepare people, right, to try to insulate the Justice Department from these attacks about partisanship, emphasizing that, look, if Trump wasn't indicted, that wasn't likely to be Garland's decision. And if he was, that was also likely to be a decision that came from Smith. But it's, of course, highly unlikely that even Garland's remarks are going to stop the relentless attacks from former President Trump and his allies.",

That's a 1978 law that prioritized the placement of Native American children in the foster care and adoption system, prioritizes placement with Native American families.So, this was the case of a couple out of Texas saying that this law should have been tossed out on equal protection grounds. They said they were trying to adopt two Native American children, but they were effectively blocked from this adoption because of this law that prioritizes the placement of the children with Native American tribes or families. That is the utmost priority under this law. So, the Supreme Court today not ruling with that Texas family that was trying to get custody of these two Native American children, instead upholding this law that has been in existence since 1978. And, John, when this law was passed, it really was looking to preserve tribal sovereignty. It was discovered around the time this law was passed that too often Native American children, when they were placed into the adoption or foster care system, were being placed with white families, non-Native American families. So, this law was an effort to really protect the sovereignty of tribes, and the Supreme Court today preserving that law and rejecting the challenge to it. John?",

This company had gotten a hold of the coordinates of those private reefs and were actually selling those coordinates.So, an Alabama fisherman who was actually very upset about this, he hacked into the computer systems and basically said to the company, I'm going to start telling people that you're selling the coordinates of the reefs that they've paid a lot of money for. [10:20:00] He was brought to trial. He was convicted. However, his argument was that the government had brought his case in the wrong venue. The lower courts had said, no. Even if venue was wrong, your case still stands. The question was, and this touches a little bit on the special counsel's case, if you bring a criminal case in the wrong venue, in the wrong place, in the wrong jurisdiction, can the criminal case be completely tossed out or should it just be retried? The fisherman in here, the fisherman in this case, wanted the case to be completely thrown out, but the Supreme Court stepping in today to say, no, even if a criminal case is brought in the wrong venue, it can still be retried. This might have been on the mind of the prosecutors in the Trump indictment when they decided to bring this case in Southern Florida for fear that they would bring it in the wrong venue. But now, the Supreme Court saying, even if you do bring it to the wrong venue, prosecutors, you don't need to toss the case out. You can retry it in the correct venue. John?",
