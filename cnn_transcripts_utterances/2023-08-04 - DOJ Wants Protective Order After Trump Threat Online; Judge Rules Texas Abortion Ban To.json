Our breaking news this hour, Special Prosecutor Jack Smith is reacting to this threat from former President Donald Trump on Truth Social today. It says it right there, quote, \"If you go after me, I'm coming after you.\"Now, the special prosecutor is asking for a protective order, saying if Trump began posting details from grand jury transcripts, it could have a chilling effect on witnesses. Remember, this is just 24 hours after his arrest and arraignment in his third indictment over election interference and after the judge warned him against making threats. Let's go straight to John Dean. He's a former Nixon White House counsel. John, you and I have spoken about this, Donald Trump so many times. But, you know, as I was discussing with one of our producers before this program got started, in the past, you know, we would talk about Donald Trump's tweets and his social media posts and wonder what the impact might be. But it sounds as though the special counsel in this case, Jack Smith, is really seizing on this very inflammatory, threatening-sounding post from Donald Trump on Truth Social and alerting it to the judge. The government arguing that the restrictions that they're seeking are necessary to prevent Trump from publicly disclosing sensitive discovery information. Can you walk us through what this means?",

This is not the sort of norm that they're used to dealing with.But we also all know, after watching Trump for many, many years now in court proceedings, particularly those where he's a target, uh, that he likes to play the bad boy, he likes to threaten, he likes to control witnesses, he likes to tell prosecutors -- call them nasty names. And Jack Smith is going to call out to the judge's attention and see if they can get some restrictions. They can't zip him up, but they are going to make sure that all those documents that he gets are in the hands of his lawyers, and his lawyers are responsible and not going to let him have them other than to prepare his defense.",

Congressman, I suppose this newfound love for the First Amendment, free speech, free press means we can get cameras in the courtroom for the Trump trial that's coming up in this case. You're roughly -- you're one of roughly three dozen House Democrats who signed a letter calling on Trump's trials to be televised to the public, arguing -- quote -- \"If the public is to fully accept the outcome, it will be vitally important for it to witness as directly as possible how these trials are conducted.\" Let's talk about this. Why is it so important for you? REP. BRENDAN BOYLE (D-PA):  This will be perhaps, and I know this sounds like hyperbole, but I genuinely believe this will perhaps be the most important criminal trial in American history. So, in my view, we need to let the sunshine in. We need to do our very best to defeat any sort of conspiracy theories that are going to be spread about what is going on in the court proceedings. And we do know who is the chief among those who will be creating a lot of those legends and myths about what allegedly happens in that courtroom. The best way to do that is to ensure that we are all able to see exactly what happens in court day after day. I genuinely believe this is in the national interest.",

This is deadly serious. We need to make sure we have those cameras in there.

Wade, which eventually happened with Dobbs, and what they said was that there would be some medical exceptions.But they are arguing now it was not clear. What does it mean to have this life-threatening condition? What does it mean to have the substantial risk of harm or fatality? This is what these women who brought this case against (INAUDIBLE) were very concerned with. Listen, they said, we don't have clarity. In the event that somebody does, in fact, have a qualifying medical condition that would allow them to meet that medical exception requirement, the doctors are busy trying to figure out if they're going to have liability if they get it wrong, if they somehow do not understand what the definition is or they're questioning. Meanwhile, the woman is actually suffering and could otherwise be legitimately able to have that exception. That's the crux of this issue. So, the judge is saying, look, in the absence of the clarity, you cannot essentially have this go into full effect. The result of this, of course, is that they're saying, this is not like the other case. By the way, I want to distinguish, there is the other perhaps more even controversial decision which said you could have a private enforcement mechanism, remember this, where an everyday person, a civilian, could actually try to bring a lawsuit against somebody involved in an abortion. This is not that. This is about the medical exception. The judge has decided now that that was too restrictive, it lacked clarity and it put women in an unfair position, and compromised the integrity of a doctor and their ability to decide what is medically necessary.",

First, I've got to say that those remarks from Donald Trump just sound foolish and absurd. He is, in fact, one of the key reasons why we are in this war, why Russia attacked Ukraine under the belief that there would be no consequence, no cost, because of his capture of the Republican Party, and therefore he could get away with an easy, quick victory. Of course, it is music to Putin's ears to have Donald Trump return to power. It's a significant miscalculation. A hope and a prayer, really, is what he's -- at this point is what he's relying on because his military is not achieving its objectives in Ukraine. And he's looking for a favorable outcome in political elections here in the U.S. and overseas, and hoping to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. That is a long shot to gamble on. He's -- this is going to cost his military and his nation hundreds of thousands of lives because we're talking about another year in change. And based on the casualty rates that the Russians have been suffering, that's a huge, huge gamble. But, of course, he's counting on that. He's counting on Donald Trump.

The NBA Players Union criticized the franchise's contribution in a searing statement.If you didn't catch this, take a look at this. A political contribution from the Orlando Magic is alarming given recent comments and policies of its beneficiary. If contributions are made on behalf of an entire team using money earned through the labor of its employees, it is incumbent upon the team governors to consider the diverse values and perspectives of staff and players. The Magic's donation does not represent player support for the recipient. That's from the Players Association. Let's discuss with Rachel Nichols. She's the host of \"Headliners with Rachel Nichols\" on Showtime. Rachel, great to see you. Great to see you back on CNN. What do you think of all this? The Players Union calling this donation alarming. How common is it for a sports franchise to donate directly to a Super PAC like this?",

And now, of course, we have seen team owners, players, management all individually support political candidates.Marc Lasry, the former owner of the Milwaukee Bucks, was one of President Obama's chief fundraisers. We have had Kelly Loeffler, I'm sure you remember her, former U.S. senator, who was a co-owner of the Atlanta Dream. Since she was not supportive of the Black Lives Matter movement, her players went out, fundraised, and supported her opponent, now Senator Raphael Warnock. And all of those are examples of individuals supporting their political candidates. In fact, the co-owner of the Magic, Betsy DeVos, as we know, was Trump's education secretary. She's an individual. What upsets these players so much is that this donation was not made on behalf of Betsy DeVos or Dick DeVos. It was made on behalf of the team. And you have players and coaches and executives who have come out publicly with very different beliefs and opinions than DeSantis's, and now their names are being used in association with this donation. And more importantly, as the Players Association statement pointed out, it's their labor. Money for NBA teams, the Orlando Magic's money that they donated to Ron DeSantis, doesn't come from a magic tree elf. It came from the work of those players on the court. And the fact that their work has been turned into a contribution for someone running for president who has come out with statements that they think directly oppose who they are as people, that is very difficult to stomach.",
