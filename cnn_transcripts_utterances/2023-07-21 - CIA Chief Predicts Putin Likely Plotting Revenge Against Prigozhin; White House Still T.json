Vladimir Putin is likely plotting revenge against Wagner bossYevgeny Prigozhin but right now, he's apparently biding his time. That is according to America's CIA Chief who calls the Russian president the ultimate apostle of payback. William Burns' prediction comes nearly one month after Yevgeny Prigozhin's short-lived march on Moscow. The CIA Director is also warning about potential Russian plans to carry out a false flag operation on vessels in the Black Sea. The White House says Kyiv has begun using U.S.-supplied cluster munitions on the battlefield. It comes as Ukrainian air defenses are struggling to repel a wave of intensified Russian missile strikes targeting the country's southern region. The port city of Odessa came under attack for the fourth night in a row. One official said grain infrastructure was hit, with 100 tons of peas and 20 tons of barley destroyed. Alexander Marquardt joins is live now from Kyiv. So, of course, the unintended consequences of this is for the millions of people that depend on food from Ukraine. I mean, we're talking about millions of people in parts of Africa who are incredibly vulnerable to the food insecurity that this now generates. Walk us through that.",

That puts all kinds of pressure on Ukraine, on the West and on the countries that need this most. This may very well be exactly what Russia is trying to do. Ukraine has said that what Russia is attempting is racketeering to drive up their exports, to drive up their profits on the backs of those countries that are the hungriest. They call this a cynical ploy to exert leverage or to use this leverage to exert pressure on Ukraine and the West. Russia is saying that these bombardments of Odessa that we've seen over the past four days are, in fact, a response to Ukrainian attack earlier this week on the Kerch Bridge. They say that the sea drones that were sent across the Black Sea to attack the bridge came from Crimea, that they were produced in Crimea. I'm sorry, excuse me produced and repaired in shops in Odessa. So, what we saw earlier today in the daylight hours, just after dawn and throughout the course of the morning, Zain, was a cruise missile strike with seven cruise missiles against an infrastructure facility. Ukrainian officials said, not in the city itself, but just to the southwest of the city, still in the Odessa region. And that, of course, was the fourth day running of these incredibly intense strikes on Odessa, on the Odessa region, which we witnessed ourselves more than 150 drones and cruise missiles used against southern Ukraine.

But he does expect that there will be retribution for pre-Goshen for this mutiny on June 24th at some point in the future.

There's been a survey by the European Travel Commission, and it looks like from their survey,eight percent of Europeans have said that extreme weather conditions are now their biggest concern when they're looking at booking a holiday. Now, we have seen a fall in terms of Europeans planning a holiday in the Mediterranean for the summer and autumn of this year. It's dropped 10 percent from last year. Part of that could be to do with affordability, inflation is very high, but part of it may be this extreme weather because we had a heatwave in Europe last year. In fact, nearly 62,000 people died from heat-related deaths last year as a result of that. We're also seeing, according to the ETC survey, a surge in popularity for much cooler climes -- Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Ireland, all slightly unusual destinations, particularly for a summer holiday, I would say. But the heat in southern Europe is extreme. It's not what people possibly want for a holiday. It's not just uncomfortable. It's actually quite dangerous and it's becoming quite hard, particularly for cities, to navigate how to create a pleasant tourist environment that's also safe. So, the Acropolis in Athens actually had to temporarily close for afternoons. In Rome, there's a command center, which has been set up so that tourists queuing for attractions are given water. There are misting stations. They're kept in the shade wherever possible. These are things that cities in southern Europe are having to do to try and ensure that it's safe and to keep tourists coming, because tourism important to many of the nations who are impacted by the heatwave. For Greece, tourism accounts for 18.5 percent of their economy. It's 10 percent for Italy. And unfortunately, speaking to scientists, of course, with climate change, events like this, extreme weather and heatwaves, are only going to get worse in the years to come. Zain.",

The popularity of women's sports seems to be exploding. Officials are hoping that more than two billion people -- they're hoping that more than two billion people will watch the Women's World Cup this year. That would be almost double the number of people who caught the 2019 Cup in France. French telecom company, Orange, is showing its support for the women's game in a clever new advert. It depicts French men's football stars like Kylian Mbappe scoring spectacular goals but then the ad shows who is really responsible for those highlights. The goals are actually being scored by the French women's national team. The ad has gone viral and has been seen by millions of people who are being taught a lesson about the actual quality of the women's game. Time now for The Exchange. I want to talk about not just promoting women's football but about the ways women's football can actually make a positive change in the lives of the people who play it. Joining me live now is Thuba Sibanda. She is women's football's development specialist for FIFA. Thuba, thank you so much for being with us. When you think about how much the football industry is actually worth, the football industry is worth about $200 billion worldwide. Obviously, a lot of that wealth is concentrated in premier clubs in Europe. It's also concentrated in the men's game. What do you think can be done to ensure a more equitable distribution of that wealth so that developing nations can participate and also women can participate more fairly and equally? THUBA SIBANDA, FIFA WOMEN'S FOOTBALL DEVELOPMENT SPECIALIST:  Thank you for that question. I think, I mean, we can look at what FIFA is doing as an example, in terms of going back to think about behind every player that we see right now on the world stage is a young girl that dreamt of playing football at the most grassroots level. And I think if we can put a player back into the grassroots football and plow back into the world level of the women's football pathway, we're able to ensure that we not only make sure that every girl that dreams to play football can access it, but that football can indeed lead to that place of elite, visual elite that we see now at the world stage. But as you are rightfully saying, there must be invested, intentional investment, and there must be the program that supports that investment, of course. And I think FIFA has done that by investing in these incredible women's football development programs. There are eight of them currently, that are ensuring that from the most grassroot part or element of the game. Girls can access football through the women's football campaign, and then ensuring that there's some level of competition across all the MAs with their league development program or the capacity building that's obviously also enhancing the quality and professionalization of the game. And ultimately also capacitating the very people that are driving the game on the ground, be it your administrators or your coaches. And I think that's the start of what we should do. But also looking at how FIFA is intentionally -- ensure that World Cup right now is has its own individual investors by commercializing the women's game. And I think if we can sustain it across the different countries, we can ensure that football can receive the investment that it needs and the message that goes to belong.",

One we know was on a grain elevator or a grain warehouse. At least two people were injured. And this particular attack really illustrates the difficulty that the Ukrainians have had as of late in shooting down incoming Russian missiles aimed at this part of the country. The Ukrainians say that the first missile strike on that grain elevator came in so low into Ukrainian airspace over the Black Sea that it wasn't initially picked up by air defenses. In fact, it wasn't picked up until around the same time that it was actually striking its target. And it has been a similar story over the last few days. Of course, the Ukrainians have been asking for months and months for better air defenses and for more air defenses, like the Patriot air defense system from the Americans. They already have at least two batteries. but this system is pretty stationary and it's not easily moved from place to place. And so, of course, the Ukrainians are asking for more of them. In this latest attack, Ukraine says that some 100 or more than 100 tons of peas and barley was destroyed. That of course is a drop in the bucket when we're talking about the overall global food market. The much bigger threat though is Ukraine's ability to actually use its port, now that its grain deal with Russia has expired, and the Russians are now saying that any ships headed into Ukrainian ports could be considered legitimate targets because they may be carrying weapons. The U.N. says all of this and the attacks on Odessa will have impacts far beyond Ukraine because, of course, Ukraine is responsible for a very significant chunk of the global market for wheat, corn, and barley.
