      "sentences": "That is what Macy's has been trying to find out. They were putting together their third quarter's earnings report, and they realized that the numbers simply were not adding up. So they launched this independent investigation and found that a single employee was fudging the numbers in the accounting of their small packages delivery expenses to the tune of $154 million.Now, Macy's is still investigating, which is why the company is saying that they are pushing their full earnings report and conference call that they normally hold to December 11th. Now, we do not know why this individual was doing this. We do not know how this individual was doing this. But Macy's says that the hiding of $154 million has had no impact on their cash management or their vendor payments. Macy's also says that this was going on for three years. During that time, the expenses totaled $4.3 billion for the total company. So $154 million is a fraction, but it's still over $100 million of money that was not accounted for. Now, the CEO of Macy's saying in a statement this morning, quote: At Macy's Inc., we promote a culture of ethical conduct while we work diligently to complete the investigation as soon as practicable and ensure this matter is handled appropriately, our colleagues across the company are focused on serving our customers and executing our strategy for a successful holiday season. [15:35:04] Now, this raises a lot of questions, particularly among investors who are wondering why the auditing within Macy's did not work correctly, how they could have just figured this out now that $154 million over three years was being hidden from the company. Also, investors on Wall Street wondering if this is a sign of bad management. And we know that in their preliminary earnings report, Macy's reported that sales slipped 2.4 percent. So that with this strange news about this single employee who's no longer with the company, shares of Macy's falling about 3 percent today. But the investigation at Macy's still ongoing to exactly how $154 million was just hidden.",

      "sentences": "Yes, I'm also hearing from a Lebanese official who's close to the ceasefire process there saying that they expect the deal to be signed in the next 24 hours. So it seems that both sides here think they're close. Look, the Israeli side does have reservations, and one of those reservations is that they want the ability, the right to strike back at Hezbollah if they break this ceasefire deal.It's supposed to be a 60-day ceasefire initially. As the Israeli foreign minister said today, the Hezbollah have to pull back about 30 miles north of the border, north of a place called the Litani River. The IDF pull back inside of Israel. But the thing that the foreign minister said that seems to be hard to achieve is he said that over time Hezbollah must not be allowed to grow back into the military force that it once was. How that happens, what's the mechanism for that and how they would ever agree to that really isn't clear. But it does seem that both sides are headed towards this. Look, the vote tomorrow in the cabinet, it's not a done deal. It's not in the bag for the prime minister yet. Itamar Ben-Gvir, the national security minister, really one of the hard right-wing members of Prime Minister Netanyahu's cabinet has said today, he said, I told the prime minister Hezbollah is losing. We should continue to press on. He said, continue, continue, continue. He wants the IDF to continue taking the fight to Hezbollah. Tomorrow morning before the prime minister (INAUDIBLE) with the individual parties that make up his coalition. So that will be his opportunity to give the hard sell to people like Itamar Ben-Gvir and the others who are reticent about this. But the momentum seems to be there. I don't get a sense of big support coming from the people who live in the north. I was talking with somebody I know lives very close to the border in the north and he feels that the government's selling them out. He feels that the terms of this deal are really like the terms of the deal in 2006 where it'll be quiet for a while, but eventually Hezbollah will make their way back to the border and become as big a threat again. So I think there's a level of disappointment, certainly in the north of Israel, the 60,000 people that were evacuated from there. But nevertheless, we do seem to be moving in that direction. Not a done deal, then there's the implementation. But closer and closer, yes.",

It's literally burning the planet. And we have to transition. Last year was the first year after 28 of these, where the transition was spelled out. Fossil fuels are in the past.We've got to move forward. But now the economy has shifted. And investors are trying to get in on this. And countries like Saudi Arabia, Azerbaijan saying, no, not so fast. Maybe we'll go for a while. Of course, Donald Trump is saying, drill, baby, drill. But what's interesting, for an example, right now in Pakistan, they're having a huge solar boom. It's everywhere. They talk about it at cricket matches. It's on TV. They've got so much solar power coming online they need technology to manage the grid so it doesn't crash. A perfect opportunity for the Western world to come in and help them transition and not go back to fossil fuels. But now you've got to imagine fossil fuel lobbyists will be trying to sell oil and gas in Pakistan and undo that sort of sustainable, renewable wave that's happening right now. And it's happening all around the world. So it'll be interesting to see how it plays out.",

And yet she was diagnosed with this disease. And she says that she is not alone.We have seen here in the United States a rise in lung cancer diagnoses among people who do not have a history of smoking. When you look at the numbers in the past 42 years, there has been an 84 percent increase in lung cancer diagnoses among women, but a 36 percent decrease among men during that same time period. And I will say just in general, we have seen an overall decline in lung cancer in the U.S. because we have seen fewer people smoking cigarettes. But at the same time, we've seen a rise among non-smokers. And women are twice as likely as men to be diagnosed with lung cancer. When you look specifically at men and women who have never smoked. So this is among non-smokers. And that's the takeaway message from Susan Wojcicki's blog, that we need to take a closer look into this trend of lung cancer among non- smokers, otherwise healthy, young and middle-aged adults.",

We also have guidelines, as you see on the screen here, for screening among people with a history of smoking.
