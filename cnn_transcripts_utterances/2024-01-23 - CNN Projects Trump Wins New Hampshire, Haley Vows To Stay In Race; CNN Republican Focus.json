He's a double-digit lead.Trump spoke to supporters about his win just a short while ago in New Hampshire, sounding less celebratory than furious, furious at Nikki Haley after her vow to stay in the race. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: I can go up and I can say to everybody, oh, thank you for the victory. It's wonderful. It's what -- or I can go up and say, who the hell was the imposter that went up on the stage before and like claimed a victory. She did very poorly actually. She had to win. The governor said, she's going to win, she's going to win, she's going to win. Then she failed badly. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He was beaming. He said that he had won by such a huge margin that it was time to unite the party, time to unite the country.And this was an angry Donald Trump who focused all of his rage on Nikki Haley. I mean, earlier in the day, he said he didn't care if she stayed in the race. He said he'd never call on anyone to leave the race, and that he didn't view her as a threat. But it was clear that he was not only annoyed but angry that she didn't drop out of the race. He was angry that she seemed so celebratory in her speech. And I'm not sure celebratory is the right word, but at least defiant, didn't cower down, didn't back down, and said that she would continue fighting. He also, actually, at one point looked at Tim Scott, a senator from South Carolina, and said, you must really hate her to endorse me. In what was kind of an awkward moment, Scott walked over to the microphone and said, no, I just love you. But, obviously, inferring there, but because they worked together in South Carolina, and Scott backed Trump that he didn't like Nikki Haley. And I will say that that's been a part of their long-term strategy, not just Nikki Haley, but also with Ron DeSantis, which is kind of, trying to humiliate their opponent, not just fight them in a battle over policy or issues but to actually destroy them. If you remember with Ron DeSantis, they had a coordinated effort that Ron DeSantis came to Washington, asked Florida delegation not to do anything, not to endorse, and they had a strategy to get every single one of them, or most of them, to endorse Trump the day he was in Washington. Then, here in New Hampshire, right before the primary, they had a number of South Carolina lawmakers endorsing Haley and going out and stumping for Donald Trump, one of them being South Carolina Senator Tim Scott. So, this is clearly a strategy, and they are going to continue doing it. But, yes, tonight was a very angry Donald Trump, not focused at all on the fact that he won New Hampshire, possibly by double digits, which is what they had hoped for, but instead, focused on the fact that Nikki Haley was still in the race.",

But in places where, you know, I'm going to give you a Portsmouth, for example, it's a small number of votes here, but she's getting 60 percent here, right? And she's getting, you know, 54, 55 percent of the vote here.If these areas around there where you have similar voters come in about the same, they're not huge, right? Look, that's 200 votes. You know, that's 200 votes. You get even here. It's even less than that. But it works for Nikki Haley just as it works for Donald Trump. When he runs it up in small places, you know, it helps offset what happens. So, there's an opportunity down here. And she's getting a smattering of the smaller.

But that's opportunity lost if you're thinking about a week or so, ten days or so when they really thought they could win, where they thought they had momentum and then it sort of plateaued out, this would have been someplace they needed to win. Still waiting, Hollis next door. This is a chance, you know, 38 out of 260s in terms of population. Again, these are all small population centers. This is on the Haley target list. So, you go across the southern part of the state. There are still some places, but let's just be honest with what we're seeing right here. Right now, Donald Trump is at 55, if you round that up, right? It's a 12-point race right now, just shy of a 12-point race right now.

It's more of a problem for the rest of the electorate, all the other people who are watching this, the actual independent voters out there, who are watching this and think it's kind of wild. And at the end of the day, you know, Trump is not only going to be who he is, he's doubling down on all the very things that give voters pause about him. I'm not sure that we are going to really see that bear out in this Republican primary, but once we start talking about the broader American electorate, that's going to be the pivot point for him. And all of this stuff, suggesting that his investigations are nothing, that does not play beyond Republican voters who are already inclined to believe that he and Republicans, in general, are being targeted by the state.

And, of course, this is not surprising, only 5 percent of Trump voters were looking for somebody with the right temperament.

Joe Biden is really eager to take on Donald Trump because he thinks he can easily beat him and Haley supporters make that argument, as well.But be that as it may, if current trends continue, Donald Trump does become the Republican presidential nominee and Joe Biden is the Democratic opponent.

Number one, we're not going to have this conversation into what it looks like tonight. And we're not there yet. But you could also have this conversation with Biden versus any Republican, really.And now Trump has certain strengths and weaknesses versus them that we can talk about as we go through them as you go. But here's where we ended 2020, despite what Donald Trump says. Joe Biden winning with 306 electoral votes, free and fair election, 232 for Donald Trump. Here's where that would be today because of the post-census. Electoral votes get re-allocated. States change population. And so, Joe Biden would actually lose two just because of the census changes, right? So, he would come down to 303, meaning the states he won in 2024 have fewer electoral votes than they had in 2020 because of the census, and some of the states Donald Trump won have more. So, this is where you would start with the 2020 map. Now, one way for any Republican, but Donald Trump won Pennsylvania in 2016, lost it by a bit, but was in play. So, let's say Donald Trump won Pennsylvania and Donald Trump won Georgia. That would flip the election right there. Just two states, just two states, right? And so the Democrats, if you're in Pennsylvania, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, you're saying, no, no, Joe Biden's going to hold that. So, let's give it back to him. All right, so there's one there. Georgia, that was a title, this is the Republican, so let's say we stay down here in the Sun Belt, right? Just going through this with David Chalian, hypothetically.

I think we can see that voters overwhelmingly do not want a Trump-Biden rematch, but also, Trump, right now is emerging as the strongest Republican candidate who has vanquished all of those who tried to challenge him except Nikki Haley, so far. She is the last person standing in this race.And so, I think the question going forward is the argument that a lot of Republicans who did not endorse Trump and endorsed Governor DeSantis or Nikki Haley or others who were in this race was that Trump was going to be a liability for them in the general election. I mean that was one of Ron DeSantis' key arguments. One, he didn't really make strongly enough I think some people would say until the end of his campaign came close. But if you're the Trump campaign and you're looking at these numbers tonight, that John King was just laying out there when we heard from David Chalian earlier, this many people who voted for Nikki Haley weren't necessarily voting for her because they were enthusiastic about her, but they were voting against Donald Trump. I think that is something that should cause a five-alarm fire with inside the Republican National Committee and is probably welcome news for the Biden White House because those are voters that they can try to appeal to.",

I think the reality is that voters are finding themselves here ultimately because this is about choices. Neither party wants to disarm themselves. You know? And so, you know, as Nikki Haley put it, I think it's actually such a smart way to put it, maybe the first person to -- like, the first party to let go of their 80- year-old might be the victor, but who's going to be the one to move first?

But when you talk to voters, and obviously we saw what happened wherehe confused Nancy Pelosi with Nikki Haley repeatedly the other day and never corrected himself in that moment, something that his allies tried to defend. But when you talk to voters, you do not hear the same concerns about Trump's age as you do when it comes to when you talk to voters when they talk about Biden's age.
