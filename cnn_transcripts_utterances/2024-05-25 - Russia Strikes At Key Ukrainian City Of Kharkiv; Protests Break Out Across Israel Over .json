I'm Jessica Dean in Washington.And we begin with breaking news out of Ukraine as Russia ramps up its attacks on the country's second largest city of Kharkiv. Military officials there say Russia launched a third strike this afternoon that left more than a dozen people injured. That includes a 13-year-old boy. That attack coming just hours after a strike on a shopping center in the city. Dramatic surveillance video capturing the moment of that attack. Officials say at least two people are dead, more than three dozen injured and 11 people who work at that hardware store are now missing. CNN chief international security correspondent Nick Paton Walsh is live in Eastern Ukraine. He's been tracking all of these developments throughout the day. Nick, what more do we know?",

People in a hardware store, a huge complex full of paint, full of plastic, feeling these two airstrikes from Russia, landing exactly where they were. At this point, we know four are dead, we know of some people who are not able to reach their relatives. We know potentially 40 injured.And the huge billowing smoke that went across all of Kharkiv during the hours off this attack really a symbol of how much closer Russian forces are getting to Ukraine's second city. Remember this is all about Putin deciding about two weeks ago to push forces again in what some are calling a third invasion from the north, from Kharkiv down from Russian territory, in a bid to try and stretch Ukrainian forces further than they are right now, which is pretty stretched indeed. Now, we've seen awful attacks like this against civilian targets over the past two weeks or so. Seven killed last weekend in the attack on a lakeside resort, including a seven-month pregnant woman. Seven killed in a recent attack during the week elsewhere in Kharkiv. And this again now, but it wasn't the only thing that people in Kharkiv had to endure. We also heard of another attack hours later, which didn't hit anybody in another part of Kharkiv. Details are always kept closed because the Ukrainians don't want to tell the Russians exactly how successful they were. And another attack which appears to have injured 11 individuals. So constantly Kharkiv where we were for the past week, its skylight lining lights with explosions again and again, as so many people in Ukraine realized this new part of Russia's offensive trying to exploit the gap between Ukraine's readiness and the arrival of new American weapons authorized finally by the $61 billion that Republican congressional dysfunctionality had delayed for six vital months. But that gap between Ukraine's readiness is being exploited by Putin. And now we're seeing that hit civilians in a million-strong city like Kharkiv.",

You are looking live at Tel Aviv right now. A U.S. official telling CNN CIA director Bill Burns left the ceasefire talks taking place in Paris Friday, and that progress was made. An Egyptian official telling CNN that truce talks will resume on Tuesday in Cairo. This as the U.N.'s top court, the International Criminal Court of Justice, ruled Israel must stop immediately its military operation in Rafah on Friday, but Israelis have continued those attacks.

      "sentences": "Jessica, the short answer is no. They're not changing their approach. Indeed, Israel, in response to the ICJ ruling, said that it never has nor will it ever, to use the words of the ICJ ruling, bring about the physical destruction in whole or in part of the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip. So to that extent, there's not likely to be any practical impact on Israel's plans militarily for Rafah.It says it needs to go in there to deal with the final root out of Hamas and those final battalions in order to destroy Hamas militarily to prevent it from repeating the atrocities of October 7th. It's also worth noting of course that, although the ICJ's rulings are binding, it doesn't actually have the power to enforce them itself. Now in theory members of the U.N. Security Council could table a resolution calling for some kind of action or sanctions against Israel or something. But invariably the United States would veto that. But of course, diplomatically, the pressure is added to the diplomatic pressure on Israel and in particular on its leaders. Let's not forget the International Criminal Court's prosecutor is asking for warrants for the arrest of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his defense minister, Yoav Gallant. We've seen in the past week additional countries such as Norway and Spain saying they're going to recognize a Palestinian state. And of course, all of this is adding to the pressure and the isolation that Israel is feeling diplomatically. And of course, very important to remember that the additional pressure that this will bring to bear on President Biden and his administration especially in this key election year when many from both within the party and among potential voters for the Democrats will be wanting the U.S. to take a stronger line against Israel, perhaps holding back supplies of more weapons or other things that it has already done in order to show its displeasure with the way that Israel is carrying out the war against Hamas in Gaza -- Jessica.",

He sits on the House Intelligence and Oversight Committees. He's also a ranking member of the Select Committee on China. Congressman, thanks so much for making time on this Saturday afternoon to come by and chat. I want to go back and start with Ukraine. We heard at the top of our broadcast Nick Paton Walsh talking about Russia's recent attacks on Ukraine. And this week, the U.S. announced a sitting $275 million in military aid in part to fight off Russia's advance in the Kharkiv region, which he was laying out. We know Ukraine is short on manpower, weapons, ammo, and he talked about this six-month delay that Congress experienced because they wouldn't -- they couldn't get the aid package done. Do you think this aid is going to arrive in enough time for Ukraine to turn this around and keep control of its second largest city? REP. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI (D-IL): Yes, I think so. I think that the Ukrainians are putting up a heck of a defense right now. And I think that unfortunately the pipeline has been there, so to speak, with regard to the vital equipment that they need. Now that pipeline is starting to fill up and I think that the Ukrainians will then be able to access the ammunition as well as other equipment necessary to make an even more forceful defense of Kharkiv and Ukraine more generally.",

And then this week China launched new military drills, encircling Taiwan, saying the largescale exercises are designed to test its ability to, quote, \"seize power over the island.\" And it's coming just a few days after Taiwan sworn in its new president.What do you think China is trying to do here?

And the situation could spiral out of control. So they should really stick to the status quo, which is avoiding provocative activity on their side. But also Taiwan doing the same.The other thing -- my other takeaway here, Jessica, is it's possible that the Chinese economy is even worse than what we thought and that Xi Jinping is trying to distract attention from a faltering economy by engaging in these exercises. And so I hope he will stop with these provocative measures, but that also gives one pause to reflect on what's happening within China.",

But I think the cost of that is obviously we become closer to ourpartners, friends, and allies in Europe and elsewhere, in defense of democracy. Something that the Chinese don't like. They don't like when other nations multilaterally come together and adopt countermeasures with regard to China.

This is a -- the tornadoes can be incredibly strong and long lived, and violent. So we are incredibly worried about these storms that could fire up here in parts of Oklahoma and Kansas. We've already had storms starting to blow up in parts of Texas. You can see, all this year, thunderstorm warnings there for the northern part of the state. We've also had a severe thunderstorm watch an effect for much of Georgia going into the Florida Panhandle where we've had some storms pack some damaging winds and large hail as well. This is a look at the risk for today. That moderate level four out of five, which looks like it has just gotten a little bit bigger in the latest update, includes that's threat for the intense tornadoes, baseball-sized hail and some damaging wind gusts that we'll have to watch out for. As we go through the evening and overnight, a lot of this looks like it could be nocturnal, meaning happening at night. EF-2 or greater for some of those tornadoes. Again, incredibly strong and violent. And come in what's been a really busy start to the severe weather season. More than 900 tornado reports since January 1st. Average to date would be about 700. So let me show you how this times out. Storms really might not start firing up until after 7:00 or 8:00 at night. Again, getting close to sunset. When you see these discrete little cells in there, those are the strong, violent tornadoes that we're worried about. Again, you see them propagating up from Oklahoma into Kansas. Look at the time, 10:00 at night. So before we go to bed tonight, make sure you turn up the sound on your phone so it can wake you while you're sleeping. Then it turns into a damaging wind threat overnight as we go into Missouri and then continues to push through the Ohio Valley as we go into Sunday. So the severe weather risk continues as we go through the holiday weekend. This is the threat for tomorrow, a level three out of five. You see that orange there from St. Louis to Nashville for additional tornadoes, damaging winds and large hail. So lots that were tracking.

Proponents say it will protect expectant mothers from coerced abortions. This is what Republican state Senator Thomas Pressly had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STATE REP. THOMAS PRESSLY (R-LA): And my sister was the victim of a horrible domestic violence attack where her then-husband tried to grind up Misoprostol seven different times and put it into her drinks, trying to kill my now 22-month-old niece and significantly harm my sister and her health. Look, this bill is intended to ensure that doctors, nurse practitioners, and physician's assistants have the opportunity to write these medications. And they will be dispensed at pharmacies throughout the state of Louisiana. That's going to continue when it's for legitimate health care reasons. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Ever since the 1980s, medical groups advised women with HIV to avoid breastfeeding because of concerns about transmission of the virus.But we're now seeing a reversal in that guidance. The American Academy of Pediatrics now says that mothers with HIV can breastfeed with very low risk if they follow these guidelines. They're receiving anti-retroviral treatments and the virus is suppressed in the body. When those two things happen, the risk of HIV transmission when breastfeeding is estimated to be less than 1 percent. And this change in guidance aligns with what the Department of Health and Human Services recommends as well. Outside of establishing a bond between the mom and her newborn, babies who are breastfed have a lower risk of asthma, obesity, type-1 diabetes, severe lower respiratory disease, ear infections and some other health conditions. Each year in the United States, nearly 5,000 women with HIV give birth. So this change in the medical guidance means a lot to many moms out there. I spoke with one mother in Colorado who has HIV. And she told me she's working with her medical team to safely breastfeed her newborn son. She sees breastfeeding as one of the first things she can do postpartum to help him have a healthy life.
