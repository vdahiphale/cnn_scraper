A huge hole and a ton of questions left behind.Some of the new details today and the month before Friday's terrifying 20 minutes in the air, a pressurization warning light had gone off three times. That led Alaska Airlines to actually restrict the plane from flying over water on long-haul trips to ensure it could return quickly to an airport, if necessary. On Friday, passengers describe a violent explosion when the plane's door plug blew off shortly after takeoff from Portland, Oregon, and then head rests were torn off. Extra oxygen masks were sheered off. Some seats were even twisted from the force of the depressurization. One passenger says a child's shirt was ripped off from it. Thankfully, the two seats directly next to what became a massive hole were not occupied on this plane. Also this morning, a crucial piece of evidence has been recovered. The refrigerator-sized door plug found in someone's backyard in Portland but another key piece of the investigation has been lost, the cockpit voice recording. The NTSB says it was completely overridden. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The NTSB has inspected the interior and the exterior of the plane featuring that twisted and contorted seat metal from that 400 miles per hour rush of air through that refrigerator-sized opening in the left side of the fuselage. The big development, this is the smoking gun here. The piece that fell off of the plane has been found.NTSB chair Jennifer Homendy rushed back to the podium last night to announce that, found in the backyard of a Portland schoolteacher. We only know his first name. It is Bob. That part is known as a door plug, and it fills a spot on the plane where an optional door could be installed at the Boeing factory. Finding this is key because it will hold some major clues. The NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy just told me, was this a mechanical failure? Was this a manufacturing defect by Boeing or its contractors? That is the key because the airplane is only months old, took its first flight October 15 and flew 150 flights for Alaska airlines. Investigators also now say a pressurization warning light came on in the plane three times before this incident, once the just day before, it and that caused Alaska to restrict this plane from long flights over water like to Hawaii. Could have been an early warning, and it's something that investigators are probing but are still unclear about. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

There are members of the public who, of course, found the door plug that we've been talking about for the past couple of minutes and also the members of the public who found one but not two cell phones that fell out of the compartment blown out of there from 16,000 feet.But I think it's the most important element of the story line at this very early morning hour to talk about the passengers who experienced these harrowing moments, our worst nightmare. So when this happened just a few minutes into the flight, it was a violent, intense feeling of an explosion happening 26 rows behind people who are sitting up in front. And a lot of people did not know what was going on, Jon. It wasn't until the aircraft landed safely, thank God, that people turned around and saw a hole in the back of the aircraft. So, we're going to play you a sound fight in a couple of seconds from a passenger Stephanie King, and she's describing when you listen to here of ice actually coming in the plane and being sucked out by the pressurized air coming out of that hole. Listen what she told us over the weekend. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STEPHANIE KING, PASSENGER (via telephone):  It was really, really scary, as you can imagine, initially when the piece flew off, there was almost multiple explosions, and it -- at first it felt like all of the air from outside rushed into the cabin, and particles were flying everywhere. I'm not sure what that was, if it was ice or debris from the plane itself, but it came forward, and then it got sucked back out very dramatically. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So moving to the people, let's start with Bob. God bless Bob was the quote from the chair of the NTSB late last night when we were in the news conference. Everybody brought back into the room when the first news conference ended and the chair said and came become and say Bob found the door plug. We don't have any photos as of yet. So, we're going to be looking for those later today. Two cell phones again found in perfect working condition, so we'll see what else the investigators are working on today.

We have heard that, and we heard from the lead there in your report from the accident investigation team that this is something of interest, of concern, too. There can be many warnings generated on flights every day to pilots, largely these are quite routine.Pilots report it or more and more these days automatically from data systems through aircraft flight jet decks to the ground engineering maintenance control teams. It's difficult to say what the significance of the pressurization warnings were. It seems potentially more than coincidental, but it could have been something very, very minor. It could have been something completely different. Pressurization embraces a lot of elements on a aircraft, but certainly that needs to be checked out, worked out as quickly as possible.",

He was photographed with Qassam Soleimani, the top Iranian general that the U.S. killed in a drone strike four years ago. He was photographed with Hezbollah's spiritual leader Hassan Nasrallah, top figure there. He was photographed with Imad Mughniyeh, responsible for a horrendous attack on U.S. forces back in the 1980s in Beirut, so he's been associated with some very senior figures within Iran, within Lebanon and within the fight against Israel.So Israel is not saying they are responsible for this strike. Of course, it does bear their hallmarks. It does appear to be something of an escalation. They were operating fighter jets, drones in that area and helicopters as well where they have taken out a couple of sites where they said anti-tank mills were launched in their positions across the border inside of Israel. So they were certainly operational there, and the reason that this will cause a little concern that this could look like a potential escalation is because over the weekend, Hezbollah fired 62 missiles, they said, at an Israeli military base on the top of a mountain near the border with Lebanon which they said was in response for the killing of that Hamas commander Saleh al-Arouri, Wednesday last week in Beirut. They said they would take revenge for it, and that was the biggest strike yet on an Israeli military base, so if this looks like potential for escalation, it may or may not be, but it's certainly going to feel hike it to a lot of Hezbollah people on the ground in southern Lebanon.",

She's defended herself on specific policy issue, but when it comes to questions about Trump's ability to defend democracy or about the four criminal court cases that he's currently facing, she really hasn't hitting him on those issues.

I don't think there's many votes for her there in that fishing hole, but I guess we'll find out. I do think the expectations for both DeSantis and Haley here are critical. I mean, obviously, Trump has had a massive lead in the polling. Haven't had a lot of polling out of Iowa since mid-December, however, and we may see more this week. We'll see if anything has changed. But the real question for DeSantis can he reel in Trump? I don't know if he has to win the caucus, but if here to say reel him into single digits that would be a huge night. For Haley, expectations were lower. If she were able to jump over DeSantis and do a surprise second place finish even if she was far back of Trump that would be a big night for her.

Those are issues that are real, and despite the fact that the Biden straights may tout these successes, people don't feel that way, and it's not a messaging issue. It's a reality issue.
