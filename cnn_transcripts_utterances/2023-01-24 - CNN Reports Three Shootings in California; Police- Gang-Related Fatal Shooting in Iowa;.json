Police in San Mateo County say the suspected Half Moon Bay attacked two different locations, one of which is a mushroom farm. The farm's owners say the event has left them shaken and they don't know the suspected shooter.

This comes on the heels of Comer himself asking for records from the National Archives, from the White House, about some of the communications that occurred here. The House Judiciary Committee is trying to understand the efforts that went behind, naming the special counsel in this case. The questions, will they get the information they're asking for? At the moment, it seems that they will be unsuccessful in at least some of those efforts, including the Justice Department indicating last week that it would not provide information that could undercut an ongoing law enforcement investigation. It is still uncertain whether the White House will provide the information that James Comer wants. And one in particular, getting those Secret Service logs seems unlikely. Secret Service says that they do not keep that kind of information. Also, Secret Service did not actively monitor Joe Biden's house from 2017, middle of 2017 until about 2020, when he became the presumptive Democratic nominee. So, there is no information there that Republicans want. But there are other communications that they are seeking, including from the White House, which is indicating that it will talk in good faith with Comer about trying to get some of the information that he's seeking on these matters. The question, though, is, if it does not -- ultimately, if Republicans don't ultimately get what they want, what do they do next? Some are threatening subpoenas. Will the White House comply with the subpoena requests or will we see what we saw in the Trump years when Democrats who battled with the Trump administration went to court trying to get information? Sometimes, successful. Sometimes, leading to lengthy, protracted court fights.
