I'm Rahel Solomon live in New York.We want to get straight to our breaking news this hour, roads underwater, homes destroyed, and fears that the number of casualties could rapidly rise. We begin with one of the largest storms to hit the Gulf of Mexico in the past century. Tropical Storm Helene now pummeling several southern states and heading north, after barreling into Florida as a Category 4 hurricane overnight. This is just a glimpse of the severe storm surge that accompanied winds of up to 140 miles an hour. Multiple flash flood emergencies now in place in the southeastern U.S. You are looking now at some of the latest images from Asheville, North Carolina. That's where historic levels of flooding could be imminent. And massive concerns in a major city of Atlanta, with residents being told to stay off the roads, as the city there braces for more flooding. A total of at least seven people have been killed, with watches and warnings in place for 60 million people across 12 states. We have a team of reporters for you. But first, I want to go to North Carolina, where the Governor, Roy Cooper, is giving us an update. Let's listen.",

Also, really sad update just coming in. He said that they can report two deaths now. He said one was the result of a motor vehicle collision on a flooded roadway. The other was a tree falling on a home. That happened in the major city of Charlotte. So, of course, as we get these press conferences from different local government officials in the southeastern region of the U.S., we will bring it to you.But now, I want to go to one of our reporters who is standing by, Carlos Suarez live in Gulfport, Florida.

We'll walk a bit here. So, this is where we were yesterday. However, the storm surge was so bad that it was unsafe for us to stay here, and so we made our way a bit further north, where things dried out a little bit more.You could see, though, all of the storm surge that came from this storm, between four to six feet of it, did quite a number on this marina here. You see that one boat there, that is just one of two, three, four, and five that I can count that made their way inland. They were pushed here from the bay because of the strong winds and the strong surf. And to give you a sense, Rahel, of just how much water made its way out here through the overnight hours. That 5,500 is the address of the Gulfport Casino. The water was just above that number. If you follow the damage a little bit to your left here, you'll see what used to be the entrance to this Gulfport Casino, you see the window there has been blown out. And then, if you follow the promenade, you'll see what's left of it, at least. You can see folks there walking by. All of that yesterday was in pristine condition, and as you can see right now, it's pretty badly damaged. That right there, that's sitting in the parking lot, that used to be part of a floating dock, we're told, that broke free of its pilings and then ended up where it's at right now. Rahel, the National Guard has been called out to Pinellas County. They are in the city of Gulfport, where we are right now. We're told that they are the ones that are going to be the folks that will be taking care of law enforcement, considering that a good part of this city is without power, and because of all of this damage, they are the ones that are kind of coordinating the effort in making sure that folks stay safe and that these businesses that have been pretty badly damaged themselves are safe from anyone that might want to try to get in there or do something that they really should not be doing.

So, it makes sense for him to be surrounded by water and boats. But, look at where I am. I'm at an apartment complex in Buckhead, Atlanta, and you look at this car behind me, the CRV has seen better days. The water, at one point, was above the windshield wiper on the backside of this car. The people who live in the apartment upstairs, they're still up there. They have an infant. There were water rescues all across Atlanta yesterday, more than 25 of them happening overnight. The reason why they were concerned is because the more of 10 inches of rain that has hit this area. But, when you see how expansive this is and how much water is just left behind, you understand what they're dealing with. This is a city that's been hit by several different rainstorms over a 24-hour period. We talked to some people who've had to wade through this water recently.

And it would be one thing if this -- if the storm had made a direct landfall here. And so, folks perhaps may have thought a little bit differently about the storm.But remember, where we are was well east of where this hurricane passed us. It was 100 miles to the west of us. And so, the folks that we talked to are kind of like trying to process the idea that the size of this storm was so great and yet it was located so far off the coast that they really can't make sense of all of this damage. I mean, Greg, if you can show them here, this one business here, they were supposed to reopen just a few days ago. This place had been closed after Hurricane Debby hit just in August, and the folks were getting ready to reopen when this storm hit. Not even here, right? It hit the Panhandle. It hit north of us. And so, folks, in talking to them, they're exasperated. They're overwhelmed, and they -- but they're used to this kind of thing. I've been here now for three hurricane seasons in a row, covered three hurricanes from this location in Gulfport in Pinellas County. And every time I'm out here, it's the same folks. They are right now -- this one business here, they're cleaning up. I saw them last year. Same thing happened with another storm. They were flooded out. They were trying to reopen. They're right back where they were this time last year. And the other businesses that are kind of right next to it, it's the same thing. There is a pet animal store, supply store there. I talked to that gentleman for three years in a row for Hurricane Ian that hit to the south of us, and I spoke to him when Hurricane Idalia hit to the north of us. And in both of those hurricanes, this part of Pinellas County, Gulfport, flooded, you can understand why. We're right up along the bay. The Gulf is on one side. Tampa Bay is on the other. And the sizes of these -- the size of these storms and the intensification of it, when all that water comes rushing in, it doesn't even have to be a direct impact for folks to have their lives literally uprooted.

So, I think it really only amplifies the divisions at home, as the Prime Minister tries to set out his vision of what's to come.But, by and large, the tone of his speech, the text of his speech, was not a great surprise. There were many things that he has visited here before, particularly picking up on the issue of Iran and talking about blessings and curses, and trying to make the situation black and white, or black or white. So, this was many people here. They will recognize this as vintage, if you will. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu going out, saying that he is speaking for Israel being tough.

And Jomana, I'm sure you just heard Jeremy Diamond there with that statement from Daniel Hagari, saying that they did, the IDF did carry out this precise strike on the central headquarters of the Hezbollah terror organization. But, I want to draw your attention to something we sort of touched on briefly, this statement saying that these headquarters were built under residential buildings in the heart of Beirut as part of Hezbollah strategy of using human shields. Talk to me about what we know about the site of that huge plume of smoke, that site of the explosion. What do we know?",

Jeremy, if I still have you, actually, Jeremy -- OK. Jeremy, I do have you, OK, as we sort of just try to understand where our crews are. Talk to me a little bit about the context in which this happens. You sort of touched on it there that the last week or so, there has been this ratcheting up along the border between the IDF and Hezbollah, and it really started, I think, with those pager attacks. It started with those walkie-talkie attacks. And since then, we have seen this continued tit-for-tat. Just give us a sense of the context in which this is happening.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. And I also think we need to be really clear that the escalation, the escalatory steps that we have seen over the course of the last week have been led almost solely by the Israeli government and the Israeli military. It is Israel that has been ratcheting up this conflict over the course of the last week.We have seen, of course, escalatory steps from Hezbollah as well, the first ballistic missile fired towards Tel Aviv, the first two barrages of rockets, including one today, towards the city of Haifa, where I am right now. But, by and large, what we have seen is the Israeli military, and they are doing so intentionally and without apology, escalating this conflict in a significant way, because they believe it is the pathway to getting Hezbollah to back down from its rocket attacks in northern Israel. And these strikes in Beirut, they were once considered rare. They were almost viewed as somewhat of a red line in terms of the kind of response that it could trigger from Hezbollah. Until this latest round of escalations, we had only seen the Israeli military carrying out two strikes in the southern suburbs of Beirut. One of them was targeting a Hamas official, and then it was in late July when it targeted Fuad Shukr, who is a senior Hezbollah commander. But, over the course of the last week, we have seen a handful of Israeli military strikes, most of them, targeted attacks, in the Lebanese capital over the course of just this last week. And so, something that was once kind of extraordinarily rare has now become almost commonplace in this current phase of this conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. We will be looking to see how significant this strike is in terms of the civilian casualties, in terms of the numbers of buildings that were likely destroyed or significantly damaged in this strike. But again, as I was saying earlier, just looking at the size of the plume of smoke that is emerging from Beirut right now that you are seeing on your screen, looking at the fact that the Israeli military says they targeted a central headquarters of Hezbollah underground, beneath residential buildings, I think we are going to find that the Israeli military likely used very heavy munitions in order to strike underground, and we are also likely to see a significant toll of casualties on the ground as a result.",

Nic, walk me through what you make of just the messaging component of this. Obviously, we had that statement from Daniel Hagari of the IDF, but this also comes just hours after we heard from Netanyahu deliver this pretty defiant, impassioned speech in front of the UN.",
