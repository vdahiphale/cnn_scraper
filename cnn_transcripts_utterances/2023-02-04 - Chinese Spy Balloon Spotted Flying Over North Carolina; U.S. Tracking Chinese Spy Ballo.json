This morning, we're following new details about that Chinese spy balloon traveling across the country. New video in to the CNN NEWSROOM showing the balloon now hovering over Asheville and Charlotte, North Carolina in the last hour and it could make it out to sea at any moment. The balloon was first spotted over Montana on Wednesday. China claims it's a civilian research vessel that blew off course, but the U.S. isn't buying that, calling the balloon's flight over U.S. soil an irresponsible act. Secretary of State Antony Blinken postponing a planned trip to Beijing in response. CNN's Oren Liebermann is at the Pentagon for us. So Oren, officials say the balloon doesn't currently seem to present a threat, but why is the Pentagon also proceeding with caution on it?",

      "sentences": "So the Pentagon has said for now that it will not be shooting this down, because of the risks from two different perspectives. First there's the risk to what's below, blow something up at 60,000 feet and that could be scattered over quite a large debris field, so there is a risk to people and property.But they are keeping a very close eye on it and are continuously monitoring this as it makes its way across frankly much of the United States, almost like a scenic tour from the north west over Montana to where it's just been spotted over the course of the last hour or so -- Asheville, North Carolina; Charlotte, North Carolina, some sightings there. So it is making its way -- excuse me -- along that sort of east/southeast track. The other reason they haven't taken it down yet is because they don't believe it has surveillance or intelligence gathering capabilities above and beyond Chinese spy satellites which are constantly rotating around the earth and taking their own pictures of the United States. So for that reason, the decision has been made at this point not to frankly shoot this thing out of the sky. President Joe Biden did request with military options when this was first spotted over the U.S. earlier this week over Montana but the Pentagon recommended against that at this time. The question is what is the response from here? Both the State Department and the Pentagon have made it clear they view this as a violation of U.S. Air space; a violation, a breach of international law; and they view this severely ahead of a high stakes visit or planned visit, I should say, of Secretary of State Antony Blinken to Beijing. It was to be the first time the top U.S. diplomat has visited China in Beijing in six years and the Chinese took this very seriously, especially with high tensions. So for this to have happened, a major mistake on their part, and they have apologized multiple times, and said look, this was just a weather balloon that was barely controllable, it was pulled over the U.S. by winds. The U.S. Has made it clear they're not buying that explanation. They've delayed or postponed at least the trip of Blinken to China. And now, the question, where does this go from here? First is there more diplomatic fallout? Second, is there a military response. And being at the Pentagon today, there are key staff members from the top levels of the Pentagon here. And that raises the question, does the Pentagon plan on shooting this down, once it is no longer a risk to people and property below and this is out over U.S. waters?",

But what is extraordinary here is that the Chinese government expressed regret. This is extremely rare. I don't ever remember a statement from the Chinese government like this in my time covering China. And it is a major shift from Beijing's regular playbook of just hitting back and denying.The Chinese foreign ministry said, quote, \"It is a civilian air ship used for research mainly meteorological purposes affected by the westerlies and with limited self-steering capability, the air ship deviated from its planned course. The Chinese side regrets the unintended entry of the air ship into U.S. air space. Now, decision making in the Chinese government is a black box, but this softer response from Beijing makes it clear that China is trying to lower the temperature and de-escalate. But in another statement today, the foreign ministry did accuse some politicians and the media in the U.S. For hyping up the incident, to quote \"attack and smear China\". An editorial in Chinese state media also asked why China would be so clumsy enough to rush spy balloons into U.S. air space, when China already has more advanced reconnaissance satellites. So we're left with this mystery of why Beijing let this happen. Was it deliberate? Was it an accident?

We've seen the camera shaking from time to time from those intense winds.The actual temperature right now at Mount Washington is minus 27. Yes, that's the actual temperature. When you factor in the 82 mile per hour wind, that is category one hurricane strength it makes that feels like temperature -- the wind chill of minus 77, so that's what it would feel like on any exposed areas of skin. So if you're not wearing a scarf or a hat or even gloves, it is going to be bitter cold and dangerously cold on those exposed areas of your body. We still have wind chill warnings and wind chill advisories. A lot of these are set to expire, in about the next one to two hours, as those temperatures will finally start to rebound. It is not just Mount Washington that is super cold though. Take a look Portland, Maine, feels like minus 19. Boston, minus 18. Providence, Rhode Island, minus 13 even Albany feeling like it is minus 17 right now. The good news, we talked about and as Gloria talked about as well -- this is a very intense, but short-lived cold blast of air.

But by tomorrow, that high is 48. And that's actually 10 degrees warmer than their average high this time of the year. And New York, Buffalo, Portland, all of them the same, and the temperatures are actually going to rebound to be above normal, by tomorrow. The reason for this cold air, however, has been the polar vortex. Now, under normal stable conditions, the polar vortex can keep all of that extremely cold air really confined up around the North Pole. The difference is when you start seeing these waves or these intermittent breaks and dips in the jet stream, that is what allowed that cold air to be pushed farther south into latitudes that we would not normally see. In this particular case, we are starting to see a lot of that the extremely cold air being pushed into areas of New England and the northeast and Canada as well.

Memphis police say former officer Preston Hemphill has been terminated for violating multiple department policies including personal conduct and truthfulness for his actions during the arrest.Two first responders have also now had their licenses suspended. The medical services division says that Robert Long and Jamichael Sandridge waited 19 minutes to provide even basic aid to Nichols. CNN's Nadia Romero is joining us now. So what more do we know about the actions of the officer and the medics following what they came upon?",

      "sentences": "Yes. Well, let's talk about the medics first because they arrived on scene and then you see someone, Tyre Nichols, who is leaning up against a patrol car, not able to be up on his own, slumping over, obviously has an injury, 19 minutes. 19 minutes go by before any aid is rendered. And that is why those two EMTs were fired. The other allegation is that they didn't do enough, once they came on the scene, that they had this duty to act and did not. And this is important, because their licenses have been suspended, so that means they can't just go to the next county over, and just get a job, they no longer have that license.And that is a complaint that we heard from civil rights activists for many years that police officers, EMTs, when they have wrongdoings that they just go to another department and they don't seem to have any kind of a repercussion. So that is significant here with the EMTs. When we talk about the police officers, we now have six Memphis police officers who have been fired, and that includes this officer, Hemphill who is now facing violations of company policy, department policy, personal conduct, Truthfulness, questions about how he used his taser. And this is significant in this case, because we know that the police report, what the officer said happened, and what we saw in that awful video, did not line up, did not match. But his lawyer had this to say, take a look at the statements released to CNN, saying that these charges are about policy violations, and are not criminal charges. He says, \"While we disagree with Preston Hemphill's termination from the Memphis Police Department, Mr. Hemphill will continue to cooperate with all investigating agencies into the death of Tyre Nichols. So he joins the other five officers who have been indicted, fired and indicted, with severe charges, including second-degree murder, and aggravated assault. I mean those are serious charges amongst a bevy, a long list of charges that these five officers are already facing. And I want you to hear from the grandmother of Tyre Nichols. She explains what she wants these officers to know about her grandson. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHNNIE LARAY HONEYCUTT, TYRE NICHOLS' GRANDMOTHER: My baby was a skateboarder. He worked at FedEx. And he had the best mother and stepfather in the world. Why would you want to do that to him? (END VIDEO CLIP) ROMERO: You hear the pain in her voice. You can see it in her face. Remember though, none of this would be happening, Fred, if it weren't for his grandmother, his siblings, his parents, pushing for more information. They wanted to see the body cam footage, they wanted to know more. They said what the police said about Tyre didn't match up to how they knew him. There is also now the mayor saying that there will be an independent investigation. So a lot of times we have the police departments that investigate themselves. Not this time. An independent investigation looking into how this department is ran, so that can be training, that could be culture, that could be the Scorpion Unit or the excessive force units or use of force units. So we have an independent investigation that is pending as well.",

      "sentences": "Right. Well, CNN has learned that long before the leak of that opinion, as you said, the security protocols especially when it came to documents were really lax at the Supreme Court. Now that could have led to the leak but it also hindered the investigation into the leak.For instance, for many years some justices, as you said, they didn't want to put some -- they put some sensitive information into personal e-mails. Now that information belonged on secure servers. But for whatever reason and maybe it was a hesitancy to use the technology, the justices didn't put it there. And the source told me that he wasn't suggesting that that means that a justice leaked an opinion, but at the very least, the justices were setting a bad example -- setting a bad example about how to take care of sensitive information. In another area, as you said, there are these burn bags. Burn bags are meant for sensitive information that's going to be either burned or shredded down the line. At the Supreme Court, the burn bags would often may be collected, put in bins in the basement. The bins would be locked and the shredding company would come and pick it up. But the problem with it is that there was no uniform policy among the chambers about how to deal with this. Each chamber was different. So one source told me that sometimes someone would staple a burn bag closed. Other times they would pile up under the desk. Sometimes they would be piled up in the hallways outside of chambers. Now, those hallways were non-public, but still that is no way to be dealing with sensitive information. Now, the marshal of the Supreme Court, Fred, when she released that report, she did say there were a lot of security concerns. Chief justice John Roberts himself has authorized this comprehensive look into how to better handle documents. But you know, for this leak that so rocked not only the court but the country, all of that comes too late, Fred.",
