Why the case was suddenly thrown out. Good evening. I'm Jim Acosta, in for Laura Coates on this Friday night. Remember that Republican congressman a few weeks ago who said President Biden may be jacked up on Mountain Dew heading into that debate with Donald Trump? Tonight, it appears the president was jacked up on something, something called defiance. Now, defiance do -- doesn't exactly roll off the tongue, but they were drinking it up at the president's rally in Michigan earlier this evening. We're going to show some of that to you. The president, to put it mildly, made it clear he is not going anywhere, at least for now. Despite the drumbeat of calls for him to get out of the race, breathless op-eds like this one from \"The Washington Post\" are rolling off his back. Quote -- \"Biden remains in denial. He needs to come to grips with reality,\" said the Post. But this was the reality in the battleground state of Michigan earlier this evening. A cheering crowd in Detroit. Take a listen.

And it's not just chaos. It is that Project 2025 that President Biden outlined tonight in a speech. And I want to share something else with you, because we did a stop at a restaurant in Northville, Michigan. This is the suburbs of Detroit. It's a community I used to represent. And I campaigned there very rigorously when I was flipping a seat in Michigan that voted for Donald Trump. And the restaurant we went to is called \"The Garage.\" I spent a lot of time in \"The Garage\" on the campaign trail, a lot of time in Northville. They still have a Republican township supervisor there. And I'll tell you that not only was the president engaged off- script, making people laugh, painting his vision for this nation, but there was a crowd in a small suburban town amassed, excited, engaged. These are those suburban voters. We need to win. Those are those swing state voters. Donald Trump couldn't do that. He'd be booed. He doesn't have the stamina.

That's a separation of powers issue. They weren't ready to proceed to the preliminary hearing. They had to dismiss, wait for a year, and go back to the grand jury. And now, the greatest violation of all, the Brady violation, withholding exculpatory evidence intentionally. That's grounds for the ultimate sanction, which is dismissal of the case with prejudice.

But they can't unilaterally decide what evidence to present -- present and what evidence to withhold. They have to disclose everything. That's something, Jim, that every first- year law student knows. And when Morrissey took the stand and when she testified that it was a willful withholding, that was enough for the judge.
