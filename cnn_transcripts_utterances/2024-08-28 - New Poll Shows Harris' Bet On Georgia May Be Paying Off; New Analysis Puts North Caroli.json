New polling just breaking showing massive surge for Harris. Can Democrats win the battleground state? And a Russia style oligarchy. A former Trump adviser says the former president wants to establish one here in the U.S., and then he'll use Project 2025 to do it. He'll be OUTFRONT. And an OUTFRONT investigation tonight. Dozens of pro-Trump social media accounts are using stolen photos of social media influencers, female ones. Is that the work of state actors pushing Trump? Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, on the ground in Georgia, a massive gamble by Vice President Harris. A new polling released just moments ago show that that gamble may be paying off. A new poll coming out from Fox just moments ago shows that Harris is ahead in the state of Georgia, margin of error three points. Her lead is two. So, right now, neck and neck, no clear leader. But you see, 50 to 48, and it comes as Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are wrapping up their bus tour today in the state. It is their first appearance together since the Democratic convention. Here they are. You're looking at in Savannah appearing together in a restaurant moments ago, doing the hand-to-hand of campaigning there earlier, they stopped in the town of Hindsville, which is about 40 miles southwest of Savannah, where high school students performed for them.

      "sentences": "All right. Harris doing that in Georgia going all in in Georgia is a big deal. It shows a competence and perhaps internal polling that was not what we were seeing publicly until he literally a few moments ago. Until a few minutes ago when that Fox poll crossed, the latest public polling had Trump well ahead of Harris in Georgia, 51 to 44 percent. That's a big gap politically.And we wondered, maybe Harris had some internal numbers that showed something very different because every day and every hour count, this close to the actual election, and Harris is clearly making a play as if Georgia is neck and neck, and she's spending time not just in Democratic areas around Savannah, but in rural areas that voted heavily for Trump. And here's how we can tell that this isn't just window dressing and one bus tour. Harris now has 24 field offices up and running and Georgia, by comparison, as of early last week, according to \"The L.A. Times\", Trump had about a dozen. Harris has opened offices in rural counties in deep red Georgia, where Trump has traditionally done incredibly well. In fact, one new Harris office is in the world town of Cordell, in a county that Trump won by 25 points in 2020. Now the town of Cordell, though, itself, is nearly 70 percent black. Harris's campaign thinks she can run up the vote there. And the math works like this. Harris doesn't need to win that county. She probably not trying to win a county that she lost by 25 points. She just needs to narrow the margin and do a little bit better because we all remember when it came to the entire state of Georgia last time, that margin was incredibly tight, Biden won Georgia by 11,779 votes. We all know that number now, a mere 0.3 of a percentage point. And as for Trump, by the way, he also is acting like maybe his internal polls show he has a Georgia problem, too. He's acting like that Fox poll breaking moments ago that shows Harris ahead is accurate, not the recent polling showing Trump comfortably in the lead. Why do we know that? Because Trump is doing something he hates to do. And rarely if ever actually does, which is eating crow. He is fawning over Georgia Governor Brian Kemp. Kemp is actually set to attend a fundraiser for Trump in Georgia graciously supporting Trump, even though Trump's feelings about Kemp have been loud and clear. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT &amp; 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He's a bad guy. He's a disloyal guy and he's a very average governor. Little Brian, little Brian Kemp. Brian Kemp is truly a embarrassment to the Republican Party. And this guy's a disaster. He's a disaster. I'm ashamed that I endorsed him. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That's why their strategy really boils down to losing by less in those Republican leaning rural counties. And that's where they're trying to employ an aggressive strategy, kicking off with this bus tour with the vice president and her vice presidential nominee, Tim Walz, today.Now, the person that is helping lead this, deputy campaign manager, Quentin Fulks, it's a playbook he's familiar with. Of course, he led Senator Raphael Warnock's December 2022 runoff. And during that period of time, they found success in shaving off votes from Republicans in these rural counties while winning big in Metro Atlanta. So when I spoke to the deputy campaign manager, he told me, look, this is a strategy that we think we can pull off, again, this presidential -- this presidential year because they're anticipating higher voter turnout. Remember, he was working with a runoff and he thinks at the campaign being aggressive with offices in the area, as well as with his visit from the vice president can really help boost their chances. Now, Democratic strategists that I've spoken with in the state also say, don't count out Tim Walz. Remember, he has a rural upbringing, he also has roots with football and is military background, and they think that that could really help the ticket in these rural counties that he could resonate with voters. So this stop is also an opportunity for them to test out how he fares with these folks. And, of course, the vice president's going to conclude this with a rally tomorrow. And, of course, that sit down interview with our Dana Bash. So her time here is certainly not over yet.",

She has consolidated Black voters. She's done better with Latino voters, homes of the Democratic Party that frankly Joe Biden was just leaving on the floor because the old folks have problems with his candidacy. Now, that she has brought those back into the fold, there is a much wider math for her when we look at the Electoral College, and that actually puts pressure on folks like Trump to defend places like Georgia. And let's remember, this is an opportunity partially because Donald Trump has created rifts within his own party there. You know, you mentioned the kind of attacks that Brian Kemp, but what they did in 2020, which, of course, Quentin Fulks is very familiar with in the Harris campaign, is they capitalize off a weak Senate candidates that the Republicans had. Kelly Loeffler, Herschel Walker, and allow people like Raphael Warnock to do better in the Metro Atlanta areas while also consolidating those losses in rural areas. You can't just win through voter motivation in Georgia. You need motivation and persuasion there.

Well, you can see it in the data just in the little over a month since Harris has been in the race, the polling has shifted seven points in her favor. So this is taking it from a race where Biden was down by seven to raise that as you said, is now tied. And it's not just the polling. Look at the travel and the spending by the campaigns. If you look at where Donald Trump has gone, basically in the last month, six weeks, he's been in North Carolina as often as he's been in Pennsylvania.

He had to real stops during this visit. You're looking at one of them right now, laying to wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown soldier. That is an area where photographers, the press pool was actually there could see it, could photograph, could film as you're seeing on the screen right now. After that, Trump had a private meeting with some of the family members of those service members, and then went to Section 60 where veterans of recent conflicts are buried with some of those families. It is there where it was made clear to the Trump team that there is not -- the idea of photography or any type of video was not allowed. In fact, it's against federal law to do any election-related activities at a military burial ground. That is apparently where the dispute actually occurred. Now, the Trump team has pushed back very hard saying there was no physical altercation and the former president put out a statement from some of those family members, said, quote, we had given our approval for President Trump's official videographer and photographer to attend the event, ensuring these sacred moments of remembrance were respectfully captured. And so we can cherish these memories forever. Now, that doesn't mean that they supersede the federal law that exists, which is at the heart of this dispute. Chris LaCivita, the co- chair of the -- or co-campaign manager of the Trump campaign, put out a much sharper statement saying for a despicable individual to physically prevent President Trump's team from accompanying him to this solemn event is a disgrace and does not deserve to represent the hallowed grounds of Arlington National Cemetery. The cemetery officials themselves have not gone beyond the initial statements saying the only there was an incident and a report was filed.

So when you heard that his team got into an altercation with a cemetery official as they tried to film the visit. You see Chris LaCivita talks about that there was physical prevention. What was your reaction?",

Obviously, that's changed, but at one point, I'm just saying even have a different perspective. We've heard in Trump's own words how he talks about veterans. I mean, just a few days ago when he claimed the presidential medal of freedom, which was awarded to civilians, is better than the medal of honor given by Congress to people who have suffered great losses in war. Here's what he said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT &amp; 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It's actually much better because everyone gets the congressional medal of honor, that's soldiers. They're either in very bad shape because they've been hit so many times by bullets, or they're dead. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

SCARAMUCCI:  Well, I think it's true to his nature. He has an ambivalence. I do believe what General Kelly said that he called people that were volunteering to defend our freedom suckers and losers. He absolutely did that. The right-wing says he didn't do it. Trump lies about saying in that. But there's an ambivalence, there's always two sides to Mr. Trump. Remember, in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August of 2017, very fine people on both sides. And then of course, he denounced the rally. So he gives enough evidence to his supporters to continue to gaslight them. So he's ambivalent. He's certainly there to support those people who are mourning. At the flip side is down deep as evidenced by that speech. He actually thinks that they're suckers and losers.",

I think she must have known him if she did that. And I want them to love history. History is diminishing and courses in high school now, and it makes me really sad. So I think the way to get them interested in history is through biography. That's how I became interested. When you read about a person and his stories, not just facts and figures, you remember them. So I start when they're young when there, before they're like when they before they become icons before their monuments, before their faces are on the currency when they're going to make mistakes, when they have an uncertain path, when they find there vocation. And all four of these people found politics to be an honorable vocation, all four of them went through terrific adversities in their lives, but they became stronger themselves.
