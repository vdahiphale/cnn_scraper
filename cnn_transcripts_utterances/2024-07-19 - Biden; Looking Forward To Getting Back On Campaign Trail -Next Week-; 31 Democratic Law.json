But campaign chair, Jen O'Malley Dillon, said on this call that they are focused on voter contact right now.Obviously, the President has made clear that he's staying in the race and the campaign is really telling their staff what we are doing is reaching out to voters. She said at one point, when you give me polls, I'm going to give you direct voter contact. I'm also told that she said people in our country are not watching cable news just on the voter contact part. The reason that this is significant is because this is sort of the central argument that we are starting to see from the campaign on the reason for the President staying in. They're essentially saying what is more important to us right now than what the polls are telling us is what the voters are telling us. And O'Malley Dillon did talk about this a little bit on the air earlier today. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JENNIFER O'MALLEY DILLON, BIDEN-HARRIS CAMPAIGN CHAIR: We go out and we're door knocking just this week. So this isn't in the past. This is this week. Did about a hundred door knocks, 76 percent of those people we knocked on doors and we talked to are with Joe Biden, about 16 percent or so. That's undecided. They have questions, you know, is he in this race, what's going to happen. And then a small percentage that are not available to us. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

All right, Chuck. Tell us this moment that we are at right now in this race. How would you describe where we're at on the Democratic side of things? CHUCK ROCHA, FMR. SENIOR ADVISER, BERNIE SANDERS' 2016 &amp; 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS: I'd say control chaos. I think that there's trying to be controlled with the party. Now, I've run a presidential campaign and one of the few people who has. And what you saw Jennifer O'Malley doing is trying to get a handle on it. When you talk about having an all staff call, those don't happen all the time, but they happen at times of tragedy. I was running a presidential campaign when a guy had a heart attack one time in Nevada. I was in the office, Bernie's office, when that went down. We had to control things and get control over emotions. And that's what you see now. The hardest part of this is what you're reporting on now is all these members of Congress, though, people that he's worked with. He's an animal of the Senate like this is really hard when you start hearing rumors about Nancy Pelosi. But right now, the campaign wants to control this and keep people focused on thousands of doors that they're knocking, the infrastructure that they're building, their fundraising.

Overwhelmingly, they do not believe that Joe Biden can recover to win. I think donors overwhelmingly do not believe that he can recover to win. And that has a real bite on, you know, self-fulfilling prophecy to some extent.And I think elected officials who were very hesitant to challenge him publicly because they have great respect for Biden. And the phrase I heard a week ago often was we have to give him the grace and the space to do this. They are growing more and more impatient. I mean, you know, if you look at the - at the alternative, which is most likely rallying around Vice President Kamala Harris, I think Democrats believe she may have a lower floor, but she almost certainly has a higher ceiling, you know, that - with Biden, you are kind of locked in concrete at this point, where the President's approval rating has been stuck at 40 percent or below since the summer of '23, 70 percent saying he's too old. Most people who have been in the room, to use Chuck's phrase, do not believe you can recover from that despite all the resistance to Trump. And with Harris, it could go badly.

So I think that was probably the point where some of his allies were holding themselves really tight, the same allies who were telling us that he was going to deliver a full hour long speech on unity and ending political divisiveness.Now what we think we're going to see on Saturday, what we learned from yesterday is that Donald Trump is Donald Trump. He is going to continue to campaign on the same exact things that he thinks make him popular and really is red meat to his conservative base. Talking about immigration, as you said, talking about a stolen election. But what we're looking for tomorrow is not necessarily that speech. We already saw him kind of go off topic and get away from this idea of unity. What we're looking for now is how he interacts with J.D. Vance. This is his vice presidential candidate. The thing to keep in mind is that so many people around us told us that part of the reason he chose J.D. Vance as his running mate was because of the chemistry they had, because of the connection they had. We're going to possibly be able to see that for the first time on stage tomorrow. So far, we've really just seen them kind of sitting next to each other. We've seen some reaction shots of each other, looking at each other while they speak, but not actually seeing how they run a campaign together. And this is going to be our first opportunity for that. Boris, the other thing to keep in mind is that this is the first rally since that assassination attempt last Saturday. So what we're also watching for, what have they done to change the kind of atmosphere and security to make it better protected for both President Trump, for the crowd, and for now the vice presidential nominee, J.D. Vance. We are hearing that this is going to be incredibly secure, that it's going to have more security than they've ever had at a rally because they've had to rethink protocols, et cetera. But what that looks like, we'll wait and see. One thing to note, this rally tomorrow is inside. Notable, given that the Secret Service had expressed some trepidation about having these outdoor rallies, though it wasn't an express concern about the one that we saw last weekend, as far as our reporting indicates. Kristen Holmes, thanks so much for the reporting. Still ahead on CNN NEWS CENTRAL, school shooters and bomb building instructions, two things that investigators say the man who shot Donald Trump was researching in the days and weeks before the attack.",

I'm seeing people now working the kiosks. Before that was not possible. We were actually seeing airline staff having to check people in manually, calling out flights by city, by flight number and order, prioritizing them by their departure time, so a huge headache. We saw those huge lines of people just waiting for answers, hoping and praying that they could in fact make their flight.
