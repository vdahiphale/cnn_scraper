The decision had been under consideration for months as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pressed Washington for the green light in the hopes of changing the moment of the war. But U.S. officials have been divided and concerned it could have escalated the conflict. A U.S. official says the weapons are to be used primarily in Russia's Kursk region for now, where Moscow has deployed nearly 50,000 troops to try to take back territory. Thousands of North Korean troops are among those taking part in the Russian offensive. President Zelenskyy, with this message after news of the U.S. decision. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE (through translator): Today, there's a lot of talk in the media about us receiving permission for respective actions, but strikes are not carried out with words. Such things are not announced. Missiles will speak for themselves. They certainly will. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

A spokesperson for the U.N. secretary-general says he strongly condemns these latest Russian strikes on energy infrastructure, which will only increase the suffering of Ukrainians heading into the winter months. And joining me now is Mick Ryan, a retired major general in the Australian army, former commander at the Australian Defense College. And his latest and recently released book is \"The War for Ukraine: Strategy and Adaptation Under Fire.\" Always good to see you, Mick. I want to start off with the reporting that President Biden is authorizing something Ukraine wanted for a long, long time. Those long-range weapons inside Russia. How might that impact this conflict? And is there a risk it could be too little, too late? MAJ. GEN. MICK RYAN (RET.), AUSTRALIAN ARMY: Yes. G'day, Michael. Unfortunately, these missiles are probably going to have a very, very limited impact on this conflict. They've probably come about a year too late. The dithering in the Biden administration has given the Russians heaps of warning to be able to adapt and move their forces. And frankly, Putin would be very satisfied that he's deterred the Biden administration this long from providing these missiles.",
