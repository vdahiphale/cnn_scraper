A Georgia judge has just dismissed several charges against the former president and some of his co- defendants in that sprawling, racketeering and conspiracy case he's facing in the Peach State. He and more than a dozen others are accused of trying to overturn his 2020 election loss there.A total of six of the 41 counts have been thrown. The judge saying that prosecutors committed a, quote, fatal mistake in filing the charges he ordered be dropped. And one of the dismissed charges involves defendants' interactions with Georgia's Secretary of State, Brad Raffensperger, who you'll remember received this infamous phone call from Trump in 2021.

It involves not only former President Trump. But over a dozen other defendants. They've already gotten some plea deals. The case won't die, Boris, if Fanie Willis is disqualified. It will be handed off to another office. But all of that will result in delays.And Fanie Willis already said she wanted to start this case in August.

Fifty Democrats voted against it. Fifteen Republicans voted against it. The rest of them voted for it, siding with those national security concerns over the concerns over freedom of speech.Now, former President Donald Trump had publicly come out against this, even though he had supported banning TikTok in the past, reversing his posture, citing in part the fact that potentially that Facebook could benefit from the possibility of TikTok being banned. He detests Facebook. He also met with a GOP megadonor who has a major stake in TikTok recently. But nevertheless, I had a chance to catch up with some of Donald Trump's closest allies who voted against this plan. And I asked them whether or not Trump had any influence on their vote.

The Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has been noncommittal about this, Brianna, saying just simply in a statement the Senate will review the legislation when it comes over from the House.He had indicated yesterday that the committees of jurisdiction would look into this matter further, and some of those chairmen of those key committees have their own ideas on how to do all this.

Whether or not this is the action that ends up making it through the Congress remains to be seen. But we can just see from the public evidence why that's the case. Employees of ByteDance have been caught inappropriately accessing the data of Americans multiple times, including spying on the journalists reporting on this very issue.TikTok has censored topics that are sensitive to the Chinese government. Research suggests they are suppressing content related to Beijings political aims. So, everybody knows we've got some sort of problem here. The question is, is this a solution that can pass muster both in Congress and then through the courts? And I think those are two big open questions right now. SANCHEZ: And Sarah, U.S. social media platforms are not available in China, and they have vowed, Beijing has vowed retaliation if TikTok is ultimately banned. How could China retaliate?

      "sentences": "Right. Well, as Sarah correctly mentioned, one of the levers that China has is their investment in U.S. companies. Another one is that they hold hostage U.S. investment in Chinese companies. And ByteDance is heavily leveraged with U.S. capital cash. From private equity firms who are run by donors, including Jeff Yass, the head of Susquehanna, KKR, and others. And it seems like they got to Trump. It seems like the makeup between the Club for Growth and Jeff Yass and the Trump team comes at a very convenient time for TikTok.And, you know, there's no direct quid pro quo, but you don't have to be crescent to figure out what's going on here. They've made an alliance heading into the general election. So that explains a lot of why we see what's going on here. But, you know, to be honest, Trump is so unpredictable that if he became president, he might just go back and change his mind again to the opinion that he had when he was president the last time, which is that we should ban TikTok. So, you know, the Chinese government and ByteDance are trying everything they can propaganda, lobbying money, leaning on U.S. investors in order to try to kill this legislation and at least to delay it until the election. And then if Trump wins, then all bets are off. SANCHEZ: As well as putting a prompt in the app asking users to contact their congresspeople in order to get this bill killed. It didn't work in the House. We'll see what the Senate does. But, Sarah, I'm wondering what the impression is you're getting from other executives in Silicon Valley, executives at other platforms like Meta and X, whether they're worried about regulation or what many see as First Amendment concerns tied to this specific piece of legislation.",

That's actually an open question, right? If we force ByteDance to divest TikTok to a U.S. firm, you see what the antitrust landscape is like. We're blocking mergers all the time. So I'd be curious to see who we'd even allow to buy it. But I think Silicon Valley is actually excited. I think companies like Meta see this as an opportunity to bolster reels, potentially if TikTok gets banned. So they're happy.On the First Amendment issues, you better imagine that any foreign app is looking at this and whether it would set a precedent because you can't just ban something. This is why I think if TikTok does, if this bill does pass, TikTok is going to appeal, right? They're definitely going to sue because you can't just ban something, you know, alleging national security concerns without major proof and not have that be a First Amendment issue. And by the way, you might not realize it, but we do use a lot of apps here in the U.S. that are from other countries. Think about it. How many ads do they have in the Super Bowl? Shein is one of the biggest fast fashion companies in the U.S. So it would set off a huge precedent that we would go through probably litigating in the courts for many months, if not years.",

And actually, for the past few days, we've seen these hearings on Capitol Hill with U.S. intelligence officials. And they did touch on the nuclear Russian capability. And they did talk about the fact that Russia is modernizing their arsenal, singling out the long-range nuclear capable missiles, as well as underwater delivery systems that are meant to penetrate or bypass the U.S. systems.Now, they do admit that Russia talks about their nuclear capabilities as an effort to deter the U.S. and other countries. But they say, quite importantly, that Russia is going to rely on its nuclear capabilities more because of these setbacks that they have been facing in Ukraine in terms of their ground forces and their vehicles and the other weaponry that have really suffered, immensely, over the past two years. So, Russia is focusing on its nuclear arsenal. And the U.S. acknowledges that Russia has gone quite,-- has gone a long way in terms of modernizing that arsenal. Brianna.",

He even used the word schnitzel at some point. He said that miraculously, though, his leg, which apparently was hit the most, was not broken in this incident, even though there were some pictures that came out of his leg afterwards, and it did not look good at all.
