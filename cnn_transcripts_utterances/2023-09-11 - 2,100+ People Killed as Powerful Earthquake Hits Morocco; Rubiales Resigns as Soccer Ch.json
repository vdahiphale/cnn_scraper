More than 2,100 people have now been confirmed killed, and rescuers continue to dig through rubble in a frantic search for survivors.The 6.8 magnitude quake was the strongest to hit Morocco in more than 120 years. And the death toll is expected to keep climbing as teams search collapsed homes in remote areas. Near the quake's epicenter in the Atlas Mountains, the scenes of destruction and devastation are obvious, with homes and small villages reduced to piles of rubble. One man who lost his young son said the earthquake hit as the family was just finishing their meal. He describes how a normal evening quickly turned tragic. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HAMID BEN HENNA, SON KILLED IN EARTHQUAKE (through translator): It all started at 11 p.m. or 11:30 p.m. We were having dinner. I asked my son to bring a knife from the kitchen to cut dessert. He didn't bring it, because as soon as he left the kitchen, an earthquake struck. He ran here, where you can see rubble. He was buried by one and a half to two meters of rubble. At night there was no electricity. We couldn't see at all. And stones were falling on us in the dark. I hurried, and luckily, there was a gate open. I helped my wife, who was injured, get out along with two other kids. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And that is exactly what it looks like.They didn't feel the ground shaking under them, they said. They felt and heard the sounds of explosions. Explosions from within and without their own homes. And explosions up in the hills. And 25 people were killed in the town of Moulay Brahim, which is just about three kilometers, a mile and a half or so from here. This is normally a tourist paradise, not just for foreigners but for locals, too. Some of the victims still being left buried under the rubble, because it's too dangerous to get them out, are actually Moroccans who were up in these mountains, enjoying the cooler temperatures in the summer. Everybody we're talking to here has got a complaint that the central government is really nowhere to be seen, in their words. We have seen some evidence of their help with these yellow tents, offering temporary accommodation here in Azni (ph). That's accommodation for 1,200 people who have lost their homes. All these homes are now uninhabitably dangerous. This area has been struck in the last 24 hours by at least four aftershocks, local people tell us. And they're saying they're just not getting the help they need. Inevitably, there's always going to be a level of frustration for people hit with this cataclysmic event.

The help coming just in time as rescuers face blocked roads and mountainous terrain as they search for survivors in some of the country's hard-to-reach villages.

All things Morocco needs as rescuers push deeper into the remote areas of the Atlas Mountains. Many countries have sent offers of help, and so far, Morocco has accepted assistance from some after what it says is careful assessment of its needs. On Sunday, the Moroccan king thanked Spain, Qatar, the UAE, and the U.K. for their support, which is beginning to funnel into the country. In Qatar, shipments of emergency vehicles were loaded on a transport plane bound for the quake zone. The Gulf also sending pallets of supplies and rescue personnel to the region. Help is also on the way from the U.K., with 60 search-and-rescue specialists joining the efforts.
