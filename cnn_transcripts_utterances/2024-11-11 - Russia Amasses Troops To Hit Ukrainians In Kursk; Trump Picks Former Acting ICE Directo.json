Elon Musk is camp town at Mar-a-Lago, according to sources talking to CNN weighing in on key staffing decisions as Donald Trump's second administration takes shape. And Russia has amassed tens of thousands of troops including North Koreans to hit Ukrainian positions in the Kursk Region. Well, the Trump transition is well underway, with choices announced for more key positions in the President-elect's second administration. Trump says he has chosen immigration hardliner Tom Homan to oversee the deportation of all undocumented immigrants from the United States. Homan served as acting director of ICE in the previous Trump White House. And just a few hours ago, the President-elect nominated New York Representative Elise Stefanik to serve as ambassador to the United Nations. She is a long-time Trump ally. Who Trump chooses next will be decided in talks at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida where loyalists have converged and activity, we are told, is buzzing. One near constant during the process is Elon Musk, the tech billionaire has been seen in conversations with Trump almost daily. What do we know? Well, I'm joined this hour by Priscilla Alvarez and CNN senior political analyst Mark Preston. Good to have you both on board. Priscilla, let's start with you. Walk us through what we know about Tom Holman, first and foremost.",

      "sentences": "So, Tom Homan was widely expected to hold some role in the incoming Trump administration especiallyfocused on immigration over the last several years. He's been a supporter of former President Donald Trump and a critic of the Biden administration, often taking more hard line approach to border security and interior enforcement. Now Tom Homan knows Immigration and Customs Enforcement well. He worked there for several years. And in talking to my sources, they tell me, look, Tom Homan has a grasp on the operational side of anything like mass deportation. He has been at the helm of it before. He understands the ins and outs, but he also understands the challenges when it comes to executing on a plan that would be detaining and deporting immigrants at a large scale. For example, he understands the contracting and the money and the resources that he would take to pull off something like this. So, on one end, some sources say, you know, this makes sense, but also because he has a grip on the reality of an operation like this, it will be telling to see how it unfolds, versus some other immigration choices that may be less familiar with the ins and outs of immigration law and the operations. But again, Tom Homan, he knows those that immigration to Customs Enforcement well, because of his time there. He knows those in the Trump orbit because over the last several years, he has been a big supporter of the former president and now president-elect. So, him being in this border czar role is one that, again, was expected, and it's telling that he's coming this time around. Remember, former President Donald Trump also selected him to serve as immigration czar in his first administration, which was a surprise to Tom Homan. He did not ultimately take that post but now he will be joining in this role, one that will keep him close to Donald Trump as again, he tries to shape the mass deportation campaign promise of the now president-elect.",

We are seeing a move byIsrael for full sovereignty over settlements in the West Bank. The country's finance minister, also in charge of the territory, says he has instructed his department to begin preparations for sovereignty. Bezalel Smotrich says with Donald Trump leading, heading back into power, \"the time has come.\" And I quote him there. Let's bring CNN Jeremy Diamond in from Tel Aviv. The time has come, says Smotrich. What do we understand to be the intention here and why now?",

      "sentences": "Well, Becky, what we are watching is one of the first ways in which Donald Trump's election appearsto be impacting policy inside of Israel and that is because Bezalel Smotrich's Israel finance minister who also oversees key departments within the Ministry of Defense responsible for settlements inside the West Bank is now ordering those departments to begin making preparations to establish full sovereignty over Israeli settlements in the West Bank, effectively annexing large swaths of the West Bank. Now we should be cautious here that these are initial steps laying the groundwork for annexation actions, but it doesn't necessarily mean that those will come anytime soon, but Smotrich is making his intentions and he is also making his reasons explicitly clear in a statement here, where he is making clear that he is taking these steps because of Donald Trump's election as the next President of the United States, which, of course, just happened last week. He believes that as a result of Trump's election that this is a \"important opportunity.\" He is calling it for Israel to take these steps, and he is also expressing confidence that this is a step that Donald Trump will support once he comes into office. And he's also making clear that he believes that this is a step that is necessary to remove what he calls the threat of a future Palestinian state. Now, in terms of whether or not this is something Donald Trump will support, we don't yet have comment from his camp, of course, yet. But what we can look at is what he actually did when he was in office during his first term as president. And in 2020 when his administration released their peace plan for this region, they indeed did lay out the United States recognizing Israel's sovereignty over settlements in The West Bank. It did not call for any territorial swaps between Israelis and Palestinians, which many other peace plants have envisioned. Instead, it said that the U.S. would recognize Israeli sovereignty over those settlements in the West Bank, in exchange for Israel agreeing to freeze any future settlement expansion for four years. So certainly, Smotrich and other right wingers inside the Israeli government, including the Israeli prime minister himself, see very clearly that they have a very strong ally in President Trump, you know, when he will come into office. The Israeli prime minister just yesterday, said that he spoke with Donald Trump three times in just the last week. And that, of course, signals the close cooperation that they are likely to have. We should note that Trump also spoke with the Palestinian Authority, President Mahmoud Abbas and according to Palestinian officials, Trump vowed that he would help to work to end the war in Gaza.

      "sentences": "We have seen some evidence that things have changed, but there are also humanitarianorganizations who say that on the whole, things are effectively as bad as they have been in Gaza. So, the U.S. government is going to have to weigh those two things but also weigh the specific actions that Israel has taken or hasn't taken on this long list of demands that they set out. One of those was demanding that there were at least 350 humanitarian trucks a day coming into Gaza. We'll have to see if that figure is met. But Becky, there's one part of this letter that I think gives us a good idea, potentially of how the Biden administration will respond, and that was the fact that they called for setting up a channel between the U.S. and Israel to discuss incidents of civilian harm. And that specific demand, they said they wanted to have the first meeting by the end of the month. That was obviously back in October. It is now mid- November and as far as we have been told by the State Department, that channel hasn't actually been set up. There haven't been any formal meetings on that specific topic. We also haven't seen there be any actual action taken against Israel because of that. So clearly, the Biden administration is giving them some wiggle room to try and get that channel set up. We'll have to watch and see if they're willing to give them the same wiggle room on this long list of demands that they made to Israel when it comes to improving the humanitarian situation in Gaza. And I think it's specifically important to note that even though the letter said that if they don't take this action, they may risk violating those laws that govern U.S. military assistance to Israel. They did use the word may in there. So even the U.S. government, in writing this letter, which was highly aggressive and very clear in terms of what they want to see from Israel, gave themselves some wiggle room to not potentially act on the day of this deadline, which, as you said, is Wednesday. So, watch and see what the State Department says, what the Biden administration says and what they ultimately do in terms of their action in responding to Israel and their actions to improve the humanitarian situation which continues really to grow worse on the whole.",

And they have their own grid so they can move faster than the rest of the country. 80 percent of the Inflation Reduction Act billions is in red districts, Republican districts, battery plants and new kinds of clean energy facilities. So, that will be hard to claw back once people are tasting the fruits of that. But in his first term, Donald Trump undid over 100 environmental protection laws. He gutted his environmental protection agencies. There's a big sort of paralyzing fear within those agencies now as to what he could do, firing people who are not loyal to him or partisan enough, and the brain drain when we need those smart folks, most of all, working together, from NASA to the Pentagon to the Department of Agriculture. All of that is threatened by Trump's stance on this. Maybe Elon Musk gets in his ear and convince him that climate change is real and that he's leaving trillions on the table and potential profits for American climate startups. He seems obviously very malleable in his beliefs, and maybe that's the best folks in Baku can hope for.",

That doesn't mean that all of them are sort of specialized North Korean troops, but because of the sheer number of them, that does offer Russia really significant assistance. So, 10 to 11,000 that equals, according to the Ukrainians, around three brigades. And so, they really could reinforce these Russian troops. And I'm told by this U.S. official, that tens of thousands of forces between the Russians and the North Koreans have -- are being assembled to carry out an operation against this Ukrainian held territory in western Russia. Now the top Ukrainian commander, General Syrskyi, he said that these are among the best Russian troops. He said that they are shock troops. And he praised the Ukrainians who are inside Russia for holding them at bay, because otherwise they would be inside Ukraine itself. And there is an expectation, Becky, that at some point those North Korean troops would also make their way into Ukraine proper.
