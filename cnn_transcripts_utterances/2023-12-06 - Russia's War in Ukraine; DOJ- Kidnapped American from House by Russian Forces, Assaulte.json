Now, CNN is unable to independently verify the size of the stockpile or exactly where it was found. But U.S. officials are now talking about how long they believe this phase of the Israeli ground operation against Hamas will last. For several weeks, they say. Multiple sources tell CNN that the IDF will then shift to hyper-localized -- a hyper-localized strategy targeting Hamas.CNN's Alex Marquardt is in Israel. Alex, tell us more about this timeline.",

      "sentences": "Well, John, there are major questions about how much longer Israel can keep up this pace, this intense pace of operations that we saw throughout the efforts in Northern Gaza, now we see it expanding into Southern Gaza. So, what my colleagues and I are hearing from U.S. and Israeli officials is that they are expecting high intensity operations like the ones we're seeing right now.And in fact, the IDF said just yesterday that yesterday was the most intense day of military operations they'd seen yet. They're expecting this high intensity phase, as they're calling it, to continue for several more weeks. And then, they say, the IDF is expected to switch to a lower intensity phase, if you will. One that would be a lot more localized, a lot more targeted, where the IDF would pull back, but would continue to carry out a counterterrorism operation, specific operations, for example against Hamas leadership. The U. S. has been warning publicly and privately that essentially the support for Israel is running out with the increasing humanitarian catastrophe. They have said -- the U.S. has said that they really don't want to see Israel carry out the same kind of operation in Southern Gaza that we saw in Northern Gaza in terms of the devastation, the destruction and the death to civilians. So, what that could mean for the next couple weeks, John, is that we could see this high intensity phase continue throughout the month of December. And then sources say it could transition to what could be a very long but lower intensity phase starting in January, John.",

Other as -- other victims of the opioid crisis who would be part of this settlement, I want to read some of what they have also said. One woman who lost two sons to opioid overdoses told \"The Wall Street Journal\" this, that I look at it, the settlement, as that money is going to be used to save lives. That money will be used as another mother -- so another mother doesn't have to bury her child, or the two, as I have. Do you wrestle with that?W. NELSON:  I do, every day, and I, and I sympathize with those families that are for the settlement. It -- it is not a lot of money. I mean, $6 billion may seem like a lot of money. It may seem like it's going to save lives, but we've been fighting this crisis for 25 years now. And 200 people a day are still dying. If you think about it, you know, $6 billion -- you hear about this $6 billion, you hear about this money going towards opioid abatement treatment facilities, et cetera. But what you don't hear about, and you didn't hear a word about it during the oral arguments, and I'm not sure the justices even are aware of it, but this $6 billion is paid payable out over 18 years. And if you think about it, you know, $6 billion paid out over 18 years, that's $330 million a year, divided up between 50 states. Divided up between all cities, towns, and even the Native American tribes, that money's not going to go very far. The Sacklers have $11 billion. They are so interested in saving lives. Pony up the money now, and we might change our position. You know, you've got -- you're sitting on $11 billion. Pony up $6 billion of it right now. Don't wait 18 years. It may be a real save lives. But over 18 years, 200 people a day are still going to die.",
