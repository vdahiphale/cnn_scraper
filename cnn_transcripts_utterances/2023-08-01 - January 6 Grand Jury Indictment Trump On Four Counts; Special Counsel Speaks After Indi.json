Take a look at the ethic complaint, everyone, and see how many times lawyers are involved in this as well. And also I'm pointing my attention particularly on this word, knowing, and what the president knew. There has been a lot of questions about how are they going to be able to get into the mind of Donald Trump or any defendant to suggest that they, in fact, were aware of what they knew and what they did not know to be the facts, and they go through great pains to actually outline pages seven through nine, frankly, that talk about, and only the people who were best positioned to know the facts, that he had often relied on these people for candid advice and ignored it. Now, in this instance, in a self-serving way, you talk about all the -- just to name a few, the secretary of the state of Georgia, the defendant's acting attorney general, the acting deputy attorney general, the defendants, the attorney general, the acting deputy, you're talking about the campaign manager, a secretary of state, more than one, the speaker of the House, other people, the majority leader of the Senate, all these people who were in a position to know and negate these facts. And so if you're looking -- how do you prove this in a court of law? How do you convince a jury that says, listen, he's not going to necessarily state all these things in open court, for example, in testifying, but how do you have the contextual clues? And I remind people back when January 6th, when the congressional hearing took place, they talked about an ongoing threat. Congresswoman Liz Cheney spoke about an ongoing threat. They talk about an ongoing threat. Many of the things that are actually outlined in this, in this very significant criminal indictment, he continues to do. He continues to talk about that he believes he's won the election, in spite of the breadth of evidence that's available to him and from people who would be, again, in the position to know the truth.",

He's telling -- even though it's long, he's breaking it down, he's making it simple. We will talk about the judge he got. She's known as a tough judge. She moves cases fast. Smith tells a story in here.First, Trump pressured the states, the state officials. When that didn't work, he got fake electors. Then he turned to his own Justice Department. In desperation, then to the vice president, and, finally, he fanned the flames of the violence. That's a simple story. You can tell it in one sentence. And then these counts capture that story. It's a conspiracy to defraud the United States because you are not allowed to take the truth of Joe Biden winning and have these schemes to say, no, I won. It is an attempt to obstruct a proceeding in Congress because they squeezed Pence not to do the right thing, and then the violence, and then finally it is a conspiracy against civil rights. That's the kicker. Why? 81 million Biden voters whose rights would have been deprived. You can describe the whole case in one paragraph. That is a master stroke.

One of the things that he did there is he connected what the former president was doing, what he perpetrated by spreading lies about alleged fraud when he knew, according to prosecutors, when he knew that there was no evidence to support his claims of fraud.What he has done in this indictment is tied the violence, as we saw, on January 6th, of course, the very vivid pictures that we have seen of police officers defending the Capitol, defending the lives of members of Congress as they were trying to fulfill their ceremonial function of certifying the vote, tying all of those acts there on January 6th with the former president's overall scheme to try to remain in power. They describe in this indictment, Wolf, that during the time of the violence the former president was still trying to press members of Congress to essentially try to somehow put off the vote, trying to make sure that even if Vice President Pence was not agreeing to his scheme, that members of Congress, perhaps, could find a way to buy him more time and, again, find a way for him to remain in power. And so that's what you see in this 45-page document that you heard there from the special counsel trying to make sure people understood that this was not just about politics. It is not about -- they acknowledge that the former president had the right to challenge the vote. He has a right to lie about fraud and everything. What he does not have a right to do, according to prosecutors, is to do -- is to carry out these three conspiracies as a way to try to remain in power.

So, it started out as one kind of plan where he's making phone calls, he's calling Brad Raffensperger, he's saying you have got the votes hidden somewhere, you have got to do this. And then when that failed, the last-ditch attempt, as he points out here, was to create this fake elector theory, which, of course, was fake and goes through it and goes the desperation, I think, of what was going on in his mind.",

It just speaks to what we were really told about this indictment was. It was going to underscore over and over. Finally, there is one thing here, I think, maybe new toward the end on page 33. It mentions here, it is talking about Mike Pence, and it says the former vice president on December 29th, as reflected in the vice president's contemporaneous notes, the defendant, Donald Trump, told the vice president that the Justice Department was finding major infractions.

And we've seen this in these other indictments as well. Even if there is something revealing, even if there is a surprise, they are going to continue to hammer that this is election interference.And I will tell you that this week, I spoke to a number of political advisers, but also a number of allies who felt so much more confident in that argument, particularly after That New York Times poll this week that showed Trump leading by such a big margin. They looked at this one spot in the poll particularly where it shows head-to-head contest with Ron DeSantis, and it has Trump leading by a number of points. They believe this indicates that Trump is likely to be the GOP frontrunner. And because of that, they believe that they have an argument that this is election interference. Now, of course, given what he is being charged with here, that is incredibly ironic, but they do believe that this messaging is resonating with voters and even allies who are somewhat hesitant about all of these legal issues do believe they are seeing voters resonate with some of this. And it was very clear how prepared Trump's team was for this message because almost immediately after this indictment came out, we started hearing from Trump sources on the Hill, from his allies, from senators, congressman, all things we should defund the FBI, the special counsel, all saying that this was election interference, this was all because of Joe Biden.

They have put cameras at every place that Trump has been, whether it is at Mar-a- Lago, whether it's going to New York, whether it's going from here in Bedminster down to Florida, they want to create their own narrative around this.

REP. ZOE LOFGREN (D-CA): Well, Wolf, I just had a chance to skim the indictment. I want to read it in detail. But it sure looks like the facts that were cited follow what the January 6th committee was able to unveil to the public. As you know, we thought those actions were criminal in nature, and, apparently, upon our referral, the Department of Justice did as well. Attempting to overthrow the government is pretty serious stuff. And it's worth noting that, you know, it is a continuing threat. I mean, in December on Truth Social, Mr. Trump announced he intended to terminate the Constitution if he was re-elected. So, this misconduct, this criminal behavior, needs to be addressed by a jury. We, as a committee, felt that we had evidence warranting prosecution. And, you know, I don't feel joyful today. This is a sad day that an ex-president would have committed such terrible things that the Department of Justice had to bring an indictment. On the other hand, the good news is we're a country of laws, and no one is above the law.

BLITZER: Before I let you go, Congresswoman, I want to get your reaction to part of this statement that the Trump campaign released after this criminal indictment of Trump.

It describes on December 23rd, we know that Mark Meadows went down to Georgia, went to look at the Cobb County vote count. And the purpose of that was to try to reassure the former president that everything was being done to find his claims, to find proof of his claims of fraud. And he comes back, and he tells the former president, he notified the former president that state election officials were conducting themselves in an exemplary fashion. That's a quote that appears to come from Mark Meadows to the former president, again, that they would find fraud if it existed. The defendant, according to special counsel Jack Smith says, he tweeted that the Georgia officials who were doing this, he says that they were terrible people. So Mark Meadows comes back from being down in Cobb County, Georgia and says, look, everything is doing what they can to find fraud and they are exemplary people. Trump takes that and still goes out and attacks the Georgia officials, the Cobb County officials and calls them terrible people. It gives you an impression here, Erin, it is not very -- obviously, they don't name Mark Meadows, but we know that he did testify, he did provide testimony to the investigators, and we know that he is probably one of the most important witnesses, alongside Mike Pence, of course -- Erin.",

As Zoe Lofgren said, we heard in painstaking, powerful detail from witness after witness during the January 6th hearings, committee hearings in the last year this story unfolding much the way Jack Smith is telling it here. And yet -- and yet as we sit here today, 2/3 of Republicans still say that Biden was illegitimately elected. They believe what Jack Smith called a lie today. And 86 percent of them said they didn't think Trump should be criminally charged in relation to January 6th. And, you know, the result of that is you see a cavalcade of statements from Republican politicians tonight not -- not expressing concern about the contents of the indictment but indicting the prosecutors, indicting the Justice Department, essentially amplifying Trump's story.

It says in here that he was keeping contemporaneous notes and then in that context as it lays it out, it becomes clear that some of the things Mike Pence is saying happened are literally from those notes. Is this something you knew him to do and in a level of painstaking detail? OLIVIA TROYE, WORKED AT THE WHITE HOUSE DURING FEBRUARY 2020 MEETING: Yes, actually. You know, it's interesting that you point that out because actually that line really stood out to me. And I was having this vision of Mike Pence sitting there with a black sharpie and his note card writing down the conversation that was happening. Again, this is happening when he's doing that and it talks about the notes, this is after he had already been repeatedly sort of bullied by Trump and sort of cornered by all of these individuals being told that you will do this, you have the power to overturn this election. You can -- you know, fake electors, let them in, certify all of this. We'll lean on the Justice Department, I read in there. Maybe they can do something. Each time Mike Pence has the same response of like, no, I cannot do this, and he counters it. I think the other thing that stood out was Christmas Day, so typical of my former boss calling the president up and saying, merry Christmas, Mr. President, and Trump, of course, responds with, let's talk about the election, right? I think that was just so telling because that's just so typical of the dynamic there between the two of them. But, you know, as a homeland security person who watched the chaos around the country and the threats, I just wanted to follow up on David's point because when I -- when I think about this indictment today and I think about a big step towards accountability with what happened here these past couple of years that the country has lived through. I think about the election workers that have faced the threats because of this lie -- a lie that is now being very clearly laid out in the judicial process, in this indictment about what really happened here and how Donald Trump knew what he was doing.

He did not win it.And this attorney thinks that none of these co-conspirators are going to escape legal consequences.",

      "sentences": "Exactly. BLITZERGovernor, thank you so much for joining us. First, I want to get some reaction to this truly historic and solemn moment in U.S. history. The former president of the United States, Trump, now officially criminally charged for his efforts to try to overturn the 2020 presidential election. GOV. CHRIS SUNUNU (R), NEW HAMPSHIRE: Well, for most of us obviously it's a shock, right? I mean, I think a lot of us knew that this indictment was probably coming, but when you look at the grand scheme of what it means to have a former president of these serious charges, it's beyond unprecedented. On the political side, it just reaffirms there's no way this guy can win in November of '24. I'm sitting here in the first of the primary, was out campaigning with various candidates today. And it just really affirms that there's no independent out there going, yeah, I might go with Trump now. You know, I've changed my mind. We're back on -- no. Not going to happen. Never going to happen. And the Trump supporters, if you will, that have kind of been drinking the Kool-Aid quite a bit lately, the best part about this is the fact that Trump knew he didn't win. He didn't buy any of what he was spitting out publicly. He was lying to his supporters. He knows he didn't win. That's going to be laid out. And it's -- again, it's just shocking to know that we've come this far. It's even more shocking to know this probably isn't the last indictment. I mean, this one is extremely severe. And I think -- I honestly think Trump is more nervous about this one, I know he is. We've already talked to people on his team today, he's more nervous about this one than any of the others because so many other folks involved. Not just Mark Meadows. There were so many folks involved in that conversation and many of those folks are no longer part of his inner circle. He no longer controls that narrative with those individuals. He's scared and he knows this one -- you know, I think the discussion of when it comes to bear, when the trial actually comes, but he knows this one could really stick.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. These criminal charges raise very serious questions, Governor, about Trump's fitness to serve again and yet -- yet he's leading your party's 2024 field with 54 percent of the vote according to the most recent polls. How do you explain that?",

      "sentences": "Well, the national polls, you've got to not look at the national polls. The national polls are based on the national message, which is mainstream media. I'm not casting aspersions on mainstream media, but the mainstream media talks about Biden, they talk about Trump. That really drives the message. When you look at the polls within Iowa and New Hampshire, it's a verydifferent story. In New Hampshire, I think he's averaging under 40 percent. In Iowa, about 42 percent. That's where the narrative is happening. That's where these candidates are kind of laying their groundwork, their case, their ground work, and they're having a lot of success. So, considering that's happening and we haven't had a debate yet, he's going to be in real trouble as this progresses along. I think as was brought up, he's raised a lot of money off the first couple of indictments, but it's kind of been trickling down. I don't think -- I think that well is going to be dry. The fact that he's bilking his own supporters to pay his legal bills, I mean, you know, he's only a billionaire. You can't expect more than that to ask everyone to pay your own way. But, no, I think it really is wearing thin here in New Hampshire and Iowa. And I think the more and more folks look at where those discussions are happening, I think there's hope there. And understanding that Trump very well is not the nominee of this party.",
