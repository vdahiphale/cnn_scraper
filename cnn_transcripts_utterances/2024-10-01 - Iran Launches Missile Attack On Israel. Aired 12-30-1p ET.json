      "sentences": "And General Hertling, we talked a little bit about this at the beginning of the show, but I want to re-up our discussion about the distance and the time. If Iran does strike -- and of course Iran is involved in this right now because Iran is a major supporter of, financially and in every other way not just Hamas but Hezbollah -- if Iran does indeed launch these missiles, how long would it take to reach Israel?LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes, if it is solely a ballistic missile, the Iranians have a missile called the Fattah, it travels at Mach-15. That's fast. So it can cover the distance, I mean, just a straight line distance from Tehran to Tel Aviv is about a little over a thousand miles. It can cover that distance in 12 minutes. During the April attack when Iran combined not only ballistic missiles, but also cruise missiles, which travel Nap of the earth, that they follow the path of the earth and they can be programmed to fly like a jet over different areas to the ground. Those take a long time. It takes as long as a jet to get there. If they fire drones, those are even slower. So what Iran did in April was a very uncoordinated attack, not matching the speed of their weapon system, along with the targets they struck. So at this time, if Iran only launches ballistic missiles, they have a lot of them. They have close to estimates anywhere from 3,000 to 5,000 ballistic missiles. Now, they can't get all of them off at any given time. But even if they lost launched a fraction of those, it would be very difficult for Israel to counter those with air defense system, the kinds of systems that shoot from the ground up into the sky as a missile is falling into a certain area. So when --",

      "sentences": "Yes, the Iron Dome is designed specifically for rockets that fire very slowly, but a certain parabola. It goes up. It calculates where it's going to strike when the Iron Dome radar catches it. If it's not going to hit into a populated area, the Iron Dome doesn't fire.It only knocks down a target when there are indicators that the radar is going to take it to a certain area where there's civilian or military targets. So the Iron Dome is kind of a unique weapon system. What you have to do for ballistic missiles is literally shoot quick moving target much faster than an airplane, Mach-15. Even fast airplanes don't go that fast. Knock it out of the sky as it's either at its top, or as it's coming back into the earth. And that's very difficult to do if you don't have the systems in place.",

It's a standard way of communicating air raid alert here in Tel Aviv. Just before that, we heard an enormous amount of activity in the air over the city here that most likely Israeli fighter jets, which are part of the missile detection, also missile defense. And there's been a swarm of that in the last couple hours. My latest reporting is that the likely targets from -- and you can hear the -- there's the air raid siren now. My most recent reporting is that the potential targets are two air bases in Israel, but also the Mossad headquarters. And that's crucial, Dana, because the Mossad headquarters are in the city proper. In fact, just to the northeast of here and a strike with a ballistic missile by Iran inside the urban center of Israel's largest city would be quite, quite an enormous escalation.",

And so we understand that the Glilot's intelligence base, I was told that it was evacuated earlier today, and that the Israeli military was beginning to put into place various contingency plans for the evacuation and the safety of their personnel at these various bases. We know, of course, that the last time Iran attacked Israel with a range of drones, cruise missiles and ballistic missiles, there were a couple of hits in a southern -- base in southern Israel as well as on the road leading to the Hermon intelligence base which is actually just behind my shoulder north of here.

They follow a regular speed and pace and trajectory when they come down. And this is the one coming down here, I believe. They come down a little bit more erratically and you could see it looks to be in more than one piece. That indicates to me that that -- those are fragments of an incoming projectile that was hit, falling. And, again, keep in mind, this is a big city -- and there goes the air raid sirens again -- where that fragment just fell is still in a populated -- a densely populated part of the city.

As a senior White House official was warning this morning that an attack could be imminent, they did stress that the U.S. would stand ready to help Israel in defense against any type of attacked. And also warned that there would be severe consequences for Iran if they do launch a direct military attack against Israel. It comes at a time when tensions in the region have already been incredibly high, and this certainly will escalate fears of concern that there could be a wider regional conflict on the brink of erupting. Now, I will know we will see President Biden a bit later this afternoon at 2:30. He's holding a briefing relating to Hurricane Helene. He's actually canceled or postponed a virtual call.

And there's an integrated air defense system where an aircraft can determine an incoming missile. Get it to the ground station and have the ground station fire upward. Jeremy Diamond was actually -- was absolutely right when he said some of the explosions were likely going on above the atmosphere. That's how you engage a ballistic missile. That's now reentering the orbit to strike a target. But what I saw was the potential for both rockets, which are unguided for the most part. They're not precise.

We saw multiple impacts on the first barrage and some of those fragments or missiles themselves hit not far from the hotel. I want to say -- perhaps and now we're seeing what they're attempting to interest up in the sky. Now what I'm going to do, I'm going to take my team off the roof again to go back into the shelter because they're getting close and when these come down, they can come close to us. Guys, let's go back into the shelter.",

      "sentences": "Well, Dana, the whole question since the death of the killing of Nasrallah by Israel last week was when and how Iran would respond. And now, of course, we are seeing that response. So what we're trying to get at is really the scale of this response, particularly when it compares to what we saw back on April 13th, when more than 300 missiles and drones were fired at Israel, frankly, without much impact.And the reason that there was not much impact was because of this U.S. led coalition that helped the Israeli forces to defend their skies, and there really was not that much damage or destruction. So, what we're seeing now is a significant amount of activity in the air. We may also be seeing impacts on the ground. So that will certainly play into what the Israeli response would be. But there is a lot of fog of war right now. We really need to figure out what exactly is being fired at Israel and what those strikes are going to entail in terms of damage. But then there's the question about the defense of Israel. The U.S. has been preparing for this kind of scenario for quite some time. You remember a couple months ago after the killing of the Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, Israel and the U.S. were then expecting an Iranian response that frankly never came. So there has been this framework in place that we're now seeing being put into action to defend Israel. Dana?",

This is an attack on Israel as a way to show its support for Hezbollah. You heard Alex talking about the last time in April, Iran sent missiles that were intercepted. It was after there was an actual strike, Israeli strike inside Iran -- Tehran, where they took out a leader there. And this is different.",

Whether Mossad is the only target in Tel Aviv or if it is indeed is one of the targets, we don't know yet. I will tell you I did see impacts. I saw two impacts quite close to the hotel here, and I saw another one further north of here, I might guess a couple miles where I did see some fire and explosion. Again, so it is often difficult to determine in the midst of a heavy barrage like this one. What is hitting the ground actually? Is it a fragment of the missile that was fired? Is it fragments of the air defense intercept missiles that went up or both of those things? We'll know more over time. But there's no question that projectiles are hitting Tel Aviv right now --",
