U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin will be sitting down with Israeli officials in the hours ahead on his second trip to the country since the October 7 attack by Hamas. Austin's visit comes after a stop in Bahrain. And once in Israel, a U.S. official says he will get updates on the war, but he's also expected to press Israeli officials to define specific operational milestones in the ongoing battle.Meantime, the Israel Defense Forces says it's uncovered the biggest Hamas tunnel in Gaza. That tunnel, which the IDF says was secured a few weeks ago, was made public on Sunday. The Hamas-controlled Palestinian Health Ministry says the death toll in Gaza has climbed to nearly 19,000. It doesn't distinguish between combatants and civilians, but says 70 percent of those killed are women and children. Some of the images coming out of Gaza are graphic, and that includes our next video, which is hard to watch. It comes from Debalieh in northern Gaza, where a senior official in the health ministry says at least 24 people were killed and dozens more wounded in what is thought to have been an Israeli airstrike on Sunday. He says a house sheltering displaced families was hit. And Elliott Gotkine is following all the developments for us, he joins us now live from London. Good morning to you, Elliott. So U.S. Defense Secretary Austin will meet with Israeli officials in the coming hours amid increasing pressure on Prime Minister Netanyahu to define the next phase of this war and to make a deal with Hamas to get more hostages released. How far might Israel go on all of this?",

GOTKINEthis is the biggest tunnel it has discovered to date. It stopped just 400 meters short of the Eris crossing with Israel and I suppose if all of these other tunnel shafts we've been talking about of late have been akin to kind of veins in the human body imagine this as being one of the big arteries. This is big enough to drive a car through it's been described almost like a pedestrian underpass or like a subway that would you would use to go under the street and of course, we know these tunnels are used by Hamas to launch attacks to shelter from attacks and also to hide hostages, but this particular tunnel seems to be on another level. It's got ventilation systems, it's got electricity. As I say, you could drive a car through it. It would have needed mechanized equipment to have been built. And according to Israel, it goes four kilometers under Beit Hanoun in the northern part of the Gaza Strip and has offshoots into hospitals, mosques and schools as well. So Israel says that it discovered this several weeks ago and it's planning to destroy it, but it wanted to share these images to, I suppose, show exactly what it is up against in terms of dealing with this tunnel system that Hamas has painstakingly built over the years, and as I say, which is clearly making the battle against Hamas from Israel's perspective that much harder.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (voice-over): The tunnels themselves are big, big enough for fighters and their weapons, seen here in this Hamas propaganda video, which was also posted by the Israel Defense Force. They are reinforced with concrete too. Two years ago, Hamas claimed to have built 500 kilometers, more than 300 miles of them. The tunnels are spread all over Gaza. This map over two years old. The IDF says they've discovered 800 tunnel shafts so far and have destroyed 500 of them. The entrances are often well hidden.

There could be hostages in those tunnels.There are very few details about how precisely the water is getting into the tunnels, how much water, how fast it's going in, or what you do if you suddenly discover you're flooding hostages, other than the IDF say they have begun carefully testing it and that this method is being trialed on a limited, limited basis. ROBERTSON (voice-over): Some of the tunnels are thought to be five floors deep. Some of the hostages who were freed have described them. This elderly hostage helped by her daughter.

POLITICAL ANALYST: He's not only ramping up the authoritarian and racist language and making it more explicit. There's a policy agenda behind it as well. I mean, he is running on a much more militant agenda than he ran on certainly as president in 2020 when he focused more on the economy or even in 2016. I mean, you know, behind the polls, behind the language like that about poisoning the blood of our country or vermin are a variety of ideas to weaponize control of the federal government, undermine the civil service protections, deploy federal force into blue cities and states, mass deportation, internment camps, the use of the Insurrection Act potentially to use the military to put down protests. So all of this is much more explicit and confrontational than even what we have seen from Trump in the past. And the answer on Republicans is that, you know, he learned a long time ago there is no line he can cross. that would compel a meaningful number of them to oppose him. They have long ago decided either that they can't stand against him because his hold on the base is too strong, or B, they don't want to stand against him because they think they benefit from the mobilization of his electorate that he is uniquely positioned to do, which can enable Republicans to gain the power to do the other things that they want to do, appoint judges, cut taxes, ban abortion.
