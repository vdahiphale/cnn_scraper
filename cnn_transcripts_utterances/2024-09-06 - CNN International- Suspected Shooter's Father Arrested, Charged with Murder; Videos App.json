This hour, the 14-year-old gunman accused of killing two students and two teachers in Georgia on Wednesday will make his first court appearance.We're on the ground in the West Bank, where after a week of intense military operations, Israeli forces appear to have withdrawn, and it's another complicated day for Donald Trump. First, he appears in a New York courtroom before hitting the campaign trail. The 14-year-old suspected gunman in this week's deadly school shooting in the U.S. State of Georgia is scheduled to appear in court this hour for the first time. Colt Gray faces four counts of felony murder. He's accused of killing two of his fellow students and two teachers at Apalachee High School on Wednesday. Gray is expected to be charged as an adult. The suspected gunman's father also arrested and now facing charges. Authorities say Colin Gray bought the AR-15 style weapon used in the shooting as a gift for his son in December. CNN's Rafael Romo spoke to our Sara Sidner earlier. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But what we know already is that he is facing at least four charges Sara and the charges that he faces, of course, have to do with the horrific murders that happened Wednesday here in Winder, just about an hour away from Atlanta, northeast of Atlanta. And in a significant development overnight, Sara, we have also heard and got confirmation from the Georgia Bureau of Investigation that the suspect -- the suspect's father, Colin Gray, has also been arrested, and he faces multiple charges. Let me read to you what he is facing. Now, the 54-year-old is now facing eight counts of cruelty to children in the second degree, two counts of involuntary manslaughter in the second degree, and another four counts of involuntary manslaughter. Now, why did authorities here decide to charge the father? This is what the Director of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation had to say about it.",

The same thing applies in Georgia.There is no such statute which makes that -- places that duty upon a parent, so they're going to have to show that somehow or another, there was what we call culpable negligence, or criminal negligence, which is beyond mere negligence, and establish some sort of duty upon the parent to secure the weapons under common law, not so much under statutory law. Do I think that the result may end up being the same as in the Crumbley case? Yes, I do. This type of case does ferment a lot of public outrage, and want applications like this. Georgia is more of a gun state than even Michigan, so it is going to be a tough road to hope for the prosecution as it is for the defense. But the second-degree murder is kind of a reach, but that's because of the cruelty to children is an element of second-degree murder that they're trying to apply to the father outside of the involuntary manslaughter. The charges are kind of duplicative, and so as a result of which I'm not sure he can be convicted of all of them, one or the other involving the deaths, is probably what we're looking at.",

His father is being charged based on allegedly providing access to the firearm in question here, and this is really interesting. We'll have to see if this is somewhat of a new trend that we're now seeing with prosecutors across the country. We know, for example, in the case of the Oxford High School shooting in Michigan, both of the shooter's parents there were prosecuted again based on access to a gun in the 2022 July 4th shooting near Chicago, that shooter's parent was also prosecuted for alleged recklessness when it came to allowing the child access to a gun. So, the father in this case similarly faces charges for his role. We know that stemmed from an FBI tip that came in, tip to the FBI that was then sent down to authorities there in Georgia. This pertain to an online threat that people had seen they determined that this child was the person who was making those threats. Law enforcement goes to the home, they interview the alleged shooter, they interview his father, and then shortly thereafter, CNN is learning that the father essentially provided this AR-15 style rifle to his child as a holiday gift. And so, the father on notice from law enforcement that they believe that the kid had been making threats about conducting a school shooting shortly thereafter, provides his son allegedly with access to a gun.

You don't have to say anything at all, and it's important to understand that, because anything you might say, could be used against you at further proceedings associated with your case. I want to inform you of the charges that you currently face. In essence, you are charged with four counts of felony murder, as outlined in a state warrants that have been issued against you. I want to make you aware that the maximum penalty for felony murder so for each count, the maximum penalty is that you could be punishable by death, by imprisonment for life without parole, or by imprisonment for life with the possibility of parole.

Professor Jeff Swartz back with us as well. I mean, very serious charges. I mean -- I mean, I think we all knew there were very serious charges, but just to hear the judge, then let this young man know that the maximum penalty here was death, imprisonment for life with or without parole. I mean, this is very grave, very serious. Four people were killed at his school. He's accused of, you know, of firing the weapon that led to the deaths of two fellow students and two teachers. And this is just the arraignment hearing for this young man. Later, a similar hearing will involve his father, who is accused of helping to supply the weapon there.

It may not even be in the cards for him to get life without parole. The Supreme Court has ruled that only under certain circumstances can you improve -- impugn life without parole on someone who's only 14-years-old.So, there are matters. Now, in the Crumbley case, he got life without parole. I don't know whether that will stand up on appeal or not, and that might happen to this young man. You know, a lot of the rights that should be read to a defendant at this particular first appearance hearing was not read to him, but I don't think it's anything fatal. They'll take care of it at the next proceeding, when he is actually arraigned on his indictment. And I anticipate that will happen within the next week to 10 days, and the same thing will go for the father. This is a really sad situation. And I -- when I look at a child of 14- years-old, a freshman in high school, being told you're going to spend the rest of your life in prison is really difficult. And obviously he's a very troubled child, and a lot of things will come out at trial regarding just the kind of upbringing that he's got, he's received from his father. And I think that's going to act as evidence against the father as to what type of father he has been and what he has encouraged him to do? I think you brought up one point earlier. You know, an AR-15 is not a hunting rifle. I don't care what the NRA says, unless you want to blow up what you're hunting. I mean, that's literally what happens with the kind of ammunition that comes out of an AR-15. And taking a kid out there to literally blow-up animals is not something you want to encourage a 14-year-old to do.",

Certainly, Judge Swartz has sat before many defendants who are having their day in court. And you know, this is the great equalizer of the U.S. justice system, that everybody is presumed innocent until proven guilty.But this is the process, as you know, the law outlines. There was this question, as you mentioned, about -- you know this individual being tried as an adult in the State of Georgia, and you know, other places, if a juvenile is alleged to have committed offense where the punishment can be death or life imprisonment, that then means the individual will be tried as an adult, as an adult. But as the judge mentioned, there's a question about -- you know how strenuous the penalties would actually be here? And what's so interesting in these cases, particularly involving children, and as you mentioned Fred, and as the judge mentioned as well. I mean, all around this is certainly a tragedy. When you look at what the law does, there to punish, and it's there to deter, certainly to punish someone for their crimes in this case. I mean, I'm not taking anything away from the fact that this suspect is charged with very serious offenses, taking the lives of others this very deadly, tragic shooting. But you have to wonder about the other side of the coin, and that's the deterrence aspect, and how that impacts a child. You know, I've talked to pediatricians who have described, particularly, you know, children that engage in violence. They're at the state where their brains are still -- you know forming. So, you have to wonder what the deterrent aspect is. But certainly, this is a process that will be lengthy.

It would take decades before they would ever even think about it. I think that that would be something to save the families having to listen to all the details and go through all of this. It may be something they're considering to the same extent some people want the retribution. They think somehow or another that's going to make things better for them, and it only really prolongs the tragedy. So -- you know I worked as a defense attorney. I worked as a prosecutor.

He's 54-years-old.He is facing four counts of involuntary manslaughter, two counts of second-degree murder, and eight counts of cruelty to children. He is not alleged to have been present during that shooting at the high school a couple of days ago. But largely Jeff Swartz, because police say he provided the weapon. He provided the AR to his son. It was a Christmas gift, or some there -- somewhere thereabouts, in December, a Christmas gift.

The remaining cruelty to children charges relate to the other children and the other victims who were shot. I don't know how they're going to attach that to the father, because it's not like manslaughter, and there was no action taken by him or failure to do a duty that they could attach to him that resulted in those injuries. So, I don't know how far those are going to go. I'd have to do a little bit more research into Georgia law to find out how they're going to put that together.
