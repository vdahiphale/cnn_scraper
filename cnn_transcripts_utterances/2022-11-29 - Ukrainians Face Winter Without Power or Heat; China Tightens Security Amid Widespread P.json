A protester in Shanghai claims authorities detained around 80 to 110 people on Saturday, deleting photos and social media apps from their phones. The Chinese foreign ministry say media accounts do not reflect what actually happened.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHURCH (voice over): State run media has not directly covered the protests.

And it's not just that the Chinese vaccines aren't as effective at protecting people from the virus. It's also that the they haven't been ramped up. I mean, I -- there's about 32 million people in China over 80. Only about 40 percent are properly vaccinated according to WHO standard. So there's a lot of vulnerable people in China.

The government's told them, well, we've protected you from this unlike those hopeless, irresponsible democracies in America.And so they thought was the government's protecting us? Why do I need to get a vaccine? Plus, there is the sort of anti -- underlying anti- vaxxer sentiments suspicion about the vaccinations.

Whereas in the private sector -- in the public sector they're rising by only two percent. So, there is a gap which has been there for quite some time now. And one of the reasons why we are seeing a number of strikes, you mentioned picket lines. Particularly in public services is because of this gap. And the fact that all these people who are working through the COVID period, like nurses, for example, and also right now we've with problems the rail strikes and also teachers looking to strike.

We have a tightening taking place in the fiscal side. So, there are tax increases, rather than decreases. We had a short period where that was going on but that's been reversed when we changed our prime minister just recently for the third time, which is really quite interesting. So, what has been going on as a result of this upheaval that we saw in the markets when we've -- we had a bit of an unstable political situation is that this government, right now, is increasing taxes and also, of course, interest rates are going up. So, we have a double hit the economy. Quite a lot of countries are not doing. So, I think we are one exceptionally, really, by comparison to what is going on elsewhere.

Until those things are reflected in what people are paying in the shops and what they found are very substantial increases there. What is not happening here is that the support to consumers and businesses, which is being evident in other countries, has not quite materialized to the extent that it has happened elsewhere. So, I think that probably the government is hoping that those price declines that we're seeing internationally will eventually start being reflected in the U.K. as well. And therefore, some of those wage increases, which they fear are going to be embedded in the economy and they won't be able to do anything very much about that in the future because they will feel more inflation, that some of those will become permanent and that is a big concern.
