We saw him leaving to grab lunch. He declined to comment on what he was up to today, and whether they were bringing witnesses in before the grand jury. We also saw another prosecutor on the team getting snacks, getting bags of chips and getting cookies, and going back behind the closed doors where the grand jury meets.Now, that is an entirely secretive process. So, it is unclear to us today if they had any witnesses, if the grand jury was hearing any testimony, but we do know this is the second day in a row that we have seen prosecutors from the special counsel's team working here. Yesterday, a former Trump aide, Taylor Budowich, that testified before the grand jury for just under two hours, that after we've learned from sources that the grand jury here has heard from a number of witnesses in recent weeks. So, we're definitely seeing a lot of activity here. Now, the reason why we're seeing activity here when we have had a lot of activity take place at the grand jury in Washington, D.C. could be for a number of reasons. Sometimes they do it to accommodate certain witnesses, but also it could be that prosecutors are looking to bring a case in the venue in the area where the alleged crime could have taken place. Now, Mar-a-Lago is just about 70 miles north of where I'm standing. You know, also this grand jury activity is happening after sources have told our team that Trump has been notified that he is a target of this investigation.

It says that you are the target of this investigation, and his team is bracing for that. He is in New Jersey right now, as Paula was noting earlier. But, of course, they are preparing, where would his appearance potentially be. Could it be in Florida? Could it be here in Washington? They don't yet know the answers to that, of course, but they are bracing for the fact that this is going to happen, and he's kind of come around to that.He is calling Republicans and asking them, you know, why is the tone not the same here about Jack Smith toward this special counsel. He wants more people attacking him now that he's realized that it is imminent that this is likely going to happen. Obviously, we have to wait to see for it to happen. But what I am struck by, as we have been reporting on this for so long, is how we went from a period in this investigation where they were shocked when the search warrant was executed at Mar-a-Lago last August, but when the documents situation happened with the former vice president and with President Biden, they thought they were in the clear. Obviously very different situations, they no longer think that.

Of course, the records belong to the government, which is based here. We know that these documents were removed allegedly from the White House. But it gets a little tricky because former President Trump was still President Trump when he left Washington. And it's not clear if the fact that the government was located here would be enough to bring the case, which is part of why we're seeing all of this sudden grand jury activity down in Florida because that's where the bulk of the alleged criminal conduct appears to have occurred. But you can move a case, but it takes a while. You have to read the grand jury in. They have to hear all the evidence, and that can take quite some time.",

They're trying to suss out, is it better for them if it's in Florida than if it was here in Washington.I think the other thing that this is going to raise and something they'll be talking about, which we're still reporting out, is does this mean there're in the January 6th case.

And the same is true if they're going to go in D.C., the witnesses we have seen testify in Miami, their transcripts would have to come up here. They'll also be given a presentation by the prosecutors, sort of a closing argument, if you will, and then the indictment itself must be read to the grand jurors before they're given the opportunity to vote on it.All of those things typically take a few days.

And on this tape, you can hear him sort of waving a piece of paper. It was unclear if he has the document in his possession. And he expresses a desire to be able to share the classified documents but acknowledges the limits of his own ability to do so now that he's out of the White House. That's significant for so many reasons. First of all, he's acknowledging having a classified document, but he's also undercutting the defense that he and his attorneys have given in the court of public opinion, which is that he, of course, had the authority to declassify these things.

Because what seems to happen is that these particles, once they get in the blood, they can cause clotting, they can cause inflammation, so they can sort of flare up preexisting diseases or, you know, cause things like autoimmune diseases. That's a problem.But to be fair, Wolf, I mean, if it's a short-term sort of exposure, I think some of those long-term risks are far mitigated. They're going to be a lot less. Some have said if you get levels of 400 or more, it's like smoking one cigarette every hour. That's a problem, clearly, but most of the damage from cigarette smoking is something that's measured in many, many months or years of smoking cigarettes. Hopefully, the air continues to improve.",

But this, Wolf, is part of an ongoing battle, not necessarily directly connected to the wider counteroffensive that I think we're seeing the shaping or early stages of. There have been a significant number of probing attacks that sort of company level strength from Ukrainians, trying to punch through, feeling for weaknesses around the front line from Zaporizhzhia towards the Russian-held city of Donetsk, there's very strong Russian held offensive there. The Ukrainians know that. I think they're clearly feeling their way there. And, of course, we have seen the destabilizing campaign, using Russian militants to attack and raid inside Russia itself across the northern border between Ukraine and Russia. This all combined with the drone attacks, the long range artillery attacks and missile attacks against Russian logistics hubs, particularly in Russian-held areas of Ukraine, but also beyond that into Russia itself.

He spent roughly half a day in front of that grand jury.And, of course, those proceedings are behind closed doors. We don't know exactly what prosecutors asked him but we know from the House Select Committee that investigated January 6th a little bit about why prosecutors might be interested in him. According to documents the committee was able to uncover, they say Gingrich was allegedly in communication with senior advisers to Donald Trump about the television strategy around the 2020 election, including, you know, ads that would push some of these false allegations of election fraud, the January 6th committee also alleged that Gingrich may have played some sort of role in coordinating some of these slates of fake electors that we saw in a number of battleground states that Donald Trump lost, but of course wanted to continue to try to contest. One of the people that Gingrich was in touch with was Mark Meadows, which of course we reported also has testified recently before these grand juries as part of the ongoing special counsel probe, and I think, you know, one of the things that's striking, Wolf, is of course we're waiting for a potential indictment in the classified documents case. It looks like that could be looming kind of at any point, and it seems clear that these two probes could be moving on different time lines. You know, it's relatively late in the game to see a big name like Newt Gingrich going in before a grand jury.

His announcement speech yesterday, the video what he said largely in the town hall last night, it was all about positioning himself as a defender of the Constitution, a defender of the rule of law as opposed to what Donald Trump did, in his case, with him trying to get to, from his perspective and from the perspective of what it says in the Constitution, break the law and then to call him out afterwards multiple times and is still doing so today.",
