The pain is still palpable.Families gathered today at the site of the Nova Music Festival where hundreds of young people who came to dance a year ago were instead slaughtered.

That siren sounded for two minutes outside Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in Jerusalem today, as devastated and exhausted families urge the Israeli prime minister to bring their loved ones' home.We begin our coverage with CNN's Erin Burnett, who is in Tel Aviv. Erin? ERIN BURNETT, CNN ANCHOR: All right, Dana. You know we're here right now at what's called hostage square. And I know you've seen this so many times. There are members of the public, people mourning. There were a group of young men from a yeshiva school singing, all of them here to grieve, to hope for the return of those hostages. 97 people who were taken hostage on October 7, one year ago today, are still in Gaza. Right now, the latest that we understand is a third to a half of them may not be alive. It is an incredible tragedy, and their families still do not know. And what you're hearing behind me, Dana, this is just the beginning of -- it's going to be a very large video screen that is going to be broadcast across Tel Aviv. There are thousands of families nearby at (inaudible) square. There were going to be, Dana, about 40,000 people. There could be many people gathering in this, as I said, the public location, but they were allowed to be 40,000 that was dramatically scaled back because Israel, of course, is not a country just grieving. It's a country at war, a war in north, a war in Gaza, a war with Iran. All of that going on sirens, of course, across Tel Aviv. Just within the past hour, Dana, as there were ballistic missiles apparently coming in, perhaps from Yemen. Those were intercepted, but everything lights up red. People have to go to a shelter. They're prepared to go to a shelter here if they need to. There's a plan that's been told to everyone in this square, and that is the reality of the life that they are living every day. As now, Dana, as they grieve in these early moments of darkness, there is the possibility that Israel will choose tonight, as it's night, to strike Iran, with that imminent strike that the U.S. has been prepared for and searched 40,000 troops over these months to the region to support Israel and its defense after that anticipated attack. An attack, Dana, of course, is that we all know could come at any moment, with very little warning, even as Israel tonight griefs, Dana.",

      "sentences": "Well, Dana, President Biden this morning, spoke by phone with Israeli President Isaac Herzog, head of holding a candlelight ceremony here at the White House to commemorate the somber day of the October 7 attacks.President Biden did not deliver remarks today, instead opting to hold this candle lighting ceremony. He was joined by First Lady Jill Biden, as well as Rabbi Aaron Alexander, who prayed for the souls of the holy ones, men, women and children who were killed on October 7. It's worth noting that Rabbi Alexander is actually a friend of the family of Hersh Goldberg-Polin, who was killed by Hamas in captivity in late August. It really adds a very poignant and personal touch to today's remembrances. President Biden is using this day to once again, renew his calls for a ceasefire deal between Hamas in Israel, saying that he wants to ensure that they can get these hostages back home for their families, get more humanitarian aid into Gaza, as well as find an end to this war. He said in that statement, Israelis and Palestinians alike deserve to live in security, dignity and peace. But the president, even as he's renewing these calls, is running up against the reality that there has been little to no traction in those talks to secure a ceasefire deal. And as Erin was noting, this conflict has now widened out on several fronts. As Israel is not just battling Hamas, but also Hezbollah and Lebanon, and now potentially Iran as well, promising that they will respond to the attacks. So, President Biden certainly is juggling this on multiple fronts today, trying to commemorate those lives lost on October 7, while also dealing with this conflict potentially widening something that he's really hoped to try to prevent since October 7, one year ago.",

We're going to talk a little bit more about that later in the show. But just picking up where Arlette Just left off about the fact that the Biden administration has spent the past year.

What the -- we weren't thinking about domestic politics, what the effect domestic politics would have.But since that year has moved along, the hope in the Biden campaign and administration initially, and then the Harris campaign initially was, by the fall, there will be a ceasefire. By the fall, things will be better. I've been to Dearborn, Michigan, which, of course, is home to a very large concentration of Arab Americans and others. And there was the abandoned Biden movement, giving way to a bit more hope for the Harris campaign. And there is still some hope. She definitely had a bit of a different moment in some time. But even then, still back in July -- by the fall, by October, there still may be a ceasefire. That, of course, is out the window. And that is why -- And so, this has unintended or uncertain domestic political consequences and effects that we don't know.

And it was a moment for her to try to define herself, while also maintaining that she is in lockstep with the president on a policy toward Israel.And this has been one of the great challenges of her now campaign is trying to -- by all accounts, and by everyone I've spoken with, say we are in lockstep with the president. But there is also so much pressure on her, including at a meeting that she had in Michigan on Friday with Arab American leaders. For her to show that she is willing to be different from President Joe Biden on this, and that is that answer, in some ways, was telling of that. I will also just say that when we're watching the developments over the last year, the statements that were put out by the president and the vice president today sort of indicated that and put a pin in that. Because not only was it the first half of the statement saying Israel has a right to defend itself, and we need to think of the Jewish people today.

It is just mind boggling.We went to sleep last night, and it was a category one hurricane, and look at how it just increased. The winds in this thing have increased nearly 100 miles per hour in just 24 hours, all fueled by incredibly warm ocean temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico. Now, as it heads towards Florida, it will start to weaken some. But we are still looking at a major hurricane making landfall on the west coast of Florida, where we have these hurricane watches in effect right now. We are incredibly worried about the threat of damaging winds, incredibly heavy rain and storm surge, looks like the most destructive winds could be right around the Tampa Bay area, down towards Sarasota and Fort Myers. That would put some of the biggest storm surge totals in the areas that got record storm surge in Helene. Eight to 12-feet of storm surge in the Tampa Bay area would be something that they have never seen before, and something that eclipses the damage that was done in Helene.
