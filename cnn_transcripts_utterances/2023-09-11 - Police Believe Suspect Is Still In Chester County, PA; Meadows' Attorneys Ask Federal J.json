It has now been 12 days since Danelo Cavalcante crab-walked between those walls in that Chester County prison and escaped. But just a short while ago, police said they have no idea where he is. And they no longer even have a defined search area. Police just said they believe Cavalcante is still in Chester County, Pennsylvania, but that's not because they actually know. It's because they don't think he has the resources to travel far. Investigators said that they think he's probably growing desperate because he was reaching out to old acquaintances for help. Over the weekend, we did see these new images in Cavalcante captured on a Ring camera. Look on the left there, that's from the Ring camera of one of his former acquaintances' homes. You can see, he has changed his appearance. He is now clean shaven and longer has that beard. He has not seen been in public since. Danelo Cavalcante was serving a life sentence in prison for killing his 34-year-old girlfriend, Deborah Brandao. According to \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\", prosecutors in the trial said that he killed her to prevent her from telling police that he was wanted for murder in Brazil, an entirely different murder. He stabbed Brandao to death in front of her children. In another new development, Cavalcante's sister is now behind bars in the custody of ICE. Police arrested Eleni Cavalcante for overstaying her visa and primarily it seems for refusing to cooperate in this investigation. She is now facing deportation. Our coverage starts today with CNN's Danny Freeman who was at that update that the police gave just a short while ago and has been tracking the developments into Cavalcante's movements from the very beginning. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DANNY FREEMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Now playing the long game. That's how law enforcement views its on going manhunt to find escaped Danelo Cavalcante, now 12 days on the run. ROB CLARK, U.S. MARSHALS: I think the advantage switched to lawmaker. Before it was advantage Cavalcante, while he way playing that tactical hide and seek in the woods now, I believe it's advantage to law enforcement because he's in an urban setting.",

John, investigators believe that Cavalcante must still be in Chester County, Pennsylvania, not because they know but because they don't believe he doesn't have the resources to leave given the fact that he went by the home of one of his old acquaintances. They don't have any evidence to back it up. It's a theory. Do you think it is a good hunch?",

But, again, the flip side of that is what authorities are doing, Jake, is their trying to shrink his world. His world used to be the woods and now, if his world is Phoenixville, they're trying to get in touch and they've already done this before he got out of the woods, with everybody he might reach out to and say if you help him, he's going to jail and you may end up being a cell mate.

Prosecutors said, quote, he couldn't have that so he had to silence her and that's what he did, unquote.So he stabbed her to death in front of her children. This is not just a common variety murderer, if I could say that even, this is a serial killer, really? MARY ELLEN O'TOOLE, FORMER SENIOR FBI PROFILER: Well, and he is, by definition, he is a serial killer. But it also demonstrates how he handles problems and frustrations in his life. He didn't like what his girlfriend was about to do. Rather than leave her, or sit down and have a discussion about it, he ends up killing her and he does it in a very extreme way with multiple stabbing injuries and then in front of her children. So what we knew as profilers, we look at past behavior and we place it on top of current behavior. So what does that say about this person right now and how he handles his frustrations and handles how -- if he doesn't get what he wants, what's he going to do. And that makes him even more dangerous than say the average offender and the average fugitive.

I figured as soon as he got a vehicle, he would just get the hell out of Pennsylvania. What could you tell us based on your skills about what's inside his mind right now? O'TOOLE: Well, at this point, I think he does not like being a fugitive. The general public tends to think just based on TV movies and shows and stuff, that being a fugitive seems to be somewhat glamorous because you got all of this attention on you, and the offender and the fugitive doesn't mind that at all. He's miserable, he's not happy, he's angry and he wants away, he wants to get away. So, this makes him more desperate. And he's also very impulsive guy. He's also a big risk-taker. Those three personality traits make him very dangerous. If -- whether or not he comes into contact with a prior acquaintance or whether or not he comes into contact with a complete stranger, we look at what his prominent personality traits are and how they're elevated at a time like this. But I could just tell you, he wants out of this situation. And he's going to do what it takes to enable that to happen -- again, raising his level of dangerousness.",

But it's really important to understand this: the courts are in charge of their own dockets. They don't have external masters. If they want to prioritize and expedite, they could do that and if we actually look at some of the courts of appeals that have considered and rejected Donald Trump's executive privilege arguments, they've got those cases decided that in two to three months. So, there's every reason that this court, 11th Circuit, can act much more quickly than normal here.",

And I think the other thing that's notable is, you know, they're going to have a better sense of where this state court judge is on timing. He's made clear that he wants to issue some rulings this week about where all of the other defendants stand as far as when they should go to trial and, you know, he seemed pretty skeptical of the argument they should all go to trial in October.

And the other thing is the district court judge here in his very thorough opinion said, there is a novel issue here.

But since then, an almost equal number have died of illnesses related to their work in the rescue and recovery efforts at the World Trade Center and all that toxic air.What does America owe the families of these survivors, especially since this list keeps growing?",

And it's sad that people are continuing to die from 9/11 which is even more reason that the president should be standing with us.We have this new legislation that is pending in Congress right now ensuring justice for the victims of terrorism act. It is exactly what we're asking for, ensure justice and we've written letters to him and asked to meet with him. He chooses to meet with Mohammed bin Salman over the families.
