On Tuesday, the Islamic republic launched around ballistic missiles at targets across Israel. Israel shot down most of them with the help of the U.S. and others, but some got through. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that Iran will pay.So how might Israel retaliate against Iran? Joining me is Danny Citrinowicz. He served in Israel's military intelligence as head of the Iranian strategic branch. He's now a fellow of the Atlantic Council. Danny, welcome. Tell us -- explain to us Iran did this once before April 14th, and the Israeli response was quite measured in response to Iran's hundreds of rockets Israel basically took out a crucial but I think a single radar. Why is -- why does Prime Minister Netanyahu seem to be signaling this one is going to be this Israeli response is going to be much bigger?",

      "sentences": "Well, first, greeting from sunny Tel Aviv.Well, when you're looking at the 14th of April attack, we need to remember the constraints that Israel had when he wanted to retaliate against Iran. We had American administration that pushing hard on Israel to contain its retaliation but also we had Hezbollah as a tool, as a measure that Iran could use in order to threaten Israel. Before what happened the last couple of weeks, Hezbollah was fearsome enemy to the state of Israel, with capabilities to actually inflict a severe damage to the strategic sites of Israel. So in that regard those constraints were in the April 14th attack that led to very symbolic response by Israel. But unfortunately, right now, unfortunately, for the Iranians, there are no constraints anymore and I think that's really raising the chances that Israel will retaliate, retaliate hard with dramatically significantly against Iran.",

And then we got struck again by the Iranians.So, obviously, second time Israel has to do something differently. But I think also, it also connected to the American politics and the fact that the administration a couple of weeks before the election cannot be seen as someone -- that perceived as someone that pressuring Israel not to defend itself. I think what the administration trying to do now is pressuring Israel not -- of course, it's not able to pressure not to retaliate, but be make -- trying to make some sort of adjustment to the targets. The American administration is worried, afraid that things will escalate into a regional war. This is why they're pressing Israel to pick targets that will enable them in the future to contain the Iranian retaliation and thus preventing a regional escalation. I don't know if it's whether -- they're going to succeed in doing so, but for sure, there are debates, discussion between Israel and the U.S. in that regard, and we have to wait to be seen what will happen next couple of days and what Israel will choose eventually.",

I'm sure that Israel doesn't want to find itself in a war of attrition with Iran and we have the Lebanese arena and we have the Gaza arena to focus on, and I don't think that we want to open another arena with Iran but we have to retaliate.This is why I think we have to pick targets that will enable the Iranians to contain their response. So, obviously, going for the oil refineries or even go for the nuclear side, this is something that would pressure the Iranian regime to retaliate but also they would think to cross the Rubicon in term of the nuclear capabilities. So I thinking that regard, maybe the military sites, the military targets -- targets will enable Iran to contain that in the future. But again, it's all connected what the Israeli government want to achieve from the future attack against Iran. ZAKARIA:  And, Danny, this would have to result in an Iranian retaliation, right? You're an Iran expert. They -- they presumably have to particular because now, they don't have the option of asking Hezbollah to respond. They are going to have to increasingly get involved directly.",

This is why we are standing in front of a real escalation, regional one, between Israel and Iran, that's for sure. Unlike the 14th of April, I think now the chances are higher in that regard and I think it's also connected to the fact for like you said, the Iranians feel they need to retaliate because of the situation of Hezbollah. Remember that Hezbollah was the cushion, was the real protector of Iran, the element that really deterred Israel not to attack Iran.Now, without Hezbollah, or with Hezbollah diminishing in a way because of the Israeli attack against it, Iran has to take a step forward, using its missile capabilities but also I suspect they will have to do something in terms of the nuclear strategy because they really want to fortify the deterrence with other proxies. And, of course, it remain to be seen, but I'm afraid that if Israel will retaliates significantly, higher chances that Iran will retaliate as well to balance the equation between it and Israel.",

It was in the wake of that invasion that Hezbollah was born.And even though that invasion at the time was seen as a tactical success as you pointed out yourself in your introduction, in your take of the week, it turned out into a strategic failure because precisely it led to the rise of Hezbollah which used to be a guerilla movement, seen by many as a resistance movement against Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon. But over time, the group grew corrupt, grew fat, grew bigger, grew into a more traditional part of the Lebanese establishment, and got involved on the side of President Bashar al- Assad in his war in Syria. And so, they were gone from the underground and into a much more regular army style operation which exposed them to surveillance, exposed them to corruption and exposed them to the hatred of many Sunnis, but others also in Lebanon, in Syria, and in the rest of the Arab world for the terrible role that they played in this very bloody civil war. And I think that has been their downfall and that's what led to such penetration by intelligence, signal intelligence, but also human intelligence.",

We French in Mosul we did not take so many precautions. You Americans in Kabul and in Mazar-i-Sharif in 2001, the same. Today, Israel takes precautions which I never saw any other army in the world involved in such a -- such a war taking. This the true reality. Now, of course, too many casualties. Of course, it is heartbreaking. Of course, every day when I wake up, when I look at my phone the news from Gaza and from the civilian casualties, I am depressed. But you must know that IDF called for evaluation -- for evacuation, warnings. Did you see any army warning before striking? Even on the strategical or tactical -- tactical point of view, its nearly absurd but then they do that. They alert. They warn.

But as a writer, I really, really try to avoid getting into a position where I am taking strong public stances on things that I have not seen firsthand.Unfortunately, what I saw confirmed the skepticism. In fact, I would say deepened it and made it significantly worse. I write about in the book, I am the child of parents born into Jim Crow, a system in which we had one group of people who are given one class of citizenship and another group of people who are not. During my travels in Israel and on the West Bank, I saw a level of citizenship for Jewish Israelis. And then I saw something lesser in various tiers for everybody else. I would include Palestinian citizens of Israel also in that. And I was forced to wonder, how a country that takes the civil rights movement so seriously could be implicated in such a project?
