      "sentences": "Showdown in Simi Valley, seven Republican presidential candidates took the debate stage at the Reagan Librarybattling to take on the absent front runner Donald Trump. And you're looking at live pictures from Capitol Hill where House Republicans have begun their first hearing in their impeachment inquiry into President Biden. Where's the evidence? Is there evidence? We'll discuss with the panel ahead. Plus, I'll address that impeachment inquiry in my interview with Democratic Senator and Biden campaign co-Chair Chris Coons. Hello, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt to our viewers watching here in the United States and around the world. It's 11 am in Washington Thursday, September 28. There are 403 days until Election Day. This is today's \"State of the Race\". Welcome so what did we take away from the second Republican debate last night, seven candidates took the stage in what may have been their last big chance to steal the spotlight from Donald Trump. The Former President skipped the debate again to meet with working class voters in Michigan. We are going to get to all of that in just a moment. But first I want to show you this according to the latest CNN poll of polls. Donald Trump is leading his main rivals for the Republican nomination by about 20 points combined. It makes a rematch of 2020 seem even more likely, despite the fact that Trump is a four times indicted person and is also facing numerous civil lawsuits. And right now U.S. House Republicans starting their first official hearing of the impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden you can see it here. They claim that he profited from his son's business deals and abused his office. But the White House repeatedly denies this and Republicans have yet to back up those claims with any kind of proof. Impeachment inquiries have usually had a higher bar to begin, but two days before the government runs out of money and likely shuts down. This is what they decided to do, their goal, of course, a political one, to bring Joe Biden to Donald Trump's level in a way and potentially make voters question his eligibility. Let's dive in with today's panel. Lanhee Chen worked on Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign as Chief Adviser. Karen Finney, a CNN Political Commentator who served as Spokesperson for Hillary Clinton's 2016 Presidential Campaign and Leigh Ann Caldwell, a Political Reporter for The Washington Post and the Co-Author of the Early 202 Newsletter thank you all for being here, it's wonderful to have you on day two of \"State of the Race\". I want to make sure that we show everyone a little bit of what played out on the debate stage last night because while you know I do think in the big picture, there are some questions about how much these debates do matter in terms of President Trump's dominance over the field, it is very clear that they still are having some impact on the race for second place. And I don't think we're going to learn till Iowa or New Hampshire voters start to have a say how this is actually going to go down. So let's start with this moment between Nikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy. Just because I think it's going to be the moment that if we're still talking about this debate in a couple of months. This is what we're going to be seeing. Take a look at how she responded to him.

And so but Nikki Haley has effectively both in the first debate, and the second debate, shown a clear command of the issues. She's the only woman up there not afraid to throw her punches.

Because the person who comes out to face Trump is going to have to perform well, in these debates, and Nikki Haley has met that bar. Tim Scott kind of came out last night, I thought and had a much more aggressive showing was really much more of what people thought he could be, whether it's enough or not, we'll see.

So in some ways, what Vivek Ramaswamy outlined last night is a position that's more consistent with where a lot of Republican primary voters are, in fact, I think it's most of Republican leadership, whether in Congress or frankly, other candidates in this race, who really seem to be out of step. And so it is incumbent upon people like Tim Scott, like Nikki Haley, like Mike Pence, who believe that the United States should continue to be supportive of Ukraine to make the case for why and it is a split.

Let's underscore this key fact. So far, no evidence has been presented just allegations around what Republicans are calling abuse of power, obstruction and corruption. Democrats say the evidence doesn't exist and that the impeachment process is being fueled by politics and driven by the election. They alleged that Republicans are trying to hurt Biden's re-election chances by muddying the waters and distract from the criminal charges that face their front runner, Donald Trump. All right, back to my panel now and look, the reality here, Karen, is that impeachment proceedings are always political, even though people try to you know, it's a political process. And, you know, Republicans will argue that Nancy Pelosi did certain things with the process. And that's part of what justifies it here. But the reality was that in that case, at the very least, they were dealing with actions, that action had actually been taken by the President. And in this case, they are dealing with the actions that were taken by the President's son. I want to stay a little bit in the realm of the political here, though, which is to say, it does seem like voters are starting to get a little bit confused about what's going on.

And the way that he doesn't like the way the party has gone, you yourself ran for a top state government position in California, you echoed some of the same themes. And in that campaign, to even get this inquiry started, there was a massive divide inside the Republican Party in the House. And you had a number of Republicans who I would argue are more aligned with certainly the way you've talked about the fact that this inquiry period would be bad in a general election for them, people who want in Biden districts, do you buy that?

And of course, this goes back to the fact that Republicans and Democrats had agreed to all of this earlier this year. Joining me now to try to figure out what is going on, Senator Chris Coons of Delaware. He is the Chair of the Senate Ethics Committee, as well as the Co-Chair of President Biden's reelection campaign. Sir very honored to have you here on our second broadcast, its \"State of the Race\". And let's just start right there at the shutdown. Because the reality is, at this point, it's looking like millions of Americans aren't going to be getting paychecks come Sunday morning. Because quite frankly, there's a small group of Republicans in the House that seem to be holding the entire thing hostage, do you think there's any hope at this hour of avoiding a shutdown? SEN. CHRIS COONS (D-DE): There is hope. But I don't think it is likely given the obstruction of a few Republican senators here, who are slowing down the process of our taking up and sending to the house, the bipartisan package that is advancing in the Senate. And given the determination of an extreme small faction in the Republican majority in the House, who are threatening to strip speaker McCarthy of his seat as speaker if he tries any bipartisanship. I think we are at real risk of a shutdown this weekend. And if you'll just take a moment and think about what that means for us, around the world, leaders like Xi Jinping are telling other national leaders, other countries, that the United States has a political system, so broken and flawed that the United States is an unreliable ally, and not a credible partner, and no longer able to stand up to them and to meet our commitments. This moment, a federal government shutdown helps make Xi Jinping's case for him. I am encouraged that in the Senate, we have sustained broad bipartisan support for investing in Ukraine and their brave fight for freedom against Russian invasion and occupation. And that we've come to a balanced agreement on investing in meeting America's needs for disaster relief. But in the house, they continue to flail around and fail to make any meaningful progress. The one thing speaker McCarthy hasn't tried is bipartisanship. And I hope he will take up that challenge and move forward in the coming days.",
