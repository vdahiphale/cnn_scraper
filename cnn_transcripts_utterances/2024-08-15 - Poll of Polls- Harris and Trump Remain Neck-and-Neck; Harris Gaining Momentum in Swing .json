U.S. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris will travel to Maryland in the coming hours. They will be giving a speech on lowering costs for American families. This will be their first joint trip since Biden dropped out of the presidential race and comes on day before Harris delivers her first major economic policy speech as the Democratic nominee.The Mpox outbreak in Africa is now officially a global health emergency, says the World Health Organization. Until recently, Mpox had been contained to the Democratic Republic of Congo, but now a more deadly strain of the virus, HSA, spread to a previously unaffected countries. Mpox has infected more than 17,000 people in Africa this year. And New York Yankee Aaron Judge hit his 300th career home run on Wednesday. He reached a milestone faster than any other player in history, including Babe Ruth. Judge was playing in his 955th game against the Chicago White Sox. His Yankees clobbered the Sox 10 to 2. Now, CNN's latest Poll of Polls still finds no clear leader in the U.S. presidential race, but a new Quinnipiac University poll puts Kamala Harris a few points ahead of Donald Trump in the key battleground state of Pennsylvania. And Democrats hope she can also pull ahead in the swing state of North Carolina. CNN's Jeff Zeleny is there.

On the ground, you see that those attacks sort of on the border region inside Russia are stopping the kind of shelling that we've seen over and over again over into the Sumy region of Ukraine. Local residents have told CNN that there's been a downtick in those. But if you hit the airfields further away, you can prevent the kind of sort of glide-bomb attacks that we've been seeing increasing in frequency in recent months, the kind that devastated Avdiivka back in the winter. So that is the strategy here.We don't know how effective these attacks were yet, how many planes were actually destroyed. But, certainly, this is something that President Zelenskyy is using, not only to sort of add to the morale boost of the incursion into Kursk, but to call for more weapons and less limitations, crucially, from his Western allies. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): Thank you for the accurate, timely, and effective strikes on Russian airfields. Our Ukrainian drones are working exactly as needed. But there are things that drones alone cannot do. Unfortunately, we need other weapons, missile weapons.

MONTGOMERY: The luxury market is booming in Japan as it sees record foreign tourist numbers and spending, with estimates surpassing U.S. $54 billion this year alone. MONTGOMERY (voice-over): But elsewhere, big brands are feeling the pinch. LVMH, the world's largest luxury group and giant behind Louis Vuitton, saw a 14 percent revenue dip in Asia, excluding Japan, during the second quarter of this year compared to 2023. Brands like Ferragamo and Kering also took a hard hit. But Japan's bucking the trend, even riding a wave of celebrity-driven demand for vintage luxury. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): Yes, Japanese vintage is very popular. From a global perspective, Japan excels accurately at praising items and distinguishing between authentic and imitation designer pieces. MONTGOMERY (voice-over): Japan's vintage scene, already a top destination for high-quality finds, is also getting a boost from the weak yen. Asia's secondhand luxury market is set to reach 4.38 billion U.S. dollars this year, 165 percent bigger than the U.S., with Japan leading the way. But with higher Japanese interest rates looming and a fluctuating currency, experts warn this travel trend may not last. NOBUKO KOBAYASHI, ASIA-PACIFIC STRATEGY EXECUTION LEADER, EY: So the price harmonization across the region will eventually take place. So far it's been so volatile, it's not been caught up. But these two factors will kick in and the arbitrage opportunity will be lessened.
