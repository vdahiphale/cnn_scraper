He also searched for information about both Biden and Trump. What they haven't found is any evidence of strong political beliefs in either direction. The only thing we have is his registration as a Republican and a possible donation to a Democratic or progressive entity. So, the fact that he was looking at searches essentially in both political directions and there are no statements or really solid evidence of a strong political belief.

And when you end up getting too much rain, we know that causes problems. So, yes, we've got two big stories to cover for today. We've got the heat out in the west after a very, very, very brief reprieve from that, and we also have a lot of rain headed to the southern tier, and that's essentially going to be from Arizona, basically all the way over into the Carolina separate systems, but still, nonetheless a flooding concern. Right now, some of the heaviest rain just moved through Atlanta, starting to make its way up towards Greenville, Spartanburg, Columbia, and eventually into Charlotte, Birmingham, also starting to see some heavy rain, as well as some lightning moving into that area. But it's all from this stationary front, and it's not going to move much, hence the name, which means more rain today, more rain again on Sunday, more rain again on Monday. And a lot of these areas are only expected to get about an inch to two inches, maybe tops each day, but it's on top of the two to four inches they've had to last 48 hours. And when you keep adding that, the cumulative effect leads to ponding on the roadways, maybe some water in your basement, into businesses and roads. So that's going to be a concern. Couple of different areas we talked about, the southwest monsoon. That area is going to see some rain. Also, the southern tier of the U.S., this is the focus for today. But a lot of these same areas likely to see some flooding potential on Sunday and even Monday as well. The other story again, covering out to the West, not always necessarily the same places, even areas of inland Washington and Oregon, going to see those temperatures spiking back up well into the triple digits.",
