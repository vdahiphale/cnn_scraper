We don't know exactly what to read into that yet.And he had this to say about the events in Russia. He said, I won't hide it, it was painful to watch the events that took place in the south of Russia. Not only for me, he said, many of our citizens took them close to heart because there is only one fatherland. This is something that we've heard multiple times from Lukashenko. Emphasizing his closeness, his close ties ethnically, politically to Russia. You know, he hasn't done what state media in Belarus told us to expect. Which is that he's going to answer all of the burning questions around what happened. And crucially, he hasn't said yet where Prigozhin is. If he's still planning to come to Belarus and what the plans are for other Wagner fighters.

Their heroism overall.So I think, you know, Wagner, perhaps the fighters are being separated from their leadership. There is something in Russia that perhaps they don't want to disband the grouping because they've been so effective in Ukraine. And that would in the words of one Russian politician over the weekend, be a gift to the Ukrainians and NATO. But we just do not know. I think that is one of the big defining questions is, what is going to happen to Wagner? They've been instrumental so far in Russia's efforts in Ukraine.

      "sentences": "No. I mean I think that -- what we did get from the speech from Putin last night I think, which is a turnaround. Given the previous relationship between Putin and Prigozhin is that Putin I think now to see him as a threat and as an enemy. He didn't mention him by name. That in itself is significant. He doesn't ever mention, for example, Alexey Navalny by name. You never hear that name come out of Putin's mouth.But he was very clear that while, you know, he's grateful for the heroism of the Wagner fighters. As I said, he sees the organizers of the rebellion as having betrayed their country. And the way he said it, the anger that was apparent in that speech, made it very clear. Interestingly on the flipside, much less clear that Prigozhin sees Putin as an enemy. He was pains in his own audio message to stress that this wasn't an attempted coup, that he was simply trying to protest and prevent the destruction of the Wagner Group.",

Officials very clear that we do not yet know exactly what is going to happen next. Or what the impact will be on the Wagner group for example on Russia's war in Ukraine. Or most importantly, on the future of Putin's hold on power inside of Russia.Secretary of State Tony Blinken on Sunday, saying that it was clear that this insurrection revealed cracks in his regime. But asked on Monday, what the impact would be on Putin. Whether Putin has been weakened. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby just wouldn't go there. There was a number -- one of a number of questions that Kirby refused to answer. And it speaks to how cautious U.S. officials and particularly the White House is being in commenting on the record about this situation. They wouldn't even label whether this was an insurrection, an attempted coup. And part of that is because of the fast-moving nature of the events. Another part of it is because what we saw of this is all unfolding. The White House trying to avoid the perception that the West is somehow weighing in here. We heard President Biden on Monday talk about that strategy.",

He only talked at one point about this being an outcome that the West had been seeking or wanted to see. Which was notable in and of itself, given how often Putin has reverted to that playbook of blaming the West for events in Russia or inside of Ukraine.Now President Biden for his part, he is continuing to coordinate very closely with allies. He's expected to speak once again with the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. And on Tuesday, the White House is expected to announce $500 million of additional security assistance for Ukraine. Now that's intentional. It's an important message that the White House wants to send at this moment. That regardless of what happens in Russia, regardless of what happens in Moscow, the U.S. will continue to support Ukraine against the Russian invasion. Jimmy Diamond CNN, the White House.

The weekend rebellion in Russia is taking a toll on the country's economy there. the ruble briefly hit its lowest level in nearly 15 months on Monday. Trading about 87 to the U.S. dollar, before paring back some of its losses. Russian's scrambled to swap their cash for dollars over the weekend. Pushing up the exchange rate. The Russian currency has been surprisingly resilient for most of the year thanks to the central banks aggressive rate hikes. The U.S. is expected to announce a new round of military aid for Ukraine as it fends off Russian troops. Reuters reported the package will be worth up to $500 million. And it would include munitions, vehicles and anti-tank weapons. It could help Ukraine make even more gains on the battlefield. On Monday, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his fighters had advanced on all directions -- or in all directions on the southern and eastern frontlines. Earlier Mr. Zelenskyy visited soldiers and the Donetsk region and praised them for their efforts. Ukrainian officials say Russian forces are now on the defensive. And that their main motivation is to hold on to the ground that they've left. Ukraine also says that Russia is focusing its efforts on the Donetsk region where more than 35 clashes were reported on Monday. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh has more on the frontline battles. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NICK PATON WALSH, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Unprecedented chaos in Moscow has yet to ease Ukraine's bitter fight in the trenches. Close combat around Bakhmut, two weeks into the continued grind of the counter offensive open operations filmed over the weekend just as Wagner troops roll towards Moscow. Here, the red, white and blue are Russians in disarray and surrendering. The hope is more will follow as word spreads of the failed rebellion and morale and discipline falter. It was near here Ukraine proclaimed Monday progress on the frontlines with room for hope elsewhere. To the south, another Donetsk front near the heavily contested Marinka, it appears some Kremlin loyal Chechen fighters were pulled to Moscow for his defense at the weekend. Here, they are strutting along an apparent highway near the capitol. Bakhmut and Marinka opportunities for Ukraine in the east, but also further west near Kherson, on the Antonivskiy Bridge, the scene of intense clashes captured by this Russian drone, as Ukrainian forces claimed to cross over to the Russian controlled eastern bank, opening another front perhaps. It is too early to tell whether or if Russia is crumbling. And Ukraine's progress has been incremental still. This, a familiar scene when their fighters declared they'd captured another small village in the south, Rivnopil on Monday. None of this yet the strategic sea change in Russian collapse. The weekend's madness that Zelenskyy visiting troops in the east Monday as well will hope follows. He faces anxious choices even with all the Kremlin's intimate ugliness so exposed. Move now or wait for more in Moscow to unravel. He must be sure to make no mistakes of his own or interrupt the torrent of them in Moscow. Nick Paton Walsh, CNN Kyiv, Ukraine. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
