I'm Erin Burnett.And OUTFRONT tonight, the breaking news, hate and division, that is a quote from the Vice President Kamala Harris, who is taking on Trump and his rhetoric. In her first interview since the debate, Harris saying, quote, I think people are more willing now in light of the hate and division that we see coming out of Donald Trump to say, hey, lets put country first. And I think that just makes us stronger and more healthy as a country. Let's stop with the division like enough of that. Well, this new interview coming as Trump speaks out about controversial right-wing conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer. Now, Loomer has been by his side quite constantly recently, including traveling to the debate with him and just before the debate, Loomer says -- said that if Harris wins the election, quote, the White House will smell like curry and White House speeches will be facilitated via a call center. Well, now, Trump is saying -- just coming out and making a comment, writing, Laura Loomer doesn't work with the campaign. She's a private citizen and a longtime supporter. Kind of sounds like he's trying to distance himself, but actually know he's trying to have it both ways because he continues to write: I disagree with the statements she made, but like the many millions of people who support me, she is tired of watching the radical left Marxists and fascists violently attack and smear me. He disagrees, but -- well, Loomer, of course, was with Trump before the debate, where the foreign president again brought up that migrants are eating pets in Springfield, Ohio. That is a baseless claim that Trump is still tripling down on. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It's everywhere. You know, there are good people on both sides. She continues to say the same old lies over and over again. And nobody is checking her.

They are destroying their way of life. There are real challenges that this town is facing. The Republican governor of the state of Ohio has said, you know what, this is a real issue. Here's what we're going to do, we're going to bring support to this town. But Trump -- rather than dealing with it in a real way, is trying to stoke this idea that they're changing how you live your life. They are not like you. They never will be like you. And that is at the core of his -- I don't even like to call it really an immigration message. This is a nativist message. That's how he sees the immigration issue. If it were just about who's here legally and illegally, he'd be talking about visa overstays, from all over the world, which is not just from people in the southern part of this hemisphere.

That's why he's hit a ceiling in the polls. That's why he's stubbornly at 48 percent. It does work with some Americans, but definitely not those that he needs to bring to the table. He continues to isolate them with this type of rhetoric. And there's a way in which we can talk about solutions without demonizing people, without alienating people, without undermining the very fabric of our nation. And that's what the president continues to do. It continues to go down this path of division rather than uniting the party. And that's partly why -- that's partly why Kamala Harris is really hitting momentum, $500 million she's already raised. That signifies that the country does not want a third season of Donald Trump.

Bush, and Barack Obama. And today he was at the White -- at the White House today for a meeting on President Biden's remaining economic agenda. So, John, you know, as you're in the center of this moment here, one of your areas of expertise is housing, which is now a core to the Harris campaign. She's made it a priority. She just talked about it tonight at her rally in Pennsylvania. She says she's going to make housing more affordable and she focuses in on a couple of things. One is she's going to build more housing units, 3 million more, she says and then she's offered up to $25,000 in government paid down payment help for homebuyers and a $10,000 tax credit for first-time homebuyers. I know though, John, that you think there's another idea that she needs to include in her plan and it is specific. It is a 40- year mortgage. How come? JOHN HOPE BRYANT, ENTREPRENUER &amp; AUTHOR, \"FINANCIAL LITERACY FOR ALL\": Yeah. Well, in 1930, when 30-year mortgage was created, we lived about 59-years-old. So it was about half of your life? And now were living at about 80 -- 80-years-old, 81 or better with wellness. And so, a 40 year mortgage time to upgrade the software on it. The benefit of it is if you run it through the federal home loan banks system and for first-time homeowners, you get a three-and-a-half to four-and-a-half percent rate, subsidized rate, you have say by $500 a month on a $300,000 mortgage, which is a game changer for people with too much month at the end of their money. So you got to, in the short-term, give people a chance to get into houses before the three main homes gets built, because it takes some time for the private sector to do that. And we should note, it's a private sector is going to build homes, not the government, and so, the down-payment assistance that has to go through Congress. These other things have to go through Congress. This is something that can happen pretty much right now. And it allows you to get be affordable now. And a three-and-a-half to 4.5 percent mortgage is also becomes an asset parallel to the asset itself. If God forbid you pass on, you can give the sheer child the home and the benefit of the three-and-a-half to 4 percent assumable mortgage because after five or ten years is the preference would burn off.

Now, I know you've always -- you're an unabashed capitalist and yet you're talking obviously about a subsidized rate and part of Harris his plan, right, is that she says it will incentivize homeownership by this $25,000 tax incentive, right.So the criticism of this is when you put out a subsidy on interest rate or you put out $25,000 of an incentive, you know, you give someone that to buy a home, they don't get the benefit. It just pushes up the asset price. One economist said, I think it's a bad idea. The ultimate beneficiary of that credit is not going to be first-time home buyers. It's going to be people selling homes, right? So on the $25,000, I'm going to give you that then they just jack up the house price by $25,000, right? Do you think that's a fair criticism?
