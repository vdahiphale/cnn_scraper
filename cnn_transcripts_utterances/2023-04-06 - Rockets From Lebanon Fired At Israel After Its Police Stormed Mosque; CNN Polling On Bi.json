Action and reaction.It is concerning that the fire came from Lebanon. The last thing that the region needs is a major escalation involving Hezbollah's 100,000-plus hydrogenated weapons in what is likely to be a very, very tough response, not just against Hezbollah but against Lebanese infrastructure and the part of the Israelis.",

And remember, you have a situation in Israel against the backdrop of months of demonstrations and protests, including hundreds, if not thousands of Israeli military reservists, which is which are in precedent.And those reserves, by the way, are important. Since Israel hasn't fought a ground war in quite some time. It is the reserves in the Air Force and in the intelligence that, in fact, would be ready for this sort of operation. So I think, even though some would argue it's a sort of a wag-the-dog potential possibility with a Israeli prime minister who is burdened with a domestic crisis might seek a response abroad. I don't think that's the case. I think the prime minister and his security establishment, and the Israel military establishment understands the dangers and the risks that could result if, in fact, you have a full-blown escalation and confrontation as we saw in the summer of 2006 between Israel and Hezbollah, My gut tells me, Fred, that this is going to calm down, at least on the Lebanese piece of it, after the Israelis respond. And they've already signaled their diplomatic establishments and have their talking points to expect that they are going to respond.",

And look, if you look over time, we asked this question just back in December, and the president is ticking in the wrong direction. There you see he was at 37 percent yes, deserving reelection but now he's down to 32 percent. So he's a tick down from where he was in December -- Fred?",

The Supreme Court has issued an emergency order and it said it won't allow West Virginia to enforce this law that bars transgender women and girls from participating in school sports teams for now.This isn't a ruling on the merits. It's an emergency order. But the effect is that, right now, the state can't enforce this against a 12- year-old trans girl named Becky Pepper Jackson. She wants to participate in school sports and came up against this law. Two justices notably dissented. That's Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas. They would have ruled in West Virginia's favor. What's important here is it's really the first time the court has looked at the issue of transgender sports, even in this limited way in an emergency order. But it is the first time they've looked at it. It comes as Republican-led states across the country are trying to pass these similar laws. So we've seen a glimpse today in this emergency order about how the Supreme Court is going to look at this issue.",

All right, right now, in the U.S., more than 90,000 people are waiting for someone to donate a matching kidney. Thanks to this Chicago kidney doctor, there are now two fewer people on that long waiting list. She did it by donating her own kidney to a Virginia woman she had never met in an effort to show her own patients how safe the procedure is. And that's where the domino effect kicks in. CNN's Elizabeth Cohen is joining us right now. So, Elizabeth, walk us through exactly how all of this worked. DR. ELIZABETH COHEN, CNN SENIOR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Fred, it's so wonderful when this works out. And this all worked out thanks to Dr. Aleksandra Gmurczyk. She's at Northwestern Medicine in Chicago. So let's take a look at what happened. There was a wife who needed a kidney transplant and her husband was not a match. So he wanted to donate to her but he couldn't. But Dr. Gmurczyk, she was a match, so she donated to the wife. And that allowed the husband, who then wanted to, you know, give his kidney, he gave that to another patient. So in other words, because of what the doctor did, two people were able to get a kidney transplant. Let's take a listen to Dr. Gmurczyk. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. ALEKSANDRA GMURCZKY, DONATED KIDNEY TO STRANGER: I have seen so many patients that need a kidney transplant. I just feel so bad for every one of them. And I just cannot pick one, just one person because my heart would break for the other one. So I just could not do that. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And then, of course finishes at 18. He's one over par. At one point, he was three over par. He has looked frustrated. The perspiration. It's a hot day out here. He's been sweating through his shirt. He just hasn't looked settled. But it's been almost two months since he played a round of golf, a competitive round in Los Angeles on the PGA tour. So he's looked rusty. And the iron play hasn't been as good. The putts have been short. Everything that we know about Tiger and that so many fans love, the ability to just kind of just, you know, take the momentum and run with it. He had no momentum until the last 20 minutes or so. Birdie, birdie. Tiger could even maybe birdie one more to get back to even par, which would be -- which would be a very good start for him on a tough day.",

The conversation, the national conversation that you and I have talked for a long time about, how sports takes us to report conversations. This has racism. This has sexism. This has everything. I'm not saying all that is good all the time. But if we are talking about these things that can be a positive.

Katelyn Clark (ph), of course, the record-breaking tournament. And I think she just thought, hey, let's have them all come to the White House. Clearly, she's walked that back. LSU is going.
