Pac West saw its share price cut in half after it confirmed it was, quote, exploring strategic options. Western Alliance's stock tumbled after the financial times reported the bank was also exploring a sale. First Horizon scrapped a $13 billion merger with T.D. Bank, which sent its stock plunging more than 30 percent. As the banking turmoil continues to drag on, one senior analyst at a foreign exchange company tells CNN there's a lot of concern that, quote, something is about to break. It's a pretty dire warning. Let's bring in CNN's Chief Business Correspondent Christine Romans and CNN Chief White House Correspondent Phil Mattingly for this.

They're not a systemic problem.And I think that that's what Jamie Dimon, the chairman of JPMorgan Chase, was suggesting to analysts and investors earlier this week. There could be other shoes to drop, but the overall banking system is still fine.

Signature was caught up in some of the same mismatch issues in terms of what their balance sheets look like, but also some crypto issues as well. First Republic, everyone has known for the last two months, was right on the brink, and it was only a matter of time.To Christine's point, all very large banks, particularly SVB and First Republic, these banks we're talking about right now, are 40s, 50s, 60s in terms of size overall. What's fascinating is the issues that took down SVB in terms of having long-term securities that are deeply under water and not necessarily having the equity to match up with them. That's not necessarily out of the norm, particularly in a high interest rate environment. What's different now is people are looking at that data, which is publicly available, and then talking about it, talking about it on social media, talking about it online, driving short sellers to go after these banks, which in any other world would probably be fine, be doing normal course of business, and then you have pressure. And so they say, well, we have to raise money. And it comes out they're going to raise money, and that shows weakness. So, people attack them for that.

We're in a new phase of banking stress, and I think we will see headlines like this. We saw that merger that was scuttled yesterday. That was kind of a plain vanilla merger in February.

When you think about Katrina, Rita, Ike, Gustav, the B.P. oil spill, when you think about the fires in the west, the lack of water, we've got a real problem on our hands, and we have to get to a clean energy economy sooner rather than later. The president is and Senator Manchin right now on this particular issue have a difference of the speed, not really the direction.So, the Inflation Reduction Act also, by the way, had significant health care provisions to save health care costs and lower the costs especially for prescription drugs. So, if you undo that bill, you actually are going to take away the ability to create high paying jobs in states, like West Virginia and Kentucky and in Tennessee, and we think that's a bad idea.",
