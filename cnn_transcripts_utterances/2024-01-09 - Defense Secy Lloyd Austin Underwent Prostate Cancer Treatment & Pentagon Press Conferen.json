      "sentences": "A Pentagon press conference expected to begin here any moment. We are keeping our eye on that. You see the dais there.I want to go to Dr. Jonathan Reiner now. Doctor, just walk us through this. Obviously, prostate cancer is incredibly common. But tell us about your reaction to the diagnosis, the treatment, and then the complications from it. DR. JONATHAN REINER, CNN MEDICAL ANALYST: Yes. I think this was always going to be one of the more likely reasons for the secretary's hospitalization. For many men, this is a private time. Prostate cancer is super common. There's almost 300,000 new cases every year. About one in 40 men will die of prostate cancer. These moments in your life are very private. It seems like Secretary Austin is a private man. I understand why this is something that he perhaps would not want to deal with publicly. This diagnosis, depending on what stage it is, is managed in a variety of different ways. From just observation to, you know, hormonal manipulation, to surgical excision of the prostate, which sounds like he had right before Christmas. There are a variety of ways to remove the prostate. That includes robotic surgery. Complications can include bleeding or difficulty urinating. It's a little hard to understand perhaps what exactly the complications Secretary Austin might have experienced. But it's surgery, it's invasive, and complications can happen. SANCHEZ: Doctor, I'm curious to get your perspective on the second part of that. In a statement it was revealed his prognosis, when it comes to the cancer, is excellent. However, days after the procedure he had the urinary tract infection that you mentioned. There was further evaluation that revealed a collection of abdominal fluid impairing the function of his small intestine. Fortunately, the statement says his infection has cleared. Is that something common when it comes to that procedure? Is it something that could potentially be recurring?",

We just heard what we were describing before, which is we learned that Lloyd Austin, the defense secretary, was diagnosed with prostate cancer, had it removed, then had complications.And that is what led to his being in the ICU. Then to the controversy over the fact he had not disclosed to the White House that he had this. I want to talk to Dr. Reiner about this. And I want to tell our viewers we will keep listening, because this will likely come up again as we get to the Q&amp;A portion of the briefing. Doctor Reiner, just what you heard there, I mean, we should be clear that there was an issue with a UTI, and then a blocked intestine, or a backup as it was described in the statement. It must have been incredibly painful. We learned that during his stay, in this complication period, that the secretary never lost consciousness or never underwent general anesthesia.
