He now is in the United States and will face justice and be in a court soon. We don't know quite know when. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ROBERTSON (voice-over): Almost 34 years since the deadliest terror attack in British history, and the man accused of building the bomb that killed 270 people, mostly Americans, is finally going to face justice in a U.S. court. Libyan Abu Agila Mohammad Mas'ud Kheir Al-Marimi was arrested for his alleged role in blowing up Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, 38 minutes after it took off for the U.S. from London, killing everyone on board and 11 people on the ground. The U.S. first charged Al-Marimi for his involvement in the attack two years ago while he was already in custody in Libya for unrelated crimes. MICHAEL SHERIN, FORMER ACTING U.S. ATTORNEY: It is alleged in the criminal complaint, in the indictment, that at that time, all co- conspirators worked together to arm the explosive device in the suitcase.",

But by going to the moon and settling there, and looking for water and resources, and ways in which we can launch from the moon to go further to mars is very, very exciting.So I do believe that the time has come. It's been 50 years, as I said, we've been wanting to do this for decades to get to this point, but it looks like we are really there. Like no kidding, we now have some of the infrastructure built just to begin this. Just to get the rocket and the spaceship. We're going to have to build more to get down to the surface. But that's a lot more to come. I mean, even Artemis 2 is kind of -- I think it's going to be very doable. Artemis 3, will they walk on the moon again? I think they can pull out one for sure.

Astronauts are there to fly for their countries, for the world, for science. I think that what we're going to be seeing now as there's more access, now we can get to some other interesting things, like doing it for art or movie making or whatever they might be interested in doing.I still think there's a purpose in that. It might not be just exploration, science, understanding. It might be more in the entertainment area. In this case, I don't know too much about this filmmaker, but it seems like they're going to be using space for other reasons and doing things for the good of people, for the world, that is not necessarily in the direction of what NASA's goals are.

I think they -- I think the Russian general staff and the Kremlin absolutely believe that President Biden when he said that there will be catastrophic consequences.So there is no battlefield advantage for Russia to use it and the price that they would pay would be, I think, too much for them. However, by bringing things up like this, it gets it back into our mind. When we had actually gone several weeks without too much reporting about the possibility of a nuclear strike. So this gets it back in people's minds, as we enter this tough, cold winter and again, as you know, the Russian objective is to drag this out as long as they can in hopes that we'll lose the will to continue supporting Ukraine.

And it all really happened around the time of this hearing that was supposed to take place in another case, unrelated this, involving Alex Murdaugh.

It was June 7 of 2021, that Murdaugh said he showed up at the property that the family had in South Carolina and found his wife and son bleeding and no longer breathing. But prosecutors say that he didn't find them that - that way, he actually shot and killed them. I spoke with a source with knowledge of this investigation, and he told me that there was blood spatter found on Alex Murdaugh's clothing, which would have put him in close proximity to at least one of the victims at the time of shooting, this source said. The same source also telling me that there is video, which contains audio on Paul Murdaugh's cell phone that puts Alex Murdaugh, you hear him speaking to those family members at the crime scene, much earlier in the night than when he had called 911. So, prosecutors say that they were murdered between 8:30 and 10:06 pm on June 7, 2021.

She says she took a nap with her daughter on that last day and woke up to her father holding Caylee in his arms. C. ANTHONY:  She's soaking wet. I can see him standing there with her in his arms. And hand her to me and telling me that it's my fault. KAYE (voice-over):  Anthony says her father took Caylee after that and she doesn't know what happened next. Five months after Caylee was reported missing her skeletal remains were found in a wooded area about a half mile from the family's home. She had duct tape over her mouth and was inside a laundry bag and garbage bags. Anthony was charged with first-degree murder, lying to investigators and other charges.",

C. ANTHONY:  She was cold. KAYE (voice-over):  But in the new docuseries, Anthony puts the blame squarely on her father, suggesting Caylee died on his watch. C. ANTHONY:  And I know people are going to question, well why didn't I make a phone call? Why didn't I call 911? And I have to live with that, knowing that I failed to protect my child. KAYE (voice-over):  For 31 days Anthony kept quiet. C. ANTHONY:  During the 31 days I genuinely believed that Caylee was still alive because my father kept telling me she was OK. KAYE (voice-over):  When her mother finally called 911 to report Caylee missing, Anthony said the girl's nanny had taken her. Turns out that nanny never existed, which Anthony admits in the documentary. In the docuseries Anthony says she was lying to protect her father, as she'd been taught to do, following what she claimed were years of sexual abuse by him, beginning at age 8. C. ANTHONY:  My father was holding me down and raping me. That happens again and again and again. It was like I was brainwashed. And it wasn't until much later that I started to really realize why. GEORGE ANTHONY, CASEY ANTHONY'S FATHER:  G-E-O-R-G-E. KAYE (voice-over):  At her trial, her father, George Anthony, denied abusing his daughter or having anything to do with Caylee's death. Peacock says he turned down an offer to appear on their program. CNN has reached out to him for comment. After more than 100 witnesses at her trial, Casey Anthony was found not guilty of murder, but she was convicted of providing false information to police. She was freed shortly afterward due to the time she's spent in jail awaiting trial. C. ANTHONY:  She's still everything to me. KAYE (voice-over):  Anthony says she'll always wonder what really happened to Caylee. C. ANTHONY:  (Inaudible). I don't know if it would be better to know or just keep not knowing, because I don't know what the truth is. All I know is that she's dead and something happened.",

We're basically saying the same thing over and over for one month.Look, initially a month ago, when I started reporting on this, police said there is no threat to this community, this is a targeted attack, then they had to walk all of that back and say, well actually because we haven't made an arrest, we can't definitely say that this was - is not a threat to the community. On the other hand, you also have police still saying that, yes, they believe this is a targeted attack, but what they're saying is, it's not clear whether it was the house here behind me that was targeted or if were the students that were targeted in this case. Now, one of the most significant pieces of information that we've gotten all month is this white care. They're trying to find information about the driver or the passengers, of a white Honda Elantra. They say this is a car made between 2011 and 2013 and they believe that car was in this area near the house in the early morning hours of November 13, when these students were stabbed to death while they were sleeping. Authorities now saying they're getting a lot of tips on this white care. It's unclear if any of these tips had been helpful. But we do know that it's the FBI now handling all of these tips. There are almost 50 FBI investigators on this case. That's in addition to Moscow police. So, it's Moscow leading the investigation with the help of the FBI and the state police. A lot of investigators on this case and not a lot of information. You're also seeing a lot of speculation and a lot of rumors. And officers having to spend a lot of time debunking a lot of these rumors. And the bottom line is that a month later, Jim, we still don't have a suspect, we don't have a motive and we do not have a weapon.",
