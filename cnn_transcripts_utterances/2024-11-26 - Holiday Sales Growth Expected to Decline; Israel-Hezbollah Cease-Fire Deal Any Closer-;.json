Israel has coordinated -- a lot of people think this is talks between Israel and Hezbollah. It is not it is talks between Israel and the Lebanese government to control Hezbollah in the southern portions of Lebanon. They haven't been able to do that. The U.N. hasn't been able to do that. They have had a UNIFIL post in Southern Lebanon for almost 10 years now and haven't kept the Hezbollah terrorist fighters from occupying the southern portion of Lebanon and firing drones, rockets, missiles and artillery into Northern Israel.",

But as long as Hezbollah keeps firing rockets into Israel, Israel still perceives a threat, and they are going to fight back. The indications are that Israel has devastated Hamas in the Gaza Strip, but they are still facing literally thousands -- tens of thousands of fighters, Hezbollah in in Lebanon. And they want the government of Hezbollah to take control of those and make sure that they're not continuing to fire rockets into Northern Israel.",

They are willing to try and stop some of the -- at least the overt turmoil that's been occurring. But I got to tell you, we're still on a tinder's edge and it could certainly flare up again.

So, he considers Donald Trump to be a free trader. And then, lo and behold, Trump announces these tariffs are going to be happening on day one. You have some experience in this area of advisers, aides around the then-president, now soon-to-be president trying to control him, trying to talk him out of bad ideas, trying to keep him from going down the road of ill-advised policies.Can they get through to him in a second term?",

I think Trump is more determined to wage a trade war through tariffs than before. He's convinced himself that this is an alternative way to fund the government. He doesn't understand, I think, that Congress would willingly add another tax if they could get away with it, not reduce income taxes, but just add the higher prices that the tariffs would mean for revenue and spend even more. So it's a pretty fundamental decision. And there are people in the administration who are absolutely determined to carry out Trump's will here. I'd say good luck to secretary-designate Bessent. I'm not sorry, but I will certainly miss the discussions, the endless, repetitive discussions he will have dealing with Trump on this subject.",

He cited the longstanding Justice Department policy that says you can't prosecute a sitting president. What are your thoughts on these cases being dropped, especially the classified documents case, given that Trump took a big trove of these documents down to Mar-a-Lago and is not going to be held accountable for that?",

I think it's the proper policy.It's long been the Justice Department view that you shouldn't prosecute a sitting president. He's wrapping these -- Jack Smith is wrapping these cases up well before January the 20th, with one notable event yet to follow. And that's what I expect to the reports that he is writing on both the documents case and the January 6 case intended for the attorney general that are part of the regulatory structure inside the Department of Justice for independent counsels that will lay out what he found. And I think the question is whether the public gets to see those reports, which I don't think are going to be very friendly to Trump in either the documents case or January the 6th. I have always felt, of all the many, many pieces of litigation, civil and criminal, brought against Trump that the most important one and the one I'm I think is would have been most difficult for him to avoid is the classified documents case. And I think anybody who's dealt with classified materials knows how serious his offense was. And so that's why the report on that I think will be especially interesting.",

We saw what took place on September 11 and in the years that followed. It was a hugely costly time for this country in terms of blood and treasure. Are you concerned about just having Tulsi Gabbard in that role of director of national intelligence and the potential threat that is posed to this country by foreign terrorists? I mean, obviously, that is that is still a threat that looms out there. Can she run an office as important as that office is?",

I really don't know about her National Guard career, so I don't want to comment on that, but no experience in running a large operation or doing the coordination that the DNI has to do among 18 separate national intelligence agencies.I mean, my own view is, ODNI has become excessively bureaucratic. I think there are better ways to do it. But I'm not sure that's why Tulsi Gabbard is Trump's nominee to go. He's not interested in making ODNI more efficient and effective. He wants his person in there to probe the deep state. And I think this is going to -- since she has no knowledge whatever of what actually happens in the intelligence community, I think it's going to be a very corrosive influence. This is a bad nominee. I think, of all of what -- all the nominees Trump has put forward so far, she and Matt Gaetz were in a class by themselves. (CROSSTALK)",
