Prosecutors say they want to move this along quickly, they suggested December as a time when they would like to take this before a jury. And they insisted that it doesn't matter if former President Trump is running for the White House again, they said he should be treated like any other busy, important person. But his defense attorneys took issue with that, they said this is an unusual case. And it would be, quote, \"unfair\" to take this before a jury before the 2024 election. They insisted it was too early to even set a trial date. So here, Judge Aileen Cannon split the difference, putting on the calendar a May 2024 trial date. But in addition to that date, she also laid out a schedule, all the things, all the deadlines, all the hearings that have to happen between now and when this goes before a jury. And the Trump team said that they feel confident that they can get this push back until after the election. When you look at that schedule, it's clear how they could make that happen. Just a delay here, a hearing postponed for a couple of weeks of filing where they asked for an extension. Those weeks and weeks will add up pushing this closer to the election. And when you get too close to the election itself, it is expected that the Justice Department would be less likely to want to bring this to trial. Historically, the Justice Department has tried not to take any action that could interfere with the outcome of an election. And if Trump's lawyers wanted to fight it, it would certainly be a constitutional question of first impression ripe for the Supreme Court. Amara, Victor.",

You know, it's -- this is a man who has used his power over his crowd of supporters to encourage and instruct, essentially command many of them to come to the Capitol on January 6 and storm our nation's capital.So, these are not empty or idle threats. I think he's being very careful in the way he chooses his words, but there's no question what he is implying here. And that is, if you come after me, violence could be the result of that.",

You have to continue doing your job, they have to continue following their oath despite these threats, despite this, essentially, extortion by the former president of the United States against the current government. I can't even believe we're saying that on national television, but here we are. I mean, that's exactly what's happening. I do think that some of the out -- the effect of the successful prosecutions of so many people who came to January 6 to participate in the riot, I think that's had a deterrent effect, you don't see the same sort of mass following at his numerous arraignments. We'll see what happens in the next case to come down the pike. But that's what the government has to do. They need to keep holding people accountable, keep imposing significant sentences against people who follow his direction.

It's not unprecedented, but would it be rare to charge only one person with conspiracy? MCCABEI think the key here, Victor, is that what we're not really looking at is the impact of the target letter. DOJ doesn't have to send a target letter to anyone. It's possible to send it to some people in a case but not others. It's also possible that other people's target letters have simply not arrived yet. We know that there's a significant amount of work that they are still scheduled to do when you have more people scheduled to go into the grand jury in the next few weeks.

There's a little bit of room for improvement here, but it was a win, like you said and that's what matters.You know, that wasn't in question. We knew as back to back World Cup champs, they were going to come in and beat Vietnam but a lot of people may be thinking that they notched a couple of goals, they left a few goals out there. It's OK, those goals will come in is a very, very long tournament. But if you look back at the game, what matters is that they possess the ball for the majority of the time. And that's really what I think is the positive takeaway here. I mean, the Americans just did an incredible job for the majority of this three nil win. And it really didn't take Sophia Smith very long to make an impact in her World Cup debut, she drove the ball into the back of the net to open the scoring in the 14th minute. She is an absolute superstar on the world stage. She struck again deep in stoppage time at the end of the first half for her second goal of the game. And it was only two nil at that point your point, Victor, but she's just shy of 23. She became the second youngest player in U.S. women's team history to score multiple goals in a World Cup game. And then you had Megan Rapinoe, who started her final world cup before retirement on the bench. Came in as a sub in the 61st minute for her 200 cap for team USA, becoming the 14th floor to reach that milestone for her nation.

But it's also this increasing intensity on the Biden administration and the campaign's part of really engaging Ron DeSantis and taking him really to task and condemning these more cultural war aspects like this right to education and right to learn that we saw on Friday in March, a real shift from the White House not only just focusing on former President Trump and the threat that he believes -- that they believe he poses to democracy, but also now taking on Ron DeSantis on issues just like this, hoping once again to galvanize those voters before 2024.

Of course, you know, he's burning through cash pretty quickly as well. Why is he struggling to gain momentum? Is it because he seems to be so narrowly focused, in many instances on you know, these culture wars and wokeness, and what have you?BARRON-LOPEZ: Well, he's running to the right of former President Donald Trump. And we've seen that he's really been running a very anti-LGBTQ, anti-transgender campaign, and one heavily focused, as you've noted, on issues around book bands, you know, and has also championed, saying that his state is going to reject the Study of African American AP history. And so, that has been what his campaign has been focused on, it has not been focused on the economy or bigger issues that could maybe very well help him in a general election. It's a very much a primary campaign right now. And yet, despite all that, despite running to the right of former President Trump, he doesn't appear to be making any dent in him. Right now on average polls show that Trump has about -- is about 50 percent in the polls to DeSantis is roughly 19 percent. And when you talk to folks in these early voting states, it doesn't seem as though he's making any headway. And when he -- on one hand attempts to take minor jabs at the former president, he also then tends to backpedal on them and defend the former president.",

And as you know, Laura, has defense team wanted the trial to begin after the 2024 presidential election? What's the impact of this decision?BARRON-LOPEZ: His campaign team has been saying that this is a victory for them that that ultimately that this is something -- this is a date that they're happy with. That seems to be a bit of spin, Amara, because of the fact that as you said, they did want this to happen after the election cycle. But notably appears as though it may not be impacting that much of the primary race, although it'll come about a little less than two months before the Republican nominating convention. Where this could potentially have the most impact is in the general election. Because we've seen that when these indictments are handed down and when Trump goes into courtrooms or is arraigned that it doesn't hurt him among the Republican base, that instead they rally around him. And I expect that with the potential for a third indictment on the way that we could very well see a boost for him in the polls again. But the general electorate is very different again in the primary electorate, and there's no indication right now in polling that those moderate Republicans who have gone a little left in recent years or the independents are going to want to vote for a president that is facing multiple criminal charges.",
