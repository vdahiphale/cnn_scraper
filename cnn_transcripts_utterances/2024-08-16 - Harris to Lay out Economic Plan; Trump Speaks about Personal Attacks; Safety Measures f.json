We'll take a look at the numbers. Plus, so long 6 percent realtor commissions. A major shake-up in how realtors get paid. How will this change the way we buy and sell homes? I'm Sara Sidner, with Kate Bolduan. John, out today. This is CNN NEWS CENTRAL. Happening now, Kamala Harris' campaign releasing brand new details of her economic plan as a Democratic Party nominee soon hits a stage in North Carolina to lay out all the details in her first major policy speech. It is a series of striking new proposals aimed to lowering costs for American families she says. Among the highlights, huge tax breaks for more than 100 million Americans, an historic ban on price gouging, a $25,000 subsidy for first-time homebuyers, and a push to eliminate medical debt for millions. CNN anchor and chief political correspondent Dana Bash is joining us now. This is a very aggressive plan, Dana. How do you think that voters will be able to take this all in, and whether or not she will be able to deliver this when critics are going to be right there ready to lambaste her?",

The whole criticism of the Joe Biden campaign on the economy was that he was relying on, look at all the things that I have done for you, of which he had many things to point to, but voters weren't feeling it, so they weren't buying it. And so what Kamala Harris and her campaign are clearly trying to do is not run away from those things, but try to look forward, trying to look ahead and do so through the prism of what voters are feeling the most, where they're hurting the most.So, the question of childcare. A huge, huge issue for people. That is maybe the - one of the biggest rising costs for families. Housing. I mean we - you've talked on this show, I have as well, the price of housing, whether it's rentals or purchasing, any form of housing, is just absolutely, forgive me, through the roof. And so those are - those are some of the things that the Harris campaign knows will directly appeal to people who are not feeling the - on paper, if you look at the data, economic gains that the Biden-Harris administration has made.",

The policy attacks are intertwined with the personal attacks because, remember, for Donald Trump often it comes out as, can you do the job. He likes to talk about competence. You remember he was - one of the first things he said when he came down that golden escalator back in 2015 was, he was saying, we have a bunch of incompetent people running this country. That ties into the policy issues he spoke about yesterday. He talks about the issues around inflation and the fact that energy prices are up 50 percent over the last four years. That groceries are up 20 percent over the last few years. You know, we want to talk about tax policy on a day like today. It talks about whether Kamala Harris wants for repeal the Trump tax cuts, which, by the way, double the standard deduction, which over 90 percent of Americans take. It actually presented the largest tax cut in American history. Is she going to rip that away from families right now?So, it really ties into a bit of a larger thing.

He's standing in front of tables of groceries, higher prices than they were, you know, before the Biden ministration. But what he says, which is so jarring, is his defense of his personal attacks against Kamala Harris, calling her not intelligent and calling her all sorts of things.How does - what's going to stick with what voters? I guess there's no way of knowing. But if he's thinks it's all wrapped into one, it's really some - one thing is going to stick with voters.

He would probably fare better in terms of communicating a message and a plan then Donald Trump is right now, because what we heard from Matt today is probably what Republicans want to hear from Donald Trump.One of the things that Donald Trump has to stop doing, and this is just something that bothers me to my core, is you've got to stop calling black people and black women in particular stupid. And Republicans do that up and down. Lauren Boebert, for example, had the audacity to call Kamala Harris dumb. They call her a DEI hire. This is enveloped in racial undertones. So, just, for the love of God, Republicans, please refrain from playing these racial identity politics that you accuse Democrats of playing often and going down this path of insulting this woman's intelligence and calling her dumb, because we all know that by September 10th, when we're preparing for this debate, and when she gets on stage next to Donald Trump and she shows the world that he's an intellectual midget, then you're going to say that she was more well-prepared, and she's in courtrooms all day. And so what I don't like is for these racial undertones and for them to go down this path of calling her and other black women stupid. I think that clouds the message with those personal attacks.",

I don't think it has to do with race as much as it has to do with anyone who, you know, takes a swing at Donald Trump. He swings back.And so, now I will say, he also took a similar tact in the run-up to the debate against Joe Biden. He happened to be proven right. You know, you had a lot of other folks trying to raise the bar for Joe Biden and clearly didn't have to in that one. What I'd say though, at the end of the day, is that voters are going to look at qualities, they're going to look at policy in first and foremost. They're going to say, you know, Kamala Harris was there, you know, right next to Joe Biden when we had rising inflation and stubbornly high prices that make life unaffordable for us. They're going to say she was there during the Afghanistan withdrawal and that there was 13 gold star families as a result of that disastrous withdrawal. And they're going to ask the question if she ever reached out to those families the way Joe Biden didn't either. They're going to ask all those questions. But then it also ties into a larger issue around, is she going to be able to handle the job? They're going to look at the record she's had for the last four years, whether it's on the border, whether it's on inflation, and then they're going to make that judgment on that as well.",

Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MARTIN ESTRADA, U.S. ATTORNEY: These defendants took advantage of Mr. Perry's addiction issues to enrich themselves. They knew what they were doing was wrong. They knew what they were doing was risking great danger to Mr. Perry. But they did it anyways.

And they're saying during September and October of 2023, Perry got 20 vials of ketamine for $55,000. Keeping in mind here that one vile would cost about $12 for the doctor and he was charging like $2,000. That's what the U.S. attorney is alleging here.So, Dr. Salvador Plasencia is the main doctor that they were going after with this. They say they have text messages from him where he was texting another doctor saying, quote, \"I wonder how much this moron will pay.\" And also saying that he wanted to be the only source of ketamine for Matthew Perry as well. We know he entered a plea of not guilty yesterday. He did surrender his DEA license. That means he can no longer prescribe those controlled substances. He could face 120 years in federal prison. His trial will start in October. Now, the ketamine queen, I also have to mention her because they said they found drug selling paraphernalia throughout her house. They have also said that she is a risk to flee. So, she is being held. She's looking at life in prison. Then there's also the live-in assistant, Kenneth Iwamasa, who they say was injecting Matthew Perry with ketamine without any training, including on the day that he died, as well as another man, Eric Fleming, who they are saying was getting the drugs away from the ketamine queen.
