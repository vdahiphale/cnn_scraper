And China's Covid surge could cost nearly 1 million deaths. That is according to a new study. What else does the data tell us? We're live in Beijing straight ahead.",

And CNN has been working for months with our excellent team on the ground here to try to make this trip happen, to show people what it's like on this remote piece of rock, in the middle of the Black Sea, that is strategically crucial for Ukraine because it allows them to bring cargo in and export cargo out. If they don't control Snake Island, Russia could barricade the whole place, especially this port city of Odessa. But the Ukrainians are there. They're holding down the fort. And they told us their remarkable story.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RIPLEY (voice over): As the saying goes, whoever controls Snake Island controls the Black Sea. The safest way to get there, the Ukrainian military's inflatable speedboat with seating for six. It's small enough to stay out of sight. RIPLEY (on camera): We are really getting tossed around out here, but we need to take a small boat because we need to stay out of the sights of Russian reconnaissance aircraft. RIPLEY (voice over): Safer than a helicopter, but no protection from the Black Sea's big waves, bitter cold and whipping winds, not to mention the vines (ph). By the end of our stomach-turning journey, Snake Island's craggy cliffs are a welcome sight. Up close, a pier in pieces, previews the destruction we're about to see. We enter Snake Island by climbing up a pile of half-sunken, slippery sea blocks. We're the first journalists allowed here since Ukraine recaptured Snake Island five months ago. Russia blanketed the island with boobytraps before bailing out. RIPLEY (on camera): The soldiers told us we need to follow in their footsteps exactly and we need to be very careful where we step. This whole island is littered with land mines, unexploded ordnance. Basically a powder keg. RIPLEY (voice over): A powder keg with plenty of cats wandering through the wreckage of ten brutal months of war. Not a snake in sight. On February 24th, the first day of Russia's full-scale invasion, Russia's Black Sea flagship, the Moskva, aimed its arsenal at Snake Island, demanding dozens of Ukrainians surrender or die. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): I am a Russian military ship. I propose that you lay down your weapons immediately or you will be bombed.",

Something that, you know, my photojournalist, Peter Runin (ph), our local producer, Sosia Hock (ph), and our producer, Pier Groen (ph), we all certainly got a little taste of that. I've never been more cold in my life. I think I can speak for the other guys. They feel the same way. And yet it makes you feel alive. It makes you stronger.

So, joining me now, investigative reporter for \"The New York Times,\" Russ Buettner, who has been looking into Trump's taxes for years. Russ, good morning to you. I'm so glad you're here. As you saw in, you know, the clip that we put on there, promises, promises, promises, as I said, and then more excuses. He has done everything possible to stop people from seeing his tax returns. So today could possibly be worse for the former president than even yesterday's criminal referrals from the January 6th committee because this is something I think that concerns him the most, his wealth and whether he was accurate about his taxes, which will show what he's actually worth. RUSS BUETTNER, INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER, \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\": Yes, that's a good point, Don. I think this really goes to the heart of not only his -- how he's presented himself to voters and the public at large, but how he sees himself as well, which is a man of incredible wealth, can never seem the find other (ph) ranges of the billions just goes up and up and up every time he talks about it. And his tax returns, the 20 plus years' worth that we reviewed showed a very different story, that the bulk of his money has come from entertainment, from \"The Apprentice,\" from licensing deals that required no real business expertise on his part and from an inheritance from his father. And the businesses that he has run have kind of suffered or been consistent at best.

And then we should see -- one of the more interesting things is he's had - he talked about the audit and the great clips that you ran at the start of this. He's had an ongoing audit by the IRS for more than ten years of a $73 million refund he requested and received in about 2010. That was all taxes he had paid for most of the last 20 years on the initial windfall from \"The Apprentice.\"So, we'll see whether he's resolved that, I think. Whether it's still outstanding. We'll see the nature of any audits the IRS may have done for him. We could, if they chose to release that. We'll see, again, how much taxes he's paid. When we looked at it, he hadn't paid any taxes in 10 of the prior 15 years, and in two of those years he's only paid $750.",

The researchers are saying, if China can adequately increase the vaccination rate, they can boost the anti-viral treatments, that it could reduce the death numbers by hundreds of thousands.But what health experts are really worried about is what happens when Covid spreads to these rural areas with a much weaker health infrastructure. We're already seeing the hospital system under huge strain in major cities. Hospitals say they've been dealing with outbreaks among staff. Long lines like these are forming outside of hospitals in big cities, like these videos from Hangzhou and Wuhan, you can see the lines snaking as far as the eye can see. Now, China has also only announced a few Covid deaths since reopening. But what we see on the ground tells a different story. Just today I went to a major crematorium in Beijing. And you can see the long line of cars waiting to get to that cremation area. The parking lot was full of cars as well. Several people told me their loved ones had died from Covid.
