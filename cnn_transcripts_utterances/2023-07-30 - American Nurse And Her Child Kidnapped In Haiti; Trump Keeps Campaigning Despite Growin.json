Alix Dorsainvil worked for a Christian humanitarian aid organization called El Roi Haiti. She and her child were reportedly kidnapped Thursday morning near the Haitian Capital, Port-au-Prince. According to the group's website, Dorsainvil is originally from New Hampshire. Now, she moved to Haiti after her husband asked her to care for students at a Haitian school. Her husband, in fact, is the Director of the Organization and said his wife and child were taken while serving their community ministry. A statement says, in part, Alix is a deeply passionate and loving person who considers Haiti her home and the Haitian people her friends and family. Alix has worked tirelessly as our schools and community nurse to bring relief to those who are suffering. Now the abduction came shortly after a warning by the State Department for Americans to leave Haiti. Just yesterday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken had this to say about efforts to end the unrest there. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: We have very deep concern for the situation there, particularly with regard to violence and the activities of the gangs. We are, as I think you know, the largest humanitarian donor to Haiti, but we are also very focused on working together with partners to try to help the Haitians restore security, restore stability. That really is the necessary foundation for being able to make progress on a political way forward as well as making sure that humanitarian assistance can actually get to those in need. So we've been very focused on trying to put in place what's necessary for a multinational force, including finding a lead nation to take this on. And my expectation is that we will have some progress to report on that very soon. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And as is typical with Trump's rallies, there was a big crowd and a lot of energy.But one thing that was interesting was, the venue wasn't entirely full and that's not normal for Trump's rallies. Yes, there were a lot of people there on Saturday, but there were also many empty seats. But Donald Trump took to the stage at around 6 p.m. and he gave a pretty typical 2024 stump speech. He went through his agenda items for his campaign. He also walked through his highlight reel from his time in office. And he also spent a lot of time criticizing President Joe Biden. One thing that I found very interesting was that he made an appeal to Republicans and he told them that they need to investigate the Biden family more. And also to act on the information that they've gathered already. And he said any Republican that doesn't do that needs to be primaried. But he also spent a good amount of time talking about his own legal troubles. He railed against Special Counsel Jack Smith. He criticized the Justice Department. And he revived the well-worn playbook that we've seen him use time and time again when talking about the charges and the mounting indictments that are looming in front of him, which is to characterize them as election interference. And my colleague, Kate Sullivan and I caught up with some rally attendees as they were heading into the venue before his speech and they told us that they think Donald Trump is entirely right in the sense that they do think that he is the victim of a political witch hunt and that really the Biden family needs to be more focused on in an investigative context. And so, I think you're going to continue to see Donald Trump using the same rhetoric as he moves forward and continues forward with his very aggressive campaign schedule.

The State of Texas is putting them in the Rio Grande River to try and prevent migrants from crossing into the United States. But despite the fact that the barriers can put them at risk, migrants are not turning around. Rafael Romo has our story.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RAFAEL ROMO, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A mother and her young daughter attempt to cross the Rio Grande in broad daylight. Orange buoys four feet in diameter and anchored to the riverbed, as well as concertina wire, stopped them at the Eagle Pass border in Texas. A migrant family from Venezuela says they have been in Piedras Negras on the Mexican side of the border, gauging the risk of trying to cross the river with young children in tow. What we have seen is that people have gotten hurt with the razor wire, he says, adding that they're thinking twice before taking any risk. But his wife says the family fled Venezuela for reasons that are much more compelling than floating barriers, including crime, extortion and living under a dictatorship. Others say barriers or not, returning home is not an option. This migrant father traveling with his wife and young son says the buoys and razor wire are indeed going to make it more difficult to cross, but their mission, he says, remains unchanged, making it to the United States barriers or not.",

Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. SCOTT MISCOVICH, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, PREMIER MEDICAL GROUP USA: One of the contributing factors to the now rise this summer is the fact that there are so few people that have been vaccinated recently. If you look back of when the bivalent was available back in the fall, that's already well over six months for the elderly. And a lot of people haven't had a vaccine in a year. Well, what do we know about the vaccines? They're great for the first four months, for every age group. And then they start to slack at six months. The older you get, the less effective the vaccine is. So that's why we're seeing some hospitalizations increase and why we're going to see the people of all ages are going to be more likely to be able to get COVID because they're losing their immunity.",

And it's going to drop the original component of the vaccine that was in the bivalent, which is what we want now. And that vaccine will be available in September, probably mid to latter at the latest. And there's going to be a massive push across the United States to get your flu shot and to get your COVID vaccine updated. And then for the over 60, get that new RSV vaccine that's available.

Now, while much of the world is of course condemning the coup in Niger, the head of the Wagner Militia has a different take. Yevgeniy Prigozhin says Niger's troubles stem from colonialism and without evidence says that Western nations are sponsoring terrorist groups there.This image of him was taken recently in St. Petersburg on the sidelines of that summit of African leaders. Prigozhin also says Wagner is capable of dealing with situations such as Niger. In fact, in a lot of the video coming out of Niger, you see it there. There are scenes like this one, right? The Russian flags being carried by jubilant crowds. Wagner Militia contractors are currently in neighboring Mali, helping it fight an Islamic insurgency. And it's important to note that Wagner has a very sizable footprint in Africa well beyond that. These are the countries right now in which it's believed the mercenary network operates. And I want to turn now to David Otto. He's an Abuja in Nigeria. He is the director of the Geneva Center for Africa Security and Strategic Studies. And I thank you for joining us -- joining us now on what really have been stunning developments in Niger. And given all the uncertainty that we see there now, how does Wagner's presence and motives throughout the region further complicate the situation? DAVID OTTO, DIR. GENEVA CENTER FOR AFRICA SECURITY &amp; STRATEGIC STUDIES: Well, of course, we know that Wagner has a strategy and that includes pouncing on any opportunities, you know, that it gets to take advantage of the chaos. What they've done in Central Africa Republic is no different from the same that's -- you know, activities that they've done in Mali, in Burkina Faso. So, at this point in time, with the words of, you know, Ibn Ghamid (ph), what they are essentially saying is that they are possibly calling for the military junta to rely on Wagner. This is a private military contractor that specializes in providing regime security, not national security. So perhaps what we're going to see is that Wagner perhaps will want to expand by providing perhaps the military junta with options, which will further encroach on the democratic process, which Niger Republic had faced for the first time in its history, to see a democratically elected process just in 2021. So it's a very concerning scenario and I hope that the meetings which have been held by ECOWAS, which is the regional body, but also African Union, will find some kind of solution to pressure the junta to give back perhaps power to the democratically elected government or perhaps to have a transitional government.

Perhaps what have expected in the Russian summit was to see African leaders putting a lot of pressure on Russia and Vladimir Putin to discontinue the use of private military contractors whom, as I said, you know, they are much more focused on regime security than national security.But what I -- I mean, I don't know how this is going to go forward because, of course, the Russian president has made it clear that he would kind of integrate Wagner forces into his regular forces. But we haven't seen the same structure being applied to African countries. And I think this is where Africa needs to be very careful. Considering the fact that Wagner has the ability to turn against its own -- it's owner in the sense of Russia. We do not know if they can do the same thing in this African countries.

It has a huge presence of French troops and German troops that are stationed in Nigeria Republic.Niger was the last basket of democracy that some of the Western countries like France and the United States relied upon, especially when we saw some of the troops from Operation Baking that left Mali into Niger Republic and Burkina Faso. They went to Niger. Now, what we're seeing is this narrative of an anti-Western and anti-French demonstration. And perhaps, you know, we've seen also that some of the protesters are kind of calling on Russia to intervene. So it's going to cause a further chaos and it complicates matter for regional bodies like the African Union and ECOWAS on how to apply sanctions, you know, against this regime. But I have to add that some of the things that ECOWAS needs to do is to try and ensure that governments do not change constitution. We do not have constitutional coupes.
