      "sentences": "It's Monday, May 6th, right now on CNN THIS MORNING. Palestinians in eastern Rafah ordered to evacuate ahead of what the Israeli military says will be an anti-terror operation. Donald Trump returning to court for his hush money trial after comparing the Biden administration to Nazi Germany at a weekend fundraiser.And deadly flooding in Texas, hundreds rescued, thousands more displaced, and the rain may not be over yet. All right, 5:00 a.m. here in Washington. A live look at Capitol Hill on this Monday morning. Good morning, everyone, I'm Kasie Hunt, happy Monday, it's wonderful to have you with us. This developing story right now. The Israeli military ordering Palestinians to evacuate eastern Rafah with the IDF dropping leaflets on the area, warning, they're about to engage in a military operation targeting terror organizations in the area. A source on the ground in east Rafah telling CNN that people are terrified. And in a state of panic, following the evacuation order, there are 1.2 million displaced Palestinians sheltering in and around the city of Rafah, but the IDF says this is a limited scale operation in just the eastern part of the city. Joining me now is CNN's Nic Robertson. Nic, good morning to you. What do we know about this so far?",

      "sentences": "Yes, the IDF is telling people from about 12 blocks in eastern Rafah that they need to leave, they need to go to an expanded safe zone, which is closer to the Mediterranean Sea, the Al-Mawasi Refugee Camp.The IDF says they've expanded this up to the north towards Deir al Balah and towards the east as well in Khan Yunis. These are towns -- cities rather that the IDF has already had major operations. And so, it's telling this -- telling what U.N. estimates to be about a 100,000 Palestinian civilians living in that eastern part of Rafah to evacuate a move to this safer area. It's not clear how long they have or when this military operation will begin, but the IDF is telling them in these leaflets, in these announcements that they need to move immediately. U.N. officials talking about this to CNN in the past hour or so say that the area that the people are being evacuated to does not have sufficient water, does not have sufficient food. At least, one of the border crossings in the south was closed Sunday when Hamas fired rockets at an IDF position just over the border inside of Israel, three IDF soldiers were killed in that. The Israeli Foreign Minister's office has just put out a statement saying -- well, from the Foreign Minister saying that the fact that Hamas fired rockets yesterday from the area of Rafah is an indication that they are not serious about ceasefire talks. This does have all the hallmarks of a major military operation that we've seen in the past, even when the IDF says it begins small, and these safe areas for civilians are often not safe. People have died in them before.",

We know that Donald Trump has invoked Nazi imagery in the past, making those comparisons -- look, this is very much red meat to his base, who is at a fundraiser, really trying to get them riled up.But I think it also reflects the frustration right now that Donald Trump is facing. You know, he has been campaigning, but at the same time for the most part, he is stuck in a courtroom in New York City, and he's -- you know, not able to essentially talk about the trial as much because of that gag order.
