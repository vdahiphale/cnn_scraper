Well, a handful of House Democrats are joining the growing chorus calling on U.S. President Joe Biden to abandon the 2024 presidential race after his poor debate performance against Donald Trump. Lawmakers will be returning to work in the coming hours after they likely heard from constituents over the holiday weekend about whether the president should stay in the race.There's deep concern over having Joe Biden at the top of the ticket this November and what it could mean for the Democrats chances of retaking the House. Polls show Biden's support slipping. One Democratic senator says the president needs to do more to ease skepticism among voters. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHRIS MURPHY (D-CT): I'm not advising this campaign, but if I were, I would probably suggest that the president get out there and do a town hall, that he do a press conference, that he show the country that he is still the old Joe Biden, one of the best retail politicians this country has ever seen. The president says he can do that. I trust that he can. And I think this week is going to be really critical for him to answer those remaining questions. And let's just be honest, I think there are still questions out there in the minds of many voters. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And unfortunately for the Democrats, there isn't a candidate that shows that they could really be Biden.But if you look at the head-to-head between Trump and Kamala Harris, though, she doesn't have a very good approval rating or favorability rating. She would do about two points better than Biden. So I think what Trump fears is if the Democrats get a new candidate, there's going to be a lot of momentum and energy and maybe excitement around this new candidate. And that person could be really good at debating and picking apart Trump's weaknesses. You know, Kamala Harris is a sharp debater. She had one of the best performances when she was running for president herself. But of course, she has some of her own liabilities. So I think Trump feels this is going to be incredibly easy if he goes against Biden, because he's leading in all the national polls, but also in some of the key swing states, as I already mentioned. And those three states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin are absolutely critical for Biden to win. And as things stand now, if the election were held tomorrow, Trump would probably win.",

You think about the fact that he's running against a convicted felon who has all kinds of other issues that, you know, staging a coup, et cetera, et cetera.

In fact, President Emmanuel Macron's centrist Ensemble Alliance got 163 seats.Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally and its allies got 143. But it's worth noting that although the National Rally got 143 seats, it will be the largest individual party in the new parliament. Now, after the first round of voting, the far-right's run to power was undone by tactical deal making between centrist and leftist opponents. There was also a massive turnout. More than 200 candidates withdrew from the second round to avoid splitting the anti-National Rally vote.

Another 31 of them will be gathered for that big historic summit. And one of the hopes of that summit had been that they would have a bigger package, financial package on offer for Ukraine. And it looks like being something short of a multi-year deal and perhaps just perhaps as much as 40 billion over a single year.Why do I mention that? Because that kind of underscores the -- the sort of tremors that have been passing through NATO as all these sort of political changes with huge implications for NATO wrap up across Europe or roll out across Europe. And the French, the possibility of the far-right coming into power in France would have had a huge impact. So I think for that reason, there's a sense of relief in Brussels at the moment, but it will be tempered, of course, by the reality that there's a real possibility of a hung parliament, of sort of political inaction domestically, that rippling out to foreign policy, despite that's the purview of the president overseas. You know, we've heard from one significant European leader, Donald Tusk, the prime minister from Poland today. Of course, he was once the council president at the European Union. And he said this in Paris, enthusiasm in Moscow, disappointment in Kyiv relief. And he said, for us in Warsaw, that's enough. So it really does kind of capture that spirit that this is better than it could have been, but it's still not necessarily good. And rather, Washington and the NATO summit is one place where these things will get discussed, the sort of turmoil, the left-right pull, the unpredictability of what's going on in many of the significant European powers, because that affects NATO. It affects policies towards Ukraine. And it also affects the direction that the E.U. can take.

And he took a risk challenging the far-right's seeming supremacy in the European elections to strengthen his domestic hand as president. But it hasn't worked out that way.And so for an experienced politician to call it so wrong underscores, you know, what Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, will be looking at in similar results in the European parliamentary elections, which show him potentially how weak his governing coalition is in Germany and therefore to the enemies of NATO and the enemies of the European Union. And just look here over the border towards -- towards Russia or, for example, in Belarus today, where China has put its troops on a military training exercise in Belarus. What is that about, if not signaling to what some of these countries may think is a weakened European alliance? So, you know, I think, you know, when you hear from the Spanish president and you look at it in terms of, you know, of the political map across Europe and that instability that sort of is now is now the sort of unwritten message of the situation that enables the enemies, if you will, of these Western democracies. FOSTER: OK, Nic, thank you very much. Rosemary, I think one thing that's certainly come out of this is it's going to be a certain amount of deadlock now in the French parliament, which, you know, is a problem for one of the major economies in the world where you can't get things done in the same way.

There is more of a premium being priced in here on French debt. And actually, the spread between French and German debt has now widened to about 70 basis points, which is a really key metric if you're looking at how investors are thinking longer term about the French economy. And here's why. First of all, you're looking at a French parliament, which is split. It's going to be very hard for them to implement any kind of policy, given how divided it is. Secondly, the difference between what Macron would like to see in terms of policy and what the left alliance would like to see in terms of economic policy are really, really poles apart. Macron, of course, is very much pro-business. He wants to implement market reforms, particularly labor market reforms. Here we have the left alliance having the biggest block in parliament, and they would like to do things like increase spending, increase the minimum wage, return the retirement age to 60 and raise business taxes. So in direct opposition, really, to each other. And this at a time when France has a huge debt problem. This is really a situation for the E.U. right now. They want to see the debt reined in. I believe debts at 110 percent of GDP, the budget deficit at 5.5 percent, way above the 3 percent limit they're supposed to have. So now it's looking less and less likely that that will be possible.

      "sentences": "Yeah, I think, look, aside from the nuances in this relationship with which Ivan has laid out, the optics, as superficial as they may be, are very important to Putin. He's just had an E.U. head of state, Viktor Orban, of Hungary in Moscow, now the Indian prime minister. This is, by the way, a leader with Putin who really wants to present himself as a superpower to rival the U.S.So the more prime ministerial planes that can land in Moscow at this stage, the better. In think the second thing alongside that is that really this policy of confrontation with the U.S. informs pretty much everything that Russia does in terms of foreign policy. So any way to sort of emphasize or even create divisions in U.S. relationships is something that Moscow will welcome. And of course, as Ivan mentioned, India is a U.S. ally. There's a quote from Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman ahead of this visit, who said that the West is watching this, he said, jealously. He says they see it as very significant trailing. They are not wrong about this. So you can see that idea creeping through that Russia is trying to sort of recruit more people to its worldview as it sees itself locked in this sort of ideological battle with the West. There's a wrinkle in this, though, as well. While the U.S. and the West do not want to see India buy more Russian weapons than they need to. And by the way, the amount that they've been buying has been coming down in recent years. They do also see some expediency in Indian purchases of Russian oil. No one in the West, despite the sanctions on Russia, wants Russian oil to come off the market, because, of course, that will lead to massive price spikes that will affect everyone. So India buying up Russian oil has actually been relatively convenient. So there's some nuance in the way that the West will be watching these talks in this relationship unfold.",

Even the Catania International Airport, Sicily's busiest, was temporarily closed because of ash on runways. Officials say people should stay out of affected areas. Caution, again, the advice when viewing these natural and potentially dangerous wonders of the world.",
