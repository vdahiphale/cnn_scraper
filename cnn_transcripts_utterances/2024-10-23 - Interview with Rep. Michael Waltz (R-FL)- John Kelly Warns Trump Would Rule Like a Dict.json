What is clear about why Kelly has said this now, or really reiterated it, confirmed it, is that he has a lot of concerns about Trump talking about this enemy within, this idea of using the American military to target his own political opponents, which is a very un-American idea, and that that is something.

I mean, fascism really is about no checks and balances, no controls.They want to stack the Supreme Court, I've seen that legislation. They want to eliminate the filibuster, our last kind of harbinger of bipartisanship. They want to eliminate the Electoral College, which would have just a couple of cities determining our next president. Those are critical checks and balances that will check power for anyone, and the left is actually moving to eliminate them because they don't like him. So what I think voters are going to have to decide in these next couple of weeks is we have allegations of rhetoric from a conversation four years ago, or actions that they are seeing right now from the left or the lack of action in terms of making their lives better in the economy and crime and the border and in global chaos.

But the story really far from over with Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg saying all airlines have been mishandling wheelchairs for too long. And American Airlines has been one of the worst offenders.This was highlighted in a TikTok that surfaced last year and it shows American Airlines baggage handlers at Miami International Airport. You can see the wheelchair that they drop down the chute that is typically used for baggage. Now, the Department of Transportation says this is only one of thousands of cases that it uncovered between 2019 and 2023, not only of abused wheelchairs, but also cases of disabled passengers who were not treated properly by the airline. A passenger in a wheelchair told investigators that American Airlines treated her, quote, like cargo. The result, American Airlines is now facing the largest fine of its type. American will pay $25 million to the U.S. Treasury. On top of that, the government is mandating Americans spend $25 million on internal improvements, new technology and new training. So this does not keep happening. American insists it's already spent millions trying to course correct. And the airline even says its rating when it comes to handling wheelchairs and scooters has improved 20 percent over the last two years. Here's the statement from American Airlines. It says, quote, Despite these improvements, there are instances where the service the airline provides is disrupted, untimely or results in harm to the passenger or their equipment. American takes all these complaints and claims seriously and works hard to remediate them. That apology might not be the only one we will get from major airlines. The Department of Transportation says it is investigating similar violations at other U.S. airlines. The bottom line here is that this really sets the precedent. And Buttigieg says this fine needs to be big enough so airlines simply cannot consider this the cost of doing normal business.",

This is not like a $185 wheelchair that you're going to get from a pharmacy or a CVS or Kaiser or what have you. Some of these wheelchairs can -- especially custom ones -- can cost in the thousands. This is really lighting up online right now. And people simply want to know how airlines can get away with this. We get data from the Department of Transportation pretty much every month about when they have mishandled wheelchairs.But essentially, the bottom line here is that this has gone on for too long. It kind of became background noise in the industry. And the Department of Transportation really wants to deal with this, along with help from the Department of Justice. It got help from a special unit of the Department of Justice to try and investigate these things. So they're really trying to make it so that other airlines don't do this, that this is bar none.

On the second day of the sweepstakes, one of the things that the PAC reframed its messaging on this, they said that this was essentially a million dollars for a job, a payment for a job, essentially trying to change it away from a direct relationship to registering to vote. And they also said that you don't have to even vote. You could be registered to vote as a Democrat or Republican, again, trying to see if they can stay within the bounds of the law. Now, again, we don't know whether this will satisfy the critics because you've seen concerns not only from election law experts, you've seen concerns from the governor of Pennsylvania that this does run afoul of the law.
