Now, Rubio is a staunch China hardliner who was once dubbed Little Marco by Trump in 2016. He is now a fierce Trump supporter, and if confirmed, would lead Trump's diplomacy in Israel, Ukraine, and beyond.Also breaking overnight, CNN learned that Trump will nominate North Dakota Governor Kristi Noem as Homeland Security Secretary. Noem made headlines this last year for bragging about shooting her dog, Cricket, but this appointment is a huge deal when it comes to Trump's mass deportation agenda. Let's get right to CNN's Alayna Treene, who is near Mar-a-Lago this morning for the pace of these announcements. Good morning, Alayna.",

And particularly I think, you know, notable obviously given the animosity between these two men over the course of the 2024 campaign. But one person we know is not going is Melania Trump, at least as of now. We're told that decision is not set in stone. But as of now, when we talked to our sources on the Trump side, Melania is not planning to go. We are told that she had a previously scheduled event for her memoir that was recently released last month, and that they were unable to move it.But this is really, I think, keeping in how Melania Trump has really broken with traditional norms for the first lady. We know that back in 2016, Michelle Obama had hosted her in the White House. In 2020, Donald Trump did not invite Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden to the White House. So, this is kind of keeping in that norm of her breaking with tradition here. John?",

A critical meeting as U.S. aid to Israel could be in jeopardy over a looming deadline for Israel to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza. Of course, this meeting comes just one day before President Elect Trump returns to D.C. for his sit down with President Biden.CNN's Arlette Saenz is live for us from the White House.

      "sentences": "Well, Sara, President Biden's advisers have said that foreign policy could very well be part of the discussions between President Biden and President-elect Donald Trump naming the Oval Office tomorrow. The conflict in the Middle East is among the foreign policy challenges that Trump will inherit when he comes into office.But for President Biden's part today, he will be sitting down in the Oval Office with Israel's President Isaac Herzog. It comes at a time when the U.S. is still eager to try to reach some type of resolution to the conflicts between Israel and Hamas and Gaza, but also Israel and Hamas and Lebanon. But so far, it appears that the talks for a ceasefire and hostage deal between Gaza and Israel, which is a top priority for President Biden, remain completely at a standstill. Over the weekend, Qatar, who had been leading the negotiations between Israel and Hamas, said that they would be taking a pause from their role in that. So, there's many questions about whether any type of agreement can be reached before President Biden leaves office. Now, this meeting between Biden and Herzog today also comes as a group of aid organizations has said that Israel did not meet the standards that were set out by the U.S. to surge aid into Gaza. You'll remember that just last month, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin sent a letter to Israel outlining how they wanted to see additional humanitarian aid sent into the Gaza Strip or potentially say that if they did not, it could risk violating U.S. laws relating to foreign military assistance, raising the question of whether the U.S. could potentially withhold military aid from Israel. Some of the standards that they had set was allowing about 350 trucks of humanitarian aid into Gaza a day, as well as between 50 to 100 commercial trucks into Gaza as well. These aid organizations that released a scorecard overnight said that Israel has failed to meet those standards and many more. So, now there will be a major question for the U.S. today as that deadline is now today. Last week, the State Department spokesperson, Matthew Miller, said that he would not get into speculation about what would or wouldn't happen if Israel did not meet these steps, but that will be something for the U.S. to determine going forward. Now, at the same time, even as Biden continues to grapple with this conflict in the Middle East, you are also seeing President-elect Donald Trump engage in some diplomacy with Israel. Just over the weekend, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that he's spoken three times with Trump since the election. The former Israeli ambassador to the U.S., Ron Dermer, was just in Mar-a-Lago yesterday, a meeting with Trump. And so what you're seeing here is a bit of crossover between the Biden administration, which is who is currently in office, and Donald Trump, as it relates to this conflict in the Middle East and trying to find some types of resolutions.",

The Dow closed with another record yesterday and Bitcoin is back apparently hitting an all-time high.CNN's Matt Egan is tracking all of this and what it really can mean. But how, when it comes to the stock market, how long can this momentum keep? MATT EGAN, CNN REPORTER:  Well, Kate, someone that's going to be up to the president-elect himself when exactly he lays out his plans for tariffs and how high they're going to go and mass deportation, some of the more negative parts. But, look, for now, the market's going basically straight up. Look at this, the Dow breaking above 44,000 for the first time ever, a massive move of more than 2,000 points just since the election. And part of this is just relief that investors have clarity, right, that there's no recounts, this is not going to end up in courts, that there's certainty. Part of this, though, is Trump-specific. There's enthusiasm about his tax cuts and his deregulation. So, we've seen big bank stocks like Wells Fargo go very sharply higher because investors are betting that Trump regulators are going to go easier on big banks. Tesla is up 39 percent since the election. Again, as investors are betting that Elon Musk is going to benefit from his close relationship with the president-elect. Crypto is basically going to the moon. We've seen Bitcoin skyrocket to almost $90,000, and Coinbase, the biggest crypto exchange, is really cashing in. Also, prison stocks, like GeoGroup, are betting that they're going to benefit from Trump's immigration crackdown. For now, investors are all very much focused on the positives. The negatives have not been factored in much at all right now.",

What we saw was bond prices went down and yields went sharply higher. The ten-year treasury yield about 4.3 percent today. That's up significantly from almost two months ago at 3.6 percent.There's a few factors at play. Not all of them are Trump related. First off, this is because investors are getting more confident there's going to be a soft landing and no recession. They're also betting that growth will be even faster under Trump. And there is some growing concern about Trump's plans to potentially borrow trillions of dollars more. National debt is obviously already very high. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has projected that the Trump economic agenda would add another $8 trillion to the national debt, almost twice as much as what they're projecting under Harris.

Also, it's costing all of us more to borrow, especially mortgages. We see mortgage rates go higher.
