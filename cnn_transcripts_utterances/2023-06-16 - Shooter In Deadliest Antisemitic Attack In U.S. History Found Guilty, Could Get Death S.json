      "sentences": "Wolf, it really was an emotional moment. You know, we've been hearing from some members of the Jewish community here in Pittsburgh who said that they did feel a lot of relief when that conviction came down. But I have to say, just to describe the tone inside of the courtroom at that moment, it was also silent as they were reading those first charges and those first guilty verdicts. It just goes to show you how intently this community has been paying attention to this trial and to this case really for the past four and a half years, since October 27, 2018.Wolf, I just want touch on these charges that Robert Bowers was found guilty of today, 63 federal charges, guilty on all counts, and also guilty on 22 of the capital offenses. And the primary capital offense here was the obstruction of the free exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death. Basically, the jury said that Robert Bowers killed 11 Jewish worshippers while they were in the middle of exercising their religious freedoms as Jewish people. But as I said, the perspective is this has been a longtime company that a lot of folks have been waiting for and a hard trial to listen to over the past three weeks. I'll just bring up one testimony that we heard. We heard from Carol Black. She was a survivor of the shooting back in October of 2018. She described hiding in a closet while bullets were ringing out in the floors above her. She saw and watched her friend Mel Wax be killed. And let's read a quote from her. She testified, \"He immediately went down on the ground on his back and was dying. He didn't say anything, he made a garbling kind of sound and then just a grunt and then silence. His head was just inches away from my feet.\" That's the kind of testimony, Wolf, that we've been hearing for the past three weeks. And that's the compelling testimony that ultimately led to this conviction. Today we heard from the president, one of the co-presidents, I should say, of the New Light Congregation, one of the three congregations impacted that day from just a little while ago. Take a listen to what he had to say about this verdict. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STEPHEN COHEN, CO-PRESIDENT, NEW LIGHT CONGREGATION: It's difficult to say the emotions we feel right now. One of relief, obviously, that the jury returned a full verdict of guilty to all 63 counts. But there's also a degree of trepidation because this is just the first third of the trial. And in a sense it was the least complicated part. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And they found repeatedly excessive use of force against people who, in some cases, posed no danger to police officers. In one case, they described a woman who had called 911 to report a sexual assault in a nearby alley. She ended up being shot by a police officer who reported that he had been spooked by her present that when she appeared next to him.One of the things that the Justice Department report found, Wolf, was that African Americans and Native Americans were far more likely to be stopped and have encounters with police than white people. You can look at this graphic right here. In the case of African Americans, 6.5 times more likely to be stopped than white people, white people in that community.

So, this report told us and confirmed to us what we long suspected.

Putin also confirmed for the first time today that the first batch of tactical nuclear missiles that had promised to the neighboring country of Belarus have now been delivered, a delivery that's going to be completed, we're told, by the end of the summer. It's obviously designed as an attempt to saber rattle and to warn the United States and the west and NATO and indeed Ukraine of the threat that Russia poses. Well, again, speaking at that conference, I suppose Putin tried to allay concerns in the audience by saying the weapons would not be used unless Russia was threatened. Take a listen.

They want to ensure that it remains private. So that's why they filed this motion for a protective order, which would guarantee several things that they're asking for.First, they want to prohibit Trump and Walt Nauta, his co-defendant, from sharing any of this information that they're handed over with anyone other than anyone involved in the case. They also want to stop them. They want them to only have direct access to this material with the direct supervision of their attorneys. Also, they can take notes, but their notes actually must be secured by their attorneys and kept in a private place, and then they cannot share anything on social media. So these sorts of protective orders are pretty standard in these criminal cases. The DOJ is saying that Trump and his co-defendant and their attorneys have already agreed to it. All parties must sign it. The DOJ is saying it's important for this reason, saying that it contains information pertaining to ongoing investigations, the disclosure of which could compromise those investigations and identify uncharged individuals. Because, remember, the special counsel still has other ongoing investigations aside from the classified documents case. They're obviously looking into January 6th, whether Trump and his allies work to plot to overturn the 2020 election. So there's a lot of sensitive information, potentially, that they're handing over to Trump. And then one other thing I'll note, Wolf, today, trump's two attorneys that he has in the classified documents case, Chris Kise and also Todd Blanche.

So they're trying to limit what the Trump team can do with that, how they can communicate about it, those sorts of things.It is notable, though, that this only covers the unclassified discovery. There is another hornet's nest of issues they'll have to resolve around the classified materials that are involved in this case. The documents that underlie the 31 counts of retention of national defense information, you will see the same sort of protective orders entered discussing that classified material very specifically.

It sounds like a divorce proceeding rather than an attorney leaving a client. And I've talked to a couple of former Trump attorneys. There are a bunch of them out there now.And one of them said to me that he has found that this client is insensitive to almost every aspect of the rule of law. And he said that's why people leave. He also doesn't take their advice, and he also has a habit of turning his attorneys into witnesses, as we saw with Evan Corcoran.",

And that is that the Justice Department does not share information about ongoing investigations.They don't share with the White House. They don't share it with Capitol Hill. So I think they're maintaining a consistent position here. Remains to be seen how much respect Jim Jordan will have for this long accepted norm.",

It's the Justice Department who's weaponized the system of justice in the country. It's the FBI who's been -- that's been weaponized as well. And I think, you know, this is part of the ongoing fight that Republicans want to have because they know it's popular with the Republican Party. According to a recent Ipsos poll, 81 percent of Republicans believe that the charges against Donald Trump are politically motivated. And that's what Jim Jordan is playing to.",

My word does mean something to me, and we can probably all justify it that I'm going to be the nominee so I can support the nominee of the party. But I want to be straightforward about it.
