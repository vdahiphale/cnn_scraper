His lawyer raising concerns about whether Mangione could get a fair trial claiming he's being used as quote, \"political fodder.\" Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in \"The Situation Room.\" First this hour, we're digging deeper into the House Ethics Committee report on former Congressman Matt Gaetz and the disturbing, very disturbing evidence of extensive payments for drugs and sex, including a potential violation of Florida's statutory rape law. CNN's Katelyn Polantz is working the story for us. Katelyn, CNN has been pouring over and over these newly released texts, a detailed ledger and other evidence. Give us the latest. KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN CRIME AND JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT:  Wolf, it is tens of thousands of dollars in payments that the committee was able to find a document that they say amount to Matt Gaetz giving payments to women in connection to sexual activity and drug use. What they say is essentially him paying for prostitution and in one case giving $400 in cash to a woman who at the time was 17-years-old heading into her senior year of high school. This was at a party in July of 2017 where he had sex with that girl twice. That is the part where the House says they believe it could be statutory rape. When the House is putting this all together though, this is the astonishing thing about this report. We've heard allegations around Matt Gaetz for some time. He was investigated by federal authorities, never charged with any crime. But the House Ethics Committee in releasing that report today, they also made public a fair amount of detail, evidence, including a ledger, an extensive ledger, 11 pages showing payments, things for hundreds of dollars going to women from Cash App, Venmo. PayPal from Matt Gaetz, also from an e-mail account that he had, they say, under a pseudonym from another person's PayPal account. All of these ledgers are for hundreds of dollars saying they are reimbursement or gift or food. Now the committee says that is what is showing Matt Gaetz giving payments to women. So, they're putting everything together here in this very searing, damaging House Ethics Committee report that Matt Gaetz has been trying to stop from having made public, but now it is out there and he's denying these allegations against him.",

But he's also taken to social media to put his message out there. One of the things he says is, giving funds to someone you are dating that they didn't ask for and that isn't charged for sex is now prostitution. There is a reason they did this to me in a Christmas Eve report and not in a courtroom of any kind where I could present evidence and challenge witnesses.When he did make that court filing earlier today to try to stop the committee, he was claiming they were defaming him, they were invading his privacy, he even signed a declaration saying, everything that I am saying in court is true, signed by Matt Gaetz, but that lawsuit that he filed, it was moot by the end of the day because the committee released their report and it's been dismissed by the judge as of now. So now Gaetz is out there publicly fighting this on social media. And we are looking still though at the report itself, not just the committee's findings, but the evidence they gathered too.",

And I'm guessing that's what Gaetz is going to continue to rely on moving forward.I think there is a larger question here, though, as to why the committee felt the need to put this report out there. Matt Gaetz is no longer a member of Congress. He's not going to be the attorney general and their long-standing practice has always been as the chairman of the committee noted in a dissenting opinion today, to not release these kinds of things.

I think what's really damning about this report is that it puts it into a narrative, is that you have quotes from the women, some of whom have expressed regret after, you know, consensually abiding by some of these things, who basically say they had in some ways felt taken advantage of.So, I think the whole narrative put out there is what's damning about, well, certainly that it was pushed forward by really a group of Matt Gaetz peers. Now the question going forward is not just what his political future may be. Obviously, there have been suggestions that maybe he goes back to the House, maybe he goes to an unconfirmed position in the administration, but it's going to be what Donald Trump has to say about these allegations. Of course, Donald Trump is somebody who feels that these institutions have been weaponized against him. He may feel that Matt Gaetz is going through the same thing. Obviously, he's chosen for AG because of the ability for him to tear down these institutions.

And so, this is certainly somebody that's going to be in the Trump orbit.I think what's really interesting here is that folks who are kind of these Trump loyalists, they kind of have a different set of rules, different set of playbooks about how accountable they are in situations like this or how really career damaging reports like this, specifically some that don't have bases within the DOJ or that weren't prosecuted by the DOJ, how damaging they are to their career. And so, I think that Matt Gaetz, as long as Donald Trump is by his side, is within that group of people who maybe these types of reports don't damage as much as other Republicans. But I think, of course, we will have to see. Yes, he'll be on own network with his own, you know, basically be able to use that as his own megaphone. We'll see about whether or not he runs for office again or goes back into the office and goes back into the House in January.

I guess from the perspective of a prosecutor when it comes to picking a jury for either of these two cases, I think all of this pretrial publicity is going to make it much harder to pick a jury when this comes up.Now every prospective juror is going to have to answer questions about whether they saw the mayor making comments about this defendant, whether they saw the perp walk.

My -- my job is to go to work on January 3rd, I get sworn into the Senate and to focus on securing our border, growing our military, making our military strong again with adversaries around the world like China and others who are trying to beat America in many ways, militarily and economically.So look, Wolf, that -- that's what I'm focused on. The -- the report speaks for itself. If Matt Gaetz ever puts his name on the ballot again, then his voters can -- can make that decision. He has a right to defend himself, like I said before, and I know he will do that. I -- I served with eight years with Matt. He's very smart. He's very talented. And I know that he will do everything that he can to clear his name. And he has a right to do that. But the -- but the contents of the report, this ethics report, are very serious. I -- I -- I expect the public to react to it in a serious way. But he's not -- he's not a nominee, he's not a congressman anymore. He's a private citizen of the country.

I -- I don't take anything that Donald Trump said yesterday as downplaying Elon's role.In fact, we know that Elon has spent a considerable amount of time with Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago and many of the important meetings and conversations about forming a cabinet that will grow this country's economy and put us back on track to where we need to be. So I'm proud of that. The -- the -- the government efficiency effort that Elon and Vivek Ramaswamy are leading are so important to make our government work for the people again, to shake up Washington.

And the return of Donald Trump to the White House weighed considerably on his decision to grant clemency to these 37 individuals. In a statement, he said he was guided by my conscience and my experience as a public defender, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Vice President and now President, I am more convinced than that we must stop the use of the death penalty at the federal level. In good conscience, I cannot stand back and let a new administration resume executions that I halted.Many of those whose sentences were commuted today had been convicted of killing fellow prisoners, law enforcement officers or service members. But the move by Biden to commute their sentences was praised by the ACLU and the Legal Defense Fund, which even suggested that Biden should go further and remove those three remaining inmates from federal death row. Those individuals have been convicted of orchestrating mass murders at the Boston Marathon bombing, a historically black church in Charleston as well as a synagogue in Pittsburgh. Now, the Supreme Court had previously deemed capital punishment unconstitutional, but it was reinstated in 1988. Since then, only 16 executions have taken place, but the vast majority of those took place during the twilight of Donald Trump's first term. That was why activists had earned urged President Biden to take this step and avoid what they feared would be executions en masse when President Trump took office for a second term. Wolf?",
