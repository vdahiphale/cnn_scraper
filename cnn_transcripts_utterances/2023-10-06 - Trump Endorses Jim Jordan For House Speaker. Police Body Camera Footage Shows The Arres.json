There was the manufactured shutdown drama over the weekend when Congress cited to just kick the can down the road instead of maybe finishing the task at hand. Then on Monday, day one of Donald Trump's quarter of a billion-dollar fraud trial in New York City. Yeah, I said billion with a \"B.\" Tuesday, Kevin McCarthy got voted out of the job that he risked everything to get. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP.

It was the former president throwing his support behind Trump acolyte, Jim Jordan, for the speaker of the House. That's the second in line to the presidency, remember? That after floating the idea that he would actually take the job himself. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP.

TGIF did not give you a reprieve from the whiplash, everyone. First, there were multiple sources saying that the former speaker was going to step down before the end of his term.

But it's actually not fiction. It's real life.I mean, look at all the problems in real life we are facing. There's aid to Ukraine, there's funding the United States government, not a minor detail, there's the immigration crisis, the epidemic of gun violence in this country, the climate crisis. And fasten your seat belts because we are actually no closer sitting here right now to finding the next speaker of the House. The GOP conference isn't even going to meet until 6 p.m. on Monday. They get the weekend off just like you do, although maybe one set of us should be working. They have a candidates' forum on Tuesday. They've got a closed-door meeting on Wednesday. The question is, will it be Jim Jordan who emerges or Steve Scalise or maybe someone else we're not even thinking about on this Friday evening? And if it is Jim Jordan, what does his track record tell us about what he'd be like as Speaker of the House and the leader? If he becomes the next speaker, would his politics, his unique brand of politics, redefine the Republican Party? I mean, this time next week, think about it, we might have the answers to who will be holding the gavel and who will be left holding the bag. I want to bring in CNN political commentator and Democratic strategist Maria Cardona, former Republican Congressman Joe Walsh, he's the host of the \"White Flag\" podcast, and Republican strategist Shermichael Singleton.

He's now gone. Boehner left. And now, you have McCarthy gone. I mean, they were supposed to be the next generation to sort of carry that establishment mantle, and I would argue that is no more.

We all knew that we would most likely get somebody worse because most of the people who could win as speaker were going to have to be a lot more extreme than McCarthy, and we're seeing it now with Jim Jordan.The issue though is, is that if they do embark on a pathway to try to implement an agenda that is far out of the mainstream of the majority of the country, that is going to give Democrats yet another opportunity to demonstrate why it is that Republicans don't deserve the majority, why it is that Americans cannot trust them to actually solve, govern, and lead. Because Democrats will demonstrate that they have tried to work with them across the aisle, negotiate in a bipartisan manner, which in a divided country is the only way to get anything done, and will be able to say, look, they don't want to do it, they don't deserve to win.",

What we all know is that certainly, there's an indictment as it relates to Tupac's murder and the police believe, based upon a longstanding investigation, that they have the person who is responsible.So, at least, as to that, right, an indictment, of course, by a grand jury in Las Vegas, Nevada, of course, what would end up happening is you have 20 grand jurors, twelve of which must concur, that is a reasonable cause to believe, uh, that a crime was committed, in this case the murder of Tupac, and that the defendant, Mr. Davis, committed it. It's not at all a conviction but it's significant. They believe they also have means, motive, and opportunity. What are we talking about? In terms of the motive, we will start there, we know it relates to Mr. Anderson and him being attacked right after the Tyson fight in the hotel. And as a result of that motivation, the motivation was retaliation and payback. The means is the actual weapon, of course, used in that particular case to kill Tupac, and the opportunity was at the traffic light. So, in answer to your question, certainly, they look -- they think law enforcement does, that there's a connection and that he's guilty, Mr. Davis, of the conspiracy to kill Tupac. We just don't know enough yet as it relates to notorious B.I.G.",

You know, in the aftermath of the shooting involving Tupac where he died, you know, there were what was called 10 days of hell in the Compton area where over the course of those 10 days, an additional three people and 10 others were wounded in the aftermath of the gang warfare that kind of erupted as a result of this shooting. And Davis is someone who is implicated in the connection around the Compton gang affiliation back home and just the way that he has spurred a lot of activity around this. He has now a longer and wider legacy that doesn't just implicate himself in Tupac's death, but all the trauma and carnage has been left behind in the wake of what has happened because of the longstanding history that kind of got quieted as a result of the death of both Tupac and Biggie, which is like the gang insinuation inside of hip-hop music and record labels. And so, all this is greatly knotted together. And I think for Davis, I think he was feeling perhaps some level of invincibility around constantly skirting -- you know, he had gone away to prison, but I think this still feels like some type of odd feather in his cap --",

I think that's probably part of the most poignant aspects of this incredible new book, Malcolm.And one part that people have honed in on in recent years for the NFL and their interest has been about the intersection of race and the sport. And in fact, Colin Kaepernick is but one example. And you, of course, have begun an advocacy organization within the NFL at one point. And you mentioned Kaepernick in your book. I want to read a part of it. It says, I was inspired by the momentum that had been created by his stance. This type of groundswell of coverage and eyeballs hadn't really been seen before, and we had an opportunity in our hands to grasp it if we could organize. I just hadn't anticipated that organizing would be so damn difficult. And of course, Kaepernick is not the only issue on race the NFL is dealing with. It's also facing a discrimination lawsuit from Brian Flores and another former NFL network reporter, Jim Trotter. When you look at and contextualize all of this, does the NFL have a race problem and can they fix it?",

And the NFL is no exception to that. You know, I think, you know, over the last since 2016, this has been a hot topic, whether it's the on-field protests, whether we're looking at the amount of head coaches and GMs, presidents that are African- American or any diverse background. There's definitely very little, you know, diversity in the ownership group.But I do think we've seen them move their stance quite a bit since those days in 2016, obviously, with much more branding, much more -- open to players and societal issues. But I still think there's a lot of things that can be approved on. you know, the coaching this year has been -- there are more Black coaches now than probably we've ever seen. With more Black quarterbacks starting than we've ever seen. But I do think that there are constantly these issues that are still kind of lingering. We still -- and that's because of the ownership, right? There's -- at the top of the NFL, there's very little diversity. So, until you start to see some of those changes, there's always going to be, you know, these issues that are going to be pointed out.",

And so, for that, you would love to see him have an opportunity.But here we stand seven years, you know, removed from that moment. And if this were not Kaepernick, any athlete that was out of their career for seven years, I would probably tell to hang it up, right? It's just -- that's just a long period of time. So, realistically speaking, I don't know that we'll ever see him put on a uniform again, which is unfortunate because of what he sacrificed his career for. But obviously, we all hope for the best.",
