So this is a person who is polarizing, to say the least in Washington. On top of that, this is the Justice Department, this is one of those very large organizations with a lot of prosecutors who are working in the American court system on cases. We may never hear much about in the public sphere. Just having the ongoing bringing cases into court. There has been a push in recent years from Attorney General Merrick Garland to stabilize that workforce, but already, Richard, just on this announcement from Donald Trump that Matt Gaetz is who he wants to try and have confirmed as the attorney general, I have been hearing from people at the Justice Department and those in touch with them, they are in absolute disbelief. And one person I spoke with who is close or who was potentially one of the choices here for the attorney general position, someone that was in the running implied that, well, we will see what happens next, implying that perhaps Gaetz may not make it through a confirmation process.

Other attorney generals very often, and many people who were even looked at by Donald Trump often come from private practice law. They are defense lawyers. They're former prosecutors. That's different than Gaetz's history coming out of Florida as a politician. And the other thing, Richard, to point out here, Gaetz has been quite vocal about opposing both criminal cases against Donald Trump in court, calling January 6th not an insurrection and then cheering when a judge in Florida dismissed the Justice Department's work bringing that classified documents case against Donald Trump, but the Justice Department still is trying to fight on appeals.

And of course, you have the commander-in-chief. The three of them together is quite powerful as you say. Will it be powerful enough for Trump's most extreme positions? That is an open question. Will it be powerful enough and big enough for Trump's most extreme appointments? And I think we could put someone like a Matt Gaetz in that category. You're already seeing Republicans react to this saying they're not on board for it.

Pete Hegseth is not that, let's be frank, 2.1 million people, enormous budget. And you have to, you know, walking around that building, the Pentagon, which I've done for years, right, you're surrounded by folks covered in brass, right? So they now have to look up to Hegseth, if he were to be confirmed, and that's -- listen, I spoke to folks in those positions last night as this was announced, folks currently serving or recently serving under both Trump and Biden. And I want to give you a sample of what they said to me. One said \"effing nightmare.\" And I am using a euphemism there deliberately. One said \"ridiculous.\" Another said that the one commonality here is loyalty and loyalty while essential, this recently retired four-star general told me, he said that it is a problem when it becomes slavish fealty. So these are folks, by the way, who are not partisans, who have served both Republican and Democratic presidents in Biden and Trump with loyalty and commitment. So, you know, the reaction has not been good, let's be frank and that befits the other choices. We had mentioned Tulsi Gabbard as the director of National Intelligence, America's senior most intelligence official, right, let me just -- you know, it is not just personality with her, right? She has public positions that contradict US positions and intelligence assessments. When Russia invaded Ukraine, that same month, she blamed it on Ukraine and NATO. Right?

The reason we are doing it is because the rest of the worldneeds to see exactly where this is going to go? How is it going to play out? Not that the president-elect doesn't have the right to do this. Of course, he does. It is his job. But there is -- we all have to understand and make of it what we can, which is why the retired US Army General Wesley Clark is with me and is going to make sense of this appointment at Defense. Please go ahead, sir. GEN. WESLEY CLARK (RET), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, I think that first of all, you do have to acknowledge that the president has a right to appoint whomever he wants for this position. Secondly, the president is going to have unparalleled power. There has never been a president in the history of the United States who has had as much power going in as President Trump will have, with the court, the Senate, the House and his appointees that he is putting in, loyalists. So it is going to be his government, and I think what he wants in the Pentagon is someone who is going to serve up options and to give him some advice that supports his positions, and I agree with what Jim just said about fealty and so forth. But when you look at this, nobody, almost nobody who goes into the Defense Department is actually prepared to run it unless they've been through it before. Even Don Rumsfeld, who was former Secretary of Defense came back in 25 years later and he found everything had changed. So, it is a huge organization. Hegseth, he has been to Harvard. He has been around Washington. He has got strong opinions. He has got to have qualified people working for him and, and I think, you know, he is going to have resentment from some of the senior officers that are there and maybe even the junior officers. But it depends on how he conducts himself and if he conducts himself with maturity, with wisdom, with some grace. But if he goes at it in such a way that it is a vendetta against certain generals, because they supported a diversity programs, or they are part of a diversity program, then he is going to have a real upheaval in the Defense Department.",

And so this is what President Trump promised the American people, and this is what he is preparing to deliver. Now, the history of purging generals is not a good history for any military. It didn't work for Joseph Stalin before World War Two. It didn't work for Hitler in World War Two . And, traditionally, we've never done it in the US military, that's why men like Mark Milley were so forthright in saying that the loyalty is to the Constitution.

But in this case, it's taken a full week to realize, a full short week to realize if there was any hope of seriousness in the Trump administration's appointments or him surrounding himself with anyone skillful, that he's going to do that sparingly. You see some people he's named for his cabinet, perhaps his secretary of state and such, who may be serious people, but then you see other folks who clearly are an indication at least that he's much more worried about loyalty and fealty to him than he is about the competence or the ability to do the job with some -- some level of professionalism and -- and dignity.",

GARY BOWERMAN, DIRECTOR, CHECK-IN ASIA: What happened in Vietnam, it had a slow recovery in terms of tourism inbound after the pandemic. There was a lot of criticism about the slow recovery in terms of visa free access. You know, look at countries around the region like Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, they were very, very quick to reactivate visa free access for key markets like India, from China, from other destinations and markets around Asia Pacific. Vietnam was much slower to do that. But since then you've seen the recovery of the demand for visiting to Vietnam. And two reasons for that. One, I think it is has really strong destination appeal, particularly in the post pandemic era. A bit like Thailand, it has this really intangible appeal tourists.
