Erin, we'll get back to you shortly Thank you very much. Jamie Gangel, Audie Cornish and Mark Preston are back with me for more perspective right now. Audie, let me start with you.

You know, this is a very difficult job and they're not it in for partisan, you know, reasons. Even though many of them are partisan elected.So, look, I think we are going to have problems.

And then obviously, you know, we're going to have a lot of polls closing at 7. So, Governor, what race or races are you most focused on? GOV. ASA HUTCHINSON (R-AR): Well, you start off with the Senate of course, because even the White House acknowledges that the Republicans should win the House.

It could be the first time there's a transition between a Republican and succeeding Republican administration.So, that I'm paying attention to. You asked me about the ballot initiatives. There are five states that has marijuana -- recreational use of marijuana and that to be decriminalized or legalized in those states, Arkansas is one of those that will be on the ballot. It's called issue 4, I've campaigned against it but it's going to be critical as to really help shape the direction of our country. Senator, what do you think? Do ballot initiatives matter?",

Secondly, there'll be hearings, there'll be investigations. They'll investigate Hunter Biden. It'll be very toxic and Marjorie Taylor Greene and those people will want to impeach Biden.

It is a bit of performance art between the Democratic Justice Department and the Republican DeSantis administration. Not a shrinking violet in terms of looking for statements to make.Look, these are the three heaviest Democratic vote counties in the state of Florida. Natural for DOJ to want to go in. Again, there's no reason that DOJ monitoring shouldn't be in polling places. They traditionally are except for 2020. When those monitors go in, they are traditionally seen and not heard. But they do make note of things, and so, again, their presence there helps to validate the way the vote is being conducted.",

It's where there could be problems. If Democrats want to be sure that their base vote turns out, they want it to be in those three counties. If Republicans were to take weaponized poll watchers, which is a possibility under the new Florida election law that was passed, they would try and potentially slow down voting in those three heavily Democratic counties.
