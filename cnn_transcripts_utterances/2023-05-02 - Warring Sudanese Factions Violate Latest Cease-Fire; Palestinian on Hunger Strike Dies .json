Sudan's military and the paramilitary rapid support forces or RSF both appear to be repeatedly violating truce extensions. Their respective leaders locked in a bloody power struggle that has claimed hundreds of lives, injured thousands more and inflicted misery on those stuck in battle zones, with dwindling food, water and power. Our reports see two sides may hold cease-fire talks in Saudi Arabia. That country an initial entry point for some of the 100,000 Sudanese citizens and thousands more foreign nationals, who have already fled the fighting. Larry Madowo reports from Jeddah in Saudi Arabia, where more people fortunate enough to escape the fighting are still arriving.

We are getting reports of at least three injuries, one of them a 25-year-old man in serious condition as a result of shrapnel. As of right now, the Israeli military has advised people living near the Gaza Strip that they can go about their days as normal. They do not need to stay near protected areas. We are hearing from the militant factions in Gaza, who are claiming responsibility for these rocket fires, saying that it is a preliminary response to the heinous crime, they say, of Khader Adnan's death. Adnan was a well-known figure here, really a symbol of Palestinian resistance and for Palestinian prisoners. He was once a spokesman for the Palestinian Islamic Jihad. He had been arrested at least 10 times since 2004 and this was not his first hunger strike. He had been on at least five hunger strikes in the past. This one, he was found unconscious this morning, the Israeli prison authorities say, after more than 80 days of this latest hunger strike. The Israeli prison authority say he had refused medical treatment during his hunger strike. However, his attorney did tell army radio that they had requested that Adnan be released to a civilian hospital. They did not believe that the prison authority medical clinics were well equipped enough for Khader Adnan. But beyond the rockets, the reactions we are seeing from the Palestinians is a general strike in the West Bank and Gaza. Everything from shops to schools are closed as a result. And we are seeing, from other Palestinian prisoners in Israeli prisons, who are taking on their own hunger strike in response to Khader Adnan's death. We are also hearing from his wife, who says she does not want these types of rocket fire from Gaza. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RANDA MUSA, KHADER ADNAN'S WIFE (through translator):  Not a drop of blood was spilled during the previous prisoner's hunger strikes. Today, we say, with the rise of the martyr and his accomplishment of what he wished for, we do not want a drop more blood to be spilled. We do not want someone to respond to his martyrdom.

And then in the last 24 hours, Ukrainian officials saying that they've seen Russian troops abandoning positions and they've been able to move forward. It's hard to tell what's really going on here. But it's certainly not the swift victory that Russia began the winter with. So this continued focus on a deeply symbolic but strategically less vital city has shown through these White House figures the extraordinary loss of Russian resources expended on this one single goal, ahead of a counter offensive. But pretty much anyone you talk to, even on the Russian side, accept that Moscow is going to need everything it possibly can to hold on to the parts of Ukraine they still occupy.",

And so, regarding residual fees and how many writers are employed by shows, I think those are the main sticking points that you've seen emerge in these negotiations, which have been occurring over the past six weeks.

Daily soap operas as well. But those other shows that are supposed to debut in the fall, there's some more leeway there. So we will see what happens, if the strike does go on for months. Those could also be postponed. There are some big issues. So I'm not sure how quickly they are going to be resolved. The AMPTP, which represents the studios, they are saying they are willing to budge and move up on some other things but that basically they have hit a standstill with the writers about things concerning streaming. The main issue at this point, according to AMPTP, is that, because streaming services have revamped the way shows are produced, there's only about 10 episodes per streaming season versus 20-plus for a broadcast network. Because that's the case, the studios employ less writers. And the writers want to account for this. The studios are saying no. And so that's the main clashing point at this point, it seems.

You had Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer reiterate his calls to pass a clean debt ceiling hike without any conditions. He's even getting backing from some red state Democrats, up for reelection next year. That's a critical sign of where the winds are blowing. Then on the Republican side, they are completely united behind speaker Kevin McCarthy, who has called to pass a debt ceiling hike in exchange for spending cuts. That's something they passed in the House. Senate Republicans say they are supporting McCarthy and won't do anything without his blessing. So we are continuing to be at a stalemate here. We are nowhere closer to finding an actual way to solve this crisis. And there are only a few weeks left that Congress is in session, before that potential June 1st deadline. So really, all eyes are on this meeting at the White House on May 9th between speaker Kevin McCarthy, Joe Biden and some of the other congressional leaders.

It's to do with the unintended consequences of this sort of technology and just how fast it's being developed. The concerns are threefold. The first, is the immediate problem that Dr. Hinton sees, of what is real and what is not. How are people going to know, what is AI generated or AI manipulated and what is real? We are seeing this every single day. Some examples are fun, some are really serious. We have everything from a new song coming out that appears to be by Drake and The Weeknd and then you find out, once it's been downloaded, hundreds of thousands of times, it was actually AI generated.
