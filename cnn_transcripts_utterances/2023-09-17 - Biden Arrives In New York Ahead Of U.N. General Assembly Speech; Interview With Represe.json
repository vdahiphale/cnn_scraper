      "sentences": "Well, Jim, it's shaping up to be a big foreign policy week for President Biden as he has now arrived in New York City where he will attend the United Nations General Assembly. On Tuesday, he will give remarks in front of that group. The White House saying that he will lay out America's vision for leadership around the world and also talk about the need for countries to work together to confront some of the biggest challenges they're facing.But in addition to that large meeting, the president also will be holding one-on-one meetings with various world leaders throughout the week. Some of the most closely watched meetings will include a meeting on Wednesday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. There had been a lot of questions about whether such a meeting would even take place since Netanyahu came into power last year. The White House has expressed criticism about Netanyahu's government's plans to overhaul their judicial system. So there had been questions about whether the two leaders would meet at the White House or at UNGA. And it does turn out that that meeting will happen in New York City on Wednesday. The president also will be meeting with Brazilian President Lula da Silva for the first time as well. And then after the president wraps things up in New York City, he comes back here to Washington for perhaps the most consequential meeting of the week with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The president will meet with him here. They'll likely be discussing that counteroffensive that's under way against Russia. But it also comes at a time when President Biden is trying to get more aid for Ukraine passed up on Capitol Hill. That is something that many House Republicans have expressed opposition to. So right now, while the president is hoping they will be able to pass that in the supplemental funding request, it's unclear whether that will actually become a reality. So perhaps as Zelenskyy's meeting here at the White House, he also will be traveling up to Capitol Hill to meet with lawmakers. Perhaps that will serve as a motivating factor the White House is hoping in trying to get some of this aid across the finish line.",

But one issue here is that even if it were to pass the House, it's dead on arrival in the Senate, still leaving many questions about whether they will be able to fund the government by September 30th.And earlier today, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said that he will put forward a defense spending bill on the House floor after there had been some disagreements within his own caucus about the way forward. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): Unfortunately I had a handful of members last week that literally the Republicans stopped the Department of Defense appropriations from coming forward. We will do that this week. I gave them an opportunity this weekend to try to work through this, and we'll bring it to the floor, win or lose, and show the American public who's for the Department of Defense. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Thank you so much on this Sunday evening.Arlette Saenz, at the White House. Joining us now is Democratic Congressman Joaquin Castro of Texas. Congressman, let me just jump right into this. It sounds as though on the Republican side of things, and of course who knows what happens after that, that they might have some kind of a deal on a short-term spending bill to avoid a government shutdown at the end of the month. We're just hearing this now from our Arlette Saenz and our colleagues up on Capitol Hill. Your thoughts on that? It sounds as though that doesn't exactly get us to the finish line, but is that progress? REP. JOAQUIN CASTRO (D-TX): Well, I'm glad that they're talking. Their conference, the Republican conference has been in chaos the last few weeks with folks like Matt Gaetz and others threatening to make a motion to vacate to remove Speaker Kevin McCarthy and other threats as well. So I'm glad that they're finally talking among themselves and trying to come to an agreement. Now, because this news just broke, I have not seen what they're proposing. I do hope that we can avoid a government shutdown. In 2013 when Republicans shut down the government back then, it was very, very costly to millions of Americans. So I'd like to avoid that this time.",

And Republicans are upset about things that the president's son has done and are trying to hold the president accountable somehow by proxy. And so they haven't provided any evidence that President Biden has been involved in any wrongdoing. Every time you hear them talk they talk about the actions of Hunter Biden.Well, you can't -- you're not going to hold a president responsible for what his son does. And so I'm not surprised that they're pursuing impeachment. They were upset that Democrats pursued impeachment against Donald Trump. Well, Donald Trump, himself directly, first tried to extort Ukraine and then secondly incited an insurrection, an attempted coup at the United States Capitol. And so his personal actions led to him being impeached, and of course he didn't get convicted in the Senate because Republicans protected him. But those two things, what they're describing with Hunter Biden and what Donald Trump actually did himself are not comparable at all. But, you know, again, they're spending time on impeachment because it's a substitute for taking real action on the things that matter to Americans in their own lives, whether it's the economy and jobs, health care, education, immigration, whatever it may be. They have no policy solutions for those things, so they do this instead.",

So both of those things can have obviously very negative and traumatic effects on the kids.

Donald Trump Jr., before the trial started went out on Twitter and talked about RINO hunting season. These few Texas billionaires who control the Texas Republican Party spent about $3 million or more on -- not only on a contribution first to the lieutenant governor, but then on ads to support Ken Paxton. And so in that environment, it became, I think, people having to choose their career and also, for some, their personal safety rather than voting to do the right thing.

Officials at the event said the fatal accident happened at the end of the T6 Gold Race when the planes were landing.CNN affiliate, KNRV said there are two different scenes in the neighborhood west of the Reno Airport. Race officials report there were no civilian injuries. T6 aircraft can post speeds up to 230 miles per hour over a five-mile course according to the National Champion Air Races website. And in Libya a dramatic decrease in the death toll from last weekend's devastating floods. Last night we mentioned how more than 11,000 people are believed to have been killed in the city of Derna alone, but an update now from the UN. The UN now puts the death toll nationwide at just under 4,000 attributing that much higher number to the Libyan Red Crescent Society. However, that agency says it never released the higher toll. So the reason for the huge discrepancy at this point is not entirely clear. Nine thousand people are still missing and our own Jomana Karadsheh is on the ground in Derna with the latest.

They say that -- one team told us that they were able to recover more than 60 bodies since they got here. But right now, they are not able to do this anymore. This one team says they spotted the bodies of about 300 people, but the conditions are so challenging out there for them, they say that they don't have the right equipment to reach these really hard to reach areas, coves where these bodies have ended up, shallow waters where their boats can't go and they just don't have the equipment and the expertise, the manpower to deal with a situation like this. And what they're telling us is while they did spot these bodies over the past couple of days, right now, those bodies have disintegrated into remains that they just cannot reach, they cannot retrieve because of the health hazard and this is absolutely devastating for the so many families, survivors here in Derna who we were speaking to, who told us all they want is to find the bodies of their loved ones or their remains to give them a proper burial. This one international team we were speaking with earlier said that they have dealt with accidents in the past, with migrant boats capsizing. They have dealt with search and recovery operations where they've managed to pull dozens of bodies in the past, but never had they had to deal with a situation with something on this scale before where they're looking for hundreds and thousands of bodies.

You've heard some of the music, you'll hear a lot of people, you know, speaking about it. It's an amazing respite to the missiles, and the drones, and the bombs and all the horror people are going through. And in Ukraine, I've seen -- I've gone to the theater, I've gone to ballets, I've gone even to the circus, and I've seen how, you know, citizens will rush to the theater when they can, and if there is an air raid siren or something, then they all have to, you know, in an organized manner rush downstairs to the shelter, but they just want to keep being able to be human  and art is so much part of being human. And tragically, of course, some of those who stayed were drafted or they volunteered to go to the front. And you know, at least one of them was killed on the front. And that also, you know, speaks volumes to his colleagues, to his fellow dancers now who are left behind, they want to keep dancing in his memory as well.

Then, that was the first thing the ayatollahs cracked down on when they came. They abolished the Ministry for Women's Affairs. They put women under the hijab, mandatory hijab and legal rights just disappeared. But at the same time, women in Iran have got a huge education. They make up the majority of university students. They have an enormous, you know, presence in society. They can drive, they can work, they do all those kinds of things that you probably can't do in some of the other Islamic countries. But now, they have managed this year to get their right to not wear the veil and that was an important thing.
