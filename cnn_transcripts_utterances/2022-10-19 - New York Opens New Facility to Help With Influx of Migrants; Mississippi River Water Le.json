And they're putting up no information to explain what the privilege is. So, he has a log of what they consider privilege with no rationale for why it is privileged.And he said, listen, I'm not going to do your work for you. You have got to tell me why this is privileged material, why it shouldn't be passed along, and you're not doing that. So, he's bringing them up short, they're going to have to do it or they're going to be out of his court, but that case could well be taken away from this judge because it's on appeal in the 11th Circuit to just take the entire process and stop it. Judge Cannon, who initiated it, exceeded her authority in doing so, the department is arguing, and they want to end it.",

      "sentences": "Good morning, Bianna. Well, you can see the facility behind me in the background. These are large tents. It's about 85,000 square foot total, so a large facility that will be housing 500 single men.City officials say it can be quickly expanded to house up to a thousand and it's going to have all kinds of  services, wrap-around services, you can call them, medical services, food or recreation room. There are T.V.s, videogames, free Wi-Fi, phones to make international calls, there is also laundry services. 90 percent of the staff here are going to be bilingual, so able to communicate well with the folks arriving. And there is going to be an intake operation. So, first, the asylum seekers arrive here, they'll be greeted with food and water and then they'll be tested for COVID-19. If they are positive, there are trailers apart from the main structure where they can be housed in isolation for as long as they need to be. If they are negative, they then have the option to meet with a resettlement officer who will work with them on figuring out their next destination and how to get them there. Now, originally, as of last week, city officials were saying that they expected people to be housed here for no more than 96 hours, so about four days. Now, they're saying that while that is still the goal, there will now be no official limit for how long these asylum seekers can be housed here. And officials say that, look, it can take a while for people who many not have family anywhere in the country, to figure out where they're going to go and all the logistics on how to get there. But it also gives the city some wiggle room here if they need to -- if they don't have enough facilities to move people to and if they get backed up. This is the first center to deal with this huge surge of migrants, some 20,000 since the spring. And this center costs $325,000 to make. That is part of the reason why you've seen New York City Mayor Eric Adams say that he's declared a state of emergency because this city has been overwhelmed. He wants to see federal and state emergency aid, city officials saying that they still have not received that requested aid. But the mayor says this migrant -- dealing with this influx of migrants could have cost the city at least a billion dollars this fiscal year. So, this is a major center opening today. We haven't yet seen any buses arrive, but they are ready. We have seen staffers coming. They're ready to greet them and to begin this transition to their next location here in the U.S.",

Satellite images show the difference in river levels in the Missouri area from July until now. And now, near New Orleans, federal officials are working to build an underwater levee to prevent saltwater from the Gulf of Mexico from contaminating drinking water supplies. A drinking water advisory has been in place for parts of Louisian for weeks because of that threat.Joining me is Ricky Boyett, the chief of public affairs for the Army Corps of Engineers New Orleans District. Ricky, thank you so much for joining us. So, this is an issue that we should note not only impacting the United States but much of the world is going through these issues with drought and facing drought. But you are working specifically on this levee. Talk about what that entails and what you're hoping to do with this new levee.",

What we are focused on right now is getting this wall of mud built. And we use dredges and they essentially pipe down mud into a very specific place and build this wall. Once it's in place, it will hold that saltwater back. And then once we get enough rain and we start to get to flow again, the freshwater itself, the river will do the work and push the saltwater all the way back to the gulf, as well as take down the temporary wall.",

Since we only have to do it about once every ten years, this is probably the better way without having any long- term impacts or changing the dynamics of the river. So, for now, this is what we would do. In the future, if we saw something change, we had a greater frequency, we may reevaluate.",
