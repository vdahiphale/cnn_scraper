(COMMERCIAL BREAK) JULIA CHATTERLEY, CNN HOST, \"FIRST MOVE\":  -- Tokyo 6:00 p.m. here in New York. I'm Julia Chatterley. And wherever you are in the world, this is your \"First Move.\" And a warm welcome to \"First Move\" as always. And here's today's need to know. Sell-off stress. U.S. stocks have their worst day in two years following Japan's Monday market rout. All eyes on the open there amid broader U.S. recession fears. Deadly demonstrations. The prime minister of Bangladesh flees the nation as nearly 100 people die in new anti-government protests. Veepstakes. Kamala Harris VP choice down to two. The decision expected within hours. And, comeback complete. Simone Biles stumbles but still megawatt shines on the last day of her Paris Olympic Games. All that and plenty more coming up. But first, a record-breaking day for global stocks for all the wrong reasons. The fierce summer sell-off that began late last week, showing no signs of easing on Monday. Just take a look at this U.S. stocks having their worst session in two years. As I mentioned, the Dow falling more than 2.5 percent, the tech heavy NASDAQ down almost 3.5 percent. And among those big NASDAQ losers, NVIDIA, the chip stock, down more than 6 percent. Apple, Alphabet, and Amazon all tumbling more than 4 percent plus. But it also wasn't just contained to tech with all of the 30 Dow stocks falling on the day. And actually, we saw selling pressure into the market close, which bears watching as well. Now, Monday's deep sell-off began in Asia with the Nikkei finishing down 12 percent. That's actually its worst drop since the Black Monday crash of 1987. South Korea, tech heavy Taiwan down more than 8 percent. That was actually the worst stock plunge ever in Taiwan. Now, for some perspective, one month ago, the Nikkei was at a record. And now, it's in a bear market. Look at that chart. And it's tough to say at this stage, if we're done with all this selling pressure given, hey, U.S. economic concerns, tech stock pressure, geopolitics, U.S. politics, all weighing on sentiment. Richard Quest joins us now. Richard, I present you with a kitchen sink, feel free to fill it further if you want to, but I do think it's important to point out, this is fear, this is not panic, at least at this moment. RICHARD QUEST, CNN BUSINESS EDITOR-AT-LARGE:  It's -- yes, absolutely. It is worry. It is worry about what comes next. And it's not in the traditional sense, but it's about whether the Fed left it too late to cut interest rates, or at least start the process of cutting rates. Now, it's interesting, if they did leave it too late -- let's just game this out. If they did leave it too late, what's the worst that can happen? Well, the market continues to slow down, the economy continues to slow down, and we might have a technical recession of a short order. But it's not going to be a calamity, it's not going to be a disaster, things will pick up because they've got 500 basis points, Julia, that they can cut to get things moving again faster. The more tricky question on tech, I think, is the reality that has dawned on everybody that A.I. is here and here to stay and will be part of the future, but it's not going to be profitable anytime soon.",

Her son says the ex-leader has fled the nation. Security forces have clashed with thousands of demonstrators taken to the streets of Dhaka. Nearly 100 people were reportedly killed on Sunday, including more than a dozen police officers. Protesters stormed the prime minister's residence and they climbed the statue of her father, the leader of the Bangladesh independence movement that was assassinated in the 1975 coup. They used a sledgehammer to damage the head of the imposing memorial. Military says it will be forming an interim government. The country's army chief now says the military is forming that interim government. Hanako Montgomery has more on what is a very volatile situation. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) HANAKO MONTGOMERY, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Forced out of office, Bangladesh's Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, in a dramatic resignation Monday after weeks of deadly antigovernment demonstrations. Thousands of jubilant protesters stormed her official residence and scenes aired on local TV. Chairs, tables, and televisions looted from what was one of the most protected buildings in the country. GEN. WAKER-UZ-ZAMAN, BANGLADESHI CHIEF OF ARMY STAFF (through translator):  I have given orders. The army will not fire at anyone. The police will not fire at anyone. MONTGOMERY (voice-over):  The country's army chief, Waker-uz-Zaman, now calling for the same students who brought about Hasina's downfall to help them maintain peace, and announcing that an interim government will be formed by the military. It came after antigovernment protesters were attacked in the capital Dhaka on Monday, according to a CNN fixer in the city. Dhaka is a battleground. That's how one witness described the chaotic scenes on Sunday as tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets, some wielding sticks and knives, demanding has seen his resignation. Dozens of people were killed on Sunday alone in a resurgence of protests that have spread nationwide with violent clashes erupting between demonstrators, police, and ruling party supporters. Rallies that began last month over quotas for civil service jobs have escalated into widespread fury with protesters demanding Hasina and her ministers be held accountable for the rising death toll. Protests began in July, led by students angry over hiring rules that would reserve more than half of civil servant positions which are highly prioritized for select applicants. Students said it's a discriminatory system that would cut down on job opportunities in a workforce where an estimated 18 million young people are unemployed. In the clashes that followed, at least 150 people were killed, thousands injured, and about 10,000 arrested. A military enforced curfew and a mobile and internet blackout attempted to suppress protests, as well as a ruling by the country's Supreme Court to reduce the quotas. But public anger has only intensified with protests returning in recent days. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator):  It wasn't possible to stay at home anymore. Everyone is on the street. Many people who are younger than me are no longer with us. They've been killed. MONTGOMERY (voice-over):  Hasina blamed her political rivals for the unrest, saying the main opposition party and other adversaries infiltrated the student movement. The human rights groups have accused authorities of using excessive force to stifle dissent and curtail civil liberties in the past. Now, Hasina's 15 straight years in power are over. The student movement celebratory, but what next for the country now under military rule is uncertain. Hanako Montgomery, CNN. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "Well, Julia, we're being told by a Defense Department spokesperson that this was a suspectedrocket attack that was launched at Al-Asad Airbase in Iraq and that it injured several U.S. personnel there. No word yet on just how many U.S. personnel were injured or the severity of their injuries. But as far as where it actually came from, that is not yet known either. The statement that we got from the Defense Department is pretty bare bones at this point while they conduct a post attack assessment of the damage that was done to the base. But, you know, it's safe to say that this was likely, according to officials that we've spoken to, an attack by one of these Iran-backed militias that have carried out these kinds of attacks many times before against not only U.S. military personnel writ large across the region, but also against that very air base in Iraq. And so, right now, of course, tensions are very high across the region. The U.S. military has been preparing for the possibility of a new wave of this kind of rocket and drone attacks targeting U.S. military personnel in Iraq and Syria in particular because Iran and its proxies are, according to U.S. intelligence, preparing for some kind of major retaliation against Israel and its biggest backer, of course, the United States. And so, while they are waiting for all of this, it does appear like one of these groups has gone ahead and launched an attack here. And the last time that Al-Asad Airbase was attacked was just a few weeks ago, on July 25th. But prior to that, there was a lull in these attacks, following U.S. strikes on these proxy groups earlier this year. However, it seems like that these have now started back up. And as we saw earlier this year at a U.S. outpost in Jordan, these attacks can be deadly. Three U.S. service members were killed in that attack earlier this year, something that the U.S. obviously does not want to see a repeat of, which is why they have surged additional air defense capabilities to U.S. personnel, U.S. forces across the region. Some, however, some of these rockets and drones unfortunately do get through though, Julia.",

So, how much more unwinding of the borrowing that you're talking about there in the yen or the Japanese interest rates that have been so low could unwind here because that's going to have profound implications for the money that's been invested elsewhere in the world, including the United States?

But I think the size of the move over the past few weeks or so surprised everybody. And part of this might be the result of lower liquidity during the summer months. And that helps to explain the magnitude of the volatility. Now, it's hard to say exactly where the yen is going to end up with so much volatility over the short-term. But I think what we've likely seen is a lot of asset managers and investors are now going to be very cautious and unlikely to put the same type of trade on at the same size and magnitude over the coming quarters. So, I think we're probably not going to see the yen -- we're probably going to see volatility over the short-term, but I don't think we're going to see that carry trade coming back in the short-term.",

And this -- you know, considering that equity markets in the U.S. We're up 20 percent this year. So, this is an unwinding of some of that bullish momentum. And there's also a lot of pickup in seasonal volatility between July and October. So, even though this has been very painful, this type of corrections are common within bull markets. We'd also say that the economic backdrop isn't perhaps as bad as people were thinking. We recently got the U.S. services PMI and that showed that the economy or private sector was back in expansion, that was broad, and it helped to mitigate some of the risks from the manufacturing. And the last thing is that the Fed has significant firepower if it needs to. It has lots of options. It can provide forward guidance. It can provide liquidity into the market.

And they are -- what they are also doing is preparing for what those retaliatory options that Israel will have at hand should that Iranian attack actually unfold. And this is a potentially very, very slippery slope that we are heading down, which is why there has been a flurry of diplomatic activity in the region over the course of the last several days to try and de-escalate tensions, sort of try and get Iran to reconsider its vows to retaliate against Israel. So, far, those efforts don't appear to be successful. And what is instead beginning to take place is efforts by the United States in particular to try and reassemble that international coalition that helped to defend Israel from that barrage of 300 drones and missiles that Iran fired back in April. And we know that those efforts involved not only actual shootdowns by the United States, the United Kingdom, but also radar assistance from several Arab countries in the region as well. And so, efforts to reassemble that coalition are very much underway. That's where we see General Erik Kurilla, the top U.S. general in the Middle East, visiting the region, meeting with top Israeli military and defense officials today. But as you said earlier, the Israeli prime minister is vowing that there will be a quote, very heavy price to pay should Iran carry out that attack. And so, for now we are in wait and see mode as all of these preparations, as all of that diplomacy still continues behind the scenes. Julia.",

So, this is the problem we're having right now is that the rainfall, even though it has lost a lot of intensity and so has the wind, we're down to 50 miles per hour, 80 kilometers per hour. So, we've lost a lot of that. But what we haven't lost is the amount of rain, even if it's only, let's say, a centimeter an hour. The problem is it'll be for 48 hours. So, yes, you're looking at a half a meter of rain in some spots. So, you're looking at 18 inches of rain possibility here. And yes, as every storm comes on shore -- and we can see them here, every storm comes on shore could be rotating in every place that you see a purple box, if you do, there's a tornado warning. Good news is, right now, only tornado watches, which means that could happen right now. We don't think they are happening because none of these really are rotating significantly. One there near Brunswick looked like it had a little bit of a hook on it, but we'll have to see what happens there. There will be an awful lot more rainfall to come. If you've already seen a half a meter of rain, and that's what these people here in Lake City, Florida have picked up, you're going to get what's called a flash flood emergency. Flash flooding is happening and it's happening to big cities, big towns, lots of people that are in the way. We have these scales, one through five for severe weather, one through four for flash flooding potential. And for the next two days we have a four and a four, where at least a half of a meter possible in some of these areas running up hills, on top of the hills, and then all of a sudden, it rains up there and then, obviously that all has to try to go back down into the ocean, and that's not going to happen willingly when the wind is off the ocean, pushing that water, trying to keep it in the river. Where does it go? Well, it goes up. And Julia, by the time we work our way into the weekend, just for you in New York, this thing could be heading all the way up there. That's what the European model has going for it. Some models are way to the west. Some are out to the ocean. But yes, this thing could spread rain all the way into New York in Boston by the weekend.

When you think about what she's achieved, what she's accomplished, how old she is, 27 years old for a gymnast, although it's very young, in my opinion. And you think about what she went through in Tokyo with the twisties and the mental health issues and stepping away from the sport, this has been an extraordinary comeback in gymnastics for her to win three gold medals and a silver. The silver coming on the floor in Paris on Monday is just absolutely extraordinary. And this is a pretty extraordinary image as well. It was the Brazilian Rebeca Andrade that took the gold medal in that floor event, you're looking at Biles and Jordan Chiles, another American who took bronze, bowing down and saluting her. And this is a hugely significant moment because this is the first time in the sport of gymnastics at the Olympics that we've seen three black athletes together on the podium.
