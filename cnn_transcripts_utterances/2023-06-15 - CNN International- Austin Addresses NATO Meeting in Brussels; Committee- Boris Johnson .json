Just ahead, heavy combat in Ukraine, as the Ukrainian Military makes some advances a live report from Kyiv in a moment. 78 people are dead and hundreds more could be missing.The devastating tragedy of the Greek Coast where a boat carrying migrants sank, we are live at a rescue center. And a damning report finds that Former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson deliberately misled Parliament more on what the consequences will be coming up. In Ukraine fierce fighting is taking place along the southern and eastern front lines with Kyiv claiming advances near the embattled City of Bakhmut. Meanwhile, we're getting a look at some extraordinary video from the Wall Street Journal showing a Russian soldier surrendering to a Ukrainian drone. The journal interviewed the soldier in the presence of Ukrainian guards CNN doesn't know whether he was speaking under duress. We haven't seen the raw video ourselves. That video was edited and produced with music. CNN Sam Kiley joins us now live in Kyiv with more on the intense battles taking place on the ground. And that video it really is, in many ways becoming a drone war or the war where drones have been used the most.",

      "sentences": "Yes, join use there, Max, to propaganda effect, small correction it's not exclusive to the Wall Street Journal. It's been out on social media for more than a month, the Daily Mail used it back on May the 12th.But what it shows is a Russian soldier giving up, and trying to give him-self up to Ukrainian force is very risky indeed, because of course, he risked being shot by his own side in surrendering. But this is all part of an ongoing campaign that the Ukrainians have to try to win the war in cyberspace and in the minds of Russian soldiers. And on the ground of course, this has been backed up by Special Forces attacks, targeting commanders on the Russian front line very carefully singling out senior officers and the Russian officers on the Russian front, particularly ahead of what is now the early stages of the counter offensive. And if you add all that up, and then combine it with a very aggressive new campaign coming, particularly in the south of the country, and in near Zaporizhzhia between Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk, Max, but also south of Bakhmut, where the Ukrainians have enjoyed a degree of the initiative after several months of being on the back foot. They're now getting very much more on the front foot South of Bakhmut making claims about a significant gains there and incremental small games on that very heavily defended Russian front in the south, which of course, ultimately, strategically, the Ukrainians would like to break through their separate the Russian front from the Russians eastern front and drive towards the Crimean peninsula as the ultimate prize. But this is very much the early stages. And Ukrainians here admit privately, Max, senior officers here will admit that they're anticipating some pretty heavy casualties, and that they will be using a lot of that NATO equipment that they've been recently supplied with. They are very delighted that the United States and others are re upping their pledges for more equipment. Particularly for things like Bradley's Stryker fighting vehicles, and other personnel carriers from the United States but also ammunition from other NATO partners because this stuff gets used up more and more rapidly as this counter offensive, builds in and accelerates, Max.",

That's part of what the Ukraine contact group does is it stays in touch with Kyiv gets its needs on the ground in that moment.[08:05:00] And then tries to meet those needs as quickly as it can but already, Max, billions of dollars have been poured into Ukraine's fight and all we know is the counter offensive really in its early stages. So all of these Defense Ministers, yes, committed to the fight. Yes, very much aware of the importance of battling Russian aggression on those Ukrainian Front Lines. But they also have their own home base to answer to. So they need to see those games that Sam, our colleague, Sam Kiley was speaking about. They want to see that shift on the front lines. It's looked like a stalemate for months now. They're hoping that all this help will turn into Ukrainian forces being able to pierce through those Russian lines, potentially cut off that land bridge to Crimea make a major shift on the ground, basically.",

The authorities in Southern Greece are racing to find survivors after a boat reportedly carrying hundreds of migrants sank off the coast early on Wednesday. At least 78 people have been confirmed dead and just over 100 have been rescued so far, and brought to the City of Kalamata.The Greek Coast Guard provided these aerial photos of the overcrowded vessel on Tuesday, before it sank. The boats believed to have been carrying 400 to 750 people, and the Coast Guard says it most likely capsized because of a sudden shift in weight. It's one of Greece's worst maritime tragedies in years. We'll have much more on this story later in the show.

One of them was Johnson's birthday party one of them had 200 odd people invited to it where attendees were told to bring their own booze. And ultimately, the committee found the Boris Johnson did deliberately mislead Parliament because of the unsustainable interpretations, they say of the rules that he himself helped to write. For instance, he insisted that and continues to insist that some of these going away drinks were in fact essential work functions.So the committee wrote this as part of its conclusion. He said we came to the view that some of Mr. Johnson's denials and explanations were so disingenuous that they were by their very nature deliberate attempts to mislead the Committee and the House, while others demonstrated deliberation because of the frequency with which he closed his mind to the truth. Johnson released his own scathing response writing in part, the committee now says that I deliberately misled the House, and at the moment I spoke I was consciously concealing from the House my knowledge of illicit events. This is rubbish. It is a lie. In order to reach this deranged conclusion, the Committee is obliged to say a series of things that are patently absurd, or contradicted by the facts. So ultimately, Max, the committee suggested the punishment here is Johnson be suspended as a sitting MP, where he's a backbencher for 90 days, anything more than 10 could potentially trigger a by election, but all of this still needs to be voted on by the House of Commons on Monday. And of course, it may be moot because Boris Johnson has already resigned as an MP in advance of this report being released, Max.",

Now, these are billed as the largest live fire drills ever held between the U.S. and South Korea.There were five separate days of them today. President Yoon Suk Yeol went along to view them as well, some 2500 soldiers from the U.S. and South Korea. 610 pieces of artillery and equipment we're being told, I went along with the team to one of those days earlier in the month and it certainly was one of the biggest that I have seen in many years. So this is what North Korea says that they are reacting against they call them \"provocative acts\" of the enemies. And they say this is the reason that they felt the need to carry out a missile launch or in fact a rocket launch to try and put a satellite into space earlier this month. Now that failed, but they have already said that they will try again as soon as they can. And they have said that this time around. They won't warn anybody when it is coming. So certainly that's something that we are waiting for as well. But when it comes to these live fire drills, we are seeing them far bigger this year. Because the military say that they are celebrating the 70th anniversary of the U.S.-South Korean Alliance so we can expect to see more significant live fire drills, significant engagements between the U.S. and South Korea throughout this year. And inevitably that is going to irritate Pyongyang and likely come up with some kind of response, Max.",

Only this year, the United Nations reported that 441 people drowned in the Mediterranean Sea between January and March, making it the deadliest maritime crossing in the world.And the U.N. warns that the death toll is likely to be even higher than we know. And with the number of crossings on the rise such disasters are likely to increase each year since 2020. The number of migrants arriving by sea in the Mediterranean region of Europe has grown in 2022. More than 34,000 people reached Europe by sea, while between January and the May this year, more than 64,000 approached Europe's shores.
