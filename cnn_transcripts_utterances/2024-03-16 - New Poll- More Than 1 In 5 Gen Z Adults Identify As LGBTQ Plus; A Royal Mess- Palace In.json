Go to my website at smerconish.com and vote on today's poll question, is the increase of those who identify as LGBTQ plus more a result of comfort in reporting or actual growing numbers?Joining me now is Lydia Saad, Director of U.S. Social Research for Gallup, which did this new survey that I've been relying upon. Lydia, thank you so much for being here. What stands out to you, the expert, in all this data? LYDIA SAAD, DIRECTOR OF U.S. SOCIAL RESEARCH, GALLUP: Goodness. Well, you know, we've been following this since 2012. So, you know, people often say what's surprising about it. It's not surprising because we've seen this trend coming through. One thing that's not in the data that we've put out that I think is worth noting is, you know, we've tracked an increase over time by generation and increase in self- identification as LGBT. And we're looking at it by generation, which I think is very profound, because we are dealing with people who have grown up very culturally different times. And this Gen Z has had very unique experiences in terms of coming of age at a time when a majority of Americans for the first time support same sex marriage, believe it's morally acceptable, and in fact, the Supreme Court made same sex marriage legal during their lifetime. So, you know, you're talking about this is going to jokes about by certain time we're all going to be gay, when we look at that very young Gen Z group in our sample that there are 18 to 26, when you look at them age, by age, there's really no difference. It's not like the younger ones are more likely to identify than the older ones. I think we're looking at a group that has a very unique set of experiences. And as a group, they have a higher rate of expression of LGBT than older generations, because of those very profound societal changes that have happened changing the way, you know, their experiences young people versus -- and older people's experiences.",

Again, it's what are people willing to say on the phone to someone else.And just to put -- you know, I just don't think we can underestimate the changes that have happened over time, just to give your viewers just a tangible idea of that. Like I said, the Gen Z that came into adulthood in the last few years came in a very tolerant world. The millennials that came before them, they turned 18 in 1999. And that year, Gallup found only 35 percent of Americans thought gay, or lesbian marriage should be legal. And if you go up to Gen X, those people who are kind of in their 30s and 40s and 50s, excuse me, not only were we asking the question about same sex marriage then but we found majorities of Americans didn't think you should be a doctor, a teacher, a clergy member if you are gay, and majority thought it should be illegal. So, they were very different consequences for coming out in the 80s versus the 90s versus the 2000.",

And there may be some truth to that. But it's, it's not an excuse, you can use more than once. The real issue here is an information vacuum. And from a media perspective, information vacuum gets rapidly filled, especially today, with social media, and all sorts of extraordinarily unpleasant and worrying, rumors spread by social media, particularly about Catherine.And I think the answer here is, like all crises, you have to tell the truth as much of it as you can. And in the case of the King's cancer, can you imagine the President of the United States going to Walter Reed for his annual physical and coming out and somebody saying, well, you know, he's got cancer, but we're not going to tell you any more than that. So you got -- the king got points for disclosing that he has cancer. That is only half an answer. William was in rather more trouble because when his wife Catherine, about whom we're extremely concerned, went into hospital for major abdominal surgery, we would tell she'd be out of commission for months. And there would be further announcements after that time. What happened here is that the palace lost control of the narrative. And instead of putting out regular, reassuring messages, particularly appreciating people's concern, you know, that the British public very, very affectionate feelings for their kingdom, particularly for Princess Catherine, the king's people got this quite OK, they show pictures of the King read and get well cards.

This week, a new government report warns the following, \"A.I. could pose an extinction-level threat and the U.S. must intervene.\"A day later, a new novel about this very topic was published. \"2054\" is the title predicting that in the future, one nefarious use of artificial intelligence could be political assassination. \"2054\" was written by my next guest, former NATO supreme allied commander James Stavridis and Elliot Ackerman. They were co-authors of \"The New York Times\" bestseller \"2034.\" At its core, the book is about the fusion of technological and biological evolution and focuses on remote gene editing. It's one of those reads where you scratch your head and you wonder, could that really happen? Joining me now is retired four-star Navy Admiral James Stavridis. Admiral, great to have you back. You've written 10 books of nonfiction on everything from oceans to leadership. Why have you now turned your attention to fiction? ADM. JAMES STAVRIDIS (RET.), FORMER NATO ALLIED SUPREME COMMANDER: I'll give you three reasons, Michael. One is simple. It's just a bigger audience. The number of people who want to read a scholarly book about the rise of artificial intelligence is kind of a bounded community, shall we say? Whereas, I'm hoping that people will pick up \"2054.\" It's a beach read. You can get in and out of it quickly. It's character-driven. So, bigger audience. Number two is simply to undo those chains of nonfiction where everything has to be footnoted and perfectly accurate. Here you really get to splash some paint on the canvas about what the future might look like in the year 2054. And then third and finally, I mentioned it earlier, but people resonate and take messages from other people, characters. The characters in fiction, I think, can carry the story. That's the idea of \"2054.\"",

Same with artificial intelligence. So bottom line, I think we should be mindful of A.I. That's the point of the book. It's kind of cautionary fiction. Look ahead to 2054.

The world of X on artificial intelligence.We've rushed into A.I. without establishing guardrails knowing we can now question everything we see. We might miss the era when facts and truth were universal and mattered. I have so many reactions to that, not the least of which is, Biff, I love that and always think of the movie. So, back to the future. The book is a wake-up call for that reason. I mean, that's exactly what the admiral is saying with Elliot Ackerman in writing this book, that as the horse is very quickly leaving the barn, we better figure out how were going to regulate it and keep guardrails on this process or bad things could result from it. And as to your point as to separating fact from fiction, there was great data released this week saying that fewer and fewer of us can separate between the two. Remember, artificial intelligence not probably allows you to put somebody in a place they never were. But it also allows for what they call the buyer's dividend when somebody can say that that which really is true, well, that wasn't me because I wasn't there that day. A new poll by Gallup this week shows the generational population of adults who identify as LGBTQ plus has had an all-time high, which makes me want to have you go to Smerconish.com and answer this question.

A California handyman is helping hundreds of frustrated homeowners retake control of their properties from trespassers who refuse to leave.Flash Shelton wanted to help his mother sell her home after his father passed but a squatter derailed their plans. Due to California squatter laws removing a trespasser can take weeks or months and can cost tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees. Police officers are also rarely able to intervene. So, Shelton moved in with the squatter by having his mother rent her home to him as the new lease holder. After confronting the squatter and installing surveillance cameras, the trespasser was out within a matter of hours. Shelton posted the entire experience on his YouTube channel which got millions of views. Helping his mom gave Shelton the idea of launching Squatter Hunters which allows homeowners to hire he and his team. The plan is simple, live with the squatter, dirty the bathroom, take the best spot on the couch, hog the T.V., blast music, eat their Cheetos. His business only works with squatters which is different from a lease holder or a tenant. Even those who stopped paying rent a long time ago, still have rights. A squatter, on the other hand, is somebody who trespasses and stays on the property without permission. And believe it or not, they're innocent until proven guilty. Homeowners can't simply go in and drag them out without exposing themselves to potential lawsuits. Joining me now, the squatter hunter Flash Shelton. Flash, good to see it. Tell me about the caregiver for the elderly that you had to displace? FLASH SHELTON, ANTI-SQUATTER ACTIVIST: Yes. She posed as a caregiver and wasn't caregiving.
