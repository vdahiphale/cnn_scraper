The second and final day of meetings begins just a few hours from now. Leaders at the summit are highlighting the human suffering being caused by the wars in Gaza and Ukraine. That came in a joint statement issued on Monday, which also calls for cooperation on climate change. Of course, these talks are just taking place two months before Donald Trump becomes the next U.S. president, is expected to enact massive changes to U.S. policy, including towards Ukraine. Trump has been highly critical of continuing aid for Ukraine and has promised to end the war there. But at the G20, current President Joe Biden encouraged the group to keep up its support of Ukraine.

There's been a lot of rhetoric in the last 24 hours.And actually, in the last few minutes, we've had some more reaction from the Kremlin making mention of nuclear weapons. CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, so I think obviously, this was a big part of the U.S. calculus in delaying the decision on ATACMS. There was serious concern a couple of years ago in this war, even that Russia came close to using a tactical nuclear strike. So obviously, this is the lever that Russia pulls in these instances. And this morning, President Putin has signed a decree, essentially enshrining some changes, some updates into Russia's nuclear doctrine. Now, he proposed these back in September, which is, of course, the month after Ukraine launched the Kursk incursion. We're sort of still going through the details of this. It's just come out. But what it seems to be on the surface is an expansion of the list of threats, which could constitute enough of a threat to Russia, for Russia to use a nuclear strike. Now, the doctrine already allowed Russia to use a first strike if it felt its very existence was threatened, even with conventional weapons. So it's now saying that aggression from any non-nuclear state, but with the participational support of a nuclear country, would be considered a joint attack against Russia. So that seems to be a thinly veiled reference to Ukraine with, you know, partnerships from the United States, the U.K., France, other nuclear-powered countries. They say that Belarus is now also sort of under this umbrella. So an attack on Belarus would be considered the same as an attack on Russia. A massive launch of military aircraft, cruise missiles, drones and other aircraft crossing the Russian border would also be considered a threat. So on the face of it, I think it's still debatable as to how much this would lower the bar for a first strike, but certainly highly significant that they would do this now after, of course, we got the reports coming out of the U.S. that Biden had granted permission for Ukraine to use those U.S. long-range missiles on Russian soil.",

We were talking to a Ukrainian parliamentary member yesterday who was actually calling on the United States to provide more in terms of sanctions, in terms of further support, further military action.Time is running out for President Biden.

I should also point out that President Xi Jinping met with the Prime Minister of Australia, Anthony Albanese. These two nations have also had some tension in the past. There is a diplomatic stalemate. There are a lot of issues with trade, but things have moved forward and progress has been made.

Thanks, Marc.Now to Hong Kong, where 45 pro-democracy figures have been sentenced to prison terms of up to 10 years on subversion charges. This comes after Beijing imposed a sweeping national security crackdown four years ago. Among those sentenced, legal scholar Benny Tai, who received the longest prison term of 10 years and former student leader Joshua Wong, who will be jailed for four and a half years. More than 300 people gathered outside the court Tuesday morning to show their support for the defendants. The U.S., Australia and Amnesty International are among those who condemned the sentences. Beijing has hit back at international criticism, accusing some Western countries of interfering in China's internal affairs. CNN's Ivan Watson joining me now live from Hong Kong. So Ivan, this verdict has really dealt a hammer blow to any hopes of democracy now in Hong Kong.

The combined sentences that the judges handed down for the 45 defendants add up to more than two centuries worth of prison time. In fact, more than 240 hours, our team has kind of added it all up, of how much prison time all of these 45 defendants will have to serve.And the top judicial official here in the Hong Kong government has actually set on the record since then that he is going to weigh whether or not to appeal and make these sentences harsher for some of the individual cases here. The judges ruled back in May that the defendants were convicted that they were guilty of conspiracy to commit subversion. And that if their scheme had worked out, the adverse consequences quote, would be far reaching and no less serious than overthrowing the government. What was it that they did? Well, back in 2020, these individuals participated in an unofficial primary election. They were trying to find the strongest candidates to compete in what were expected to be city elections for a city legislature. And that is what they're accused of having been a plot to basically undermine the stability of Hong Kong as a whole. [04:15:02] The defendants include, you know, journalists, former opposition lawmakers who had already served in the city legislature, activists, protest leaders, union leaders, a whole range of different kinds of people. Among them, as you pointed out, Joshua Wong, who had been a youth protest leader after he was sentenced to more than four years in jail on his way out of the courtroom, he yelled out, I love Hong Kong. The arrest of this large group of opposition pro-democracy activists really signaled a sharp change in the political culture of this former British colony, which used to allow opposition lawmakers to be elected to the city legislature. It used to see independent newspapers. Those have all closed down in the last four to five years. It used to see protests in the streets. Well, look what happened when a single woman tried to hold up a banner outside the courthouse today during the proceedings. Police quickly grabbed her and put her into a police van. That is really what happens today in contemporary Hong Kong. If somebody tries to hold up a political sign, it is not tolerated anymore, a signal of the changes here. So among the critics that have come out, they don't come from within Hong Kong society really because those voices have really been silenced. Instead, they're human rights groups like Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and the U.S. Consulate here in Hong Kong, which put out this statement, strongly condemning the sentencing and calling on China and the Hong Kong authorities to, quote: Cease politically motivated prosecutions of Hong Kong citizens and to immediately release all political prisoners. The Hong Kong government, the Chinese national government, they reject this kind of criticism as meddling in Hong Kong's internal affairs. And they justify the crackdown that we've seen in the last four years in this city, saying that it has succeeded in bringing back stability to this international financial hub -- Christina.",

Her deposition is under seal, but lawyers, or at least one of the people who were sued in this lawsuit, used portions of her sealed deposition in their questions that are now public record, including saying that the underage woman said that she had sex with Gaetz on an air hockey table.Now, a lawyer for women who were interviewed in the ethics investigation say that they, at least one of his clients, testified that they saw Gaetz having sex with a minor. Of course, Gaetz is no longer in Congress. It's unclear if this ethics report will see the light of day.
