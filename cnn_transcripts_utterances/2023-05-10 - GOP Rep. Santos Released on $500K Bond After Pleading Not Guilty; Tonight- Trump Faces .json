A wild scene today as the Republican congressman caught in lie after lie is arrested and charged on 13 criminal counts. Will George Santos, aka Anthony Devolder, aka Kitara Ravache stay in Congress, go on his own or will he be pushed out? Plus, taking the stage, Donald Trump now hours away from facing questions at a CNN town hall one day after a jury found him liable for sexual abuse and defamation. And, following the money. Republicans flagging what they call shady deals as they lay out their case against President Biden's family, including son hunter. Is there evidence behind these allegations? (MUSIC)",

He collected $24,000 plus in unemployment while he was working. And, third, he lied to Congress about his finances. In some instances, he vastly overstated. In others, he vastly understated.
