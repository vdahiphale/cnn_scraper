Global cyber outages have caused delays and issues at European airports affecting travel, the media, and also the London Stock Exchange website, among many other things here on the continent.After mass outages worldwide have caused IT systems to shut down, airports in Europe have reported issues with their IT systems, with Berlin's BER airport saying that it is experiencing delays to check-in due to a, quote, technical fault. Some airlines in the United States are grounded due to the outages, and the outages are also affecting Australia, New Zealand, and China as well. Australian airlines Virgin Australia and Qantas have been impacted by massive tech disruptions. Marc Stewart has been covering all this for us and is back with us once again. Marc, tell us what's going on in your part of the world.",

And as we know, especially with the airline system, if there is a problem in the system of one part of the world, it's likely going to affect the rest of the world. United Airlines, for example, said that some of its flights that were in the air, they were able to operate, but other flights likely are going to be delayed or halted.Also, I can't help but think about the financial impact of all of this as well, not just for airlines, but for even small businesses that depend on different IT products, different computer products, just to do basic transactions. So the problems, the financial aspect of all of this is adding up and it may take days before it's seen. Plus, not clear exactly how far along we are in the troubleshooting and all of this and how close we are to any kind of resolution -- Fred.",

So people who are experiencing delays now, they might be in trouble for a considerable amount of time, right?",

It can also certainly -- it's also certainly impacting the domestic air travel system in North America. It can take at least a day and a half, even two days for things to fully recover. And that's what we see during a weather event. And now we have these IT issues. I mean, a big problem is also just getting people through the travel process.I mean, we heard from airport officials in Hong Kong that they're having to check people in manually. And as we know, there's so much dependence on these computer systems, these electronic kiosks, where you just scan a QR code on your phone to check in for your flight. Well, that's been held up. So it is just problem after problem collectively resulting in all of these delays and all of these headaches for people in airlines, but also people who are just trying to do their everyday jobs.",

Thank you.And here are some of the other top stories that we're covering today. Top Democratic officials are reportedly ramping up the pressure to get Joe Biden to step away from the 2024 presidential race. The president faces metaphorical and literal isolation after testing positive for COVID earlier this week. Donald Trump has officially accepted the nomination to be the Republican Party's pick for the Oval Office. The former president took the stage at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. His family and closest political allies spoke on his behalf. Trump finished the night with a record-breaking speech, lasting one hour and 32 minutes and beating his own record from 2016. He spoke for the first time about his experience being shot at during a political rally in Pennsylvania last weekend. And more on the convention and Trump's speech now from our own Phil Mattingly. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN CHIEF U.S. DOMESTIC CORRESPONDENT: Well, for Donald Trump, there was no question. His third convention speech, accepting his third Republican presidential nomination was a massive moment, especially after nearly losing his own life just a few days ago. And it was a story he told in detail for the first time to the sold-out crowd here in the convention hall in Milwaukee, including saying this, which brought an immediate response from the crowd. Take a listen. DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm not supposed to be here tonight. Not supposed to be here. (APPLAUSE AND CHEERS)",

Now, Trump's top campaign advisor is calling on the Secret Service Director to resign. She will likely face some pretty tough questions about the security failures from angry House Republicans during a hearing on Monday.Questions will be sure to include why law enforcement identified the gunman as, quote, suspicious, a full 19 minutes before the shooting took place, but failed to locate him. Meanwhile, the Secret Service is defending its female agents amid misogynistic criticism from some right-wing personalities. Critics are claiming the female agents in Trump's detail were incapable of protecting him on Saturday. Another big story we're following for you. Houthi rebels in Yemen are claiming responsibility for a deadly drone attack in Tel Aviv. And coming up, the latest on the investigation in a live report to the scene of the attack.

      "sentences": "Well, Fred, we are in the street right now where this explosive-laden drone that the Houthis are now claiming responsibility for appears to have exploded, sending shrapnel flying into apartment buildings and cars in this area. You can see right behind me a vehicle that was struck by some of the shrapnel from this -- there's multiple vehicles in this area that were damaged by shrapnel, but really the main damage is up above.I'm going to have my cameraman Matthias pan here. As you can see, most of the windows on this building have been shattered by the power of the explosive blast, as well as likely by shrapnel as well. And you can see damage from shrapnel on all of the residential buildings in this area. Now, one other thing that is interesting here is if you look how close we are, actually, to a pretty significant site, and that's because behind me, down this street, you can see the American flag there. That is the U.S. Embassy branch office in Tel Aviv. There's no indication that that was the target of this attack, but nonetheless, it is notable how close that building actually is. The U.S. Embassy says that there was no damage to that building. Now, in terms of injuries and fatalities, one man in his 50s was found dead in his bed due to what the Israeli Magen David Adom services described as, quote, penetrating injuries. Another eight people were taken to the hospital for injuries. Five of those have been released so far. The status of the three others is unknown at this time. But I also just have to note how incredibly rare an event like this is. This is the first time that a drone fired allegedly by the Houthis has actually successfully hit a target in Tel Aviv. They have hit the southern Israeli city of Eilat before, but this is a first for Tel Aviv. And the Israeli military says that they actually detected this drone, but due to human error, it was not intercepted. Sirens did not go off in this area. I spoke to one man whose car was severely damaged by this drone attack. He says that he was woken up in the middle of the night by the sound of the explosion, but most notably it was the sound of glass breaking, glass falling on the street below. And, again, we've seen damage on multiple areas, although a lot of the damage on this street has already been cleaned up -- Fred.",

Diamond there on the ground in Tel Aviv from where that apparent drone strike took place.And our own Nada Bashir here in the studio to talk about other developments as well. Because, of course, as all this happened, and it happens, of course, also as the war in Gaza continues, and, of course, you have that standoff between Hezbollah and Israel in the north of the country, in the south of Lebanon, where the Israelis say that they took out pretty key commanders yesterday.

We've heard from the Israeli military confirming that they carried out a number of airstrikes, according to the IDF, targeting the elite Erdogan forces belonging to Hezbollah.Two key commanders killed in that attack, according to the Israeli military. Key amongst them, Ali Jaafar Maatouk, who they say is a key field commander, field unit commander, belonging to Hezbollah. Hezbollah has acknowledged this attack and the death of Ali Jaafar Maatouk. But, of course, the Israeli military claims that these commanders were involved in terrorist activity, so targeting Israel in these continued strikes that we have seen between both sides since the outbreak of the war in Gaza. And we have really seen that ramping up. And, of course, this has had a significant civilian impact as well. We've seen, of course, much of border region, northern Israel being evacuated. Nearly 100,000 people in southern Lebanon have been forced to flee their homes as well. And we've seen this continued ramping up of that crossfire. And on Tuesday, in fact, we saw more airstrikes targeting an agricultural region of southern Lebanon, according to officials in Lebanon. Dozens of civilians were injured in those strikes. Three children said to have been killed as well. So significant concern there around those ramping tensions that we're seeing.",
