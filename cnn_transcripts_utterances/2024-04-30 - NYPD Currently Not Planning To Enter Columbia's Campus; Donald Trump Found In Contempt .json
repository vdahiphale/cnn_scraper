Julia, let me start with you because you are actually on campus. I understand that you're a student there, as well as obviously working for CNN. So, the university campus at this point in time is pretty much closed to anyone, everyone rather, unless you reside on campus and unless you are a worker providing essential services. Just walk us through what you're seeing behind you right now. JULIA VARGAS-JONES, CNN REPORTER: Yeah, we are, Zain, right outside Hamilton Hall. This is where all the action happened last night. The videos that you were showing, it's happening right now. What's happening right now is that they're trying to get food in for the folks that have been in there for almost 12 hours now. And they still blocked off access to try to protect folks from any potential interaction with police. As we saw about two weeks ago, Columbia did invite New York Police Department on campus to help get people out. It is private property. So, the argument here is that they'd be trespassing, right? So, they have a right to do that. The situation on campus is pretty calm. Otherwise, they've cut off basically access to everyone. I am a student here, so I have a student I.D. I can beep in and come in. But at this point, if I were to come out, I wouldn't be able to come back inside because I'm not a resident of campus and I'm not providing essential service. Media cannot get in, either. So, it seems like Columbia is trying to limit the amount of people that can be on campus at this time to try and see if the situation will resolve, Zain.",

So, it was a stern warning from the judge this morning, the fine, and then also warning Trump that, look, this gag order is serious, according to the judge, and if it continues to be violated, it could potentially result in jail time. The prosecution now just called Keith Davidson to the stand. He is Stormy Daniels' attorney, so he'll likely get into the details of that hush money payment. What we saw just before that were a few witnesses. They weren't really offering any new testimony. They were being used to get in some crucial pieces of evidence. Just before Davidson was Philip Thompson. He is with a deposition company that was in charge of taking Donald Trump's deposition during the E. Jean Carroll case, so he was explaining how depositions are taken, you know, the sworn testimony of people involved in court actions, and prosecutors, through him, were able to submit certain parts of testimony from Trump into the record. And then right before the deposition testimony was Dr. Robert Browning of C-SPAN. He was used so prosecutors could admit video evidence of Donald Trump at several rallies in October 2016, talking about those Access Hollywood tapes, and in particular speaking out against some of the women's accusations that had emerged, calling them total fabrications. So, right before we got to Keith Davidson, Bianna, prosecutors used those two witnesses in particular to get in those crucial pieces of evidence, and they'll likely use the deposition evidence and the video evidence to further show the baseline at this case, which they say is the scramble of the Trump campaign in those final days leading up to November election, right after the Access Hollywood tape came out, right after they were making, or Michael Cohen was making the payment to Stormy Daniels. So, those were just some procedural witnesses, and now we're getting into the meat of it with Keith Davidson. Again, Stormy Daniels' attorney, he'll be able to talk about his exact interactions with Michael Cohen and that big payoff to Stormy Daniels of $130,000, a payoff which is the basis of this case for the falsification of business records. So, this probably, you know, our last few witnesses went by pretty quickly, but this is testimony that I would guess might take the rest of today, potentially even into tomorrow, since Keith Davidson was such a key player getting that money to him from Michael Cohen, Bianna.",

So, Bernarda, we finally got the ruling from Judge Merchan.

Infidelity and trying to protect his family is the argument of the former president was making and his defense is making interms of any hush money or not wanting this to come to the surface. Obviously, the prosecution is saying this is a campaign finance violation and this was all because of the election. Let me ask you about the witnesses we've seen thus far. Last week was really consumed by David Pecker. Now, we've seen the attorney Keith Davidson speaking today. All of this and then Michael Cohen's banker speaking today. And on Friday, all of this a prelude really to the expected witness and testimony of Michael Cohen himself. We know him to be a flawed witness. He himself has admitted to perjury, served jail time over it. Do you think that the prosecution has done a good job up until now to build their case knowing that they're going to get all of these allegations about Michael Cohen brought back and regurgitated by the defense once he takes the stand?",

Especially Joshua Steinglass who's an experienced career prosecutor. Actually, I interned for his bureau back in 2002. He knows what he's doing. He knows how to try cases. He knows his audience. He knows his jury pool. So, when you have a complex witness that has huge credibility issues as a prosecutor or as a trial attorney, what you want to try to do is build up your case and lay a strong foundation before that witness takes the stand because you want to start out strong and have this strong foundation that this jury is looking at and be like, wait, his testimony is corroborated. So, while his testimony may be flawed, I can look past that because it's corroborated by the testimony of other witnesses as well as the document evidence that's being put before them. So, the prosecution has been doing an excellent job so far. It's still early on but we still have a long way to go. But as of now, they are doing a great job.",

      "sentences": "Thank you very much for having me. And yes, what you described where university leadership respond harshly to protests seemsto increase the resolve and build the protests is a pattern we have seen historically. Definitely in the 1960s, that was a period similar to this period where there was hotly debated, hotly divided issue, in that case, the Vietnam War, and when students engaged in peaceful protests that was met with harsh response by university administrators calling. You know, disciplining students, calling in the police, having protests removed, that tended to increase the sympathy for protesters, build the size of protests, and also increase the voice of more extreme activists who could then argue that our peaceful efforts haven't really worked at all, that we've seen repression, and therefore we should up the tactics. So, this is a pattern we saw in the 1960s, and there was a lot of resistance on the part of university administrators to really accepting this pattern. There were a lot of outside voices and internal voices that said, no, permissiveness is the problem, that we really need to show students that we're serious, and therefore we have to respond in these more quick -- quickly punitive measures. And -- so, those voices were very strong in the 1960s. It really took almost the full decade for university administrators to realize that, no, it was probably better to let the protests continue, to calm down, to try to respond to students by acknowledging that they had legitimate concerns, that they were acting out of moral and political concern, and to recognize that the protesters had an issue, and then things typically would tend to die down. So, for a long time we saw this was a sort of typical response in the 1980s to the protests against apartheid, and in the 90s, you know, sweatshop protests, tended to see that universities responded, not necessarily that they liked these protests, or that they often tried to avoid them or limit them, you know, restrict them if they could, but they didn't tend to bring in the police because I think that they remembered the lessons from the 1960s where police tended to increase sympathy.",

There are others that are having these open debates and conversations and negotiations with the activists.

And if you have, if it's undisputed, both sides can stipulate or get the evidence in another way, and it could be quick and easy. But when you have the prosecution and defense fighting and butting heads, then the defense attorney can say, you know, I'm not stipulating to that. Prove it. You need to check those boxes, bring in the witness. And so, even though it might seem like a perfunctory and a waste of time, you know, the prosecution does have the burden, so they do have to produce that. But I think that's what's happening as we see some acrimony between the prosecution and the defense, and the defense is not willing to stipulate to quick, easy evidence coming in.",
