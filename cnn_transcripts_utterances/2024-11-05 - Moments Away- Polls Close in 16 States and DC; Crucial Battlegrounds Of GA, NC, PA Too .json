And let's bring you some CNN projections.CNN projects that Donald Trump will win the state of Florida with its 30 electoral votes as expected; Donald Trump, CNN projects will win the state of Tennessee as expected with its 11 electoral votes. Missouri will go to Donald Trump. Missouri, as expected, will give Donald Trump 10 electoral votes. Here are two more projections for Trump. Alabama, CNN can project will go to Donald Trump with its nine electoral votes. And Oklahoma, CNN projects will go to Donald Trump with its seven electoral votes. We have some projections for Kamala Harris as well. CNN projects that the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, with its 11 electoral votes, as expected, will go to Kamala Harris. CNN can project that Maryland, as expected, with its 10 electoral votes, will go to Kamala Harris, and CNN can project that the District of Columbia, with its three electoral votes can go to Kamala Harris. Here are the states where the polls just closed where we are not prepared to make a projection. They include Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island. No projection in any of those states. Here is the electoral vote count at this hour, Donald Trump has 90 electoral votes. Kamala Harris has 27 electoral votes, 270 are needed to win. Neither of them has approached that number yet. Key Race Alert for you now in the big battlegrounds North Carolina, Kamala Harris is in the lead there with 51.8 percent of the vote, Donald Trump has 47.2 percent of the vote. Kamala Harris with an 11,000 plus vote lead. That's with only five percent of the estimated vote count. It's still a lot of votes to count in North Carolina. In battleground Georgia, Donald Trump in the lead with 54.8 percent of the vote, Kamala Harris has 44.6 percent of the vote. That's with a third of the vote in, in Georgia, that's 33 percent of the estimated vote. In the Commonwealth of Virginia, Kamala Harris in the lead with 54.2 percent of the vote. Donald Trump has 43.9 percent of the vote. Kamala Harris with a healthy 115,000 plus vote lead, that's with a quarter of the vote counted in the Commonwealth of Virginia, 25 percent. In New Hampshire, Kamala Harris has 55.7 percent of the vote. Donald Trump has 43.7 percent of the vote. Kamala Harris with a 9,517 vote lead. That's with only a 10 percent of the estimated vote counted in the State of New Hampshire. In Ohio, Kamala Harris in the lead there 54.5 percent of the vote. Donald Trump has 44.7 percent of the vote. Kamala Harris has a 144,000 plus vote lead in Ohio. That's with a quarter 25 percent of the estimated vote in, in the State of Ohio -- John King",

In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Kamala Harris in the lead with 77.6 percent of the vote. Donald Trump has 21.5 percent of the vote. Harris with a 187,924 vote lead. But it is very, very early. It's only five percent of the estimated vote has been counted in the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, with its big fat packet of 19 electoral votes.In battleground Michigan, Kamala Harris in the lead with 76.7 percent of the vote. Donald Trump with 22.1 percent of the vote, Kamala Harris with a 62,597 vote lead.

      "sentences": "Jake, I was just in your home state, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. It's been at the gym. It's a slimmed down packet of 19 electoral votes. It's not so fat. It's slim down. It's looking good. Here we go. Where are those votes coming from?Well, number one, they're mostly coming from Philadelphia. Kate Bolduan told you just a few minutes ago, we were going to get them. Here it is. We got, she said, we'll get a hundred thousand votes. We got a little over hundred thousand votes, right, 17 percent though, of Philadelphia, 87 percent in the first batch of votes in Philadelphia for the vice president. Again, bit of a broken record, but you compare her, Joe Biden won Pennsylvania. So you want to go back and look for years ago, and how is she doing vis-a-vis, Joe Biden, 87 percent in Philadelphia. He got 81 percent in Philadelphia. It's early in the count. We know these are early votes. Kate told us that. Early ballots tend to be disproportionately Democratic. So, will this number hold up for the vice president? We'll see as we play out. If she stays close to that number, comes out a little bit, she'll be in good stead in Pennsylvania, but we need to get more votes. Where are the rest of the votes, you're going to come out here now at Lancaster County. This will be interesting. If this one stays blue, you got 52 percent for the vice president if you round up. But look it's fewer than a thousand votes there, fewer than 800 votes. If you come back four years ago, Donald Trump won this county convincingly, Lancaster County, 57 percent if you round that up. So we've got a ways to go as we wait that play out. So, you see things early on again, early votes. You get some early votes. They tend to favor the Democrats, which is why, for example, as we leave Pennsylvania, and the votes that you still see Ohio on the map is blue, unlikely to hold up. We'll see everything's fair game on election night, you count the votes and you see what happens. But we're very, very early on in the count in Ohio. And for example, a few moments ago, we showed you Texas as blue. That has changed, just barely Donald Trump, just barely ahead. But that has changed, as well as more votes come in, in some of these rural counties in Texas. So let's come back to the states in play, and let's start in battleground Georgia. It was 11,000 votes, 11,000 votes, 700 and change, back four years ago, Donald Trump at 57 percent right now. Why is that? You see the red, see the red, see all that red? Those are the building blocks of the Trump coalition. Talk about the Democratic coalition. Urban areas, close in suburbs, then you fight in the exurbs and farther out the suburbs. Trump's base is all these small rural counties. I'll just pick one randomly. Wilcox County, but 57 percent reporting is getting 77 percent of the vote. You say, well, that's only 1,500 votes. That's not a big deal. It's a big deal if you're getting it here and here and here and here. You know, there are a lot of counties, right? You've got 159 counties in Georgia, 159 counties in Georgia. If the Democrats win 13, they carry the state, right? They're all in Atlanta and other urban areas. So, that's how Donald Trump runs it up in these little, tiny counties. And so, you go back, let's pick another one. Jackson County, 78 percent, slightly bigger, you see the math there, 90 percent counted. So, they're almost there, 78 percent in 2024, 78 percent in 2020. Donald Trump's base is Donald Trump's base. Let's just pick another one, just to compare it out Hall County, again, slightly bigger. You see 49,000 votes. That matters, that matters. You're getting a vote margin like that. That's 30,000 votes out of one county in a state that is very competitive, 73 percent 2024, let's just come back and look 71 percent so in that county, Donald Trump's over performing, 2020, Donald Trump, which is good news for the Trump campaign. Now, you've got to add them all up in the end and again, the key for the Democrats is here. I just want to check back on Fulton County, still at 53 percent there, 71 percent for the vice president. This one still no math. Cobb County, if that one stays red, Donald Trump's going to carry the state. But it's still very early in the count. You come down to Douglas County. A moment ago, I was talking about Rockdale County. This is one of the counties the Harris campaign is tracking and saying, okay, this is good news for us. Why do they say that? She's about 76 percent of the vote counted, she's at 66 percent, when you round that up, and Joe Biden was at 62 percent four years ago. So again, it's relatively populist, suburban area, Southwest exurban area, southwest of Atlanta, and you're looking at the Biden number, and then you look at the Harris number in those counties, and you say, we're doing a little better than Joe Biden did four years ago, and that's good for the vice president, especially if she's going to lose a little bit in other places. If she's not matching Biden in places you want to over perform Biden in some others. So Jake, you look at the map, it's getting interesting, but we still have a long way to go. I just make one quick peek at North Carolina still at nine percent, we'll keep counting.",

Donald Trump in the lead with 105 electoral votes. Kamala Harris has 27 electoral votes. There are 270 electoral votes needed to win.

In battleground Michigan, Kamala Harris has 57.6 percent of the vote. Donald Trump has 40.5 percent of the vote. Kamala Harris with a 50,000 plus vote lead. That's with 6 percent of the estimated vote in from Michigan. Still a lot of votes to be counted in Michigan. In battleground North Carolina, Harris in the lead there. 49.8 percent of the vote, but Donald Trump bringing up the rear, 48.9 percent of the vote. Harris has right now a 7,200 -- approximately 7,200 vote lead. That's with 14 percent of the estimated vote in North Carolina counted.

Donald Trump with 48.2 percent of the vote. Harris with a 30,000 plus vote lead. That's with more than a third. 39 percent of the estimated vote in from Virginia counted. In the state of New Hampshire, Kamala Harris in the lead 54.1 percent of the vote. Donald Trump with 45.3 percent of the vote. Harris with a 13,000 plus vote lead. That's with an estimated 18 percent of the estimated vote out of New Hampshire counted. In Ohio, Donald Trump in the lead, 50.3 percent of the vote. Kamala Harris with 48.9 percent of the vote. Donald Trump with a 36,000 plus vote lead. That's with an estimated 41 percent of the estimated vote in from Ohio. And now we can make a projection in a closely watched race for governor. CNN can project that Democrat Josh Stein will be elected governor of North Carolina. Stein is the current Attorney General. We are projecting that he will defeat his Republican opponent, Lieutenant Governor Mark Robinson, who had Donald Trump's endorsement. Robinson's history of controversy became a major issue in the race, including recently uncovered shall we call them inflammatory posts on a porn website from more than a decade ago. Again, CNN projects the Democrats will hold on to the governor's office in North Carolina with Attorney General Josh Stein replacing the term limited Governor Roy Cooper. John?",

In North Carolina, battleground North Carolina, Donald Trump in the lead there. 52.2 percent of the vote. Kamala Harris with 46.6 percent of the vote. Donald Trump taking the lead there in the first time this night. This with Donald Trump has a 69,000 plus vote lead.

Now, we're standing by for the second largest wave of poll closings just minutes from now at 9:00 Eastern when a total of 163 electoral votes are at stake in 15 states. Remember, 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency. All voting is about to end in Arizona, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, the battleground state of Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, battleground Wisconsin, and Wyoming. As I mentioned, Michigan and Wisconsin are the two battlegrounds on the line in the hour ahead. Pillars of the Democrats' so-called blue wall that crumbled in 2016 but was rebuilt to help seal President Biden's victory four years ago. Out west, Arizona is another major presidential battleground that we're watching. We're heading into a high-stakes hour in the Harris- Trump contest with polling places about to close in three states that could decide the race. Let's go to Abby Phillip at Harris campaign headquarters in Washington. And Abby, voting is about to end in three battlegrounds. What's the outlook in the Harris campaign?",

If they get Pennsylvania, the rest of the path becomes much more clear. So, as I've been talking to people tonight, they're really waiting to see how these results, as they are coming in, really shape the picture. But right now, it's really not that clear to them. And I just want to be transparent about it because they've got great numbers, but they're not willing to go out on a limb on any of this stuff just yet. In Pennsylvania, though, I think what I am hearing is a lot of optimism. They're seeing good numbers out of Philadelphia.

He's slightly above his national approval number in Arizona. If you look at Michigan, he's at 42 percent approval. Again, slightly above where he is nationally at 40 percent.

Because of changes in Michigan state election laws in 2022, they were able to begin counting those absentee ballots received before Election Day, prior to Election Day.So at this point, they've already counted 92,000 of about 100,000 expected absentee ballots. And they expect when those 8,000 come in over the next couple hours, it's not going to take them long to finish up that count. In fact, we heard a short time ago that here in Detroit, they expected by midnight tonight or perhaps a bit after they will have counted, not just the absentee ballots in Detroit, but early voting ballots, ballots and voting that took place today as well. So you're seeing the effects of that law, which allows for counting to begin as early as last Monday. One more note, and this is important, Erin, because in 202, this site in downtown Detroit became the scene of protests and unfounded claims of fraud. In the midst of that frantic absentee ballot counting, in part, because you have that law, you were able to start early. We're not seeing any of those protests here now. And there's going to be a truck arriving in the next couple of hours. Going to pull up at that door there with absentee ballots collected from dropped boxes around the city as well. Again, that's not fraud. That's not vote dumping. That's part of the process of counting these votes here. And they expect it to move very quickly tonight.",

Well, he says it's because there were very long lines when the polls are supposed -- were supposed to close at 8:00 p.m. Eastern time. So they had to delay closing and stay open until everyone had the opportunity to cast their votes. Officials are tabulating the results right now, but those first results from Macomb were supposed to be reported around 9:00 p.m., just five minutes from now. I'm told by the clerk it's going to be later than that due to the long lines. According to the clerk, there were over 122,000 early votes cast in person there and 182,000 mail-in ballots. As of yesterday, they're on track to have more than 200,000 mail-in ballots, he says. But given the high early voting turnout, he told me that the expectation there was that there would be lackluster turnout today. That is not the case in that key county. Overall in Michigan, let's look at the numbers here. The Michigan Secretary of State says more than 3.4 million voters cast their ballots early or by mail. That's nearly 47 percent of registered voters. And listen to this. Another 85,000 absentee ballots returned to polling centers today. Let's go over to Milwaukee. They've had some issues over there in Milwaukee today. They're going to have to re-tabulate about 30,000 ballots after problems with the counting machines were discovered. All 13 tabulating machines are being set to zero. The ballots will be put through again. It's going to take time. They had initially estimated there. The ballot count from the absentees would be done around midnight. Now it's more likely around 2:00 a.m. or 3:00 a.m. And then in Arizona, I spoke to a source there, Maricopa County, the largest county, that it's taking longer than expected to process early ballots. The first release of 1.1 million to 1.2 million ballots of those early ballots at about 10:00 p.m. Eastern tonight will only account for early votes through last Tuesday, October 29th. That is less than the initial estimate that the first drop would be comprised of ballots through at least Friday, they thought. So it's going more slowly there. One more thing I want to note, I'm told they're going to keep up 24- hour shifts in Maricopa to keep things moving. They understand how important it is to get those results out, those accurate results out as quickly as possible.",
