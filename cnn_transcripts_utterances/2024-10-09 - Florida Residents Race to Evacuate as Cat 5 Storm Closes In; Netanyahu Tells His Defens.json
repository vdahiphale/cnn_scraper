I mean, I think Floridians are used to hurricanes coming through, you know, but not ones that are cat 5's.And even though this one is expected to drop down to a cat three by landfall, that's still winds greater than we've seen in again over 100 years. Gas lines, there are things that we've just never experienced. Back, you know, when Irma came through, and Ian, there was a lot of evacuations, but this one, you know, it just has that feel.

While the earlier on Tuesday, the track was right into the bay, now the latest track is a little more to the south between Bradenton and Sarasota. I mean, it's such a fine line. The way this surge is going to work wherever landfall is, just to the south, we're talking 10, 15, 20 miles is where that worst surge will be at about a 10 to 15 foot surge. So right now, with that new track and that new little wobble, the bay itself is supposed to be right on the fringe of the highest surge. And I would not be surprised if we get another wobbler, too. So while worst-case scenario is 10 to 15 feet, there's a lot of indicators right now saying the bay itself might escape the worst of the surge and much of it might be Sarasota, Siesta Key, you know, down to the south.",

Also, Netanyahu wants to have a cabinet vote on what they should do, the nature of the response to Iran's strike last week. And we've also heard from the State Department saying that they object to IDF troops raising an Israeli flag over a southern Lebanese border village that they appear to have taken control of. They say it is inappropriate that they want the IDF to stick to the terms of what they said they were doing, which was limited incursions, and not giving the impression that they are taking and holding territory inside of Lebanon. And to the west of there, the IDF also increasing their military operations along that northern border, creating another closed military zone, very close to the coast there. Another division bought into that area, stepping up the military operations across the border. Not clear how long they'll go on, how far they may go into Lebanon.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Serene and picturesque, it's what Alma El Chaeb once was. Today, much of this Lebanese border village lies in ruins. The destruction is horrific, says Hanna Zohrob. Homes in Alma El Chaeb are destroyed, completely devastated by strikes. The face of the entire area has changed. He says war hit his village long before most were paying attention. It began on October 8th when Hezbollah launched attacks against Israel under the banner of solidarity with Gaza, sparking a year of tit-for- tat cross-border attacks. Homes in Alma El Chaeb were destroyed, almost its entire population including local official Zohrob was forced to flee. The border conflict has now expanded to all-out war. The last 10 days no one can imagine the level of brutality, Hanna says. They began using different weapons against the village. Whenever there is an airstrike now, it destroys a whole neighborhood. Five to six homes destroyed at the same time. Hanna thought like previous wars their Christian village would be spared the worst of the violence. He believes its strategic position, right on the border overlooking Israel, has turned it this time into a battlefield for both sides, and its people are paying the price. Like 90-year-old of Om Jameel (PH). She was too old to leave, killed late last month in an Israeli strike on her home. Hanna, like many of his generation, has seen every war in Lebanon since the 1970s. He says the Israeli onslaught in recent weeks is like nothing he'd seen before. He doesn't name Hezbollah, but he questions those who started this war. Was that banner of solidarity with Gaza worth all the pain, destruction, and displacement, he asks. Now we talk about help for Lebanon and have forgotten that solidarity. Hanna and his wife, Soud, show us what's left of the neighborhood where they grew up. When these homes were hit, I felt like a part of my childhood is gone, Soud says. The memories are gone. It was all erased in an instant. The pain is unbearable. It hurts so much almost. Alma El Chaeb is now a ghost town. The last of its residents have now fled. Their livelihood, these agricultural lands, olive trees, gone. The big question is, will we ever return to our homes? Will we ever go back to our village, Hanna says. Will we rebuild it again and who will rebuild it? If this had stopped 10 days ago, maybe. But now, with this level of destruction and devastation, war has spread far beyond their small village. Home now the mountains above Beirut. What will become of their village and their country has never been so uncertain. Jomana Karadsheh, CNN, Beirut. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Now, it's forecast to weaken before then, likely to a Category 3 strength. But remember, forecasters warn the powerful winds and storm surge will still be life-threatening. The city of Tampa is bracing for the worst-case scenario. Officials there say one thing that makes Milton even scarier is what it could do to all that debris -- you see it there -- left behind by Hurricane Helene, which hit the region just two weeks ago. Another major concern: power outages, which authorities fear could be widespread and very long-lasting, affecting potentially millions of people. Joining me now is Eric Silagi. He is the former chairman and CEO of Florida Power and Light. And Eric, not too long ago, this storm and its aftermath would have been resting on your shoulders. So, if you're looking at this monster storm, what is Florida facing as it tries not only to keep the power on, but restore power when this storm finally does pass?

Category 5 right now. Hopefully, the predictions hold, and it does dissipate. But it, regardless, is going to be a major impact on the state, right on the heels of a storm that hit us just a few weeks ago, Hurricane Helene, and a lot of rain in the weeks in between. So, we've had ground saturated; a lot of storm surge that hit the Western part of Florida, the West Coast of Florida two weeks ago; a tremendous amount of debris that is still piled up on the sides of the roads that, unfortunately, can become a projectile pretty quickly, in these kind of winds.

You always hope that you never got a big one, but you always planned for it. It's always a challenge when you have kind of one, two events, or one, two, three, where these storms have a tendency to come in waves. And ones that cut across the state or, in Florida's case, ones that started in the South and move North are always very challenging, because it's a very big state with a lot of population, a lot of density of people that live on the coastlines. And it's challenging to get as many crews as you need to come in, because they all have to flow from the North, South and from outside of Florida. So, there's a lot of -- a lot of challenges yet to plan for and scenario-play and prepare for, which -- which we did. And I will tell you, the industry does. Utility workers understand what's -- what's ahead. They understand what's at stake, and they have a mindset of a duty to serve. So, I'm confident that, you know, we've got the best folks with the best training ready to go. But we also shouldn't downplay the fact that the challenges of this one are going to be significant.",

And it's a challenge, perhaps, that no one in Florida has dealt with so far, at least not in recent history.I want to ask you about, are their infrastructure plans already in the works in Florida so that utilities can better adapt to these storms? We all understand that the power might be out for one or two days, but when it starts to lean into a week, two weeks, three weeks, I mean, that really compromises lives and livelihoods.",

However, Musk, who had denounced the orders as censorship, has since bowed to pressure, with his platform reversing course, blocking accounts flagged by the court and paying pending fines. Now, 14 U.S. states are suing TikTok for allegedly harming the mental health of children. They're accusing the social media app of addicting young people with its endless feed and challenge videos that can sometimes encourage risky behavior. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANDREA CAMPBELL, MASSACHUSETTS ATTORNEY GENERAL: Our goal is to hold the company accountable for its unlawful conduct and to stop the company from engaging in practices that exploit our young people for profit. This case is not about regulating the content that is shown to TikTok users. It's about TikTok's own bad conduct, its intentional design choices that trap young people's time and attention and hurt them in the process. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
