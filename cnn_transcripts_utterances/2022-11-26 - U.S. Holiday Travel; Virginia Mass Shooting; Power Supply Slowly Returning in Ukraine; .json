They released an update about an hour ago, saying at least 15 people have been killed in the last five days and 35 others wounded. Hospitals in Kherson have started moving patients to other parts of the country. A voluntary evacuation of other residents began yesterday. Officials are urging people to leave before temperatures drop even further. Also on Friday, President Zelenskyy paid a visit to the site of a Russian missile strike near Kyiv. Officials said the missile hit a residential building on Wednesday, setting it on fire and causing casualties. The lights are slowly coming back on in Ukraine after massive Russian attacks on its power system earlier this week. Right now, Ukraine has about 70 percent of the electricity it needs. But repairing the damage is an uphill battle, as power crews deal with high winds and subzero temperatures. Officials said an hour ago customers without power and heat is down to about 130,000 and they say water supply is back up and running and cell phone service is widely available again. But despite the progress, President Zelenskyy says many Ukrainians are still in the dark. Here he is.
