It was over promising. Then you've got what happened under Boris Johnson when in government, the various scandals about parties in Downing Street and so on and a lack of honesty about that. So, a reputation for integrity was lost. And then following Boris Johnson, you had Liz Truss coming in, blew up the economy.

You've got to bear in mind, reform won four seats last night. The Conservatives lost well over 200 seats to Labour and the Liberal Democrats. And if you go down the route of trying to be like reform and trying to tap into people's anger and so on, well, that will work for some people, but it will put off others. And also, more fundamentally, how do oppositions get into government? Now, we've seen three examples in recent British political history. 1997 Tony Blair, 2010 David Cameron, and now, today, 2024 Keir Starmer. All of those leaders took their parties into the center ground. They offered credibility, competence, they reassured voters who were nervous about a change of government. We don't do it very often in this country. You know, those go back -- those three examples go back to 1997. You need to reassure the public that you can be trusted in office. And that's what the Conservative Party needs to do. Go down the route of being like Nigel Farage, and yes, you'll have cheering audiences, you'll be able to have rallies, lots of people very excited. There'll be newspapers that will cheer you on. But that is not going to reassure the skeptical, pragmatic, calm British voter that is just looking for someone who will come in and do the job, not muck their lives around, not create great dramas, just, you know, quiet competence.

In reality, all the energy that he puts into fighting us, it's simply because he knows that we are the alternative movement. We are the ones who can secure an absolute majority. The far-left does not have that option. So, the danger of which he's talking is a threat to his own power.

You said the sanctions on Putin should be removed. Those that were put on him for annexing Crimea and invading parts of Ukraine. Now, he's fully invaded. Are you committed to the victory of Ukraine?

What Russia has done here is violate Ukraine's territorial sovereignty, violate Ukraine's freedom, and bring war to Ukraine. From the outset, we have condemned Russia in this matter, and we have supported Ukraine throughout these two years, indicating that we have two red lines, which were sending French troops to Ukrainian territory, because the French are, I believe, totally opposed to this.

So, together with Mrs. Meloni and with our differences too, are what we call patriots. In other words, we defend the existence and the power of nations within the European Union, because nations are the expression of the French people. When the European Union takes on certain roles without consulting anyone, it is no longer democratic. We are defenders of nations. We want a Europe of nations, a Europe that respects the decisions of the people and not a super technocratic structure such as it exists today. And that's the path that we want to follow.
