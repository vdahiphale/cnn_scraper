He posted a message on X, formerly known as Twitter, saying, there is no extradition. The U.S. accusation, besides being false does not exist in Spain. Blacklisted by the U.S. as modern-day digital pirates, North Korean operatives are linked to ransomware attacks, targeting online gaming, gambling, and banking industries. Even American hospitals, North Korea exploiting online vulnerabilities, using stolen money to mass-produce missiles, funding the Kim family`s lavish lifestyle. Palaces, planes, yachts, and this armored Mercedes limousine carried on Kim`s private train to that September summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
