They have said that they are all men, but of course, again, no word on their condition either.This is one of the biggest reasons that U.S. officials are currently pushing for an extension of the current truce. They say the longer the truce, more time for more hostages to get out. But officials that we are speaking to, really emphasizing that this is a one day at a time kind of situation. They are very much focused on getting out all of the women and children hostages first. And then the attention will turn to men and soldiers as well as remains.

So, I'm sure that more details will come out in time. But obviously the Thai Government is celebrating to some extent today. In fact, the Prime Minister has been speaking at a press conference. I'm getting -- I'm actually getting the reports second by second coming in from Bangkok.He said -- he asked one of the released hostages if they knew the whereabouts of the remaining hostages. That is a very, very sensitive situation. And they said that they had no idea. The Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin also congratulated these seventeen former hostages who have now landed on Thai soil and welcomed them home, of course. Now some of them have been reported to be moving on to other flights to their home provinces. And that's important to mention, because let's remember that many of them went to Israel in the first place in search of a better life. They are migrant workers and they've been, as you said, very much caught up in everything that has been happening over the last seven weeks or so. They could never have imagined the kind of chaos that they would have witnessed. And so there's going to be, understandably, sometime of rehabilitation and reconnection to the life that they have back home. Just going on to tell you a little bit more about that press conference that's been happening. The Prime Minister and the Thai Foreign Minister have been thanking all of those countries that have been involved in that agreement and who have helped with the releases. But also, we have to remember -- and I mentioned this just a second ago -- the situation over remaining captives is very sensitive. We know that nine Thai nationals remain hostages and it's very unclear where they are or what their situation might be. There are also six that are still in hospital. They're at the Shamir Medical Center in Israel. They are part of the original 23 that were released and this has all been happening within less than a week. So, you can imagine it is still daytime here in South East Asia. As they were landing, they would have been able to see their homeland below them. One can only imagine the feelings that they must have been going through on returning home.",

However, it is a very critical meeting, where much of the action, as it were, happens behind closed doors.
