And the Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, is headed here in the coming days. He'll be in Israel very, very soon. A key mediator from Qatar says that Qatar is hopeful. His words, hopeful and extension will be announced soon. An extension of the truce. CNN is following all these angles of a very, very fast developing situation. Alex Marquardt is standing by live in Washington. But let's start with Oren Liebermann. He's here with me in Tel Aviv right now. Oren, what new details are you learning about the potential hostage exchange set for today?OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT; The process has already begun. We learned from the idea for a short while ago that two Israelis were handed over from Hamas to the Red Cross and have now entered Israeli territory and will now follow that medical process, which is a quick medical checkup and then the hospitals for further evaluation. Their names are 50-year-old Yelena Trupanov and 73 year old Irena Tati. Now, it's important to note these are Russian Israeli citizens that were released essentially as a favor to Russian President Vladimir Putin by Hamas. They are not part of the 10 Israeli women and children that we expect to be released later on tonight. That process, as far as we know, hasn't begun yet. But we do expect it to play out here sometime over the course of the next several hours. Crucially, the process of the overall release has begun on this sixth and as of right now, final day of the truce agreement, as there are massive diplomatic efforts to continue it.",

Essentially, it comes down to whether Hamas presents another list of hostages that they will release tomorrow. Israel has said clearly that if Hamas agrees to continue releasing hostages, at least 10 per day, that they're willing to extend this pause. So certainly, the Biden administration has been pushing for this pause to be extended as much as possible in order to get more hostages out. We've seen the CIA Director Bill Burns in Doha yesterday meeting with regional counterparts. He really has been the point person on this hostage portfolio.And there is a belief, Wolf, that Hamas still holds enough women and children that they could release at least 10 for at least two more days. So, if we're in day six now, there is a belief that this pause could be extended to at least an eighth day. Here's what Secretary of State Antony Blinken had to say earlier today.

It's also believed, although we don't know the number, that Hamas does have some bodies of hostages that were either brought into Gaza or who died in Gaza.One last thing, Wolf, on that question of Red Cross access. We know that the U.S. has been pushing Qatar to then press Hamas to allow the Red Cross to visit with those hostages who are still being held.

Now, we would expect these negotiations to continue over the remaining hostages, but you can imagine that a military operation is going to take place immediately. So, we know that the resumption of military activity would greatly complicate those talks.There is a major fear on the U.S. side, Wolf, because the expectation is that Israel will move its military campaign into the southern part of the Gaza Strip. As you know, Israel has told north Gaza residents to move down to the south. The majority, close to two million Gaza residents, have moved into the south and are currently displaced. So, what we have learned is that the Biden administration has issued really a stark warning. They say that they have expressed in very clear terms to the Israeli military that they do not want to see the Israeli military carry out a similar campaign in the south as they did in the north, where we have seen such extraordinary destruction and more than 14,000 people killed, Wolf.",

As these negotiations are continuing over trying to extend this temporary truce, I want to get some perspective right now from someone who was heavily involved in the al-Qaeda hostage-taking crisis back in the early 2000s. Dan O'Shea is a former Navy SEAL commander. He was also the coordinator of the hostage working group for the U.S. Embassy in Iraq.During his tenure, he directly managed the interagency response to more than 400 international kidnapping incidents. Dan, thanks so much for all your -- work over the years. Thanks so much for joining us. As you know, and as we just mentioned, Secretary Blinken will be traveling here to Israel in the next day or two. He says the next few days, the focus will be to extend the pause in Gaza. What do you think these talks are looking like right now? How do you assess the situation? DAN O'SHEA, FORMER NAVY SEAL COMMANDER: Well, to be honest, the fact that the ceasefire has been extended another 48 hours shows that it's working and that both sides are getting hostages back for Israel and prisoners back to Palestine. And this is a blueprint for how we're going to get more hostages out. But again, they're a joining asset. And every time Hamas gives up one of these hostages, they're losing the leverage. And they are their bargaining trip for survival. So, I can guarantee you we're down about, what, 130, 140 now. But when we get under 100, it's going to get even, the stakes are going to be even higher. And as if it could get any higher with everything laid out in the previous segment in terms of how high stakes this is for the U.S. and the fact that they've committed, you know, the senior government officials from the Secretary of State to the CIA director to play a direct role in trying to get these hostages home.",

There could be a second one today, but a handful remain hostage in Gaza right now. Why do you think more American hostages, at least so far, have not been released?O'SHEA: Well, again, just as I mentioned, the high stakes involvement of every official in the U.S. government all the way up to the president. I hate to say this, but that high profile exposure by the president, Secretary of State, CIA director, what it's done is raise the value of the American hostages to Hamas. And that is why they're holding on to them, because that's -- they are their strongest leverage right now. And sadly, when you raise the level of the value of the hostage to the hostages, guess what? The price to get them out goes markedly higher. And that's what I believe is happening here.",

But as you can see, people here are thrilled to watch their fellow compatriots coming home after being held in captivity for over 50 days. And we are expecting that a second convoy, with all 10 of those Israelis, will indeed be coming through here as well.

Other nights. Of course, there are times where they come in a convoy, and they come to this airbase in order to then be lifted to hospitals. But clearly the people here are thrilled that they were able to come in the convoys to get a close-up look at these newly freed hostages. And I think you could also see the smiles.

Hamas is firmly in control of the Gaza Strip, and they have some power over some of these other militant factions that exist there as well. But nonetheless, that has been cited by Hamas as one of the factors, the difficulties of getting some of these individuals released.It's also why over the course of these last four days, they sought to have drones blocked, Israeli and American drones stopped their flights for six hours per day, not only to be able to get these hostages without revealing the locations where they were hiding them, but also so that they could carry out over those initial four days a search for the other hostages, speaking with other militant groups and trying to get them back into their captivity. Of course, there's also an element of this where it's simply Hamas trying to regroup for the next phase of this war. And that's also something that even as we see these scenes of jubilation, something to keep in mind here, which is that once this pause, ends, we will be returning to war here in Israel and in Gaza. That has been made explicitly clear by Israel's political leadership that this is not a permanent ceasefire, that they want to get as many hostages out as possible, but they will eventually return to the critical mission as the Israeli prime minister has laid it out to not only get all the hostages out, but also to destroy Hamas and to remove it from its hold on power in Gaza.",
