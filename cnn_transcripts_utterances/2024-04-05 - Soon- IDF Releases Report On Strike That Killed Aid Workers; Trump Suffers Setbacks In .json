The IDF expected to release its initial report on the Israeli airstrike that killed seven aid workers from the World Central Kitchen. Let's get straight to CNN's Nic Robertson in Jerusalem. Nic, good morning to you. What are we learning about the Israeli investigation here, and how does this play into everything else that we are seeing this morning with the Israelis saying they're going to open additional crossings for aid?",

The reports have gone back and forth about how quickly it could happen. Could it happen in days? Could it take even weeks to get the full investigation underway?But the initial impression that was created -- that it would be that initial report would be happening now, it hasn't happened so far. Potentially, in the coming hours. But what we do know is as a result of the killing of those aid workers, that phone conversation between President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu last night did appear to have some effect. The Israeli government announcing that they would open the Erez Crossing in the north of Gaza for aid shipments. This is something they've been under a huge amount of pressure for the United States to do. And also, allow the Port of Ashdod to -- which is close to the Erez Crossing -- to take direct import of humanitarian aid for Gaza. The intention appears to be, although the details on what the Israeli government has said so far, are very limited. It appears to be that potentially, that aid could arrive at Ashdod, drive for 20 miles, and be inside of Gaza. Secretary Blinken, like the White House last night, saying that today, while he's in Europe -- saying that we should be cautious and judge Israel on the results. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  We welcome the steps that have been announced by Israel opening Erez as a new crossing point having shipments go directly from the Ashdod Port, maximizing the route from Jordan. These are positive developments but the real test is results, and that's what we're looking to see in the coming days and in the coming weeks. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He called for the Erez Crossing to be open back then. He called for an increase of aid to come from Jordan back then. It didn't happen.And if you go back to January of this year, the Israeli government said, we can open Ashdod Port for food supplies coming in. And then what happened? Protesters in Israel blocked those food supplies getting wider distribution and making their way to Gaza. There is no guarantee that what the Israeli government has said will actually bear fruit on the ground in a substantial and meaningful way to alleviate the humanitarian situation in the north of Gaza. We're a long way from that position right now and I think this is why we're hearing these very cautious words from the White House and from Sec. Blinken as well.",

The language seems to be getting stronger. Independent means something potentially taken out of the hands of the IDF and taken out of the hands of the Israeli government and given to some independent body. This is not something that Israel is given to do easily or readily if a tool in the past.And it seems highly unlikely that they would allow outsiders to scrutinize the military voice and data traffic surrounding the strikes on these three separate vehicles that family members of the aid workers who were killed say was direct, intentional targeting of those vehicles even though the Israeli government has called it unfortunate -- something that happens inside of war. So, getting more details I think -- to think that it will be done independently from outside is a stretch at the moment.",

The judges presiding over both of these criminal trials rejected separate notions by Trump's lawyers to have those cases dismissed.

She is allowing his attorneys to use the Presidential Records Act as an argument of defense, something that the special counsel says is simply not relevant to the case.

The rare celestial event will offer millions of Americans the chance to see the afternoon sky temporarily darken as the moon blocks the face of the sun. NASA estimates that more than 31 million people live within the path of totality where the total solar eclipse will be visible.This will be the last total solar eclipse in the U.S. until 2044 and people are scrambling to make last-minute decisions about where to set up to see it. Joining me now is Adam Frank. He's professor of astrophysics at the University of Rochester. Adam, good morning. I'm so happy to have you here. I really enjoyed your piece in The Atlantic that gave us not only an accounting of how to watch this eclipse but why it is that we have such a special place in the history and time and space of the universe that we get to see these events. Tell us about it. ADAM FRANK, PROFESSOR OF ASTROPHYSICS, UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER, AUTHOR, \"THE LITTLE BOOK OF ALIENS\" (via Webex by Cisco):  Yes. So, an eclipse occurs in the universe anytime a moon passes in front of its planet or between its planet and the sun. So eclipses, in general, are not rare cosmically. But the Earth has this very, very weird accidental arrangement where the moon is 400 times smaller than the sun but it's 400 times closer. And so that means it's almost a near-perfect alignment on the sky of how big the sun and how big the moon are. So the moon, when it gets in front of the sun, perfectly hides its disc and then allows the outer atmosphere -- the shimmering corona to show up. And, you know, this really freaks people out quite a bit throughout history. Now, we can predict exactly when it's going to happen. But that perfect alignment is so stunning that empires would fall, basically, when there was an eclipse. So it's quite a cosmic accident.",

But right now, the weather says maybe a 50 percent chance that we're going to get a partially sunny day. So I think what people might want to do is even the night beforehand consult the weather and then perhaps drive -- plan on driving to their best bet. And if you'll even -- unless it's super cloudy and raining dark rain -- even if it's cloudy the sky is going to go dark, you know? It's going to suddenly get nighttime for a little bit. So even if you don't get to see the sun -- and I hope we all get to see that amazing total eclipse -- but it will still be a really remarkable event to have the sky go dark.",

And it all depends on how far away the moon is in its orbit because the moon actually is not a perfectly circular orbit. So that changes when we're catching the eclipse. When the shadow is passing. So there's a number of things.And you can predict exactly -- science was born, in some sense, because of eclipses because people needed to make these predictions. And it's that accuracy that you find that we can predict exactly when the eclipse is going to happen is why science is so powerful for predicting, like, climate change or what's going to happen in a surgery, or -- So this is really the cool thing about an eclipse.
