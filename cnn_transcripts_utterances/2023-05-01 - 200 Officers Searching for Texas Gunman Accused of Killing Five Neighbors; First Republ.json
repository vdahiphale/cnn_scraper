You then have a first quarter earnings call just last week by First Republic, where they announce that deposits fell by 41 percent, totaling $100 billion. That sent the stock market spiraling. You had shares of First Republic falling by last Friday to about $3 a share down from about $122 in early March.

So, there is nothing unhealthy, inherently unhealthy about that.What really happened here, and also happened with Silicon Valley Bank, is that in the last year or so, as interest rates rose very quickly with the Federal Reserve trying to fight inflation and being a little late to that game, they found themselves with a mismatch. They had taken deposits, invested them in longer term assets, like federal bonds and mortgages. And as interest rates rose, they started to lose money because the cost of, in effect, that their liabilities went up and the return on assets didn't, and they had a mismatch. In this case, it wasn't quite as bad as Silicon Valley Bank but it was unhealthy, and that's what really brought them down.",

I mean, as he just said, I think it was Friday last week, Michael Barr, who is relatively new on the job, the new Fed governor responsible for banks and provision, admitted, it was a remarkable admission, that the Fed failed to properly supervise Silicon Valley Bank. There were red flags everywhere and their response was passive.And that's obviously unfortunate but it's also a good wakeup call. Because now, with these three failures, Silicon Valley Bank, Signature, and now First Republic, they're going to have to go back to the drawing boards and rethink all of their approaches to examination and supervision and, ultimately, that will probably be a good thing. Now, there is one other factor here, which Gary didn't mention. After the 2008 financial crisis, the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill was passed, and it tightened controls over banking, tighter liquidity ratios, tighter capital ratios, limited on leverage, and then a few years later, about four years ago, five years ago, legislation was passed to loosen that back up again. And I think in retrospect, that latter legislation was a mistake and played a role in this also.",
