Once you get there, it is going to be a matter of picking up all the doorbell cameras, all the security cameras you possibly can and knitting it into a mosaic here.At the same time, I would be very surprised if they didn't have the air assets overhead looking for any kind of indication that somebody was using the golf course or shooting into the golf course. And you know, when the shots go off, there are going to be people very close to the gunshots calling 911. So there is a lot of information out there I suspect.",

We just don't know.And as Steve said before, you know, one of the keys is to find out where did the shots occur? I mean, you need to track down either through eyewitnesses, ear witnesses, looking for shell casings, all the kinds of things you would normally do. Now, if they had technology there like Shot Spotter or something like that, they could pinpoint within a very small area where the shots actually took place. I don't know if they have that kind of technology or not, but it is a challenge. It is difficult, especially when you have someone who likes to get out play golf, going to a lot of rallies, indoor, outdoor. It is incredibly challenging, but again, Secret Service are trained for that and they will be very aggressive in taking action to protect Mr. Trump and any of the other candidates.",

We will get back with you.I want to bring back my law enforcement experts now and also add to the mix formerly of the US Secret Service, Jonathan Wackrow is with us and again, Charles Ramsey back with me, as well as Steve Moore. I wonder, Jonathan, if I could go to you first and talk to me about, you know, the role of the Secret Service in this investigation at the same time, continuing to offer protection to the former president? JONATHAN WACKROW, CNN LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST (via phone): Well good afternoon, Fred. You know, I just want to expand a little bit about -- a little bit on what Kristen Holmes just reported about the enhanced Secret Service protection around the former president. I think that is really important here because what we have seen recently in the expansion of the protective agents that are around the former president is around really the outer perimeter, that early warning -- You know, in the Secret Service they refer to it as the counter surveillance, and they work oftentimes with local police especially around golf courses. We've done this for years dating back to you the Bush administration, where we've had golf course protocols that were put into place, thinking about the -- thinking about like the concentric rings of protection away from the protectee. So what we have here is we've most likely have shots that were fired in the vicinity, probably on the perimeter of the golf course, probably recognized by one of these -- either local police departments or Secret Service agents, which initiated that lockdown that we heard. The Secret Service has well-defined protocols who take the protectee and move them immediately in the open air spaces into armor. So ideally they move them into the protective limousine, the armored limousine, or into a safe location at the clubhouse. All of this stuff is practiced by the Secret Service time and time again. In here again, out of an abundance of caution. Whenever they hear that there are shots being fired within the open-air environment of the protectee, they are going to take the proactive measure of immediately moving them into a safe location. From an investigative standpoint, that protective intelligence agents that are now assigned to the former president are working with local law enforcement to identify the shooter, and they will want to conduct a field interview immediately to assess was this a targeted attack against the former president or is this a criminal act within the region that actually had no factor to the former president himself.",

So all of this information is preliminary and it may shift and change as we've seen before.But what we are looking at is starting to come into focus a little more sharply, so this is what we have right now from law enforcement sources who have been briefed on this and it appears that around two o'clock, shots were fired at the golf course, possibly coming from the tree line while former President Trump was playing golf. The Secret Service identified the direction and the shooter returned fire at that gunman who fled. Witnesses were able to provide a description of an individual and a vehicle. We are told that a vehicle that is close to that description has been stopped by Palm Beach County Police possibly in Martin County, just over the line, and that they are holding that individual for the purposes of identification to see if the witnesses can identify that person or there is evidence in that car that may connect him. In the meantime, in the area of the shootings, sources say they recovered a backpack and a semiautomatic rifle that was described as an AK-47 in the preliminary reporting, and a GoPro camera. the last piece is very interesting because it suggests if there was such a camera there, that this individual may have wanted to record himself in the first-person doing the shooting. So a lot of questions to be answered. Is the suspect, do they have the right person? Is that the right car? The weapon that they have has to be processed for evidence and ballistics. If there is video on that camera, if in fact it was recovered as we are told, what will that tell them, but that is what we are seeing right now. So what is the direction here? The direction here is the same as we saw in Pennsylvania, which is if this was a directed assault against former President Trump, the Secret Service and local law enforcement have had the handle on that in the immediate sense, but it would become an FBI investigation as an assault on a former government official who is under protection and we are going to be seeing and hearing a lot about this in the hours and days to come.",

It goes back to what we were saying about getting aerial assets out there to see what might have been left on the course by the shooter.

It changes everything.And the way in which they go about investigating this now is going to be different. And again, like Steve said, if there was an exchange of gunfire where the service agents or some law enforcement actually fired at a suspect, again, this is rapidly unfolding. Information does change. Sometimes the first information you get is not 100 percent accurate, but it is close enough to know that this isn't just some random thing where two gangbangers shooting at each other outside the golf course. This sounds like much more than that and it will be handled accordingly. So we will find out more information. They will be having a presser at some point in time, but this may delay the presser.

And you know, just to put something else in the mix here. If that gun, the rifle that was found is an AR-15 or I am sorry, an AK-47, that is kind of interesting because every other shooter we've seen recently have AR-15s, a lower caliber. I have been trained on both and the AK-47 is a ridiculously powerful weapon and there are many fewer than the AR- 15. So that is going to be a lead and an interesting aspect of this.",

That Secret Service returned fire towards that shooter and pursued an individual and shots were exchanged and that witnesses say an individual was seen fleeing apparently in a car. A description was given and put out, license plate readers were searched and a car stop was made by local law enforcement where an individual is being detained.We do not know whether that individual is the shooter or just someone who fit the description or was in a similar car. They were in the process of trying to get witnesses who saw the individual who was shooting and fleeing to make that identification, and of course, they are investigating that individual and his background. The gun that was recovered was recovered with a backpack and we are told a GoPro camera, so those things are all going to have extreme relevance. What is in the backpack? What other things may be there that could be evidence? Additional ammunition, perhaps maps or directions? What is that weapon? That will be the job of ATF, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms to determine the serial number on that weapon and trace it at least to the point of sale and then at that retailer, they can find out to whom it was sold and when. [15:30:10 ] Florida gun laws are relatively lax in that once you obtain a weapon, you are able to sell it to other people, so they will be going through that to see if it connects to the gunman as we saw in the last attempt on President Trump's life, the gun actually led them to the identification of the gunman because its point-of-sale was to his father and then to him.

But we believe that the information we are getting from our sources, which is the flash reporting coming from law enforcement on the scene, is going to be a pretty close composite to how this unfolded. That gun will have to be processed for DNA, for fingerprints. So the practice that I have always used at the scene that my colleagues always use at the scene is, if the gun fell with the serial number of facing up, you know, to take a picture of it, and then not to handle that weapon at all because you don't want to add any biological material or disturb it before the lab people get to it.

You have more information on someone detained? EVAN PEREZ, CNN SENIOR JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT (via phone): That is right, Fred. The authorities there, Secret Service on the scene were able to detain that person. Now obviously, as John was just making reference, a lot of this is very early information from law enforcement, and a lot of times, it is just the heat of the moment and they are trying to report what they have at the scene, but at this point, what they're saying is that they have detained a person. Now, they believe this is a person who was connected to the scene, and the reason why there were shots fired from the Secret Service side is they believe that this person was poised to fire shots, perhaps in the direction of the former president. They were trying to -- they were trying to prevent this from happening. And so they -- obviously, given everything that has happened in the last few weeks, they are obviously very much, much more on guard and making sure they are aware of any possible threats. And so that is what they decided to do here. We don't know if that person was struck by anything. But now begins the harder work of trying to figure out everything about this person, what if any, connection they had to any political views that could have influenced what happened -- all of those things, the motivations and how long they've been planning this -- all of this stuff is of course now a big part of this investigation and keep in mind, down in Florida where the former president lives and where he spends a lot of this time other than in New Jersey, his club there. You know, he has great deal of protection. And so that is one of the things that seems to have come into play here, is the extra layers of protection, especially when he is in his home golf course.",

So that would be the last thing they want to pull off the rifle. So they are certainly going to try to avoid that. I mean, if the gun had say, a scope or something like that, number one, it would tell you that he wasn't out plinking. It would also be a possible source where you could go to try to find a fingerprint which wouldn't compromise the rest of the whole gun. If it were my case, I wouldn't want them doing that because as Chief Ramsey pointed out, every shortcut you take now, and by shortcut, I don't mean illegal actions, but every avenue you take to allow you to obtain information without a warrant or without properly processing is evidence that is at risk when you go to trial.",

How US Secret Service, how Palm Beach Sheriff will try to make a determination about what is the information that the public needs to know, what is information that they need to keep close to the vest so as not to compromise the investigation which is ongoing?",

But when they get together and they go through the investigation, they make a point determination as to what can be released, what should be held back, either because it hadn't been verified yet, or you know, that there are other people that may be involved in this and they don't know yet.And so there is going to be some information withheld, but there will be a lot of information I think they will be able to provide us that at least lets us know that this wasn't just some random incident, this was actually a threat to the former president or not.",

And I am talking about through tonight possibly into tomorrow, while they literally cover all that ground. As Chuck pointed out and Steve, they are going to want to look at every camera. They are going to look at who has been there. They are going to want to look at cameras going backwards to see do we see that person doing some reconnaissance in the days leading up to the shooting as we saw with the suspect in the Pennsylvania case. They are going to want to look at the license plate readers and see what cars passed by there and whether or not any of them are connected to the individual they have stopped. So there is a giant set of wheels that are turning now and as Steve pointed out, it is better if they turn slowly as long as they have that crime scene locked down. They will be looking to interview those witnesses and re-interview them. This is going to be a big deal in terms of investigative resources.",

So Jonathan, I wonder if you could help underscore the importance of this coordination between the US Secret Service and Palm Beach Sheriff's in what is expected to be a briefing that we hope to be able to carry live.It was scheduled for 3:15, but now, we understand it will just happen momentarily. And there we are now looking at a live shot, if we can show that again, of them preparing the microphones and that arena for that upcoming briefing. And I wonder -- I know its early. This allegedly happened just after two o'clock based on the reporting that we are receiving. But I wonder if you are able to help us discover whether the Secret Service will feel like it is compelled to have the best timeline possible. Because remember, shortly after the Butler, Pennsylvania attempted assassination, the US Secret Service got a lot of heat for now not having a timeline. Granted that was a shortly like days, if not weeks after that incident, but today, do you believe they are probably piecing together the best kind of timeline possible to reveal publicly?",

      "sentences": "What they are going to try to do is reassure the public, and unlike what we saw with the incident in Butler, Pennsylvania, when local law enforcement had their first press briefing, the Secret Service was not there and that was a fatal flaw by them. Why? Because right now, the Secret Service, along with their local and federal counterparts, need to reassure the general public one, that the former president is safe, they took the appropriate action. They had the right structure in place to protect the former president.Two, they need to address to the extent that they can that there is no additional threats. Right now, the former president was shot at in a protected environment. They need to ensure the public that there are no additional threats to the extent that they know that now, if they can't confirm that, they need to describe what actions are they doing to ensure the public safety. As Commissioner Miller said, this is just an initial briefing. They're going to talk about what they know right this second, the actions that they are taking. There is a lot we don't know. There is a lot we don't know about the suspect potentially, the motivation behind the shooting, the intent. We definitely know the capabilities of the shooter because they launched the attack. But in the world of the investigation, we ae only in its infancy. So we are not going to have every single answer and I just want to make sure that the public sort of level set expectations of what we are going to hear. But the fact that the Secret Service is going to do a press briefing jointly with local law enforcement is extremely important in starting to be very transparent about what happened, what is going on, and what the future looks like in terms of this investigation.",

They are not on the campaign trail. They have no events on their public schedule. We received a statement from a White House official early on in this incident, just in the last hour, expressing similar that they both had been briefed and they both are relieved that he is safe. Notably, that statement did not express what Vice President Harris did in hers, she added at the end, \"Violence has no place in America.\" So certainly, it signifies as we learn more about this incident, potentially what happened, potentially what the motive is, notable that the vice president here reiterating that violence should not be in politics in America at this time -- Fred.",

They may not have all the answers to all the questions, but I think you'll get a lot of information.If this is actually a suspect in this case, you'll get a pretty good sense. Now whether or not they release a name, that's another matter because they've still got locations they have got to secure -- a home, maybe if he has got a business, they want to interview relatives because the minute that name is out there, media and every else is going to be all over it. So you want to do as much as you can before that takes place. So there is a lot of stuff that still has to happen. But my sense is that you'll get quite a bit of information to know whether or not, was this an attack directed at the former president or not? And I believe that they will be able to at least answer that. And I think Steve raised a good point with this exchange of gunfire. If the AK was actually left at the scene, he had a secondary gun. Did they recover any other weapon out of that car? I mean, there are all kinds of questions that they may or may not be able to answer, but I suspect they are answer quite a few.",
