It's another all- important jobs Friday in the U.S. U.S. reporting within the past hour that much stronger than expected 263,000 jobs were added to the economy last month for context, we were looking for rise of only 200,000 the unemployment rate meantime holding steady at 3.7 percent but a big jump higher in hourly wages up more than half a percent well that was double what was expected and this is exactly the opposite of what the inflation fighting Fed wants to see. Industries adding jobs last month included construction, leisure and hospitality and healthcare that helped offset some job losses in retail. U.S. investors meantime, not liking today's number one bit red arrows across the screen. And that's because of its inflationary impacts. We're going to have much more to discuss on that. But all the major averages as you can see set to fall more than 1 percent Europe mostly lower as well. We'll get to the jobs report in just a moment. But we begin with China easing COVID restrictions in some cities, that's after protests across the country against the lockdowns. Now, at the same time, authorities are using cell phone data to track down protesters. Ivan Watson joins us from Hong Kong with the latest. Ivan helped me understand how significant are these new measures for COVID? Are they small improvements? Or are they enough to say that they are actually relaxing zero COVID?",

Instead we're hearing signals that it's making incremental changes that it's tweaking it. In the meantime, we're still seeing signs, for example, of frustrated residents in at least three different cities on Thursday, just breaking down some of the barriers that are put up around their communities. This is the kind of thing that Chinese people have been living with, for years now as part of these onerous restrictions that have taken such a toll on people, images like this that we've seen in at least two other cities on the same day. And as a result we are hearing authority say, hey, we shouldn't be putting so much pressure on ordinary people. The lockdown shouldn't last for quite as long. It is a fascinating moment where ordinary people are saying enough is enough. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WATSON (voice over): This was the week people across China said they're mad as hell and they're not going to take it anymore. The most widespread display of dissent the country has seen in a generation. Protesters are pushing back against the crushing lockdowns and restrictions of the government's zero COVID policy. But Chinese state media never showed any of these images instead on Thursday offering scenes of very different crowds, somber people lining the streets of Shanghai honoring Former Chinese leader Jiang Zemin. He died Wednesday at the age of 96. Jiang is being given the country's highest honors. His open casket met at the airport in Beijing by current Chinese Leader Xi Jinping. Jiang was President of China from 1993 to 2003 famous for his trademark spectacles and for periodically bursting into song. His death is triggered a wave of nostalgia on the heavily censored Chinese internet, who would have thought that movies, books and even World Cup live streams have all been censored. One person wrote in a post that appears to have since been deleted by sensors. I miss the old man that just passed away.

And that anecdotal testimony follows up several accounts that we got from other demonstrators in the commercial capital, Shanghai, who say that police were stopping passers-by on streets near where protests had taken place, and in subway stations, demanding to look at phones and look at photos and phones and apps to see whether people could try to use VPN to circumvent the great Chinese firewall of Internet censorship.

But what that tells you is that going into 2023, China is continuing to lose public events, opportunities to attract crowds and to generate revenue. It is just one of the many costs that are very difficult to quantify, of what this policy is incurring on Chinese society. It's not just the emotional psychological well-being of ordinary Chinese citizens who've seen their lives up ended been confined to their apartments for maybe two months at a time, you know, rationing food, not able to have their children go to school. It's businesses, too. And we've gotten some numbers from the Chinese Ministry of Finance, that say that the health costs for local governments have soared in the first 9, 10 months of this year, with health care spending jumping 13 percent, in the first 10 months of 2022, and that they're falling behind on payments that the 15 biggest Chinese virus testing providers, they're reporting that they haven't been paid the equivalent of more than $6 billion for work that they're doing.

And by the strength of the U.S. consumer, despite this rapid increase in interest rates, that should be reducing employment, in construction, in manufacturing, and in a range of industries that are typically very, very sensitive to rising interest rates. This time seems to be somewhat different one because U.S. homeowners have locked in those sub 4 percent mortgages, and so they're not seeing their mortgages go up. And that's why they're spending is not being affected by the increase in interest rates too badly. And then business balance sheets are also by and large, very strong. Companies use that period of low interest rates to get a hold of credit and cash. And many of them are now sitting on a lot of cash. They are somewhat insulated from what's happening in the stock market. And that's why we're continuing to see, you know, a surprising degree of resilience.",

But we haven't really seen evidence of that actually starting to happen, right that wage price spiral. And yet wages increased, surprisingly, over this last month.

Wage growth, your annual earnings increases of 5.1 percent is totally incompatible with inflation of an inflation target of 2 percent. So yes, wage growth is much too high to bring inflation down to where the Fed wants it to be. And inflation will probably take quite a lot longer to come down than the Fed would like. They may slow down. So does that mean that's an interesting point that I just want to follow up on really quickly.

Cameroon is looking to reach the knockout stage for the first time since that famous run at Italia 90, but they haven't won their final group game in any of the last seven World Cups. And remarkably, Brazil hasn't faced single shots against them on target so far in their two games. We do know though that Cameroun can score goals they fought back from 2 down you might remember in the last game against Serbia, they drew 2-2 but the issue with that is they know they have to win if they want any chance. They have to try and score goals and with the attacking threat that Brazil posed that is when things could get a little bit messy for them. There was early kickoff though it kicking off in what just over 40 minutes' time and there's a huge grudge match, bringing back a whole lot of emotion and memories of 2010 between Uruguayan Garner. Luis Suarez famously stopped a Ghana goal with his arm on the goal line. It was a goal that would have put Ghana through to the semi-finals for the first time in their history. The resulting penalty wasn't converted. So Suarez got told in the press conference yesterday, he is seen as the devil himself. That was what one of the - and journalists put to him. But you got to say Luis Suarez seemed to be relishing that thought, but a Ghana win would put Uruguay out at the group stage for the first time in 20 years, and it's Ghana the team who very much been informed over the last couple of weeks. One other update I have to bring you from Team USA ahead of their round of 16 match against the Netherlands. Coach Gregg Burkhalter says things are looking pretty good for their Captain America, Christian Pulisic, his pelvic contusion - he's been in a race against time to be fit after being taken to hospital midway through their match on Tuesday.

I mean, there's usually depending on how you measure it up to six month lag and when a rate hike start affecting your monetary policy starts affecting the labor market, there is a lag. And so if you look back to March and you look toward today, it might be that those big, big rate hikes just haven't filtered through to the economy yet. But here's what we know, resilience, right Rahel? Resilience is the Word of the Week. The unemployment rate 3.7 percent still stuck in that 3.5 to 3.7 percent band. And that is just remarkable that 3.7 percent number that you're still that low near 50 year low for the unemployment rate. And then you start talking about the jobs added, the lowest number of jobs added in a year and a half. But any other time in American history 253,000 jobs added would be quite, quite strong, especially considering that we've had six rate hikes in a row here. So if you throw that up in November, the jobs added month by month, this year, you can see a deceleration, but from a very, very strong level. And then I guess finally, looking at that inflation numbers still a worry, you still have this gap between wages and inflation. That's pretty high and you want to see a job market that cools a little bit. You know, you and I both talked about this a Goldilocks having it cool a little bit so that it doesn't really hurt a lot of people and hurt the spending of so many Americans.
