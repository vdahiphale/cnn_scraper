What has happened is that Israeli forces have withdrawn and then Hamas militants have returned. So, that's what has been going up -- going on in the north.And indeed, we know that residents of Jabalia and other places have been told to move to what Israel says are humanitarian zones. In Rafah, in the south, Israel very pointedly noting that this is, in its word, precise and limited operations. In other words, not the full- blown ground operation that President Biden has been warning against. Yet we seeing with airstrikes on Rafah already over the weekend, 15 people killed according to local hospitals sources. Among them, four children. And of course, as you also noted in your introduction, Israel has been calling for the evacuation of more than a dozen neighborhoods in Rafah, advising people to move either to Khan Younis, north of Rafah, or to al-Mawasi, which is due west of Khan Younis, which is effectively a barren stretch of beach lacking in all basic infrastructure. So, not particularly good options for those Palestinians being told to move. What you're also seeing is those living in other neighborhoods of Rafah that haven't been told to evacuate yet. They are also taken the view of, look, we may not have been told to evacuate just yet, but better to do it now because it's only a matter of time. In that way we'll at least be able to get to a relatively safer place before it fills up. And of course, as all of that is happening, as you noted, Egypt is in control of the border area between Rafah and Egypt. Egypt -- Egyptian officials telling us that it is no longer coordinating with Israel to get humanitarian aid trucks into the Gaza Strip there because it cannot guarantee their safety. And if that will remain the case -- so long as Israeli tanks remain on the ground. And as a result of that, we understand from border crossing authorities in the Hamas-run enclave that not a single aid truck has gone in through Rafah, the main conduit for aid, for the past six days. So, Israel has been getting some aid in through Kerem Shalom to the south, its border with the Gaza Strip, some 200,000 liters of fuel and also flour as well. But there wasn't enough aid getting in before this current situation. [06:05:01] And now that aid isn't getting through the Rafah crossing either, the situation is becoming even more dire.

You're seeing the next part of the operation now.But even if it is unfolding slowly, what's happening here, essentially, is exactly what the Biden administration had feared, which is that once you start dropping large-scale ordinance, and you see from those pictures that's what's happening, you're going to jump up the casualty count in an area that the Israelis had told the Palestinians to go to in the south. And now we're telling them to leave. We think about 300,000 people have left the area in the past two days. But there was an estimate -- pretty reliable estimates from the U.N. that the whole Rafah general area had more than a million people in it now.

And to my understanding that plan has still not really been put together.There are some tents there. There have been some things set up. But as you just heard in the earlier report from Elliott, you're also seeing a cutoff of fuel and other aid coming in through the gates that are closest to Rafah. So, it's not clear once they get to that expanded area, that there's going to be very much food or fuel around to go take care of them. And this has really been at the core of the argument between President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu, which is to say that President Biden has been unconvinced that there is a serious plan for how you take care of the Palestinians, much less a serious plan for how you would govern Gaza, even if they were successful at their goal which, of course, is to wipe out Hamas, and the U.S. supports that goal just not in this way.",

And then there's what their boss Donald Trump wants to see.You mentioned Stormy Daniels. What was the essence of the cross- examination on the second day of Stormy Daniels? You got this -- everything out the first day that you want to argue when you're closing, that she hates the president, couldn't be -- she couldn't be trusted, and she knows nothing about the records. But Trump says, get in there, humiliate her. And I think that -- and answer to your question is, what we're going to see as it relates to Michael Cohen. Trump wants him to be really annihilated. And so, we're going to hear about your perjurer. Is that right, sir? Nothing that comes out of your mouth we can trust. And, in fact, you've made a living off of, right, savaging the president. You were wearing a shirt that had him in jail, right? That was on your podcast, right? We're going to hear all about that. You wanted to go to the White House. He wouldn't take it in White House. So, all of those things are going to happen. The issue with me, Danny, is whether that matters. Why do I say that? Because so many of the other witnesses already said what Michael Cohen is going to say. As I noted, the other witnesses in tandem have Trump involved in this whole entire deal to really conceal and cover up, et cetera. They just -- again, put him in the room. They just don't put him at the table. And that's what Michael Cohen is going to do by saying, we have these face-to-face meetings. There was this Oval Office meeting where we talked about the whole reimbursement, that's where we said how we would do the deal so that no one would know. But guess what? Everyone found out. And the issue now is going to be, what, if any, involvement Trump had? I think other witnesses would otherwise suggest he had a lot of involvement, but Michael Cohen will tell everybody about the specific nature of that involvement and that's the open question.",

JACKSONI think there's been contingency plans underway with respect to whether that happens. Hopefully, the president will continue to message other things. It's the Biden prosecution, Biden not involved. You know, the D.A. of Manhattan is doing this off of political reasons, attacking the judge is corrupt. If he sticks to that, which is permissible, it will be OK. If he starts attacking witnesses, then it becomes problematic. And of course, we know there is no love loss as it relates to Michael Cohen.

So, I think that the airport is capable of handling those extra flights. I'm not sure really what the push back is here because they have enough capacity to handle it. They're just -- I think it's more of a political reason for the fact that these Congress -- that Congress does not want to be responsible for adding stress to a system that's already there. So, it's kind of strange to me that that's even in this bill, but Idon't see any problem with having it in there. I'm not sure what the push is yet.

But yes, we do still have some options if you were planning to maybe go out one last night.If you live in that extreme northern tier of the U.S. and Canada, it's still going to be pretty good viewing for tonight. We've just not really going to see much in the southern tier like we have the last few days. One thing that could curb that, however, is going to be some cloud cover. You can see we've got a little bit of it in the Midwest. Same thing into the northeast. But really, the bulk of the clouds, take a look at this, it's all in the Southeast. And that's coming from the next round of what we expect to be severe storms later on today. Right now, you've got a couple of showers and thunderstorms right now across Oklahoma, Texas, and Louisiana, but that is really going to ramp up once we get into the afternoon and especially into the evening hours tonight. The focus for today again, really kind of that Southeastern portion of Texas as well as areas of Louisiana, though it does stretch back north into Oklahoma. Tomorrow, shifting ever so slightly to the east where we'll start to see it spread out a little bit more towards Shreveport, New Orleans, and even into Jackson, Mississippi. So, here's that first round this afternoon and evening. Again, you can see it's really starting to focus there across Eastern Texas and spreading east. Then the second round really begins to form right there by late Monday afternoon and continuing to slide along the Gulf Coast region and spreading eastward into Tuesday. The other threat is going to be flooding. Remember the terrible flooding we had just north of Houston last week, all of that area is expected to get additional rainfall yet again today. That's why we've got flood watches in effect and continuing to watch a lot of the river gauges that are there, many of which are still at flood stage.",

They are the full ensemble. For a second straight game, P.J. Washington leads Dallas hitting five three- pointers, scoring 27. And here comes that high-flying Dereck Lively soaring in scoring. He had 12 points off the bench. Yes, sir. The game is intense though. Dallas up three with a minute 30 to go. Look at the huge collision. Their star, Luka Doncic already with a bad knee and sore ankle. Now, he has a stiff back, falling hard to the floor after hitting Lu Dort going for that loose ball. Luka finish with 22. But Kyrie Irving for Dallas had 22 as well. And in the final minute, he put the game away. That floater there sealed the deal. Mavs got out the 105-101 win.
