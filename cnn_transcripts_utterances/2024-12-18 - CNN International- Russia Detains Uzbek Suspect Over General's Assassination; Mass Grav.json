I'm Erica Hill in New York. Thanks for joining me today on \"Connect the World\". I'm in for Becky Anderson. Also, ahead Russia, detain the suspect in the assassination of a top general in Moscow. Investigators in the West trying to piece together a motive after a 15-year-old girl opened fire at her school. And Amazon Founder Jeff Bezos the latest to visit Donald Trump, that's set to happen today. The latest tech billionaire that is to make the trip. The stock market here in New York set to open in just about 30 minutes. Investors, of course, waiting on that big decision from the Federal Reserve. You see the futures there trending up for the most part, the NASDAQ down slightly. We'll continue to keep an eye on that for you throughout the morning. Russia now has a suspect in custody. Just one day after the assassination of one of its top generals, a 29-year-old man from Uzbekistan has been detained by authorities. Russian state media identifying the man as Ahmed Karbanov and aired a video in which he appears to confess. Important to note, though it is unclear whether that confession was made under duress. Russian investigators say Karbanov was recruited by Ukraine Security Service to help kill Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov, who headed Russia's radiological, biological and chemical protection forces. And also alleged that the suspect had planted the surveillance camera and a bomb, but claim it was in fact, Ukrainians who triggered that device, detonating it remotely from Ukraine, the Kremlin again today calling Kirillov's killing a terrorist act, saying this is just further justification for Russia's war against Ukraine. Ukraine has not commented on this suspect. CNN's Fred Pleitgen is following the story for us at the scene of the bombing in Moscow. And he's going to walk us through now the day of the attack. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): One of Russia's top generals and an aide just seconds before the fatal blast. We're not showing the moment of the explosion in this video obtained by CNN.",

As the general and an aide walked out, it blew up, killing them both. PLEITGEN (voice-over): Russian Investigators say the device was detonated remotely. The blast so powerful it shattered windows several floors up in buildings across the street. At first, we thought that cement might have been unloaded or something similar, this resident says. But the blast was so loud it did not seem like construction work. It was very scary. Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov was the head of Russia's nuclear, chemical and biological defense forces often accusing Kyiv of planning to use chemicals on the battlefield. The Ukrainians, for their part, accused Kirillov of overseeing the use of chemical substances against their forces, and have claimed responsibility for assassinating him, calling the general quote, an absolutely legitimate target. And saying such an inglorious end awaits all those who kill Ukrainians. The general is not the first, but the highest ranking Russian military official, the Ukrainians claim to have assassinated. Moscow furious, launching both a terrorism and a criminal investigation. Investigative actions and operational search activities are being carried out aimed at establishing all the circumstances of the crime committed, the spokesperson said. Asymmetric warfare like this brazen drone attack inside Russia two days ago is how the Ukrainian forces are trying to level the battlefield as Vladimir Putin's army has been making significant gains on nearly all front lines. The lieutenant general's assassination comes just hours after Putin met with his top military bras, ripping into the Biden Administration for its support of Ukraine. In an effort to weaken our country and impose a strategic defeat on us. The United States continues to pump the virtually illegitimate ruling regime in Kyiv full of weapons and money, sends mercenaries and military advisers and thereby encourages further escalation of the conflict, Putin said. And Russian politicians have vowed revenge for the generals killing while acknowledging his death is a major loss. Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Moscow. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "So, I think the narrative that this was carried out on orders, according to Russia's Investigative Committee by theUkrainian Security Services. We do have a source familiar with the operation who told CNN on Tuesday, that that was, in fact, the case, that this was an operation carried out by the Ukrainian Security Services. And we have seen an increase in recent months. This was the fourth such assassination on Russian or Russian occupied soil carried out either claimed directly or indirectly by the Ukrainian Security Services or Defense Intelligence in the last two months. So that does ring true, in terms of the nationality of this being an Uzbek national, according to the Russia Investigative Committee and the FSB. Or look, Russia does rely heavily on the presence of migrant workers, particularly from Central Asia. Especially now, when the war has caused even greater labor shortages than there were before. And human rights groups have accused Russia in the past of racially profiling of scapegoating central Asians. There was a backlash that we saw after Tajik citizens were charged with the Crocus City Hall terror attack, that huge terror attack in Moscow in March. Though, of course, that was linked, -certainly by the U.S. and others, to ISIS-K, which is active in that region as well. So, there are threads to pull there. I think what does ring true in particular here, Erica, is how these fits into the sort of crisis management playbook that we've seen in Russia. They are clearly trying to appear like they are getting out in front of this. It was a security breach. It was a security failing. So, this arrest happening some 24 hours later, just like we saw with those Crocus City Hall attacks in March. Fits in with that, we also see deflecting from the Kremlin saying that this is terrorism from what they call the Kyiv regime, that it further justifies what they're calling the special military operation, the full-scale war in Ukraine. And of course, they are distancing Putin from this. He personally has not said anything about this yet that we watch and wait to see if he mentions that he's holding his major annual sort of public call in session tomorrow.",

The clock is ticking down, with just over a month outfrom Donald Trump taking office again in the U.S., which could ring in a really significant policy change. We just heard the President-Elect this week, saying, for example, that he thinks it was a mistake to give Ukraine permission to fire Western long-range missiles at Russia. So, I think what we see from Ukraine at this point, and in a similar vein to what we saw with their incursion into the Kursk region, which is still ongoing, is them trying to seize the -- if not initiative, then at least show some leverage in any means possible. That's why we've seen, I think, an increase in these assassinations far from the battlefield concerning military figures or figures connected to the Russian military. These are things that Ukraine can do to show their hand, to show that they still have cards to play as we approach what may be a push from the west and from the new U.S. administration towards negotiations.",

Again, demonstrating that the core interest right now for Jolani, the core priority is going to be -- That said, there is also a concern. Damascus has always built itself as the beating heart of Arab nationalism. It's the heir to the Umayyad dynasty, the much famed Islamic and Arab dynasty based in Damascus. And right now, you look at the Syrian tapestry, it's being dominated by Turkey, but also Israel, that has pushed further into Southern Syria, only 20 kilometers or so now from the Syrian capital. Those are very concerning facts for the Arab countries surrounding Syria.

They can begin to distance themselves from some of the more troublesome actors on the ground, and also to govern using a coalition of forces. We've got the Kurds in Syria. We've got more secular forces on Syria. So, powers around this region and also in the West are looking for those kinds of clues to try and assess whether Jolani is somebody that we can work with or not. There's also obviously the issue of chemical weapons. Jolani said that he's willing to give those up. There are concerns in these amongst the Israelis about having a jihadi force on their border. He's time and again saying that he's no interest picking a fight with Israel or any of Syria's neighbor, sending all the right messages.

A new milestone in space to Chinese astronauts, breaking the record for the longest spacewalk, according to China man space agency, the China man space agency, rather. It lasted nine hours on Tuesday, which beats the previous record by four minutes that had been set by a pair of U.S. astronauts in 2001. Two astronauts stranded on the International Space Station since June. They're going to be there a little bit longer. Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore's mission, which was, of course, meant to last a week, was unexpectedly extended, extended again. Now it's been extended again due to technical fault with their Boeing Star Line, or spacecraft. CNN's Kristin Fisher has the details on this latest delay. KRISTIN FISHER, CNN SPACE &amp; DEFENSE ANALYST: You remember, Butch and Suni, they were supposed to come back on that Boeing Starliner capsule on its maiden test flight back in June. It didn't happen because NASA deemed it to be unsafe. So, they've been waiting up at the International Space Station as part of a crew rotation, right? So, you have to wait until the next crew and the next spacecraft is ready to come up there and relieve you. So, Crew-9 came up now they're waiting for Crew-10. That was supposed to be in February. Now we just learned it's going to be delayed one month until mid to late March of 2025. And the reason why, according to NASA and SpaceX, I'm quoting here, they say they need extra time to complete processing on a new Dragon spacecraft for the mission. So, this is, you know, SpaceX has a lot of Dragon spacecrafts. They've been used quite frequently. It's the primary means by which NASA astronauts get to and from the International Space Station. So, they've been planning on getting this new one up and running. It's just not quite ready to get. So, for Butch and Suni, it means they've got to wait at least one more month.",

Now,the market is pricing in a 95 percent chance of a quarter point cut from the Fed today. That's basically a slam dunk. The Fed almost has to cut rates today, because if they didn't, they'd really be freaking out markets, and they don't like to do that. So, this would be the third cut in a row, and it would mean that interest rates are about a full percentage point below where they were back in September. If you're a borrower, this is good news, if you're someone who is trying to pay off credit card debt or get a car loan or get a mortgage. It's nice to see that rates are finally coming down, but the bad news is that the Fed is also likely to signal today that they're going to tap the brakes on these rate cuts next year. They're going to be issuing new guidance and projections today. And in the past, in September, Fed officials were penciling in four interest rate cuts in 2025. Now the thinking is they might be signaling three cuts, or even two or fewer. And when you think about it, it really is an awkward time for the Fed to be cutting interest rates. There's no need to come to the rescue of the economy, it's still growing at a very solid pace. The unemployment rate has come up, but it's still pretty low, and the war on inflation has stalled out in recent months. We know that food prices and housing costs remain stubbornly high, and then there are these risks that the Trump agenda could potentially reignite inflation, specifically mass deportations. If you're deporting millions of undocumented workers, it's not clear they'll be able to do that, but if they did, that could cause shortages of workers in agriculture and in construction. And then there's this brewing trade war between the United States and China, Canada and Mexico that could also raise prices as well. So yes, it does look like an interest rate cut from the Fed is imminent today, but this could be the last cut for a while.",

At the time, there was a lot of concerns about what was in this ethics committee investigation looked at the allegations of illicit drug use, sexual misconduct and receiving impermissible gifts and the like. Gaetz has long denied all those allegations, but all these matters had concerned Republican Senators, and it was uncertain. In fact, it looked very unlikely that he would get the votes to be confirmed as Attorney General. At that point, while he was being under consideration, the House Ethics Committee actually voted to not release the ethics report. Republicans said that they would -- they didn't like going ahead with a report against someone who had resigned from Congress. Remember Gaetz abruptly resigned from Congress after Trump picked him for that seat, but since then, Gaetz has withdrawn from that consideration of Attorney General and Republicans were grabbed, were so meeting with Democrats behind the scenes on what to do with this report.
