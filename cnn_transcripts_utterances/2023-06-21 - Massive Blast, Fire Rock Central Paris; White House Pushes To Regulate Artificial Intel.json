You can see behind me the huge operation that's taking place here in central Paris, an enormous part of the Left Bank, the Latin corner, has been cordoned off and 270 firefighters involved. And earlier on those images were really quite dramatic.What we understand happened was inside that Paris American academy that you speak of, a fashion design school here in central Paris, an explosion, a gas explosion -- that is the assumption as a theory that Paris officials are working off of. There are inquiries actually been trying to figure out exactly how this came about. An explosion that was so large, Boris, and that what we've been hearing from eyewitnesses who live nearby by, is that the apartments all around actually shook, furniture moved. Apparently, one described it as sounding like an earthquake. So extremely shocking scenes when it took place just before 5:00 p.m. local time here in Paris. The entire front of the building, as we understand it, completely collapsed. And then fires were set off in several surrounding buildings. As you say, in the end 29 people injured, of those four still in critical condition. The French interior ministry is on the scene there just behind me. As for those American students from Kent State University, that statement you just seen, that are about 20 of their students here in Paris at the time, although they say all the students and their faculty are safe and accounted for. Still this hour, several hours after that explosion, Boris, the search continues for two people that are apparently still reported missing. And of course, an inquiry that will tell us more about this, how this gas explosion could have come to be. But for a few hours we saw in Paris here those huge fires raging, that fire billowing out over the Left Bank of Paris, really pretty impressive. And for all of those who have been in the vicinity and heard the initial bang and seen the chaos afterwards, extremely shocking scenes -- Boris.",

The maker of Ozempic and Wegovy is suing some pharmacies, clinics and spas for allegedly selling knockoffs of its drugs that claim to contain semaglutide which is the active ingredient in the weight loss medications. Pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk says the unlawful marketing and sales practices have created confusion, deception, also potential safety concerns for customers.Also a new report from the World Economic Forum shows a bleak outlook for women. New data estimates the world will not see gender equality for another 131 years. If you are marking your calendar, that would be the year 2154. The report shows the gender gap closed by a mere .3 percent this year compared to last year. It says in part that progress was disrupted by the COVID pandemic's impact on women and girls both in education and the workforce. And the Supreme Court is already looking at cases for next term, the justices set to meet behind closed doors tomorrow to consider whether to take up a blockbuster Second Amendment case. The challenge comes from the conservative leaning Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal which is claims a new federal law barring domestic abusers from buying a gun is unconstitutional -- Brianna.",

A recent poll found 42 percent of CEOs surveyed fear artificial intelligence could destroy humanity in five to ten years and dozens of industry leaders, academics, even some celebrities issued this statement last month warning that AI could lead to human extinction. Yes, you heard that right.In the meantime, President Biden met with a group of experts and academics in San Francisco to discuss the future of AI. Joining me now is Jim Steyer. He is the CEO and founder of Common Sense Media. He was part of these talks yesterday. And Jim, I know that you are especially worried about kids when it comes to AI.

But, yes, you asked the right question here. Look, AI is going to be a bigger deal than social media. And I think that's really important for the public to understand. That the impact of AI will be bigger than Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, et cetera.And the truth is, there've been no regulations that are meaningful on social media. So we don't want to blow that again with AI. And the truth is, is now incumbent upon us to put guardrails and common-sense regulation around this extraordinary new technology. Because used well, there is incredible potential to improve our lives. Used badly -- I don't know if I'd talk about existential extinction, Brianna, but there is some very, very scary things that could happen in terms of misinformation, polarization, and the damage to our democracy. And President Biden understood that. And I actually think that it was a very small conversation with a handful of experts, and we all said you cannot leave this extraordinary new technology up to a handful of very large companies who may or may not have the best interests of the public in mind.",

Look, when you look at privacy issue -- by the way, which affect every American -- as you may know Congress has still not passed any kind of significant privacy legislation, Brianna, since Mark Zuckerberg was in kindergarten. And we actually passed a major piece of legislation in California in 2018, the California Consumer Privacy Law, which is the law of the land. So privacy is an important issue -- and by the way it's related to AI.But if we're going to have an important set of guardrails and a public interest orientation towards this extraordinary new technology, then Congress is going to have to stop being politically polarized and unable to get out of its own way. And so, I'm very glad that Senator Schumer invited me to these meetings and is talking about hearings. But actions speak louder than words. And as a citizen, all of us should want the government to defend the best interests of kids and families and schools and take advantage of these new technologies. But not let them be managed by a small group of trillion-dollar companies. So the proof is going to be in the pudding.",

They want the numbers. Prosecution is responding by saying you should not get all of it. You don't deserve all of it. But in this filing, the headline is, they are stating as a fact that when Bryan Kohberger was arrested, a buccal swab -- which is normally done in the cheek -- of his DNA was taken. So they finally had his DNA.And that they compared that to the unknown DNA found on the knife sheath. Which we first have learned -- this was new information -- the knife sheath was turned over on the bed next to Maddy Mogen, partially under her body and partially under a comforter. But they compared that and statistical match they say to Bryan Kohberger was that unknown DNA on the knife sheath. Let's look at documents here. Because here's what they say. Quote -- and it's the STR testing they did. They say the STR profile is at least 5.37 octillion times more times likely to be seen if defendant is the source than if an unrelated individual randomly selected from the general population, is the source. That is the science data for STR DNA testing. Here's one more thing we learned for the first time from this document. Now CNN, we had reported this through our sources on the day that Bryan Kohberger was arrested. But it's the first time the prosecution has admitted it. That the FBI did genetic genealogy early on. They took that unknown DNA from the knife sheath -- according to documents -- they put it through public data bases, finding relatives, distant relatives, generational relatives and they used that with investigate techniques and they went to local law enforcement and said, Bryan Kohberger is your suspect.
