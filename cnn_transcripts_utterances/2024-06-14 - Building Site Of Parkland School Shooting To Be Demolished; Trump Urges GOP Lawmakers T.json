He couldn't get down because of a technical malfunction with the wires. You see he eventually did with a ladder.Videos of the incident showing Brown continued to sing while also furiously gesturing to the crew to help him out. Brown was eventually given that ladder you see there and climbed down. He's fine. He appeared to have some, though, heated words with some of his crew. At the end of the show, Brown told the audience he was pretty mad about that mishap. All right. South Florida bracing for more rain and possible flooding today. It is the fourth-straight day of that rain. Today's forecast, thankfully, not as severe as it was Thursday. Still, seven million people across South Florida, including Miami and Fort Lauderdale, remain under a flood watch. Florida's governor issuing a state of emergency for several counties in that southern region, and he is urging locals to try to remain at home and not drive, of course, through those floodwaters. South Korea's vice foreign minister held an emergency phone call with this U.S. counterpart over a potential visit by Vladimir Putin to North Korea. The pair sounding the alarm over that visit. And according to South Korea's Foreign Ministry, the minister stressed Putin's visit should not result in any deepening military ties between Russia and the North. According to readouts of the call, the U.S. and South Korea agreed to continue to closely monitor the situation there -- Kate.",

Demolition is about to begin on the 1200 Building at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Now, this is the building where 17 students and staff were killed in that horrific shooting back in February of 2018.And so -- for more than six years, it has remained standing and essentially frozen in time -- standing like something of a -- like a horrible time capsule -- walls ridden with bullet holes, stained floors -- because it was used as evidence in the murderer's trial. He was sentenced to life in prison in 2022. And now, after this long wait, the demolition of the 1200 Building is about to begin today. You can imagine there are a lot of mixed feelings about this moment. Joining me right now is Lori Alhadeff whose 14-year-old daughter Alyssa was one of the 17 beautiful lives taken that day. Lori is also now the chair of the Broward County School Board. Lori, thank you for being here. How are you feeling this morning?

According to sources, Trump told GOP lawmakers yesterday to follow their own convictions, but to also be smart about how they talk about abortion. He also emphasized that abortion legislation should be left to the states. For more, I'm joined by Democratic strategist and consultant, Simon Rosenberg. And Alyssa Farah Griffin, CNN political commentator and former White House communications director for Donald Trump. All right, I'm going to start with you, Simon.

And this was a moment that Donald Trump is actually being politically savvy in picking up on the moment in the country where the Republican position on abortion is widely unpopular. Because we have seen a number of red states -- Ohio, Kentucky, Kansas -- where ballot initiatives, constitutional amendments to preserve abortion rights have come up. And people have flocked out in droves, including Republicans, to vote for those rights.So he's absolutely right to say you, at minimum, need to say that you're for exceptions. But it's not so much a messaging problem. I think he would like to think that. It really is a facts problem and it's the single greatest vulnerability for Republicans. My advice is always if you say you're pro-life, you need to be pro- life through the duration of a child's life. You're for paid family leave, greatest investment in foster care, investing in programs like WIC and TANF that help the most vulnerable mothers.

The men -- they crossed the U.S. southern border and were vetted when they requested asylum. Those men are now in custody and set to be deported. CNN's Katie Bo Lillis has much more on this, and there's a lot to learn about these men and what happened and what they know. What more are you learning about their ties?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Kate. Look, very important to understand right off the bat that according to the U.S. officials that we spoke to, there's no evidence at this time that these men were sent to the United States by ISIS-K as any part of a specific plot to conduct violence on the United States. But that doesn't mean that officials weren't very worried about them.One of the things that sparked this arrest was officials were able to pick up on concerning extremist rhetoric by at least some of these men, prompting this sting operation across the country to arrest -- to arrest all eight of these people. Now, the concern here for U.S. officials that I spoke to is that these men might have been radicalized to conduct an attack once they were already in the United States -- potentially, feeling isolated, homesick, maybe financial vulnerable -- all things that might make a person susceptible to ISIS propaganda. And one of the things that U.S. intelligence officials know about ISIS-K -- this particular splinter of ISIS that these men are said to be connected to -- is that they have really emphasized their online propaganda and online recruitment efforts, right? They've really focused on trying to inspire so-called lone wolf attackers rather than train and field operatives the way that al Qaeda did, for example, with the 9/11 attacks. And so, U.S. officials are also particularly concerned because these men came from Tajikistan, and Tajikistan is a country that ISIS-K has recruited heavily from. Many ISIS-K leaders in Afghanistan are, in fact, Tajik. It's a very poor country. It's a country that -- where the population is under an extreme amount of religious repression -- both things that terrorism experts and terrorism analysts believe really make for kind of a petri dish for extremism. [07:55:03] And so, U.S. officials telling us that they grew -- they surveilled this group for a period of time. This sort of derogatory information -- this information about their potential ties to ISIS came to light. And amid sort of growing fears by U.S. officials that the -- that the situation in Gaza and the tensions that has inflamed has left the United States sort of uniquely vulnerable to a potential lone wolf attack, they moved out of an abundance of caution to move and pick up these people and arrest them. But still, Kate, a matter of ongoing investigation as officials try to understand both the exact nature of their ties to ISIS and to understand this group and how it operates in general, Kate.",
