Just ahead on \"CNN Newsroom,\" extreme weather across the U.S. Deadly flooding in the northeast and a record setting heat wave to the west, with no relief in sight.Records also being set in Europe just as tourism season reaches its peak. We are live in Rome with a look at how the ancient city is dealing with its modern threat. Plus, the Gilgo Beach murders, we will talk with the author of a best-selling book examining the case from the very beginning. Why he says that the police were so quick, at first, to dismiss the young female victims. Good to have you with us. We begin with extreme weather around the world, starting here in the United States where more than 18 million people are under heat alerts and 14 states, stretching from Washington State all the way to Florida. A dangerous heat dome remains locked down over the western U.S. and the relentless blistering temperatures are breaking records by the day. The National Weather Service says about three dozen daily high temperature records were broken on Sunday, and parts of California, Nevada, and Arizona are seeing the mercury shoot well past 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Well, people in southern Europe are also sweltering with a scorching heat wave coming right in the midst of the busy summer tourist season. On the Spanish island of La Palma, a forest fire is only making matters worse. It's burning out of control forcing at least 4,000 people to evacuate. In Italy, it least one person has died and several tourists have collapsed from the heat. Sixteen Italian cities, including Rome and Florence are under extreme health risks because of the heat and people in France, Greece, Turkey, Croatia, and Spain are also facing dangerously high temperatures. So, let's bring in CNN's Barbie Nadeau. She joins us live from Rome. So, Barbie, what is the latest on this record heat hitting Italy and, of course, other parts of Europe?",

The record, of course, just set last year in Rome, in June of last year, 40.7 degrees. Expecting it could rise above that today, almost certain tomorrow.We're seeing the same sort of warnings in southern Italy, in Sicily especially. They are looking at topping the all-time European record which was 48.8, set last year as well. So, temperatures are going to get hot. We've just seen this continuation of the rise in temperatures as --- as you said, as you mentioned, you know, the height of tourist season. These tourists have been here, their trips are planned, and they're not changing their plans at all, Rosemary.",

These above average temperatures, if we put this in the motion going through the work week, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, into Thursday, they really just expand.The high pressure that's been here over the four corners region, near Nevada, just sort of drift a little bit, but that heat dome stays massive and it blocks any of these winds and rain that could cool things off and things are going to stay 10, 15 degrees above average. That is Fahrenheit, above average, for the next, at least, week. And we're talking the hottest times of the year. So, take your hottest time of the year, add 10 to 15 degrees fahrenheit, and that is where we are. Nearly every day this week, in Phoenix, will be a record high. That is scary and what is even scarier are the lows; 94, 95, 94, those would be in the top of 5 to 10 hottest nights Phoenix has ever had, any one of them, and you've got seven in a row. It's been since last Sunday when the low dropped below 90. So, that is a record stretch for them. We are setting records everywhere. Las Vegas more of the same, looking at setting a record and then staying above 110 all week long. Again, lows not dropping down where they should be. That is where heat turns deadly. The next several days here, going through, actually next weekend. Here in the northern plains and even the northeast, you've been dealing with a lot of rain. You are dealing with smoke from the Canadian wildfires, but you are at least staying out of this record heat wave that shows no signs of breaking in the U.S. Back to you.",

Officials say some of the roadway was damaged and traffic, including cars and trains, has been halted. The governor of Russia's Belgorod region says a girl was injured and her parents killed in a car on the bridge. There is no confirmation yet on what may have caused all of this. And, to the west, the last Ukrainian ship protected under the Black Sea Grain Deal with Russia has left the port of Odessa. That deal, which allows safe passage for Ukrainian grain, will expire later today unless Russia extends it. President Vladimir Putin has complained the agreement is unfair to Russia, but he has still agreed to previous extensions, despite threatening to pull out of the deal. The U.N. has offered Russia some financial concessions, but it's not clear if Putin will accept them this time. And CNN's Scott McLean is tracking all of this from London and has the latest for us.

Obviously, the deal has helped to stabilize global food prices because Ukraine is such a big exporter of grain. On Saturday, Vladimir Putin told South African President Cyril Ramaphosa that the deal has not been living up to its objectives.And the crux of the deal is, essentially, is that Russia allows free passage of the Ukrainian grain to get out of the country via ship on the Black Sea in exchange, in part, for help from the U.N. to help its grain and its fertilizer get to market. Now, it's grain and its fertilizer, Russian grain and fertilizer, is not subject to any international sanctions, but complicating things is the fact that Russian banks are largely sanctioned and disconnected from international payment systems. And so, the U.N. has offered to connect one bank or remove barriers for the Russian agricultural bank. It's not clear whether the Russians are in the mood to accept that kind of a deal. Obviously, the ball is in their court. And one other thing, quickly, is that, of course, Ukraine does have other options to get grain out of the country, but the difficulty going via rail through Europe is that the gauge of the tracks in Ukraine and Europe are actually different so, it causes a huge logistical issue to actually transfer the cargo from one train to another once it gets to the border with Poland, Rosemary.",

A job where he is very visible. He's dealing with architecture clients all the time, perhaps high-profile people. So, it's hard to imagine somebody like that thinking that they can stay below radar forever. The fact that he stayed below radar this long, has everything to do with problems with the Suffolk County Police. Problems with the Suffolk County D.A., institutional apathy about this case from the very beginning.Cooperation problems with the FBI.

And these families are all families that were in crisis in different ways, from parts of America, where financial opportunities have been narrowing for generations. And then the internet comes along and disrupts everything, and provides an irresistible way to make quick money for people who otherwise might be working at minimum wage jobs or perhaps going nowhere in their lives.So, it was a tool of social mobility for a lot of these women. The problem is that our society made them vulnerable. They were overlooked when they went missing, their disappearances weren't taken seriously by the authorities. Some of them never got on to the official registry of missing persons that the United States has because they were escorts. And then once their bodies were found, the police didn't want to take the case as seriously as they might have otherwise, that these women were college students perhaps or, you know, corporate employees. Instead, they told the public that it was the constellation, that the killer was only targeting women like this. It really is a textbook case in why women like this get overlooked and why serial killers target women like this because they know they'll be overlooked.
