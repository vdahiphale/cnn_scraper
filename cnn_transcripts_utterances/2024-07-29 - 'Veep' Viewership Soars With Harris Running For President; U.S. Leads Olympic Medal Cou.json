And his plan includes term limits for what is now a lifetime appointment, in the Constitution, by the way, a binding code of ethics for justices and a constitutional amendment that would put a limit on presidential immunity if crimes are committed while in office.CNN chief legal affairs correspondent Paula Reid joins us now. And you just are getting this statement, right, from Leonard Leo?",

      "sentences": "That's right.I mean, what the president here is proposing, this is big, and it comes at a time when the Supreme Court is increasingly under scrutiny, right? Their approval rating is declining, questions about ethics, questions about recent decisions like overturning Roe v. Wade and the immunity decision related to former President Trump. But, look, a lot of things that he's proposing right now, these require congressional action. That's hard to do when there is consensus across the aisles, but this is increasingly a partisan issue. Republicans have made it clear they oppose these reforms. Now, the reason the president is bringing this up now is because the Supreme Court is and has been a big issue in the election, right? He campaigned on a promise to try to bring some change to the Supreme Court. And he had a committee present a report, but that was submitted in 2021 and they haven't done anything. And, likely, Vice President Harris is going to be running against former President Trump, who very successfully leveraged the Supreme Court during his campaign and while he was in office. And just a short time ago, I got a statement from Leonard Leo, and not necessarily a household name, but someone who helped former President Trump while he was in office execute his vision to transform the court. He is largely responsible for a lot of what we see right now on the High Court and in lower federal courts. Here's part of his response to Biden's proposal. He says -- quote -- \"No conservative justice has made any decision in any big case that surprised anyone. So let's stop pretending this is about undue influence. It's about Democrats destroying a court they don't agree with.\" Then he goes on to say: \"Let me be clear. If Democrats want to adopt a process across the board, an ethics ban for all branches, I'm in favor of that. No jets, no meals, no speaking honorariums, no gifts for anyone for any reason in any branch starting with Congress. Until they support that, let's be honest about what this is, a campaign to destroy a court they disagree with.\" And the reason that his response matters is, again, because he was the one who helped Trump really transform the Supreme Court and help give him the conservative supermajority that Biden and really now Harris are having to campaign against.",

They met this morning after water quality tests showed bacteria levels were too high. Two straight days of rain pummeled Paris, overwhelming the city's sewage system, sending untreated water with high levels of E. coli flooding into the river. Organizers, as you mentioned, do say that, with higher temps and more sunshine the next 36 hours, they're confident there will be acceptable limits by tomorrow's competition. Now, if they do have to cancel the swim portion, they're going to go with a run/cycle/run triathlon, and that would be the competition. Now, you mentioned Nadal and Djokovic, one of the greatest rivalries in all of sports, Pamela, the 60th installment of Djokovic versus Nadal. And this was in Roland-Garros. And it's the Serbian Joker putting an end to Rafael's comeback, winning the best-of-three sets match. They have combined for 46 Grand Slam titles. Joker has the slight 31- 29 lead in this rivalry. And this win puts him through to the third round of the Paris Olympics as he chases his first ever Olympic gold. Now, the Olympic dream for many of these athletes starts when they're just young kids.

And in Canada, this is a huge story, because it's not just the women's soccer team. Now the question is about the men's soccer team and the mind-set and their strategy and their schemes. And it is truly a big story north of the border. But it is also a big story here, because it goes to the very heart of competition.
