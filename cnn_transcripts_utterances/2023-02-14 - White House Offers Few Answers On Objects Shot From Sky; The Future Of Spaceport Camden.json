Those objects were flying at aroundforty thousand feet and had balloon-like features with a small metal cylinder underneath officials said. Sunday`s object over Lake Huron was flying at around twenty thousand feet and it was described by officials as octagonal with potential surveillance capabilities. The incidents have sparked confusion and prompted bipartisan criticism from lawmakers. REP. JIM HIMES (D-CT), RANKING, INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE:  I have real concerns about why the administration is not being more forthcoming with everything that it knows. But part of the problem here is that the both of the second and the third objects were shot down in very remote areas. So, my guess is that that there`s just not a lot of information out there yet to share.",

But officials say they won`t know more about the objects until they can recover and analyze all of the debris. The incidents have also raised questions about whether similar objects have simply gone undetected in the past and whether shooting each one down is the right response. REP. MIKE TURNER (R-OH):  What`s been come clear in the public discussion is that we don`t really have adequate radar systems. We certainly don`t have an integrated missile defense system. We`re going to have to begin to look at the United States airspace as one that we need to defend and that we need to have appropriate sensors to do so. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
