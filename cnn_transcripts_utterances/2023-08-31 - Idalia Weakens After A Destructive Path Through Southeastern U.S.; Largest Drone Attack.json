A high-end category three hurricane and the most powerful storm to better the region in at least 125 years.Idalia is now heading northeast along the Carolina coast, bringing heavy rain floods and a new threat of tornadoes. The National Weather Service reported a weak tornado touchdown in Goose Creek, South Carolina, tossing this car into the air but causing no other damage. But in the neighboring state of Georgia, police report a falling tree instantly killed one man and at least one person has died in weather related car accidents in neighboring Florida, insured property losses in the state estimated at more than $9 billion. While emergency crews have already searched about 75 percent of the storm zone, residents there asked to remain indoors, avoid downed power lines. Hundreds of thousands of people across the southeast of the U.S. are still without electricity. In Florida Governor Ron DeSantis says most schools and hospitals shuttered by the storm will reopen in the coming hours. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS (R) FLORIDA: We clearly have significant damage throughout the Big Bend region. But the response has been swift and people are getting help accordingly. There is of course a lot of debris to clean up. But we will get working with that with the local communities to make sure that the roads are cleared, and people can go back to their lives.

It's kind of exiting South Carolina right now.You're looking at a live picture out of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. That's along the northern coast actually is where I grew up. And typically the boardwalk you would see people walking around at all hours, but it was pretty quiet. Their winds were gusting around 25 miles an hour. Here's what I mean by the deep clusters are convection right across the Piedmont region and central region, as well as into the lowlands of North Carolina beginning to really diminish quite a bit in South Carolina. But some of the rainfall totals that we've seen in South Carolina had been really substantial. We've seen seven and eight inches of rainfall, Hampton, South Carolina, which lies to the west of Charleston, they saw about nine inches, nine and a half inches of rainfall. All right, so technically it is still a tropical storm, only supporting winds at about 60 miles per hour or about 100 kilometers per hour. It looks like it's trek is still going to take it out into the open waters here. Then you have to remember the water here is pretty cool. So it's going to lose a lot of strength very, very quickly. But still some of that lingering convective activity is going to continue. And this is why we have a tornado watch out from Wilmington Oak Island over towards the Outer Banks region towards Nags Head can't rule out the potential for an isolated tornado because those bands are very conductive and very active. We've had some brief flare ups over the last couple of hours but we have no known touchdowns right now. We'll continue to monitor it from the weather department. Back to you John.",

That's where Ukraine's Foreign Minister says, having entrenched on the flanks of the village of Robotyne, we are opening the way to Tokmak and, eventually, Melitopol, and the administrative border with the Russian occupied Crimea.How crucial could this moment be for the Ukrainians?

And so it's a very challenging operation. I think there was unrealistic expectations based off of what Ukraine was able to do last fall, and people expected Ukraine, some people expected Ukraine to repeat that with this counter-offensive, which was just not realistic. And so that's where they're at right now is, I mean, Ukraine did lose a lot of good fighters over the last year, and so did Russia. But it makes it that much harder conducted this really hard breaching all these obstacles. And so that -- they are related. They have to, right, have some success in the east to really hold down Russian forces, Russian assets there so that they can then penetrate, get a penetration in the south. And so that's really what we're seeing play out now. And the question is, will they be able to achieve that penetration where they can really make some kind of success? Or is it going to stall out and they're going to have to wait and try again next year? VAUSE: And just very quickly, that gets us back to this question of F- 16 and long range missiles.

That's always very tough to see, particularly in the part of Cuba where the people appear to have so little. There is something of a silver lining though to this storm for Cuba and that is residents tell me that they haven't experienced a severe drought this summer. And so the heavy rain will actually help with that. Idalia did not hit this part of Cuba as strongly as it is hitting Florida. It came in as a tropical storm, then gained strength and left as a Category 1 storm. And that is why we don't see as much damage here for the most part. Trees have not been knocked down. Power lines, in some places power is being restored. Hundreds of thousands of people were without power. That is slowly being restored.

And it resulted in the first Palestinian to be killed by Palestinian Authority security forces this year.And the reaction from the militant group has also been harsh. It highlights the widening gap between the official Palestinian institutions and the militant groups, which hold increasing sway and power especially in the northern part of the West Bank where this happened. Now, violence has been surging across the occupied West Bank over the past year and a half with the Israeli government saying that the Palestinian Authority's lack of action compels the Israeli military, they say, to conduct regular raids across the West Bank to tamp down on militant activity. So what happened was that a gun battle erupted in the town of Tulkarm after Palestinian Authority security forces say that their forces entered the refugee camp there to remove what they called hazardous materials and barriers including some that were near a school. And that they then came under fire from armed youths in the area. A local journalist told CNN that the forces entered the camp to remove unarmed IEDs that were put in place to target Israeli forces if and when they were to enter the refugee camp. Now, security forces say that they took quote, \"necessary\" measures to control the situation. Now the man killed was identified as a 22-year-old Abdul Qader Zaqdah. His brother told CNN that he was an electrician and claimed that he was not associated with any militant groups. But the militant groups have called this, like Hamas said, a crime against our people. And the Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigade which is associated with the Fatah party which is the dominant party in the Palestinian Authority, they accused the Palestinian Authority forces of assisting the Israelis and announced that official security forces from the Palestinian Authority were now, quote, \"prohibited from entering\" the Tulkarm refugee camp. The militants also warned that the Palestinian security forces would be treated, quote, \"like the occupation\", meaning, the Israeli forces, if they came into the camp. Hadas Gold, CNN -- Jerusalem.
