U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is in Cairo for ceasefire talks as Israel continues its military operation at Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza. Then, thousands of people in Kyiv forced to shelter as Russia launches one of the biggest attacks on the city in weeks. This, as European leaders gather in Brussels, we'll have the very latest. Plus, sources tell CNN Donald Trump is in panic mode. The former president has just days to raise the funds for a $460 million bond. The details on that coming up. Right now, America's top diplomat is back in the Middle East. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is in Cairo today sitting down for more talks with Arab leaders on a ceasefire and the release of Israeli hostages. Meanwhile, in Gaza. Loudspeakers warning people in Gaza's largest hospital to stay where they are as an Israeli raid on the complex enters its fourth day. The IDF says what it calls its precise operation at Al-Shifa has eliminated dozens of terrorists. Gaza's civil defense describes the area as a battlefield. There is a lot happening today involving multiple players. Our U.S. Security Correspondent Kylie Atwood is following developments from the State Department and Jeremy Diamond is live in Jerusalem. Jeremy, let's begin with you. Tell us the latest that you're hearing about Al-Shifa Hospital. What is the fate of the people who are trapped inside? Do they have access to the essentials that they need? And are they able to hear and heed these warnings by the IDF not to step outside, or they might be shot?",

Shortages of food, water, electricity having been shut off. We don't know exactly how many people are at Al-Shifa Hospital, but we have received new video of people who are hiding inside the complex, including women -- about 20 women in a stairwell. And you can hear the loudspeakers being broadcast, presumably by the Israeli military, warning people not to leave the hospital grounds, saying that they will be shot, saying, stay in the hospital. Anyone who leaves will be shot. The voice on the loudspeaker also tells the people at Al- Shifa Hospital not to worry, not to fear us, as it says here, and saying that they are here in order to get the hostages. The Israeli military also says that they have now killed over 140 militants since the beginning of this operation, now stretching into its fourth day. We also know that they have detained hundreds of individuals whom the Israeli military has described as terror suspects, but we also know that they have detained medical personnel and at least one journalist's crew from Al Jazeera in the process of this whole operation. Meanwhile, we know that there are thousands of people who have been fleeing the area around Al-Shifa Hospital, heading south for central Gaza, hoping to find more security there. The Israeli military, we should note, has said that Hamas has begun to reuse Al-Shifa Hospital as a complex for its fighters. They said that they were fired upon from Hamas fighters at that hospital, and that is what they say prompted them to go into that hospital in the first place.",

In fact, even as he agreed to send this Israeli delegation to Washington next week to hear American military officials' ideas about how else they could get after Hamas in Rafah without carrying out an all-out ground offensive, he also made clear that his mind could not be changed about the military necessity of carrying out such a ground incursion into Rafah. At the same time, it doesn't appear that that ground incursion is imminent at this stage. We know that a lot of preparation needs to go into preparing the areas where the roughly 1.5 million civilians who are currently living in Rafah would be moved to. That evacuation, I'm told, will take at least two weeks to actually carry out. So we are still weeks away at a minimum from any potential ground incursion into Rafah. And the hope, of course, certainly from the American side, is that a deal, a hostage and ceasefire deal, will forestall an inevitable Rafah incursion, as far as the Israelis view it, before it can actually go into place.",

Ukraine's capital came under heavy missile attack in the early hours of Thursday, for the first time in six weeks. More than 25,000 people took cover in the city's metro stations. Authorities say about a dozen people were injured, but there are no reports, thankfully, at the stage of fatalities. Meanwhile, in Brussels, E.U. leaders are meeting at this hour discussing how to boost support for Ukraine and Europe's own defense capabilities. There's talk of using frozen Russian assets to buy weapons for Ukraine as well, so we'll keep an eye on that. Let's go now to Fred Pleitgen for us.

It's an idea that's been floating around for quite a while. And we're talking about here's windfall profits from Russian assets that have been frozen in the European Union, obviously to try and use that to acquire arms for the Ukrainians. There's various European leaders who have already said that they believe that this is a good idea. In fact, Olaf Scholz came out earlier today as he came to the summit that's taking place today in Brussels. And he said that he believed that this is something that should be done, but should be done in a targeted way, where that money should be used to acquire weapons for the Ukrainians and not be used for other purposes. What we've also heard, and that's probably also not a surprise either, is that the Russians have come out and said that they will, first of all, use all legal measures, as they put it, to try and stop all of this. But they also said that they would retaliate if European countries went through with this plan to use the profits from frozen Russian money to buy arms for Ukraine. It's certainly, I think, the Ukrainians believe and the Europeans believe would solve a lot of problems for them, namely drumming up the sums to try and get a lot of those weapons. Because of course, right now, the Ukrainians do need a lot of arms, need a lot of ammunition to stay in the fight. And of course, the other big thing that we've been talking about for so many weeks, Bianca, now, is the fact that right now the Ukrainians aren't getting any military aid from the United States. And that's something that's still frozen in the pipeline with House Republican leadership still stalling on passing that supplemental bill. So this could be something that the Ukrainians hope could help them out with that, something that the Europeans want to try and make happen. But at the same time, of course, they say that they need to do this in a way that makes sure that these funds are used in the correct way and also that all of this is legally sound as well, Bianca.",

And if he's not able to persuade the New York Appeals Court to let him post a smaller amount or delay posting any money until the appeal's over, then that is when the New York Attorney General's office could begin to take the first steps to try to seize some of this property. And, you know, it is something that is going to be very contested. It's not something that Trump is going to go along with lightly. And even if the attorney general's office does seize some property, it is not that they get, you know, the money immediately. They will still have to find a buyer for the property.

When do we expect the court to make a decision on this very controversial issue? ED LAVANDERA, CNN SENIOR U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, it could come at any moment. There were oral arguments that were heard by a three-judge panel in the federal appellate court. So that decision could come at any moment, and we're standing by for that. Of course, you know, the legal whiplash on this particular issue has been quite dramatic over the last few days and the last few weeks as well. There's also another court hearing scheduled for early April. So whatever decision that comes out of this appellate court could very well be just temporary. What is interesting is that the judges there kind of signaled that there might be -- or there might be some willingness or some openness to adopt and allow parts of the Texas law to go into effect. And to explain exactly what the law would do is that it would give local law enforcement agencies, police departments, sheriff's departments, and state police the ability to arrest people suspected of entering Texas illegally. And it also would give state judges the ability to deport people to Mexico. So there's a couple of different layers to this law, and some of that could be enacted while this broader lawsuit continues to make its way through the legal system. So we're waiting to see exactly what this appellate court is going to do on this hearing and this issue of whether or not to allow the law to continue going forward while the legal challenges continue to play out.",

So Shohei Ohtani'sspokesman originally told ESPN that Ohtani sent money to cover the gambling debts of his longtime interpreter and friend Ippei Mizuhara. But then Ohtani's lawyers on Wednesday said Ohtani was the victim of massive theft. Now, this all came to light because federal investigators are looking into an illegal California gambling operation, as first reported by the \"Los Angeles Times.\" Now, according to ESPN, Ohtani sent millions of dollars in wire transfers from his bank account to the alleged bookmaking operation. And Mizuhara originally told ESPN in an interview Tuesday that the transfers were to cover his losses. He said Ohtani had, quote, \"zero involvement in the betting and none of the bets were on baseball.\" Now, Mizuhara, he told ESPN he didn't know gambling was illegal in California and Ohtani wasn't happy about his debts, but decided to pay them off for him. Well, as ESPN was getting ready to publish their story on Wednesday, Ohtani's lawyers, they sent out a statement saying in the course of responding to recent media inquiries, we discovered that Shohei has been the victim of a massive theft and we're turning that matter over to the authorities. Now, on Wednesday, Mizuhara also walked back much of what he had told ESPN saying Ohtani had no knowledge of his gambling activities debts or efforts to repay them. Now, CNN is attempting to contact Mizuhara. We've reached out to local authorities and Major League Baseball has declined to comment at this moment. And Mizuhara was in the dugout for Wednesday's MLB season opener against the Padres. He was seen, you know, talking to Ohtani, smiling, but Mizuhara was fired by the Dodgers after this story came out. And Bianca, you know, this is certainly just going to be a big adjustment for Ohtani moving forward. You know, Mizuhara had been with him ever since he stepped foot here in the U.S. as his interpreter and he was right by his side, you know, whether they were working out, you know, going to events, at games. He was even his catcher for the 2021 Home Run Derby. So these two were very, very close. Certainly be interesting to follow this story and see what Ohtani eventually has to say about it, considering now that lawyers are involved and the story changed early on.",

Look at this artist rendition of potential sea level rise into London inundating some of this coastal areas now since the start of 1900 we've seen about one foot or roughly a quarter of a meter of sea level rise realized since the Industrial Revolution with projections if we leave climate change unchecked up to one meter. You say, hey, look what three feet of future sea level rise, that's not that much but when you consider that one in seven people across the globe actually live in a coastal community and rising sea level allows for water to be pushed further and further inland. Just take Shanghai, here's a financial center. You can see this artist rendition of a four degrees warming world. And what that will look like.

This is what a care school for men looks like. And more than just learning how to change diapers, this is a place where Colombian men can learn how to be better husbands, fathers and sons. JUAN DAVID CORTES, FOUNDER, HOMBRES AL CUIDADO (through translation): We can all say it at the same time, first thing we are told is that men don't cry. POZZEBON (voice-over): And that includes, for example, learning how to tie a ponytail. CORTES (through translation): Combing hair is not just combing hair. It's about the emotional connection that you create. Investing in men learning about care will allow us to assume this responsibility at home and yet I don't lose masculinity. POZZEBON (voice-over): That care, something Colombian men just like these didn't really know how to give.
