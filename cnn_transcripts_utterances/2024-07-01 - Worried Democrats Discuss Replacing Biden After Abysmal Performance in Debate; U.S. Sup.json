      "sentences": "It's Monday, July 1st, right now on CNN THIS MORNING. Replace Joe Biden or keep him on the ticket? That tough decision facing Democrats this morning? Plus, in just a few hours, the Supreme Court will rule on Donald Trump's claim of absolute immunity.And an extremely dangerous hurricane barreling towards the Caribbean. We are tracking Beryl's destructive path. All right, 5:00 a.m. here in Washington. A live look at New York City on this Monday morning, good morning, everyone, I'm Kasie Hunt, it's wonderful to have you with us. After a debate performance that will be remembered for all the wrong reasons, President Biden spent the weekend huddled at Camp David with his family discussing his political future. Biden advisors telling CNN, first lady Jill Biden, son, Hunter Biden and their grandchildren all implored the president to keep fighting in his bid for re- election. One adviser saying the Bidens were frustrated with the team that prepared the president ahead of his alarming debate performance. So frustrated that people could be fired. This comes as a \"CBS News\" YouGov poll taken after the debate finds only 28 percent of registered voters believe Biden should continue running, with just 54 percent of registered Democrats saying he should stay in the race. And the reaction from many top Democrats, it's still coming in and it is decidedly mixed. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA):  Let us not make a judgment about a presidency on one -- one debate. REP. JAMES CLYBURN (D-SC):  Yes, it was a bad performance. I've been around these things. I've been a part of debate preparation before, and I know when I see -- what I call preparation overload. And that's exactly what was going on the other night. REP. JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD):  But obviously, there was a big problem with Joe Biden's debate performance, and there's also just a tremendous reservoir of affection and love for Joe Biden in our party. And so, this makes it a difficult situation for everybody. But there are very honest and serious and rigorous conversations taking place at every level of our party. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "All right, joining me now to discuss, Shelby Talcott, politics reporter for \"Semafor\". Shelby, good morning to you. This is quite a moment for Democrats, so there's this \"CBS\" YouGov poll that showed only 27 percent of registered voters think he has the mental and cognitive health to serve as president, 72 believe that Biden does not.But our reporting out of Camp David over the weekend shows the family is doubling down on this. There's no question that replacing Biden would be very messy. They have two pretty bad choices here. How do you think this plays out over the next 48 hours?",

      "sentences": "The ultimate question, I think the really important thing is the fact that the closest people to the president are urging him not to drop out. The second important thing to think about is of course, if Joe Biden did drop out, who would the party replace him with?As you said, these are sort of a lot of bad choices here. The Vice President doesn't necessarily poll better against Donald Trump than Joe Biden does. And the key argument that I've heard for months, even last year when I would bring up the age issue to Democrats is, Joe Biden polls the best against Donald Trump compared to any of the alternatives. And so, that's sort of one of the really key things here to keep in mind.",

And then the question, as you said, the president has -- is already struggling with minority voters. He's struggling with young voters.Is there an alternative who could bring in more votes than he's currently bringing in. There's no easy solution here for Democrats. And you know, I think there's skepticism within the party, but also among Republicans over whether this is even going to come to fruition or if this is just sort of a really bad news cycle for the president.  HUNT:  One thing I think we've learned here is that it's unlikely we're going to see another presidential debate this election cycle. And the Biden team is officially saying they are going to do it. But here was Steve Bannon yesterday speaking with \"ABC News\", basically saying, well, Donald Trump has no incentive to show up again. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And I think the thinking is, listen, after the debate on Thursday, Donald Trump's team was feeling really good.And so, I think the incentive is the assumption that Joe Biden will perform badly again, and why would that be a bad thing for Donald Trump if he again is able to sort of rein in those meandering thoughts and the anger that we saw back in 2020, that didn't help him.",

He has done debates for years and years and years. So, it's hard to sort of make that argument, I think, and have it stick where his team was the only reason that he had the performance that he did.",

You could potentially have Donald Trump in the White House as well who have a similar worldview.I mean, there's a lot of nuance within it. For example, you know, the very powerful far-right group in Germany has different views on the far-right group here, but there's certainly common ground amongst them. And if I look back at how Trump was elected the first time round, you know, I think that Bardella has done a similar -- given a similar argument to the people of France. You know, within Paris, not a huge amount of support for the far- right, but in rural areas where people haven't got jobs and they're being told the economy is growing, but they're not feeling the benefits of that, they're the people that are really appealed by these arguments. You talk about immigration and Ukraine and how these things have an economic cost, fundamentally, it's down to cost of living, not being able to afford everyday life, and the right, giving a much more clear argument to how to get out of  that even than the left, which used to dominate that discussion.",
