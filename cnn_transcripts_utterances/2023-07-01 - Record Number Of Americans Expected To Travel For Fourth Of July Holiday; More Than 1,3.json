Gas this Fourth of July will cost a staggering $1.30 less per gallon than last year. That's a huge plunge and one of the biggest one year price drops on record. That also means drivers are spending $20 less per fill up on average. This is a big reversal from last Fourth of July, gas prices were near record high with oil prices rising over fear that Russia's war in Ukraine would disrupt global supply. Russia is the world's second biggest exporter of oil. But despite Western sanctions, that disruption hasn't come to pass and oil prices have dropped this year as the Federal Reserve wages its war on inflation. Now there is concern that fight will slow the U.S. economy and demand. Still, this is good news for your pocketbook and part of a broader cooldown for consumer prices. Data released on Friday showed the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge the PCE index, once again cooled in May, hitting the lowest level in two years. Victor, Amara. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "Yes, Amara. Well, yesterday, President Biden made it very clear that he felt the Supreme Court misinterpreted the Constitution when they struck down his signature student debt forgiveness program. And that, frankly, he said that they got it wrong. So he said that wow, Friday's session closed one path, he's going to pursue another.Now that new path the President says is grounded in the Higher Education Act of 1965. A new law that provides him a new authority White House officials feel but they caution that it's going to take time to even get it into place months, in fact, and they wouldn't say whether or not it would impact the 40 million borrowers that were estimated to be impacted by that now struck down law. So the President in the meantime says that he's going to do two things. First, he says it's going to be about income based repayments. And then secondly, he's going to do provide a 12-month on ramp for borrowers to really get re acclimated into paying their debt. Now, while interest will increase, of course, we know that those payments are going to restart in October. So while those interests -- while interest will increase over that 12-month period, the White House and Education Department says that if borrowers miss a payment, their credit won't be downgraded, and they won't go into default for that grace period. Now, one thing we also saw President Biden do, Amara and Victor, was really slammed down a growing Republican talking point that it was actually the president himself that overstated what he could do with that Heroes Act when it comes to canceling billions of dollars of debt. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: I didn't give any false hope. The question was whether or not I would do even more than was requested. When I did I felt was appropriate, and was able to be done and would get done. I didn't give bars false hope. But the Republicans snatched away the hope that they were given. And it's real, real hope. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That's something that the White House has talked about frequently. And we can -- we will expect to hear them continue to do so. Now, we can also expect the President to talk about the fact that he believes that the Supreme Court is becoming more and more radical. We saw him earlier this week, say the fact that there's no iteration of the Supreme Court like this one is -- has done more to take away basic rights. So those are two things that we can expect President Biden to say in the coming months, as they try to put this new path towards student loan forgiveness in place, but again, it could take months.

Let's bring in CNN legal analyst and defense criminal defense attorney Joey Jackson and Errol Louis, CNN political commentator and political anchor for Spectrum News. Good morning to you gentlemen.[06:20:02] Joey, let's start with you. So Biden's new debt relief plan, obviously doesn't come close to wiping out student loan debt for about 20 million borrowers, it basically gives them this year long grace period, right, to pay back the loans, among other things. Does Biden have another or other powers available to wipe debt balances clean?",

But just the general interpretation that the Constitution engagement here, you know, you could deem it somewhat questionable. I read the Heroes Act, right, again, higher education to say the secretary can modify and or cancel, right. And so it talks to the issue of waive or modify. To me waiving debt or modifying debt means you can waive or modify debt. But the Supreme Court says, oh, wait a minute, you can't waive it in that way. Waiver to me is waiver just on the plain language, modifies modify. And so you know, the Supreme Court, obviously, we have a separation of power executive branch, having the power to administer, Congress authorizing, the Supreme Court saying that the President has gone too far. But I just think that based upon again, the reading any reasonable reading of the legislation and any reasonable reading of what the President did initially with seemingly pass muster with this court, as we look at it did not. And so fashioning remedies moving forward, the administration is going to have to be careful not to run afoul of this activist court, and the ability of the court to strike down yet another effort of Biden potentially to cancel that of many bars throughout this country.",

I don't think anybody regrets it.This is something that they said they were going to try and fight to do. And on the campaign trail, Amara, that's what really matters. And that that's what you're going to hear more of from the President saying, Look, maybe this door closes, but I'll open another one, and I won't stop fighting for you. That's what the polls show. People want to hear from their democratic president, and that's what rallies the Democratic base, a president who's going to fight for them and try even if the court says no, even if the court slows it down, even if he now has to go through administrative rulemaking that's going to stretch this out for months.",

Why can't you just help me win? This is what I was promised. And this is what I need.I think what we're going to see though, to answer your question, Amara, is you're seeing already sort of an attempt by some Republicans to say that, well, this was always an elitist project, that this was for people in private schools who didn't even need the help, and they were going to charge we the taxpayers in general, for the education of people who had no need for the loan in the first place, and certainly have the means to pay it back.

You can't defame anyone that speech because it would ultimately deal with a reputation by giving false statements. And ultimately, in that reputational damage that's deemed not to be constitutional. Right? You look at gun control, hot button issue, but that doesn't mean the right to bear arms. Everyone could run out in the street with guns.So what am I saying? I'm saying that there are plenty of First Amendment protections that are circumscribed, right, that are limited because they impair someone else. And so to suggest that wait a second, because I don't want to for same sex couples to do something. It's a form of expression, I can do whatever I want. I think it goes too far. And so the reality is, whenever you look at constitutional rights and protections through -- throughout history, whenever your right goes and affects someone else's, it needs to be looked at and limited, just like commercial speech would can't be false and misleading. And so at the end of the day, I just think it's a troubling decision in many ways it oversteps and I think it sends reverberations around businesses who might act in the future to impair someone else who has same sex, transgender or otherwise.",

The mafia council, if you -- if you like. As for Surovikin, Surovikin is a very interesting character. He's still a commander of the Air Force.
