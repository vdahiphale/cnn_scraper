      "sentences": "Well, it's interesting, Brianna, hearing you talk about what Biden's advisers and allies are telling him, because it's very different from what we're hearing from Trump's advisers and allies. They want Donald Trump to focus on things like the economy andimmigration, to bring up his record. They believe that enough time has passed since he was in office that people view him more favorably on those issues. And if you look at current polling, that remains the same. Now, of course, with Donald Trump, there are other concerns, the other concerns namely being that he will go off message, that he will stray from talking about things like immigration, like crime, like the economy, and instead go on rants or attack Biden. What they are hoping for is that he just stays true to that messaging. Now, something that we had heard from allies originally had been that they were concerned about this idea of a lack of audience, that they thought that Donald Trump would not have high energy if there wasn't an audience to feed off of. However, in recent days, I have talked to a number of allies, people who have spoken to the former president, who say that they're coming around to this idea that it might actually be better for the former president. He might not enjoy it as much, but to keep him on message, he's not going to go into those rants and riffs -- of course, this is their hopeful thinking -- because he doesn't have that audience egging him on. He doesn't have them laughing and clapping. Again, remember here, they don't know who's going to show up on the stage, which version of Donald Trump, but they can tell him over and over again, and that's exactly what they're doing, how to respond to questions on abortion, how to respond to questions on democracy, particularly his role in January 6 and what he has said about pardoning the people involved. But they are selling him, just stay on message, whatever it is. Pivot to the things that the people, the voters are showing they appreciate you for it in the polls. That is, again, crime, the economy and immigration.",

It sounds like Donald Trump may have a different approach, but he's taking it very seriously, because you have got to think about this, Boris. It's the first time that both Donald Trump and President Joe Biden have gone the same stage in nearly four years. Since then, Donald Trump has been a convicted felon times 34 times. He's been impeached twice. Roe has been overturned, which means women's reproductive rights have been in significant jeopardy. So there's a lot that President Biden wants to talk to Donald Trump about. They have not had a direct conversation in front of the American people in nearly four years. He wants to talk about why he put three conservative Supreme Court justices on the court to overturn Roe. He wants to talk about why he blocked the most historic bipartisan border bill that we had coming into Congress in 10 years, why he told his MAGA allies in Congress to block that legislation. He wants to talk about why he -- what his economic plan is, why he balanced -- why he cut corporate taxes on the backs of middle-class families when he was president. There's a lot that he wants to talk to him about, so he is taking this debate prep very seriously. And he's looking forward to having a direct conversation with Donald Trump on Thursday night.",

GDP has been at a record high and employment's been low, especially among black Americans and Hispanic Americans.So you will see President Biden talking about his accomplishments. But you're also going to hear him talk about not only what his plans are for the future, how he's going to continue to lower costs for American families, but, also, what is Donald Trump's plan for the economy? I mean, he and his MAGA allies practically cheered, jumped up and down, when inflation started going up as a result of a once-in-a- generation pandemic. So what is his plan? You're going to hear President Biden talk about that. And he's also going to make the case for the American people that he is fighting for them. He's fighting for their economic freedom. He's fighting for their freedom across the board, versus Donald Trump, who simply wants to get back into the White House to seek political retribution on his enemies and, frankly, to keep himself out of jail.",

And it's reflected in polling.And I think we can share some recent polling done by CNN and others that shows that a majority of voters seem to trust Donald Trump when it comes to the economy. So, when the president is up there talking about inflation and talking about the issues that everyday Americans face, how does he change that dynamic on Thursday night, when so many of those viewers already have a baked-in impression, not just of him, but of Donald Trump as well?",

They're starting to have real conversations about how they're going to vote in this election, what issues matter the most to them. So it was important to President Biden into our campaign that we actually went out there to the American people and had a direct conversation with Donald Trump about our different vision for America versus his dark vision of seeking political retribution and not really having a plan to deal with some of these issues. Again, President Biden is very well aware that costs are still very high in some places for American families. Those costs have gone down. He has implemented plans to continue to drive those costs down. He also, of course, through some of the economic policies he put in place early on, his administration prevented us from going into a recession. So I think you're going to hear him talk about that. But he's also going to talk about his plans for continuing to lower those costs and making it very clear to the American people that he is fighting for them. And I think that's an important contrast point that you're going to hear President Biden certainly make on the debate stage.",

We appreciate you showing that to us.After spending the past five years in a high-security British prison, the man accused of one of the largest classified breaches in U.S. history will soon be a free man. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange was released from a London jail overnight and is currently flying to a U.S. territory, the remote Northern Mariana Islands, which is not far from his home country of Australia. And he will be heading there for a plea hearing with an American judge that is going to take place tomorrow. The agreement with the U.S. government means that Assange avoids prison time in the U.S. And as part of the deal, Assange pleads guilty to a single felony count of illegally obtaining and disclosing national security material. That included, of course, one of the largest leaks of confidential military information in American history, nearly 500,000 secret documents related to the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. He had faced 18 charges for his alleged role in the breach. We have former Army intelligence officer -- or -- pardon me -- former Army intelligence officer Chelsea Manning provided those documents to Assange that was back in 2010 and 2011. And that information, the U.S. says, endangered the lives of confidential sources. This may be the end to a nearly-15-year-long saga where Assange spent years trying to avoid U.S. prosecution after seeking asylum in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London. And we're joined now by former CIA officer Bob Baer to talk a little bit more about this.
