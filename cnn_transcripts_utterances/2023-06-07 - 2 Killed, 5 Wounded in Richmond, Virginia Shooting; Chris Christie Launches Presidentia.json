      "sentences": "Former Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows is not just a witness for special counsel Jack Smith, he is the witness. Why? When it comes to the January 6 investigation, he was at the center of everything. The House Select Committee that looked into the event surrounding January 6 came to the conclusion that all roads led to Mark Meadows in and around the events on that day and the so-called pressure campaign on states and officials to try to overturn the results of the election.Now, when it comes into the investigation into the possible mishandling of classified documents, Meadows increasingly appears to be a possible critical witness there as well. Not only would he have been at the White House present when things were being packed up towards the end of the administration, but recent CNN reporting on a bombshell audio recording where Trump talks about having a classified document reveals that that conversation was recorded by Meadows' autobiographers. So, clearly, investigators could have a lot of different questions for Meadows in either investigation, but at this point it is unclear if he has spoken to investigators about both probes or just one. But this certainly solves a long swirling question in Trump circles. They have been wondering what exactly is going on with Meadows. The former president tried to block Meadows from being able to testify, citing executive privilege. He lost that fight. So, it is expected that Meadows would testify, but there had been no communication between meadows' attorneys and those for the former president leading to some concern about whether Meadows was indeed cooperating with investigators. But at this point, the fact that the special counsel has spoken to Meadows strongly signals that at least the classified document investigation is not only in its final phase but likely wrapping up sometime soon.

And where the incision was made, a hernia has developed which the Vatican described as worsening and painful.

You know, we're going to see more scenes like this across New York and some of the major metropolitans along the East Coast. I mean, to me, this looks like some type of dystopian climate change movie playing out in real time behind us. I mean, that's just incredible to see.And as you rightly mentioned, New York was battling Delhi, India, one of the notoriously most polluted cities in the world as a top ranked worst air quality in the world. Detroit and New York because of the wildfire smoke have been continuously in the top five. And they remain in the top five this morning. Now, the smoke has been visible from space. We talked about the wall of smoke that literally traveled across Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. And you see it there on the satellite imagery, it shows you how much that dark, kind of hazy smoke has drifted and it continues to drift, impacting not only the quality of the air but also the visibility. We're dropping below on two miles in some locations, Syracuse to Watertown. Several visibilities expected today across the major East Coast cities, Philadelphia, Boston, New York City, all the way to the nation's capital. And look at this, anywhere you see those red or kind of magenta colored dots on the screen, well, that is where you see unhealthy to very unhealthy air, that means anyone who is sensitive to this type of smoke, fine, particulate matter, is going to have a problem and you want to stay indoors today. We've heard all the warnings. But we have millions of Americans under this air quality alert, some code red for locations along the East Coast. So, I want you to see this, but this is a projected near surface smoke forecast and there is another plume kind of coalescing across the southern sections of Quebec that will drift into the Northeast. So we're going to see more scenes like we've seen unfold over the past 24 hours across the Big Apple -- Christine.",

They're talking about the East and we're hearing Ukraine claiming this morning making small gains in the Bakhmut direction which, of course, Russia claimed victory over a couple of weeks ago.And they are also point pointing officials to the Zaporizhzhia region, Russian backed officials there this morning saying that several towns way behind the frontlines in Russian controlled areas are coming under fire. This fits a pattern we've been seeing over recent weeks. So that is what officials are saying. I think the question now given the images that we're seeing of the destruction of the Kakhovka dam in Kherson region and flooding, this is a before satellite image and we're about to get an after, showing the scale of the flooding there, how will it affect Ukraine's counteroffensive, given that Ukraine hasn't actually said that it started yet. This is a big question. If the plan is for them to cross the Dnipro River and head south towards Crimea or even to the Azov Sea to try to cut Russia's land bridge in half, then this kind of flooding will of course significantly complicate that. I think worth noting as well the scale of the disaster is still unfolding. Ukrainian officials who, of course, only control some of the Kherson region say that 1,400 people have been evacuated, more than 1,800 homes flooded. And, Christine, this is still a warzone. Shelling continues in Kherson. One person, according to Ukrainian officials, killed there in the last day.",

So that is another issue.Normalization of relations with Israel, that is what the United States wants Saudi Arabia to do. How can that be achieved? Well, can it be achieved through better economic cooperation. There seems to be cooperation discussed on cleaner energy. There is talk in the past that Saudi Arabia would like a domestic nuclear power energy program, clean energy, if you like, potentially part of a deal to normalize relations with Israel. None of this is being discussed in detail publicly. These are some of the topics that are coming up, undoubtedly Iran. Saudis have allowed Iran to reopen its diplomatic facilities in Saudi Arabia. So, that is another issue on the agenda. Yemen, where the two countries worked closely together.  On ISIS, they worked closely together. On Sudan, they worked closely together.
