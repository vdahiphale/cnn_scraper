But it misses the larger point here, that we have to do a lot more for women's health.

If a person has a serious mental illness or they have an addiction, that that can be treated.And there are many women who are pregnant who are addicted to a substance of some sort, and they're getting treatment through their pregnancy. Not all, and that's a problem. And we need more medical health supports and more health coverage for women while they're in pregnancy. I mean, we do have some pretty perverse incentives, right now. Just two years ago, our state Medicaid program paid a fraction of the costs for childbirth, even though we cover half of all the births in the state. So when you talk about access to health care, I think that's where we really need to be focused on. But, you know, treating abortion as the end-all and be-all to mental health -- and that's the way that the initiatives written -- I think, misses the mark and that doesn't align with the values of Arizonans. BRIANNA: All right. I do just want to be clear, just to state the facts, before I let you go, because you say it's up to nine months. It does say viability. I know you take issue with the exception. You say that makes it a nine-month bill. But when we look at Arizona's statistics, 94 percent of abortions have been before 15 weeks. Abortions after 21 weeks are only 1.6 percent. They're extremely rare. We tend to know that those are actually very much wanted pregnancies in those cases, and they're very extreme cases usually. But Arizona State Representative Matt Gress, I really appreciate your time. Obviously, this is a -- it's a fraught subject. And a lot going on in Arizona. Thank you so much.",

We haven't seen him yet, but we do expect to see him pretty soon when he makes his appearance here in this courthouse behind me.Now, we have not seen him since a few weeks ago when he was basically trying to say that Shohei Ohtani had loaned him this money. He's expected in court, but he is not expected to enter a plea. Now, there are still some questions, even after reading through this long complaint. One is we're told that Ippei Mizuhara won about $140 million gambling. He lost about $180 million gambling. And were told that he stole $16 million from Shohei Ohtani. So that's still, so like by my bad math, a $24 million hold it. I can't quite account for. The other thing that's really interesting from the complaint is reading the text messages. A lot of evidence seems to be text messages between the interpreter and the bookie. I'm going to read one from the bookie. This was from last fall when the interpreter seemed to be in a bit of a whole and didn't necessarily have the cash to pay up. This is from the bookie: \"I'm here in Newport Beach and I see victim A\" -- that's Ohtani -- \"walking his dog. I'm just going to go up and talk to him and ask him how I can get in touch with you since you're not responding. Please call me back immediately.\" Then there's another text, which is from March 20th. This is just as the story was breaking. The bookie asks the interpreter: \"Obviously, you didn't steal from him.\" The reply comes back from Ippei Mizuhara, \"Technically, I did steal from him. it's all over for me.\" Now one of the things that is also now very clear is that Shohei Ohtani had absolutely no idea that this was going on. The interpreter was basically managing the bank account, keeping everybody else out of it, keeping Shohei Ohtani out of it. So Shohei Ohtani is really being described here as an absolute victim. Had no idea. So he's in the clear.

And this is all happening as the White House says it is watching very, very closely amid what officials call a real and incredible threat against Israel from Iran or it's proxies. These are concerns that follow an Israeli airstrike -- you see it here -- on Iran's consulate in Syria last week. It killed three generals. It killed other officials as well. And Iran has vowed to retaliate for this, something that could happen as soon as this week, according to sources. The U.S. announcing today that it is sending additional assets to the region to deter potential attacks. We're joined now by retired Air Force Colonel Cedric Leighton. He is a CNN military analyst. And you heard it there, 40 rockets fired into Israel from Lebanon. Hezbollah claiming credit. How are you seeing this moment? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: So, Brianna, at this moment, it's probably not the opening salvo in Iran's efforts to answer Israel's attack on its consulate in Damascus. But what it might be is kind of a probing action by Hezbollah. Hezbollah has been doing a lot of these kinds of attacks, really ever since the seventh so I've October even before that. So what we're seeing now is kind of a simmering pot, if you will, on the stove of the Middle East. But that pot is not boiling over at the present time, but it could very easily.",

We don't expect the Iranians to attack any of those. And we don't expect their proxies to do that. Although, the proxies are kind of waiting to see what will happen with several other things that are going on right now. One of those is Iraq's prime minister visiting the United States on the 15th of April. And he's going to want to have U.S. forces withdraw from Iraq.
