And the question is, will Boeing go further or is this the tale of a lone scapegoat?Boeing has parted ways with a man named Ed Clark. He was the head of the 737 Max program at Boeing, the fifth person to hold that position when he came into after the 737 Max 8 crashes of 2018 and 2019. Three hundred and forty-six people killed in those two crashes abroad triggered the Max being grounded for 20 months. Michael Stumo's daughter died in one of those crashes, and he posted to X that Clark had to go. But so does, he says, Boeing's CEO Dave Calhoun, who he says, quote, \"lies to the public and lobbies Congress to weaken safety laws.\" End quote. The top senators overseeing aviation have called for Boeing executives to face public hearings. Nothing scheduled so far. But Boeing is under incredible scrutiny even still. The FAA, the Federal Aviation Administration, has inspectors swarming the 737 Max factory in Renton, Washington. They're investigating Boeing quality control. A report on that due out any day now. This is in tandem with another investigation. The National Transportation Safety Board only a fraction of the way through its probe. It already found that the bolts that held the door plug on Alaska Flight 1282 were not installed at the Boeing factory. NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said right here on CNN THIS MORNING there is no way that plane should have been delivered to Alaska Airlines with those critical boats missing. She will testify to a Senate committee on her investigation two weeks from now.",

Odysseus began its journey into space a week ago and could land on the moon about 5:30 p.m. Eastern Time. But a historic landing not guaranteed. In fact, more than half of all attempts to land on the moon have actually failed. Just last month, a privately funded lunar lander launch from Florida and it suffered a malfunction, never made it to the moon. It burned up after re-entering earth's atmosphere. Japan did successfully land a rover on the moon last month, though. Its moon sniper sent back these pictures after landing successfully there -- how cool -- on the surface. Here with us now, so happy to be joined by NASA administrator, former U.S. senator, Bill Nelson. All right, let's just be optimistic because I already put it in my calendar to watch this width my kids today at 5:30 p.m. So, being optimistic, assuming a successful landing, what can we all learn from it?",

By the way, we know that there is ice in the crevasse of rocks, which are totally shadowed, and therefore we want to go to the south pole, however hazardous it is, to see if there is water in abundance, because if there's water, there's rocket fuel, hydrogen and oxygen.

The book is extraordinarily fulsome and nuanced. But it was striking - you know, I think everybody in D.C. was intrigued by Jake Sullivan, who you kind of track through his rise and also kind of his role in the genesis of the kind of Biden doctrine or foreign policy. In a foreign affairs essay just shortly before October 7th, he wrote that, \"although the Middle East remains beset with perennial challenges, the region is quieter than it has been for decades.\" That, obviously, needed to be edited in the online version. I'm not saying this to knock Jake, but I think that was the view at the time, right? We kind of put it to the side. We had people dealing with it, the U.S., and it's not a front-burner issue.

In effect, the Saudis and the Israelis would have to agree to a clear pathway towards a Palestinian state in order to get that normalization deal. I think if you talk to administration officials now, they would say, sure, we probably should have dealt with this issue a lot more. That said, they still refute the -- the insinuation that they marginalize the Israeli Palestinian conflict at large. They say that it was always part of their planning, but it really wasn't until only a few months before October 7th.

There weren't heads that rolled.You have this anecdote in the book on a meeting that I was aware of at the time did not go well. I didn't know how badly it went. I want to read some of it were basically the Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani, is in the Oval Office meeting with President Biden. They knew it was going to be a tough meeting where President Biden was going to tell him that their defense strategy, the security strategy, was failing and Ghani says - kind of blames Biden a little bit for announcement that he's going to withdraw. And then immediately pivots to the fact that Afghanistan should be a tech hub. And what the U.S. really needs to do is invest in 5G. And like the stunning moment of the team realizing, oh, oh, uh-oh, like, this is what we're dealing with on the other side.
