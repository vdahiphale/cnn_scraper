And America's big move to try to counter China, the new U.S. military foothold just announced right near Taiwan.Welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world. I'm Christine Romans. We begin this morning with an aggressive new legal strategy from Hunter Biden. The President's son calling for criminal investigations of Rudy Giuliani, a computer repair shop owner and several right-wing political figures. Hunter Biden alleges laws were broken when they attempted to weaponize his personal information against his father. More now from CNN's Evan Perez.",

It's a distinct change of strategy by Hunter Biden after bringing on new lawyers to help him defend himself against an onslaught of attacks from Republicans. In a letter to Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings, Hunter Biden's attorneys accused their computer repair shop owner John Paul Mac Isaac of unauthorized access of the laptop and distributing its contents to the New York Post for a story that was published in the weeks before the 2020 election. Mac Isaac has said in a memoir and in media interviews that he received a laptop at his store from Hunter Biden in 2019. The letter from Hunter Biden's attorney Abbe Lowell says, this failed dirty political trick directly resulted in the exposure, exploitation and manipulation of Mr. Biden's personal, private information. Hunter Biden remains the subject of a federal criminal investigation, and CNN has reported that prosecutors have been weighing possible charges for tax violations and for an alleged false statement in connection with his purchase of a gun.

Well, that still remains an open question. I think the fact that they had a conversation at all seems to be viewed as progress from McCarthy's side of things. However, the two perspectives which are wildly divergent in terms of what the outcome should be when it comes to the debt limit, they're still wildly divergent. And while McCarthy said that there was a positive meeting, Biden, in his statement after the meeting said that it was a productive discussion. There is no clear way to lay out a path towards avoiding default at this point in time. And still, White House officials make abundantly clear, the President is dead set on the idea that there will be no negotiations despite what Republicans insist. Take a listen.

One of the buildings is almost completely leveled.You do see rescue crews frantically trying to clear debris to try to get to anyone who may be underneath of the rubble. And the last word that we have from the local governor is that there may be at least two people still trapped underneath and time here is extremely important. The strike took place more than 14 hours ago now. And if you imagine that if there are, in fact, survivors, or at least one person still alive under the rubble, they are very likely to be injured, probably quite badly injured. They're also dealing with the smoke and the dust from the actual missile strike itself. And on top of all that, remember, this is winter in Ukraine. So overnight, temperatures were below freezing, and it is very unlikely that someone could survive in those kinds of conditions for an extended period of time. Last night, President Zelenskyy said that this type of strike is a daily reality in Ukraine. And it is sadly all too common. Last month, you'll remember that an apartment building in Dnipro took a direct hit from a Russian anti-ship missile. And in this case, the type of missile that they think was used is an Iskander, the same one that was also used to strike a train station, a busy train station in Kramatorsk last April at a time when thousands of people were at their stations trying to get out of the country.
