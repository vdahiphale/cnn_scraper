I mean, he lost the popular vote in 2016. He lost worse in 2020. And then he unleashed this national trauma that permanently hurt the GOP's brand. And now he's, you know, thinking about and has now announced a 2024 comeback.And I think there are all these Republicans who for years have been holding their breath wondering, when is the right time to publicly defy Trump?

Bill Barr Trump's former Attorney General, writing this this morning on Substack. It's painfully clear from his track record in both the 2020 election and the 2022 midterms that Donald Trump is neither capable of forging the winning coalition or delivering the decisive and durable victory required. Trump's willingness to destroy the party if he does not get his way is not based on principle, but his own supreme narcissism.Again, Bill Barr may have his own interest involved here.

I do think, you know, you see people going public like Chris Christie and Governor Hogan, I think that can build, that can build with something because as you said, there's data points now, it's like three times he has cost them in the elections.
