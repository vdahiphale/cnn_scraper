      "sentences": "Just one day after President Biden warned that democracy is on the ballot, Donald Trump is set to host an authoritarian down in Florida. The former president invited Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban to his Mar-a-Lago estate today. He's repeatedly praised the leader for his hardline policies and inflammatory rhetoric.CNN National Correspondent Kristen Holmes joins me now. Kristen, what do we expect to see today? KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, it's really unclear what we're actually going to see today. We talked to Trump's team, a senior advisor, telling me that this was a social meeting. By that, they meant a friendly meeting with no agenda. Now, of course, it's hard to believe that with a man like Orban and a man like Trump, that there is absolutely no agenda, but that's what they're telling us today. They said they might put pictures out, they might even put a readout out, but the one thing to really note here is that this cannot be an official meeting because Donald Trump is not currently a world leader. So, he has no obligations to report any part of his conversation with the Hungarian Prime Minister. The other thing to point out here is that the White House did not issue a formal invitation to Orban. And on top of that, they -- Orban did not reach out for any sort of meeting with anyone on the Biden administration. This is significant because Donald Trump is not only the former president, but also, he is the presumptive Republican nominee. He could be president again, and it gives you kind of an idea of where he might align himself with world leaders if he were to be reelected into office. It's not that surprising. Donald Trump has always said that he admires these authoritarian leaders. In fact, of Orban, he said when three or two, some people don't like him because he is too strong. Nice to have a strong man in control of a country. But the two of them, in addition to just keeping praise on one another, they also seem to be almost drawing from the same political playbook. I want to play for you what they've both said on immigration. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, look, I think the danger here is that Trump has said on many occasions that when he becomes president, he's going to end the war in Ukraine in one day. And you wonder, why would it take him so long? I mean, he's obviously a very capable guy. But more seriously, this is someone who would be pushing Zelenskyy very hard to accept a partition, accept Ukrainian occupation from the Russians of their land. And also, you know, basically get a ceasefire for that.Now, if that happens, many American allies will strongly oppose Trump and will align with the Ukrainians, but not Viktor Orban. His policy would be let's normalize with Russia. Let's start trading with them again. It's only hurting our economy. Let's work with the Americans. And when Orban does that, that becomes more attractive for other leaders. Robert Fico from Slovakia would tilt in that direction. Maybe Meloni, the prime minister of Italy. And certainly, populist opposition movements that support Trump, like for example, those of Marine Le Pen and Eric Zemmour in France pulling above that of Macron today. In other words, you know, this is -- Orban is the leverage point that would allow a Trump-led United States to drive a wedge into Europe and into NATO. It's potentially an existential crisis in 2025 for those allies. I'm not trying to panic anyone. When I look at other countries around the world, I look at America's Asian allies, for example, Mexico, Canada, India, the Gulf States, they don't face these kinds of crises from a Trump presidency. But the Europeans really do, especially given the nature of the war in Ukraine which isn't going so well right now. That's also probably a part of why Biden decided to lead his State of the Union speech last night with Ukraine, forcing all of the Republicans that support his policy and don't support Trump to stand up and applaud. And we even saw applause from Speaker Johnson in response to those comments last night. And that was an important moment for the president.",

That was a key focus of his speech last night. Let's listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: My purpose tonight is to wake up the Congress and alert the American people that this is no ordinary moment either.

Jean Carroll case. The district court's rules are that they require about 110 percent of the bond because this will stay the judgment, meaning that E. Jean Carroll can't take the money until the appeal is done, so they always want a little extra security.So, Donald Trump has made the bond in this case. There have been big questions about how he would come up with this money. There are more -- there's more information coming into the docket that we're still going through. But he has made the deadline to post this bond. You know, meeting the $91.3 million that the court requires. You know, this is now, of course, comes as he is also facing a very significant bond of $454 million in the New York civil fraud case. He is required to post that by March 25th. There have been questions about how he would come up with the money. So, we're seeing that he made this first deadline, which is the smaller amount of money. But the big question remains, will he make that next deadline? Now, he has asked an appeals court in the civil fraud case to allow him to not post that bond until the appeal is over. The court is expected to issue a decision by the end of this month, also, though that is when the deadline is. So, that could be another judgment that comes down to the wire and whether Donald Trump can make it. But for now, he has met the deadline. He has posted the bond in the E. Jean Carroll case. And he has said he is going to appeal the judgment and he's asking the judge to not allow Carroll to collect this money so he can appeal that a standard practice that's expected to be approved. The only question would be if there are any issues with this bond. But again, it is now in the judge's hands, but Trump has made this deadline, Jim.",

This was the scene yesterday at San Francisco International Airport, 11And here on the bottom of the plane, this is the left main landing gear, you can see the tire there has separated from this set of six wheels. Pretty alarming. And this was caught initially by Plane Spotters who were doing a live stream on this on YouTube. You can see the tire fall to the ground. Apparently, it bounced a little bit and then into the employee lot there at SFO. That is the tire roped off by the police there in the employee lot. It caused a fair amount of damage to cars on the ground. Each one of these tires weighs about 265 pounds. That doesn't include the weight of the wheel hub. You can see it, it looks like it hit the fence there, then it hit that Toyota Corolla there, then it ultimately hit a Tesla. Air traffic control was really the first one to notice this. And I want you to listen to the radio transmissions they made to other airplanes telling them to abort their landings. And that they had to clean up the runway. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
