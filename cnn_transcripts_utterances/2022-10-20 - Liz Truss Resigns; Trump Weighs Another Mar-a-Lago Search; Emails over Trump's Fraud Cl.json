Embattled British Prime Minister Liz Truss has resigned after just 44 days in office, making her the shortest serving prime minister in British history. Our team is following this breaking story. CNN chief international anchor Christiane Amanpour and CNN correspondent Bianca Nobilo joins us from London. Bianca, let's begin with you. The shortest serving prime minister in British history, delivering a very short resignation speech, effectively saying, I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected.",

And it was an appropriately short speech because, of course, she doesn't have a legacy to speak of. She pointed to two economic measures. But basically, her entire premiership has been mired by party division, controversy, taking policies too far, and not being in control of her party.Let's take a listen to the moment where she acknowledged the political reality that she finds herself in.

And that's because basically as soon as she got into the job, she launched ahead with these deeply controversial economic policies.And I say almost as soon as she got into the job because, of course, we had a brief reprieve from political activity when Queen Elizabeth II died on her second day as prime minister. But Liz Truss made no friends within the party with the way that she approached her economic agenda, by proceeding in a bullish manner despite not really having any mandate to speak of. She was elected on a slither of the conservative base within the U.K. That's less than 1.0 percent of the British electorate. So, as calls for her departure increased, the political circumstances became even more uncomfortable for her. And the culmination, Bianna, were the chaotic scenes in the House of Commons last night. And that's when we had reports of conservative lawmakers and some members of Truss' cabinet manhandling other lawmakers to try and get them into the right voting lobby. That precipitated members of Truss' party to come out and say that they've never felt so ashamed and embarrassed of the position that their party is in today. Bianna.",

      "sentences": "I am. And actually one of them sent a fairly devastating message, she's had a long career in parliament, and said, this is just so depressing, it's hard to explain. I feel like my time in government, my time with the party, has now amounted to nothing.There's a deep sense of existential crisis and humiliation in some quarters of the conservative party. And as Christiane was just saying, what happens now? So, one of the reasons that the party is in such deep -- deeply divided - such a deeply divided situations is because of the leadership with Boris Johnson and also Lis Truss. There was this move to expel members of the party that wouldn't tow the government line. So, inevitably, what that's done is amplified some of the more fringe voices in conservative politics at the expense of the more moderate majority in the center of the party. So that will make it very challenging to try and find a successor to Truss, which can unite the different wings of the conservative party. That's why she's been so deeply divisive as well. And that's why, Bianna, in recent days there's been so many discussions about having to have the big beasts of the cabinet, so that's the defense secretary, Ben Wallace, the health - the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, as well as Penny Mordaunt and Rishi Sunak, who were challengers against Liz Truss to become prime minister in the last recent leadership election. The fact that you'd need four of them potentially combed either working together or to get behind a unity candidate to try and lead the party forward. That just speaks to the fact that it is so divided and so factious that there isn't a clear path ahead. It's unclear who would be able to unite the conservative party. But MPs that I've just been speaking to over WhatsApp do acknowledge that if they can't find that candidate and they can't get the party discipline in place to unite behind them, then they will need to go to a general election and the perceived wisdom on that is that if that happened, the conservative party would face electoral annihilation.",

And you talked about this controversial economic plan that she put forward and the meltdown afterwards. I mean it really roiled markets around the world. And it really frightened, according to reports now, even some here in the United States, in the Treasury. And there's a stress test that was ordered by President Biden of sorts to see what would happen if something like that occurred here in the United States as well. I'm just curious, what does this do to England and the United Kingdom's standing on the economic global stage right now?",

And throughout all of this craziness, in these 44 days, there had been a sense of being out of touch with the public there and tone death.So, Bianca, what happens next? Truss says she's going to stay in office until a successor is chosen. We remember Boris Johnson doing the same. Truss was announced shortly thereafter. How long can this decision go on for?",

      "sentences": "Well, another addition to the cocktail of instability is the fact that the process is unclear. So, typically, a prime minister would be safe in their position for one year until they can be challenged if more than 15 percent of the conservative parliamentary party writes letters of no confidence. That's what we saw with Boris Johnson. We saw that with his predecessor, Theresa May, as well.But because this prime minister has served such an unsuccessful and unusually short tenure, that is not the process. So then what follows that is a leadership contest. But we've so recently had one, it only finished six weeks ago, which was generally considered to be unedifying for the conservative party. And most lawmakers I speak to are just desperate to avoid that again. They want the least disruption possible. So there's been discussion about a coronation of a new prime minister, one that can command the confidence of the parliamentary party and hopefully, they say, by extension, the country. The problem is, is right now nobody knows how that happens. There's discussions with members of that influential committee that we've been referring to that I'm speaking to at the moment, that they want this all wrapped up in about a week. The problem is, who will unite them? Because what fundamentally is true that we can say about this, Bianna, is the fact that something in British politics has obviously broken, because to have a prime minister serve this short a tenure, to have so many prime ministers, this will be our fifth, the one coming, in six years. To have the party undisciplined and fractured and unable to focus on governing, all of this does point to something really shifting in what was once the mother of parliaments.",

      "sentences": "Well, this judge is saying that John Eastman doesn't have good enough reasons to protect the emails. Eastman had been arguing that they were attorney/client communications for him, working for Donald Trump, working with other lawyers after the election. He was trying to keep them from the House Select Committee.But the judge really zeroed in on eight emails in particular that he found were -- essentially could be evidence of a crime and spoke to the schemes that the Trump lawyers were working on to put into lawsuits, claims that the election was stolen from Donald Trump. That, obviously, wasn't the case. Here's what the judge wrote, because he specifies why these eight emails in particular should be going to the House and other investigators. He wrote, there are four documents in which Dr. Eastman and other attorneys suggest that irrespective of the merits, the primary goal of filing lawsuits is to delay or otherwise disrupt the January 6th vote. He also writes, four other emails show that President Trump knew that the specific numbers of voter fraud were wrong but continued to tout those numbers, both in court and to the public. So, Bianna, that's a double-barrel finding from this judge. On one hand he's saying that these emails really could show that there was the engagement of - in a conspiracy of Trump lawyers trying to block Congress from certifying the vote on January 6th. And then that second part, that there was this intention to defraud even a federal court. Bianna.",

That's why he's fining (ph) him (ph).

And this is something that just helps him win a Republican nomination where he has this fervent base, about 30 percent of these voters who will come out and probably elect him a the Republican nominee regardless of who else is on the stage with him because he has such a grip on them. And a big part of that story is, I'm being silenced, I'm being persecuted, just like you are. I will stand up for you. And all of these legal battles that he faces, they don't seem to have any impact.

He's endorsing candidates.He and a bunch of other candidates who have long said, oh, we won't run if Trump is running, are now deciding, hey, we're going to try it out. We're going to, you know, get in the ring. I just don't know how he separates himself from Trump, especially when he has long called it the Trump/Pence administration. He's been his loyal sidekick for so long and now he's starting to separate himself from Trump, saying that he was unprincipled in his populism. And I think you're going to hear even stronger language that separates Pence from Trump. But I think it's difficult because so many of these candidates, Mike Pompeo, Nikki Haley and others who - who want to run for president in 2024, they want to be on the debate stage next to Trump, they were made by him. They embraced him for so long. Their political future - their political pasts are tied to him. So how do they disconnect themselves from him for their political future. Even Ron DeSantis himself used Trump's endorsement to win in Florida as governor and has long tied himself to Trump and now they have to try to separate themselves. It's a really difficult dance, especially when Trump has such a grip on this percentage of the Republican Party that can help him be the nominee.
