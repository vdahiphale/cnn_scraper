And the reason that the Dow is doing well, because stocks are doing well. The main event: Well, the US hit a major milestone in its inflation flight. Headline inflation dropped to three percent. President Biden says US support for Ukraine will not waver. NATO members are making big pledges of military support. And Elon Musk has added another company to his list of ventures, xAI. What does it mean and why? We need to understand it. We will over the course of the program. We're live in New York, Wednesday, July the 12th. I'm Richard Quest and yes, I mean business. Good evening. The United States is closing in on the Fed's two percent inflation target, as inflation has eased for the 12th straight month. Now CPI, that's consumer prices, that's the headline number, just three percent for the 12 months ending in June. The headline is that, it is at its lowest rate since March 2021, and core inflation also fell more than expected to 4.8 percent, but that's still more than twice the target rate of two. Markets or higher with the Dow set to post substantial gains and tech stocks have also popped. The Fed's medicine is working at least at the headline level, and to some extent at the core level as well, but in economists are warning that this last stretch of the inflation fight is probably the most difficult. The US economy and its job markets are still growing. Wages are rising faster than prices last month, which means the spiral is ever upwards, and the Fed will consider this at its next interest rate meeting where arguably, a rate rise is still on the target. Rana, do you go for a rate rise at the next meeting?",

President Biden just last week, he said that the US is actually running low on ammunition to provide to Ukraine, which is exactly why the Americans had to provide cluster munitions to Ukraine. And so there was this moment earlier today, when you saw some frustrations flare with the US National Security adviser being challenged by an activist from Ukraine saying, look, what should I tell my son? Should I tell him that he is going to be a soldier for Ukraine fighting Russia seven years from now, because the US did not want Ukraine to join NATO because it was afraid of Russia? And that really did not sit well with National Security Adviser Sullivan, who said that she is ascribing all of the wrong motivations to what the US is doing here. And so this is a really sensitive issue both for the Americans and of course, now the British. They clearly want a little more recognition from Zelenskyy about what they're doing, but at the same time, Zelenskyy is fighting a war and he is being very realistic, he believes about what he and his people need.",

And so we saw him expressing gratitude for the G-7 declaration in which they have agreed to provide long-term security commitments to Ukraine. And ultimately, his chief-of-staff, Andrii Yermak, also said that this ultimately was a victory in terms of the security guarantees they were able to get, regardless of the fact that they will not be getting an invitation to NATO automatically, right, when the war ends. That still remains to be seen, that pathway, that timeline that they have wanted so badly. But still, the fact that NATO is still saying, look, you need to fulfill certain conditions before you are allowed to join NATO, not exactly sitting well with Zelenskyy, who says that we need to know exactly what those conditions are, in order -- you know, so that our people can actually feel that they can aspire to NATO membership one day -- Richard.",

The BBC says that it made one phone call, apparently, the call didn't connect, they didn't bother to make a second one. They sent one e-mail, it wasn't replied to, and they essentially set it aside until \"The Sun\" newspaper came to them saying that these were the allegations, and they were going to print them. The BBC says that at that point, the allegations were different in some way to what had originally been reported, but it still raises the questions as to whether or not an allegation of this severity was raised up the flagpole quickly enough, followed up on quickly enough and dealt with quickly enough to potentially avoid this kind of a fallout.

So we're talking about Apple, Amazon, Netflix, our own parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery. So they are on one side, the actors on the other and they need actors to go out to the junkets, to the red carpets. You saw Tom Cruise at the \"Mission Impossible\" premiere.

But at what point -- have you got to push core down to 2 percent? EL-ERIAN: So you're absolutely right, in looking at core. Headline will come down. But however headline is going to head back up toward the end of the year. That's because there's a limit to how much oil prices can come down. Already, oil prices have recovered somewhat. So the key number is core, at 4.8 percent. That is too high. The Fed would like that number to be between 2 percent to 3 percent. And that last mile, Richard, is going to prove to be very difficult.",

The inflation target of 2 percent was made for a different world. The world we live in today is a world of problems on the supply side. Supply chains being re-wired, geopolitical tensions, tight labor markets, all that is complicating supply. I worry, as implied in your question, I worry that, if we continue to target at 2 percent inflation, we will end up tipping this economy into recession.",

You stretch it out. Second step, you observe whether we can have it stable inflation rate at around 3 percent. I believe we can. So it will not damage in any major way the economy while it's at 2 percent. And that point, you then transition to what I think would be a more appropriate inflation target.

EL-ERIAN: Yes, but it's a funny gold standard. It's one that has been adopted by many countries. It's as if I go around and saying, there's a single weight target that we should all have, regardless of whether we're tall, short; this is the target. And we pursue, it regardless of what it implies for our health. I think that we have to revisit, once in a while, things that have been there for a while and ask the question are they appropriate? Now I'm not saying, give it up overnight, I'm saying define a path to it that goes over time in order not to sacrifice the economy and cause undue damage. And you and I know that the last thing you want to do to the most vulnerable segments of the population, is first, hit them with inflation shock. Taking away the purchasing power. Then hit them with a recession that takes away their income. So this is serious stuff, Richard. And we have to think very carefully as to what is the right destination.

And warnings are coming in from places from California to Florida, coast to coast. Recovery efforts are underway in the northeastern U.S., after intense rain brought catastrophic flooding. In a month, people are trapped by floodwaters and the state governor says flooding is nowhere near over, with more rain expected. Lucy Kafanov is in Scottsdale, Arizona.
