I'm Fredricka Whitfield.And we begin with the apocalyptic destruction from the deadliest natural disaster in Hawaii's history. At least 80 people are dead and 1,000s more displaced from the wildfires. And at any moment, Lahaina residents could soon return to assess what might be left. Crews are still working to fully contain three major fires and prevent flare ups on Maui. Devastation there, costing an estimated $5.5 billion. One lawmaker says the state underestimated the threat of wildfires and failed to plan for communication issues with the Emergency Alert System. Governor Josh Green has ordered a comprehensive review of the state's response. Let's go now to CNN's Mike Valerio, who is joining us on Maui. And Mike, moments ago, last hour, you were approached by a woman who was very frustrated, upset about the road closures. It looks like things are moving right now. What's been happening there?",

Hundreds of cars queued up in the background, a couple of yards away from us, now able to move through the main route that goes into the disaster zone of Lahaina.This is Honoapiilani Highway right here. And again, it was open briefly for about 3-1/2 hours, yesterday, shut down though, Fred, because too many people were going into restricted areas of the burned-out ruined areas of the historical town. So, there is one driver. That's Patrick, who we interviewed, actually, after we went off the air with you, Fred, who is waiting to get back to his restaurant, see how much of his neighbor's properties are still in OK shape. And this is pretty momentous. These are people who have been waiting after they fled their homes Tuesday afternoon, Tuesday evening, with literally nothing but the clothes that they were wearing. And they may not know what's left of their homes. So, this is truly striking. People sleeping here overnight in their cars. So, they're checking with police. Police are just making sure that A, these are residents, not tourists. Not anybody who is trying to take advantage of the situation. And B, you know, if you were staying in a bread and -- bed and breakfast or a small hotel, you are also able to get into this perimeter. So, we also want to take you, Fredricka, as we monitor what's happening over here. So, some video of National Guard troops, who are beginning to survey the ruins of Lahaina. They're going door to door. In some instances, spray painting x's on the ruins of buildings, just to convey to first responders and local Maui authorities that they have searched inside those buildings. The latest numbers and figures notable that we got, Fredricka from FEMA, $5.52 billion is now the estimate for rebuilding Lahaina. Just an incredible staggering number. 2,207 structures as well that were damaged or destroyed. 4,500. That is the number of people who could need potential shelter. Also waiting to get in here to come through this line. People who are donating their supplies. We talked to a few of them yesterday. Here is what they told us. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Number one, in the past few days, plea negotiations between Hunter Biden's lawyers and the justice department fell apart. They reached an impasse and the federal prosecutors handling the investigation reached the conclusion that, in their view, a trial is now in order. That's the first big development. And then, separately, but, of course, completely related is the announcement yesterday from Merrick Garland, the attorney general that the prosecutor who was leading those plea talks, who is leading this investigation, David Weiss, is now going to be elevated from a U.S. attorney to a special counsel with more authority, more power, more budget, and more leeway to prosecute this the way he wants to. It's a huge development in the case, and it turns what was probably going to be a speedy plea resolution into a potential trial -- unprecedented trial of the president's son. So, how is Hunter Biden's team responding? They have been relatively cautious. They are not attacking the prosecutors and they are expressing hope that they will still reach a similar resolution to the one that they struck in the now-collapsed plea deal. Take a listen to Abbe Lowell, one of Hunter Biden's lead attorneys. He spoke last night with our colleague, Kaitlan Collins. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ABBE LOWELL, HUNTER BIDEN'S ATTORNEY: It should not change the outcome. Who could say that they have been the subject of such a painstaking investigation, looking at every nook and cranny, in which a conclusion was two tax misdemeanors, and a diverted gun case to turn into anything else. There is been no evidence or fact that wasn't uncovered a week ago that will be uncovered tomorrow. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "That's right, Fred. The White House official tells CNN that the White House did not receive any sort of heads up when this announcement was coming from Attorney General Garland just, yesterday.But their strategy as of now is consistent, which is that they are not providing any comment, they are declining to comment on this matter. In fact, in a statement to CNN, White House spokesperson Ian Sams said the following. He said, \"We will refer you to DOJ, or to Hunter Biden's personal representatives,\" when he was asked about this latest development. And again, this has been consistent for the White House on various matters, involving the justice department, when we have heard from the president. On any matters related to the justice department, he has maintained that they work separately. And that also explains why there was no heads up to the White House before this announcement came down. But when that expected plea deal was happening, there was an expectation, sources tell CNN that the Biden's would be able to move on from this chapter. That is apparently no longer the case, as this designation has now happened. And it is, of course, a time when the White House is facing intense criticism from Republicans, who have gone so far as to potentially open up an impeachment inquiry into President Biden. Now, when the White House has been asked about that, they say that their claims are baseless, and they call it a stunt. But, of course, it speaks to the increasing criticism that this White House has face from Republicans on policy matters, but also when it comes to Hunter Biden. And despite the announcement yesterday, Republicans are -- they didn't quell many of their concerns. And so, all of this is still very much unfolding. But when it comes to Hunter Biden, what we always hear from the White House is that the President the first lady love and support their son, and that all questions should be referred to DOJ and Hunter Biden's representatives.",

Let's hear the whole truth and nothing but the truth about Donald Trump's actions in the surrounding cast of characters around him. We watched a series of events happen here that were tragic and untruthful. And he's got a chance to present these facts and say, hey, I didn't know what was going on, or I think what reality is going to be is. They knew exactly what they were doing. And I think the interesting part to this indictment is different than the others, is that there's going to heavy signaling that there's going to be 12-plus co-conspirators. And these folks don't have the same level of loyalty they had to Donald Trump when he was trying to change the election outcome in 2020. And so, it's going to be interesting to see which way they go.

This is the first chapter of my book that I wrote about a rally two days before the election in Rome, Georgia.I gave an opening -- intro remarks before President Trump got on stage. And I made a couple of comments. I said, every time we lower people's taxes, it's not just for Republicans, it's for Democrats, too. And I got booed by 30,000, MAGA hats. And then I said, every time we improve education, it's not just for Democrats, it's for Republicans, and I got booed even louder. And then, I made this crazy statement and said, you know, our policies are so good, they even help the people that don't vote for us, and I got booed even louder. It was at that moment that I realized that, that crew of 30,000 people were not conservative, they were angry. And within hours of the 2020 election, when I started hearing Donald Trump talk about his notion that the election was rigged, and, you know, the machines were corrupt, and whatever else conspiracy theories, I quickly turned the page and I tried to get to it as quickly as I could, so that I could try to stop the little grass fire from turning into a forest fire. But unfortunately, I was unsuccessful. There wasn't enough of us out there doing it. But instead, we're going to have this slow, painful process of realizing what the truth actually is. And that's Donald Trump ran the worst campaign ever. And if we let him be our nominee, again, he will get beat by Joe Biden again, because it will be the worst campaign a Republican could ever put forward. We start this process on second base in this 2024 cycle. Joe Biden, you know, eight out of 10 Americans don't want Joe Biden or Donald Trump to run again, but we don't want to seem to take her own medicine, and move past Donald Trump.

We even have them for the Pacific Northwest. They really dodge the heat for much of the summer. But the heat will build quickly across that region throughout the beginning part of the week. So high temperatures today in Dallas 108, Houston 102, Del Rio 108, temperatures will finally fall in Dallas by Monday by about 10 degrees but still 99 still hot there, Montgomery hitting the triple digits throughout the weekend as well.Those all-important feels like temperatures hitting 107 in Lake Charles, 102 in Jackson, Shreveport, 100 degrees in Dallas. High temperatures for the Pacific Northwest. Portland will hit 106 on Monday. They can actually break records Sunday and Monday. We could see more than 100 records broken across the country throughout the week, most of those being in the south and Pacific Northwest. Portland should be around 83 this time of year, their temperatures will be well above that triple digits Sunday through Tuesday and then finally falling, not getting back into the 80s by Friday, though, so intense heat. We also have some storm watches Thunderstorm Watches until 6:00 p.m. Central Time for portions of Alabama, Georgia as well as Tennessee. So these storms are basically riding on the north side of that heat dome. So they are linked in some way. And you can see showers and storms firing up. Thunderstorm warnings for Nashville right now with a lot of lightning strikes. And as these storms continue to the east, we'll see some thunderstorm activity during the overnight hours for the Northeast, the I-95 corridor. And then you can see those stronger storms building across the plains and then pushing to the east throughout the end of the weekend. So we do have some intense weather to talk about, some strong storms. We do have a level three out of five for portions of the Northeast, including Pittsburgh. New York City could see some storms, damaging winds, large hail the possibility of isolated tornadoes throughout the afternoon and evening hours, Fred.",

And now, Justice Thomas, and in another iteration of it, it seems, you know, all allegedly, you know, very flagrant, you know, track record of undeclared gifts.So I wonder now, is it your feeling that there has been a history of, you know, justices not declaring these gifts and donations or, you know, VIP passes, et cetera, for a long time.

And in fact, there are some very good decent people on our Supreme Court, who, as soon as they got appointed, got literary agents and signed book deals, so they could make a bunch of money. The only agent, Supreme Court justices should have our Secret Service agents, not literary agents. So we're talking about a monetizing of the Supreme Court, when you get in there.So if the problem is when say, take on these jobs, that they feel they're not making enough money, and right now, the salary of an associate is about $167,000. If they feel like oh, we're not making enough money, this isn't enough, then go to Congress seeking a raise in salaries. So this -- the issue is this too. When one accepts a gift, luxury gifts, like Thomas has, and Scalia did, he was at a hunting lodge, you know, is a gift from someone who said, come on, let's go hunting. The problem is that they are making decisions that impact what these gift givers do. So what that does, it says detracts from the kind of respect the public ought to be giving to the Supreme Court. And we know that the popularity of Supreme Court has plummeted, just because of these things. So this is long standing stuff, and we need to take the Supreme Court out of a money making business so and restoring integrity and honesty to that body.",
