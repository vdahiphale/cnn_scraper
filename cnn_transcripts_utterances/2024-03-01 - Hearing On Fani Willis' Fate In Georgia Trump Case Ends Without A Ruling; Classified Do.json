The judge went to some lengths to talk about, well, hold on, if you want me to discredit Fani Willis, discredit her alone off of what she has said as a truthful or non-truthful statement, the D.A. signs the document on every indictment in a courtroom. Every time a lower level D.A. wants to indict, her signature goes on it as well.

(END VIDEOTAPE) REID (on camera):  Today, prosecutors answered a question that's been hanging over these federal cases, and that was just how close to the election is the Justice Department willing to try Trump. The Justice Department has a policy of not taking any steps and investigations that could impact an election within 60 days of voting. It just wasn't clear, though, if that policy applied to the Trump cases. But today, the special counsel made it clear that policy does not apply to criminal cases where charges have already been filed. That means they would be willing to try Trump in September, even October. But, Wolf, that is their stance.

This is a very complex notion here. We haven't seen anything like this before, the judge is in tune to that, but this is also playing to the advantage of Donald Trump's legal counsel and team. They know full well you've got competing interests, competing jurisdictions, and if one is able to give them a trial date, then it saves off everybody else.

In some respects, it might even catapult him to a closer victory in getting the Republican nomination because he has the wind in his sails because of the idea of the talking point, this is a political witch hunt.

You just can't drop enough food for a starving population. To stave off famine, you need thousands of trucks filled with food flooding into Gaza, but that's not happening. We were granted rare access to this warehouse in Jordan, one of the key waypoints for aid now a choke point. All of the aid that you see here is sorely needed in Gaza, but it's still waiting for clearance. Why? Well, CNN spoke to dozens of humanitarian workers and donor government officials who detailed arbitrary Israeli restrictions on aid, often with little to no explanation, impeding a multi-billion dollar humanitarian effort, even as Gazans are desperate to receive it.

In this situation, for the U.S., they're an admission of desperation because the U.S. continues to be unable to force Israel to release its chokehold and allow more trucks into Gaza. The airdrops will do very, very little. And you saw the extent of the needs there, Wolf. It is almost unfathomable that Gaza has been allowed to get to this point. Wolf?",

Thousands of people in Moscow braving the prospect of arrest to say goodbye to Vladimir Putin's greatest foe, mourners of a political martyr, vowing that Russia will be free. Ambassadors from the United States, France and Germany also joining the crowds with flowers in hand. Video of Navalny's open casket, the final glimpse of a corpse finally handed back to his family and allowed to rest two weeks to the day since he took his last breaths after years spent fighting, even from his prison cells, Vladimir Putin's iron grip on Russia, a legacy that his widow, unable to attend the funeral for safety reasons, echoed in a message on social media, sharing a montage of her life with Navalny, she wrote, I don't know how to live without you, I don't know if I can handle this or not, but I will try. His funeral reflecting his life, becoming a moment of resistance. As chance of no to war rang through the Russian capital, with people finding strength in numbers as the crowds grew.",

He's got the details. Sanjay, what can you tell us about these changes and why are they happening now? DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yeah. I mean, these are some of the biggest changes we've seen in a couple of years now, with regard to COVID-19. Let me just put it up on the screen. We can show you what the guidance has been and what the guidance is going to be now. Sleeve this up here for a second. The biggest thing is way that top line in the past, they said five days, you should be in isolation if you have COVID. Why? Because you could be contagious, even if you don't necessarily feel sick. Now, they're saying stay home and away from others only if you have symptoms basically. So that's probably the biggest change, day six and going forward, they say you can now resume activities as long as you're fever-free without medications for 24 hours, if you are going to be around people, especially people who are vulnerable, older people, or people who have some sort of illness, you should be extra careful. Wear a mask, think about ventilation, things like that. Why are they doing this now? What the CDC is saying is that basically if you look around the country with regard to existing infections and vaccinations, about 97 percent of the country has some degree of immunity. That's what they're objecting, although keep in mind, Wolf, people do get COVID over and over again. Another important thing is look at hospitalizations and deaths now, compared to the last couple of years. And what you see is that COVID hospitalizations down about 60 percent deaths, down at 3 percent. So these are some of the reasons. One other thing I'll tell you, Wolf, this guidance that is now being recommended nationally. It has been done at a more local scale in California, for example, in Oregon. So let's take a look at Oregon really quickly and see they implemented this in May of last year and what you'll see that's the arrow looking down. That's when they implemented it. You still saw those surges of cases with this new guidance in place, but what they found was it sort of approximated what was happening in the country. So they don't anticipate by loosening the guidance that it should make a difference in what the national trends are. But we'll see, Wolf. I'll tell you, there's some people who think these changing guidance is a long time coming. Other people who think this is dangerous because there's a lot of vulnerable people out there still, Wolf. It's sort of makes us think about COVID-19 like other flu or respiratory viruses, but others still differences we should remember, Sanjay?",

Even now, you can see how much more significant in terms of hospitalizations COVID is versus flu versus RSV. And that's not dimension. You can still spread this even if you don't have symptoms. People can develop long COVID. So we have to -- we have to have to be thinking about that. Its not flu.",
