Now this is a piece of the story as we're learning what exactly prosecutors are doing to prepare to go to trial in March in federal court in Washington, DC. Taking Donald Trump to trial on four different charges related to his attempts to obstruct Congress and to conspire to disrupt the transfer of power from him to President Joe Biden.And in this court filing on Tuesday, the prosecutors are laying out that not only do they want to argue that to the jury, they also want to show the jury things that Trump had said over the years that weren't specific to the 2020 election. About how in 2012, 2016 and other years he always had talked about doubting votes because of the possibility of fraud. That was some argument that he had made publicly. They also talked about wanting to explain how he said in a presidential debate in 2020 to the Proud Boys, the extremist group, stand back and stand by, and then how he sympathized with rioters even in recent months after he was charged. Said to them that he sympathized with them, you know, put them on screens at his rallies, singing the national anthem. People who were imprisoned for January 6 violence. And then also said that he was interested in potentially pardoning them. So all of that prosecutors say, very well is something that they believe a jury should hear so that they can explain to them the motive and the intent that Donald Trump had after the 2020 election. That there is a story and a history here of violence. That the character traits of the former president is something that really should be heard about how he's always tried to doubt elections and how he's always sought to exploit the possibility of violence as a way to hold on to power politically.

Where the head of the Hamas run health ministry in Gaza says that it's under siege, essentially. There's no fuel. They say they have more than 100 bodies that they can't bury, and essentially there is now no healthcare in northern Gaza.But the fact that we are now seeing a significant operation in the south centered around Khan Younis, where the IDF said on Tuesday that it was in the heart of the city, having encircled. It so is more sort of street to street urban combat that we're seeing. That is creating a delicate situation. Because even before this phase of the operation, Israel was coming under increasing pressure to do more to protect civilians. And now that they are fighting in an area where they have pushed civilians to evacuate to up until this point, more than 80 percent of the population of Gaza is now displaced. We are likely to see displacement on top of displacement because of this. Despite the fact that they say that they're leafleting, there are QR codes that people can look at to find out exactly where to evacuate. But also it's a test of how far international public opinion, and in particular the U.S., will go to support Israel in this. We're hearing that there have been direct conversations, according to U.S. officials, with Israel pushing them to do more to protect civilians. Prime Minister Netanyahu is very steadfast in his speech on Tuesday, saying that, you know, they are going to continue with the full force for a complete victory.

It may be at odds with the U.S. position that has urged Israel not to reoccupy the Gaza Strip and is pushing for some kind of leadership from a revitalized Palestinian Authority.

Food, water, hygiene products and a generator are on the list. He is part of the White Angels unit and they're heading to his hometown of Avdiivka in the Donetsk region on the eastern front, where one of the most fierce and bloody battles is being waged in the war in Ukraine.

And there's another one, he tells his colleague. Russian artillery, mortars and drones target the road. And yet Dmytro remains calm. This perilous journey has become routine despite multiple close calls. Driving past the sign that proudly states Avdiivka is Ukraine, the town of once 30,000 residents is now deserted, devoid of the living, as almost every single building has been shelled. But surprisingly, some people still live here, including Dr. Vitalii Sytnyk, head of the local hospital. Diagnosed with terminal cancer, he's decided he's not going anywhere. We have a job and we do it, he explains. He called the White Angels to evacuate a man who'd just been injured from shrapnel. As they load him into the van, the idle chatter is interrupted.
