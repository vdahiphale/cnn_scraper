It says anyone who incites an insurrection should be disqualified and barred from holding public office. The report also urges new laws which would prevent a vice president or other official from overthrowing electors chosen by individual states. That's exactly what Trump wanted his vice president, Mike Pence to do. We have more now from CNN's justice correspondent Jessica Schneider. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) JESSICA SCHNEIDER, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Nearly two years after the January 6 attack on the Capitol, the committee tasked with investigating all aspects of that attack has finally released its report. It comes nearly two days after the Committee expected to release it, all because of typographical errors, and printing issues. But it is nearly 900 pages with a comprehensive narrative of what occurred before, during, and immediately after January 6. Most importantly here, it also lays out 11 specific recommendations from the Committee about how various agencies and even Congress can move forward. And key among those recommendations is the Committee is pointing to a section of the Constitution, the 14th Amendment, Section 3, that clearly states that anyone who is engaged in an insurrection can be disqualified from holding office. The Committee says that constitutional provision should be enforced. And while they don't say it directly, the takeaway here is that they believe that Donald Trump should be barred from holding office again, especially because he has now announced his plan to run in 2024. The Committee separately is also pushing for passage of the Presidential Election Reform Act that would make clear that Vice Presidents do not have the power to overturn elections, of course, as Trump pressured Pence to do. And the Committee is also recommending that federal intelligence and security agencies really take a much closer look at the dangers of violent extremism, especially since members of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers were at the forefront of the Capitol attack. Plus, there's a host of new details in this 800 plus page report, including about how John Eastman first contacted Donald Trump at the White House on December 23, 2020, almost exactly two years ago, to fill Trump in on his plan to get Pence to overturn the election. Of course, Pence refused to do that, and also how a little known attorney named Kenneth Chesebro allegedly came up with that plot to appoint fake electors in battleground states to try to claim that Trump had actually won in those states. Crucially here, that fake elector plot is exactly what is now being investigated by state prosecutors, including in Georgia, also federal prosecutors from the special counsel's office and those prosecutors from the special counsel's office. They have even served subpoenas to election officials in several battleground states as part of its ramped up investigation. The committee wrapping up its report, but still potentially a long way to go on the criminal side. Jessica Schneider, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEO TAPE)",

I mean, you know, in the chaos and horror of that day and in the immediate aftermath, there was a tendency to say, well, to think that what happened was a switch lash of peak or frustration from the President, an impulsive action of him pointing his supporters toward the Capitol.In fact, what the committee has made clear is that it was the final step in a multi-pronged, multi-month effort to overturn the election that ultimately enlisted collaboration from a large number of other Republican elected officials, both in Congress and especially in the states. It is true that none of this would have happened without Donald Trump, as the committee says. But the other clause that you read is also important. He could not have done this alone. I think what you see in this report in some ways are only the glimmers of the breadth of collaboration that he was able to inspire.",

In particular in that early chapter on The Big Lie, chapter two, they show over and again how he was told clearly and unequivocally, not only by the Justice Department, but by his own campaign, that what he was saying about the election wasn't true, that there was not the evidence of fraud, for example, with Dominion Voter Systems.And later, the report makes very clear that the plan that he urged on Mike Pence to simply ignore the results. He was told that violated the Electoral Count Act. He knew that at the time that he did. That's obviously very important from a legal point of view. If there's any criticism of this report, is that it zooms in so tightly on Trump and his circle and their culpability that it crops out of the picture those other Republicans in the states and in Congress, for example, and it's dealing with the fake electors. It really bends over backwards to argue that they were in effect, duped in many cases by the Trump campaign and the Trump White House. Obviously, there are investigations going on in the states and through the Special Counsel about whether that is in fact the case.",

We can't have one administration judge the actions of a previous administration's as criminal. That was the argument Gerald Ford used when he pardoned Richard Nixon. It was the argument Barack Obama used in 2009 when he chose not to prosecute torture under the Bush administration.We're not hearing that argument. You're not hearing that except from the diehard Trump loyalists. In fact, you're hearing the opposite argument that failing to hold establish accountability is the real danger to society, you know, the saying that a coup without consequence is practiced.

I am here with my partner, she says, discriminated against, they say, because they're migrants, they're women and they are a couple. To be safe, they avoid public displays of affection and traveling groups. Another reason they want to get to the other side, when we're there, we're going to help all of our families, she says. The very mention of family triggers emotions Lucy has carried since leaving Venezuela. Lucy, missing her mom and siblings. Yulexi, her ten-year-old daughter. We hurry across traffic about half mile from where we first met the couple and arrived at this local shelter. With nowhere else to go, families line up, hoping to escape the freezing cold. Lucy and Yulexi among the fortunate. This is home, at least for now. We meet some of their new friends, fellow migrants from all backgrounds.
