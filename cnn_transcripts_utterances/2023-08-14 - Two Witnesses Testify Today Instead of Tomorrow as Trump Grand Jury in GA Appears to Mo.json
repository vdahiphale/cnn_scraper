Today, jurors are hearing from witnesses as Fulton County district attorney, Fani Willis, presents her case. Things appear to be moving even faster than expected.Two witnesses set to testify tomorrow got bumped up to today. Trump has tried to counter the grand jury activity with a flurry of social media posts smearing key players, including witnesses in that case. CNN's Sara Murray and Alayna Treene are tracking all this. Sara, you're down there in Fulton County. Let's begin with you. So a couple of witnesses we thought were going to show up tomorrow.

We know from our sources that she intends to seek more than chargesagainst more than a dozen individuals. And we've already seen a couple of these witnesses come in and out today. We saw former Democratic state senator, Jen Jordan, going in to testify. We heard from former Democratic state representative, Bee Nguyen, who said in a statement that she testified before the grand jury today. Both of them were witnesses to these sort of conspiracy-laden presentations that Trump's legal team made before Georgia state lawmakers in December 2020. And as you pointed out, there were two witnesses we expected to see tomorrow, independent journalist George Chidi and former Georgia lieutenant governor and CNN contributor Geoff Duncan. We learned that both of them have been told to come in and testify today.

Let's break it down.Charges that could include election fraud, making false statements to state and local officials and even racketeering, which Willis previously used to prosecute gangs and even public school officials who oversaw a cheating scheme. Here are some of the key players in all of this. Of course, we have DA Fani Willis, the judge overseeing the special grand jury, Robert McBurney. He's actually defended Willis and her integrity, though he did block her from pursuing a case against then- state senator, Burt Jones, an alleged fake elector, because Willis hosted a political fundraiser for his political opponent. Meantime, you have Secretary of State, Brad Raffensperger, who was on that call. The infamous find the votes call from Donald Trump. He rejected Donald Trump's efforts and certified the results in the peach-state not once, but twice. And then there's Rudy Giuliani. He's accused of presenting bogus claims of election fraud to state officials. You also have former Georgia Republican chair David Shafer. He told the House Select Committee that Trump directed the fake elector scheme. Remember, 16 fake electors in all, which tried to overturn Biden's legit electoral votes and give them to Donald Trump. Sixteen of them in total, many of them now cooperating with the district attorney's investigation.

Earlier in the day, we spoke to the former lieutenant governor, Geoff Duncan, who was set to testify tomorrow. Turns out he's actually testifying today. What do you make of that?PROF. CLARK CUNNINGHAM, GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF LAW: Well, District Attorney Fani Willis kind of set herself a deadline some time ago that if the former president was going to be brought into the courthouse for arraignment, that it was going to happen by this Friday, the 18th, because she's asked the other judges - the judges in the courthouse to keep people out of the courthouse, to not hold hearings through the end of this week. So if she doesn't indict in time to arraign the former president by the end of Friday, there's going to be a problem with all the security arrangements that have been made, because they haven't been made past this Friday. So my guess is that she's looking at trying to get the former president into the courthouse, my guess is, by Thursday. And, of course, it would have to be scheduled with Secret Service and everything like that. So it may be that as much as we were expecting indictments at the end of the day tomorrow, that she's aiming to get the indictments out by the end of today so she can get the former president here by Thursday. That - that's my guess.",

We've seen an immediate effect of a rallying around Donald Trump and certainly a big fundraising boost for Trump, while wondering what the long-term effect might be with suburban women voters, independent voters, people who voted for Donald Trump in 2016, but Joe Biden in 2020.It's a very real difference here, Boris, and that's - this is Georgia. And Jim alluded to this earlier about the people that he's attacking are Republicans. And as we've seen in previous elections, whether they're Senate elections or presidential, Donald Trump's behavior in the state of Georgia hurts him politically in the state of Georgia. And in a way, that could really determine who wins in 2024 or not if Donald Trump is the nominee. We know that he lost the state. We do know that he lost the state last time. And that he cost Republicans two Senate seats, which is one of the reasons that a lot of Republicans would just prefer to see Donald Trump go away one way or another. This further exacerbates that. If you're a Georgia Republican and Donald Trump's not just attacking you, but your colleagues who have won primaries in the state through Republican Party and also been elected statewide, this is not good politics.",

This becomes evidence of that to his base.And the other is his opponents, by and large, still seem to be hesitant to attack Donald Trump on the things that any other candidate would do in any other race for any other office. If your opponent is indicted, whether it's one time or multiple times, you go after him. Donald Trump, by and large, has been free from that process, which makes the debate coming up more interesting. But also this hurts him not just in Georgia, but we learn from Georgia how it can hurt him in other states. Donald Trump argued over and over again that the process is rigged, that the elections are rigged. And enough Republican voters believe Donald Trump that they didn't fill in mail-in ballots. They didn't vote. They didn't vote in the runoff in the Senate races and so forth. That's not just going to affect Georgia. That can affect my home state of North Carolina. That's going to be very close. That can affect Arizona. These close states could be imperiled for Republicans if Donald Trump is the nominee because of how he would defend himself in a trial.",

These Zircon missiles or the variant of hypersonic missile that Russia uses from its - ships at the moment, it already has them armed with that.But to put it on nuclear-powered submarines, that makes them harder to detect. You don't know where they're going to pop up. Of course, they can stay submerged for a long time. So this increases the threat against the Ukrainians and, frankly, anyone else within reach of these Zircon hypersonic missiles. We know that the Russians have fired hypersonic missiles at Kyiv before and they've been intercepted by Patriot batteries. But when these missiles are on a submarine and you don't know where they come up, it's harder to track them because the flight range might be shorter. If you can't track them, you can't shoot them down. So this escalates the tensions, makes the situation more dangerous.",
