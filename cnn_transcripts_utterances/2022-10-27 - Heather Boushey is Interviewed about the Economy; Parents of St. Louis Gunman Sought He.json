Four years ago on this day a gunman carried out a hate-filled attack on the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, killing 11, injuries six others. This anniversary, of course, being marked amid heightened anti-Semitism and attacks of hate across the U.S.Earlier today, the president paid his respects to the lives lost saying, as we grieve this deadly act of anti-Semitism in American history, we stand with the community of Squirrel Hill and Jewish communities across America and around the world. Encouraging news out this morning on the U.S. economy. Domestic GDP grew 2.6 percent in the third quarter of 2022 according to initial estimates. That's the first period of positive growth this year and a little better than was expected. We'll show you a live look at the markets here. Of course, just opening up just about two minutes ago. The Dow responding positively, up just over 1 percent right now. Joining me now to discuss, Heather Boushey. She currently serves on the White House Council of Economic Advisers. Heather, good to see you this morning. So this is good news, right? This is a little bit higher than was predicted in terms of GDP. I know there's also concern, though. One of our CNN business writers saying is this the bump before the slump. How is the White House preparing for what by all accounts could be a slump in the not-too-distant future?",

      "sentences": "Well, here's the thing, Erica. I mean, first off, this is a good report. It means that the economy is transitioning to kind of this steady growth that we want to see. And when you combine this with reports that we've seen recently in the labor market, this does show that the economy continues to be - to move forward. It does show that we're continuing to show job gains and overall growth. So that is generally good news. And I think you see that reflected in markets this morning.You know, the challenge, of course, is what - it's always the challenge is, what's around the corner. You know, we continue to have prices that are higher than we want them to be. But I think, overall, what we know is that we are in a relatively strong position to weather the storms in front of us. And I think this report provides further evidence of that. Consumers are continuing to spend. Businesses are continuing to invest, albeit at not the sort of blockbuster pace they were as we were recovering early in the pandemic, and that, too, is good news. So, I think we're seeing the kind of steady growth that we need to see.",

We're working on bringing down inflation, focused on lowering the cost of living.President Biden did tell Jake Tapper that a slight recession is possible. Are you changing that focus? Is there also planning happening for a recession, which a number of America's top bankers and economists say is likely coming our way. It doesn't mean it's going to be a massive one, but it is coming, because can't you plan for both at the same time?",

All of this has been focused on that kind of steady growth.

And because of the teen's mental health challenges, the family told police they periodically searched his home and checked his mail.But nine days before the shooting at this school, the teen's mother called police and reported that she found this weapon. The initial call was do to a domestic disturbance. She told investigators she wanted the weapon out of the home. Now, keep in mind, that 19-year-old legally was able to possess a firearm. But authorities worked with the family. The weapon was turned over to an adult that the family knew who could legally possess that AR-15-style rifle. It is still unclear how that 19-year-old shooter got the gun back in his hands. We also told you the 19-year-old left behind a notebook with messages saying, I don't have any friends. I don't have any family. I have been an isolated loner my entire life. This was the perfect storm for a mass shooting. The family says they knew nothing about that notebook. In that notebook, the teen also said, and I'm quoting here from the chief of police, he said, they can't tell that I'm doing this and getting ready. The chief says the family made efforts to get that teen help. Listen in. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. COL. MICHAEL SACK, INTERIM ST. LOUIS POLICE COMMISSIONER: They were constantly in touch with the medical providers who were providing medical care for him. They had had him committed on some occasions. They were just really very engaged and attuned to him, you know, when he went to work and everything. So, you know, mental health is a difficult thing, you know. It's just - and it's hard to tell when somebody is going to be violent or act out or if they're just struggling, they're depressed, and they might self-harm. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It's really important in this because so much of the blame has been placed on the local law enforcement, the school police department, which is now suspended, and the local police department. But I'm told there's going to be more of an enhanced timeline.You know, a lot of focus now on the Texas State Police, the DPS, and exactly what they didn't do that day and perhaps should have done that day, Erica. And the other thing, really the big part of this today, is for the families. Several of the victims' families will be here speaking publicly for the first time in front of the DPS, in front of this commission, kind of going toe to toe, face-to-face with the head of the DPS, as you mentioned, Steve McCraw, who has been kind of the face of this investigation. Sort of the guy who's been providing all the information, a lot of it wrong, certainly early on a lot of wrong information. And he, himself, placing a lot of blame on the local police officials and not his own department, which, as we have seen through a lot of our reporting, shows that they did have more responsibility and should have done more that day. So, we expect to learn more about parts of the internal investigation that they've been conducting. Seven of the officers and agents that are assigned to the DPS are under this extensive internal inspector general review. So we may learn some more details there. And the timeline, of course. The end, right now, is unclear, because we don't know what the end result of these investigations are going to be. We don't know if he's going to announce any significant moves today. We know one of the officers who responded from DPS was terminated. Others are still under investigation. But in all, Erica, really today, so much of this is going to be about the families who are going to be calling for Steven McCraw to resign. He said he would resign if any of his officers are found to be culpable. So, they want to hold him to that. They want him to resign and they want more answers. So, we expect to hear shortly first to hear from family members and then we will hear from the director, Erica.",
