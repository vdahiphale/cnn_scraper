Here's our own Matthew Chance. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It takes a certain type of bravery to stand up to the Kremlin. Across the country, police using arrests and beatings to crush dissent against the Ukrainian war. Some anti-war protesters even drafted into the army in a cruel punishment for pacifism. Political opposition always a risky business in Putin's Russia, is now essentially outlawed. With prominent opposition leaders like Ilya Yashin recently sentenced to 8 1/2 years in jail for criticizing the conflict. \"This will all end soon,\" he shouts in defiance. But there's little real reason for optimism. This was Vladimir Kara-Murza, another leading Russian opposition figure, in Moscow back in 2015 after surviving a suspected poisoning at the hands of Kremlin agents. He was allegedly poisoned again in 2017 and survived that, too, only to be imprisoned last April on charges ranging from disobeying the police to treason. The price of silence, Kara-Murza wrote from jail, was simply unacceptable. The price of speaking out against Putin's Russia is extraordinarily high too. Case in point, the former president of Georgia, whose country lost a brief war with Russia in 2008.",
