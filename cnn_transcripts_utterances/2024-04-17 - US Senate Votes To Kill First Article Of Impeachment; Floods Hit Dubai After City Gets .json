We wish them well, and the Dow Jones, well they ring the bell on a day when the Dow is all 46 points. Those markets are down, betwixt and between, as you can tell over the course of the session. The markets and the events of the day that you and I will chew over. Dubai is beginning a massive cleanup efforts after flooding caused by torrential rains. Airlines are working to restore normal flight schedules. A former bank manager tells the US Senate the lack of paperwork, given to investigators after the 737 Max plug amounts to a criminal cover up. And President Biden wants to triple tariffs on Chinese steel. We will talk about that. Live from New York on Wednesday, its April 17th. I'm Richard Quest, and I mean business. Good evening. We are watching closely events on the US Senate floor that is taking place during our time here. The senators are voting on the Articles of Impeachment against the US Homeland Security Secretary. Now, in the last hour, the senators voted to kill the first two Articles of Impeachment against Alejandro Mayorkas even before they have had a chance to debate them. The motion passed 51 to 48 to one, Lisa Murkowski, a centrist Republican from Alaska she merely voted present in a sign of discontent with the impeachment effort, we will monitor the developments on the Senate floor. There is never any real possibility that Alejandro will actually face a trial per se in the US senate. And so to our main story tonight, the United Arab Emirates is trying to clean up from very damaging floodwaters brought on by a record setting storm. We told you about it last night and now we are really seeing the damage and the victims. In Dubai, schools were closed, flights were canceled, traffic was disrupted and people were wading knee deep across water. The flood poured into this shopping mall where people frantically tried to mop it up. A year's worth of rain in one day in a region accustomed and unprepared for this kind of deluge. In Dubai, Eleni Giokos reports.",

And when you see the scale of what is going on like this, the runway is being submerged and flooded. Flight Radar says the flooding forced 900 flights that have to be diverted or canceled. Fly Dubai, the low-cost carrier parts of the Emirates Group has resumed partial operations and said it was trying to minimize disruptions. Paul Griffiths is the CEO of Dubai Airports. Paul is with me now. So just to confirm before we get to the whys and the wherefores, we've just heard that Emirates is now, which is your largest, obviously carrier, Emirates is now suspending check-in until 0900 on Thursday morning local time.

We've been clearing the roads. We've had 22 tankers on the airfield clearing all the stands and the DXB facilities are now 100 percent operational, and now we are into the mode of trying to actually clear that huge backlog. We've got hundreds of large airplanes spread all over the region, and of course, once we've slowed down on departures, we can't accept any more arrivals until there are places for those airplanes to pass. So were are ready to actually start the renaissance of operations here, but I think it is going to be another 24 hours before we can start to see the semblance of normality that is DXB, which as you know, Richard is normally the world's busiest airports.",

He has failed to secure the border and as a result of which, he has committed the high crimes and misdemeanors required. Stephen Collinson is with me. That's what the House sent to the Senate.

You know, think back to the second impeachment of former President Trump after the Capitol insurrection. Plenty of Republican Senators didn't believe that rose to the level of impeachment. So whatever Mayorkas is supposed to have done, which according to Republicans is not actually implementing the law to secure the border, doesn't come anywhere near that. And there are in fact, a lot of conservative legal scholars who were involved in defending Trump in his two impeachments, who agree that this doesn't rise to that standard.
