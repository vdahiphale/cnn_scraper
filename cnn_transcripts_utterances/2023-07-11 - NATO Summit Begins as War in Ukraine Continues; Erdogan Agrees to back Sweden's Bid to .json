Still, new defense commitments to Kyiv have been announced the Lithuanian lowdown just ahead plus, Turkeys turn, Turkish President Erdogan suddenly dropping his opposition to Sweden's accession to NATO.

And it really dealt a serious financial and even symbolic blow to Moscow. But now we are learning from this research from Yale Professor Jeff Sommerfeld. That is some companies are still very much in Russia. Sommerfeld's research found that several consumer facing companies including Unilever, Philip Morris, Mondelez, Heineken, WeWork and Nestle. That all of them despite the fact that they promised to either completely get out of Russia or at least drastically scaled back their presence there. All of them are very much still inside of Russia. Now Sommerfeld told me that Heineken in particular is the poster child for this, even though Heineken promised to leave Russia. Here we are about 14 months later, and Heineken still has according to Yale, seven breweries in Russia, 1800 employees there. And Sommerfeld says that he wants consumers to realize that if they're supporting these brands, they are supporting something that fuels the Putin regime. He told me \"It's beyond disappointing. It's shameful and unethical. They're breaking their promises. They are functioning as wartime profiteers\". Now this research from Yale is based on whistleblowers, corporate documents on the ground experts, students who are even inside of Russia, and media reports. Many of the companies that were named by Yale who got back to us, as we reported on this, they did point out this issue that you flagged, Julia, which is that it's complicated. It's not easy to get out of Russia, there are regulatory restraints. Heineken, for example, told me that they think the war in Ukraine is a, \"Terrible human tragedy\". They say they are committed to getting out of Russia. They even have a deal to potentially sell their presence in Russia. But that deal has not gotten regulatory approval just yet, Julia.",

Now we know that there are other protesters elsewhere in the airport, as well as in cars walking the streets. And this is part of this national day of disruption protests began early this morning. They were at the Supreme Court. They were in the north of Israel. They've been in downtown Tel Aviv, and they're going to continue throughout the day. Now, we have been covering these protests now for months. But the reason that they have a renewed vigor to that today is because last night the coalition government push forward with the legislation of this judicial overall had been frozen for several months after that massive general strike in March. Shut down everything in the country, including the McDonald's. The Defense Minister has come out against the judicial overhaul. There have been attempts at negotiation, but those failed. And so now the coalition government, we have made the record in a piecemeal fashion, I apologize if it's getting super loud here. The protesters clearly are reacting to something we know there is a massive police presence here. So truffle back, somewhere in the crowd, the police are moving to arrest people, as you said, you know, there been more than 66 arrests. There have been at least a dozen injuries in light condition. But you can feel that the emotion and the intensity is definitely aping up here because of the legislation that was passed last night. Now it's just one aspect of this overhaul has to do with Supreme Court, and whether they can decide the government actions are unreasonable. But it almost doesn't matter what that legislation would have meant, because of this massive overhaul package for these protesters. That is unacceptable. And that's why they're coming out in force. And they're coming out so much to enforce some of them are even saying they're planning to fix in downtown Tel Aviv to really maintain an even more permanent residence. They say they don't plan on backing down until this traditional overall is completely off the table. But the coalition Benjamin Netanyahu that while they've changed aspects of that legislation they're pushing forward with it, Julia.",

Not more than we are doing. And secondly, he was able to get some language on the EU relationship, which remains to be seen what they mean. But it's a political signal that could be of some important further down the line. So yep, it was, as you said, bumpy that were a mild way of putting it. I agree with that.

This is the statement we had from them saying both parties so it and Vedanta which is the Indian company, it was partnering with mutually agreed to part ways. This is not a negative. There was recognition from both sides that the project wasn't moving fast enough. And they now say they will apply for a government program that subsidizes the setting up of a chip or electronics display factory. As you say the slight disappointment here is Foxconn does leave in its wake sort of trail of failed relationships. That sounds like a terrible boyfriend, isn't it? Really, if you look back at Wisconsin, the factory that Foxconn had promised back in 2017, that were going to be a $10 billion investment. Four years later, a few empty buildings and nothing else. And it all really collapsed. They signed a new deal with Wisconsin, but it was a fraction of that initial investment. And just a couple of weeks ago, there was that story about Lordstown Motors filing for bankruptcy and actually accusing their former partner and major shareholder Foxconn of helping their financial ruin. Foxconn denies this but there is no doubt that they do have this slightly awkward history now of some failed relationships.

And that's as we've been investing in robots. And so robotics just helps our employees do their jobs better. So behind me, you see both employees, and then there are robots that are moving the shelves around. And so what it used to happen be the employee would have to walk many miles a day. And now there's now the robots will bring the items to the employees. So they can focus on picking and stowing. And so it's that collaborative robotics that makes jobs safer, makes jobs more productive, and makes jobs easier that we're really focused on.",

But John, I have seen people referring to this as perhaps an eye into the future of what a unionized Amazon workforce would look like. How closely are you following that?

I think the last couple months haschanged a lot of people's thinking about what this could do is you said earlier, Amazon has been using AI for decades. And when I think about kind of my business, I've got a supply chain optimization technology team that has to manage kind of, we've got a catalog of over 400 million items. And so we're thinking about what is the forecasting, what is the buying that we need to do on 4 million items. And we have to do that every day. And so the AI that is used, there is going to be very deep, very impressive technology. We also think especially on Prime Day personalization, that it uses a lot of the AI technology that we have, and your website experience is going to be personalized to you even better than it was before because of AI technology. The robotics that we talked about, we've got 750,000 mobility robots running around the world. And that all uses AI technology for kind of how do we kind of synchronize them and get them moving in the right way. And then my last one that I get excited about is what we call fleet age, which is on our vans in our last mile fleet. And that helps our mapping and our routing. And so it is understanding kind of where we're doing. And then routing improvements just improves the fuel efficiency, improves the carbon impact that we have of our routing. So we're kind of AI, it's been amazing and incredibly helpful for us. And I agree with you kind of where we're going in the future. I think it's going to change the game for how you think about shopping, how you think about productivity, with software development, there's just a lot of goodness, that's going to be coming from that.",
