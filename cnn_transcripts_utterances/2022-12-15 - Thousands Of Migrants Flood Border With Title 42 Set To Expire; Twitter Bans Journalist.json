Politicians are pointing fingers and it's hard to know what to believe. So, CNN's Ed Lavandera went to Mexico to see firsthand the thousands of migrants waiting to get into the U.S.Officials say 2,500 people are crossing over into El Paso every day. And that number is expected to double next week when time runs out on a Trump era pandemic policy known as Title 42 which made it easier for officials to send asylum seekers back to Mexico. And it's not just Texas dealing with a mess at the border. In Arizona, take a look at this. The Republican governor has issued an executive order to use shipping containers to fill gaps in the border wall with Mexico, as you can see there. And now, the Justice Department is suing that state to try to remove those containers. And one Democratic mayor in Denver, more than 600 miles away from that El Paso border, is calling for a state of emergency tonight to deal with the hundreds of migrants who arrived in his city in just the past few days. And joining us now is that Denver mayor, Michael Hancock. Mayor, thanks so much for being with us. Why is it a state of emergency in your city?",

And so, we've had to open up two of our recreation centers, actually three, take them off line to our taxpaying citizens to help those who are coming into our cities as migrants and asylum seekers as well as to make public homes for assistance with our partners, our nonprofits and our faith leaders. So, it is stressing our system. It is a challenged time. What we saw was not the continued trickle. We saw a surge happen where we saw anywhere from, you know, 16 to 110 people show up, at one time, in one night, and that becomes a problem where we're trying to provide services to them.",

We don't have any sensible immigration policy.My call to them was -- again, mayors and cities bear the brunt of Congress's inability to act to continue to play politics and not do what's right in terms of city now negotiating a policy around immigration that makes sense. Once again, we have our cities all over this nation bear the burden of inactivity. So, we need federal government to act to address this crisis at our border and to make sure we have a policy that makes sense for those who are trying to come in U.S. but also to help those of us who are the ground trying to make accommodations for those who want to come to this nation seeking freedom and seeking opportunity.",

Great to have all of you guys here. Congressman, is this your fault? Meaning, Congress's fault? I mean, as the mayor was just saying, why can't Congress act? REP. ADRIANO ESPAILLAT (D-NY):  Well, I agree with the mayor. As an immigrant, I agree that we have not been able to come forward with comprehensive immigration reform. So, it's a crisis at the border. But it's a crisis in the hemisphere, a crisis of democracy. Most of the folks that are coming over are from Nicaragua and from Venezuela. Fleeing ruthless, thuggish regimes.

If there is a complete release and there is nothing in there, then it will cause people say, see, they are hiding something! They're hiding something. They didn't release the real stuff here. People are not going to believe it, but I think the original sin from this happens so, so long ago. What the CIA probably is keeping now is just this stuff that the CIA always --",

And nobody -- given the choice, nobody really wants to believe that some slump, you know, was solely responsible for killing the person that many regards as the most inspirational, charismatic, you know, president in American politics since Lincoln.
