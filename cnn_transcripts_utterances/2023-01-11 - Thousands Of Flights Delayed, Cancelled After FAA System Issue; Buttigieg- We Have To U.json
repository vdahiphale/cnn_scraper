      "sentences": "Hello, and welcome to Inside Politics. I'm John King in Washington. Thank you for sharing your day with us. Coast to coast chaos. A nationwide system outage delays every single morning flight across the country. Right now, yes, planes are back in the air but too little runway, too little airspace means thousands of travelers are stuck.Plus, court surprise. President Biden says he doesn't know how classified documents found their way into his private office. And enough, influential New York Republicans call for one of their own Congressman George Santos to resign that after a drip-by-drip dismantling of his campaign lies and shady accounting. We begin though with a morning of travel hell and demands that the government get its act together. The FAA says right now its flight control system is back online and it is working. But an early morning outage grounded all flights earlier today. In all, that means more than 6,000 flights were delayed and as a result, more than 1,000 were canceled. Today's masks comes of course, just weeks after the Southwest Airlines holiday season meltdown that led it to cancel 16,000 flights. So front and center, questions about the technology running America's airlines and its air traffic. Just moments ago, right here on CNN, the Biden Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, offering his first pass on an explanation of what happened. The secretary says, the CSI still ongoing.

CNN's Amara Walker joins us now live from the always busy Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson Airport. Amara, what do you see? AMARA WALKER, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CORRESPONDENT: Well, John, the FAA may have lifted its ground stop and operations, and many airports across the country are resuming as normal, including here at Atlanta International Airport. But of course, the delays and cancellations are continuing. There's a huge backlog of passengers who need to be rebooked on flights. As you mentioned, according to FlightAware, nearly 7,000 delays in airports across the country, including more than 1,000 cancellations. As you'd imagine a huge headache for so many passengers with a lot of them telling me what's on the back of their minds is the mayhem that some of them had to deal with over the holidays. And we saw the Southwest Airlines meltdown. Listen to what one passenger in Charlotte, North Carolina told us about missing her connecting flight or missing her flight in general. And now she won't be able to get to Costa Rica. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Richard, happy for your time today and your insights. So, is this a leadership question? Is this a technology question? Is it both? Why does this happen?RICHARD QUEST, CNN EDITOR-AT-LARGE: Oh, I don't know. And that's half the problem. You see the reality is there should be a ton of redundancy in the system as the secretary made clear and they need to look at what went wrong. Now, I'm not going in circles here, John, because the FAA has received billions of dollars in new generation investment. But it's all gone into things like air traffic management, spacing of aircraft, all the own route commands. The bit that's gone wrong here. The no towns is to an extent crucial and vital, but it's the Cinderella part of it. It's the bit where they tell I'm an pilots, you know, well, there's a runway out here. This ILS is broken there. You'll have to go slow over here. It's not the sort of own route bit, whichever where the attention has been. And that's going to be the core question. How did something as basic but crucial managed to fail? And when it did so, John, take the whole system down with it. KING: And so, in the early hours, we pressed for answers. And sometimes the answer you get today is a different answer than you'll get in a week or two when they actually have more data. But let's listen to the Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, this is on his watch. This is his department, he says, here's what we know so far. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Obviously, you want passenger safety, you want the safety, any new safety thing you can put into the system, you want put into the system right away.But in the digital age, where you can pick up your phone and find out where your package is that's being shipped from London to the United States, or from California to Costa Rica, and you can pick up your phone and see where it is. Why can't we do a better job of lining up the planes to get them to take off and as you note, having a plan B, a plan C and a plan D if you need redundancies?",

Absolutely, the U.S. has needed to update because not only do you need a safe system, which is what you've got, but you need an efficient system, one that can cope with the increased dramatic increase in capacity. So, billions are being spent. And arguably, it is not enough. That is the simple truth.No matter how much they're spending, they probably need to spend more because the system is groaning as anybody who's flown on a weekend, or the rush hour knows you're parked for miles in terms of planes waiting to take off. In terms of the no time in terms of the investigation, the fear, the worry, the concern will be that it was cyber. Now the secretary says there's no direct evidence.

It appears what this is, is simply, here's what we found attorney general, it's now in your hands, right? And so that's a big question for the attorney general. He could order a full-blown investigation where this definitely takes a lot longer to resolve.One of those paths, of course, could lead through a special counsel, which is a dirty word in for the White House, which is why I think you hear the president saying in Mexico City, you know, you're going to hear a lot more, everything's fine. You know, it's sort of suggesting that he believes they should be over soon. That might be wishful thinking, because certainly for the Justice Department, for the FBI, the question, I think is a lot more complicated. The issue is, you know, if they close this out, right? If they say, nothing to see here, then they're going to get killed by the Republicans on the Hill who say, well, you're treating him so much differently from Donald Trump. I mean, obviously, we know that there are two different circumstances much different. The other issue here, John is, you know, certainly for the FBI, I think one of the things they still have questions on is, you know, is it possible that there are other documents at other locations? And that's a big question. That's something that's still hanging over Donald Trump right now. And so, you know, should you do searches of other places that the president was hanging his hat during the time - during the last four years.",

I assume it starts with chain of custody, how long were these documents there? When were they removed from the government vault where they were supposed to be? And then what?CARRIE CORDERO, CNN LEGAL &amp; NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Right, so there's questions. And I think the time difference here is significant and makes it a little bit more complicated for the Justice Department and the FBI, because these are documents that came from the current president status when he was vice president. So, there's a gap of years. And what the FBI and the Justice Department want to know is, how did those documents get from where they were rightfully, originally during the Obama presidency? How did they get to the Biden office that he was using downtown? Who handled those documents? What happened to those documents when they were in that office? Did anybody ever see them? Was it a box that's been closed for years? Or was there someone who had access to them? Who are the people who had access to them? So, there is questions about who had access to the information that moved it into this unsecured location? And then who, if anybody? And the answer might be, no one had access to this classified information in the ensuing years.",

And I think that's a good example of, in terms of the politics here, obviously, we have talked at nauseam about the key factual differences between this case, and the case involving the former president.But I do think Democrats need to be careful about not being too much. There's nothing to see here. And I think the approach that, for example, Mark Warner, the Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, has been a measured and sober one. He does point out the differences between the two. But he also says, we're going to be briefed, this is a matter of national security, and we need to know what's going on.",

Why didn't you disclose this as soon as it happened? A, because it's important, and B, understanding the Trump politics. That is a very fair question. Why weren't they rated? Why didn't the FBI coming in?And then why did he on 60 minutes say, he criticized Donald Trump on the 60 minutes interview, but that interview was in November, the interview, I'm sorry, the interview was in September. The documents were found in November. So, we have no evidence that the president knew anything about it in a 60 minutes interview, but Kevin McCarthy doesn't care about the facts. NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, CNN SENIOR POLITICS ANALYST: That's right. And listen, politics often doesn't care about the facts or nuance and the key differences here, and that's why you see a Republicans really pouncing on this. And they're likely going to be more investigations from the House into this. It is inconvenient for this White House, for this president. It was a great contrast. I think if he had before, being the person who had all of this experience, and Donald Trump, obviously not having that experience in handling the documents in the way that he did. He wants to be on script as much as possible on this. I mean, when he was in Mexico, it almost looked like he was on script talking about it. So, they going to be careful.
