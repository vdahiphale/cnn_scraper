Now I should say that CNN has not been able to determine the source of the video or independently verify the video.

The search mission we know is underway. We have learned that so far, officials in Maui which is about 80 miles to the west of here from where we are have been waiting for the arrival of FEMA teams that are equipped with cadaver dogs. Those teams are going to be searching the inside of structures, those buildings have not yet been searched. So far the amount of people that have been recovered about 80 people who have lost their lives have been found on the outside of structures. Now, I do want to talk about that public road that we know opened yesterday to give residents a chance to get back into Lahaina. We know that residents are anxious to get back in to assess the damage. Unfortunately, soon after the road was opened, they had to close it back up because there was so much traffic and people trying to get into the area that officials decided it was better to just keep them away for now. But that is creating a lot of frustration because there are people that are trying to get back in, supporters and volunteers that are trying to bring supplies into the area. And that is really the biggest challenge right now in addition to the search and rescue mission that is underway. People are growing impatient, they are waiting for help and supplies to arrive.

And some critics are saying, you know, perhaps lives could have been saved had there been a siren warning sound outside.Earlier this morning, I spoke with Congresswoman Jill Tokuda. And she says the state underestimated how bad the fire would get. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JILL TOKUDA (D-HI): It's not like hurricane force winds are unknown to Hawaii or dry brush or red flag conditions, we saw this before in Lane. We did not learn our lesson from lane, that brush fires could erupt as a result of churning hurricane winds below us to the south. And I -- we underestimated the lethality, the quickness of fire.

BRYAN STERN, CO-FOUNDER, PROJECT DYNAMO: Yes. The -- we're doing -- we're doing -- we've done a lot of both. We've done a lot of humanitarian drops and a lot of rescue -- and a number of airborne rescues. We're going to do our start.

The -- as far as rescue operations go, it is slow going. There's a lot of -- we don't know -- we don't know who's trapped and who's not. And it seems that nobody really does.

Now Weiss is a Trump appointed U.S. attorney, he's been investigating Biden for five years. But the Justice Department has not put forth any official explanation for why he suddenly wanted to change his status and become a full blown Special Counsel. But there are some clues in the court documents, in court filings because on Friday court filings revealed that the plea agreement that had been reached between the U.S. attorney and Hunter Biden has fallen apart. They have reached an impasse after a judge expressed some concerns and had some questions about this plea deal. And after reaching this impasse, according to court filings, it appears that that case related to some tax charges and one charges related to gun possession could now go to trial. Now one of the big difference is, once you're a special counsel, not only can you bring a case in any jurisdiction, you also have to write a full report detailing your findings. And the Justice Department emphasizes that that will help with the transparency around this investigation. But it's not clear that Republicans on the Hill are going to see it that way. Because they've wanted Weiss to come and talk to them, testify, answer questions, and it's unclear how becoming a special counsel could impact his willingness to testify before them. We know that previous special counsels like Robert Mueller and John Durham have testified but only after their investigations and after they submitted their reports. Now, the sources tell CNN that the White House was not notified before the special counsel announcement, nor are Hunter Biden's lawyers. Amara, Rahel.",

And the judge in this case is really being firm on what Trump and his legal team can and cannot disclose about the case to the public. So Judge Tanya Chutkan, she issued a protective order and it lays out the Trump cannot disclose any sensitive information that's given to him and his team during discovery. So that includes material about the grand jury process or information from it or search warrants.And she also issued several warnings to Trump. She noted that even though he's running a political campaign, he still in her words, has to yield to the administration of justice. And she said if that means his political speech has to be somewhat limited, then that's the way it's going to be. She says she is carefully scrutinizing any statements that Trump and his team make. She says that anything that they say that can be interpreted to be intimidating to witnesses or prejudicial to potential jurors could really threaten this whole process. So under all of these terms, prosecutors are saying they're prepared to begin handing over material immediately. This includes 11.6 million pages of documents. It includes hundreds of recordings of witness interviews, which Trump of course will be prohibited from disclosing publicly. And we'll see how quickly this case could go to trial. The prosecution wants it to start January 2, Trump's legal team has to propose their start date sometime next week. And they'll likely propose it after the election. But really the rate that Judge Chutkan is moving here, she'll likely want to hew closer to the prosecution's proposed January date. So we'll see. Guys.",

But Ron DeSantis, of course, you know, punch back. He's announced that he's bringing about a dozen Iowa endorsers with him to the Iowa State Fair today. And that message is very much that it doesn't matter at this point what Floridians think, this is about the Iowa caucuses that are happening in January.It matters how Iowans feel about these candidates. And he's saying, look, I've got more endorsements here in the state than you do and I'm going to bring them with me to the Iowa State Fair. So we're seeing some of that back and forth. And I think it is true that Iowans, you know, care more about who people that they know and respect in the state are endorsing. You know, they're looking for guidance from, you know, some of their elected officials who really do have a lot of access to these candidates for what they think. So at the end of the day, we'll see how, you know, how meaningful endorsements really are. But we're seeing kind of that back and forth today. And as you heard, both of these candidates will be at the state fair at about the same time today. And so, Donald Trump is certainly known for spectacle in 2015 when he was campaigning, he came to the Iowa State Fair in a helicopter, he was giving out free helicopter rides to kids. So, we'll see if he tries to, you know, one up himself and create a bigger show today.",

She is not endorsing anyone, at least not just yet. She's getting attacks from Trump, as you heard from Kyung Lah's reporting, because of her neutrality. Will you expect candidates to take advantage of that?

You know, there was even a state senator who said he switched his endorsement from Donald Trump to Ron DeSantis because of those comments. You know, the governor here is really beloved among the Iowa Republicans.And so, it's an interesting choice to skip her fireside chat series that she's doing a series of Q&amp;A's with these candidates. But you know, I think Donald Trump has shown throughout this campaign that that he, you know, thinks he's bigger than that, he can draw these big crowds, he can create events for himself, and he's not necessarily willing to lend his, you know, star power as it were to some of these other events. And so, I don't know that that's necessarily a ticket, the governor, he travels with a lot of security that can make some of these smaller events more difficult. You know, he hasn't outlined exactly what he plans to do with the state fair today. But I expect that if he tries to move through the crowd at all, it's going to draw a pretty sizable group of people. I'm not sure exactly how that's going to go for him. So, it's an interesting choice. Governor, Kim Reynolds certainly has a lot of influence. And she's decided that she's not going to endorse this cycle. She thinks it's more important for Iowans to make that choice and for her not to tip the scales, maybe in favor of one candidate or the other Iowa Republicans. And I would Democrats agree, I think that, that this is a state where people should be able to come without a huge war chest, they should be able to have an even playing field and move the needle by shaking hands and doing the kinds of things that we're going to see today at the fair.",
