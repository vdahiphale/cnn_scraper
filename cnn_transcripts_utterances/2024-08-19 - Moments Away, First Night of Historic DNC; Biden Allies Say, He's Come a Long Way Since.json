Kamala Harris expected to make her first convention appearance as the man she replaced as the Democratic nominee, President Joe Biden, takes the stage.

You know, we're told vice president will appear with the president after he delivers his marquee speech tonight. So, just that emotion one can only imagine.And it is the highest profile opportunity yet for President Biden to address his party and the entire nation, as his long political career begins to wind. Down and Biden aides have told us, Wolf, that the president will use this speech to try to lay out his argument for why he supports Kamala Harris. He'll talk about the record that they've achieved and emphasize that it was done together. He'll stress the need to defeat Donald Trump. And then the spotlight will shift to Vice President Harris as she appears with the president on stage and that show of party unity for her historic presidential bid.

And we've just been talking to a lot of these delegates about how different this convention looks than it was just a month ago when the Democratic Party was finding itself in this existential crisis of what to do before Biden dropped out of this race.But now with his exit, it has totally changed everything that you are going to see at this convention, especially when it comes to the speakers. I mean, Vice President Harris will be entering this arena tonight in a very different capacity than she ever imagined over a month ago when Biden was still in the race. Now, she'll be in the audience watching as President Biden delivers his speech, passing the torch to her tonight, something that he told us earlier as he was doing his run through on stage that he is indeed ready to do. He said he expects this to be a memorable night. When he was asked if he's viewing it in a bittersweet lens, he said, no. He believes it's going to be memorable. And that is a speech, Wolf, that I am told by his closest advisers and allies that he has been working on, fine-tuning and crafting and obviously changing. Because now instead of making the case for his re- election, he'll be making the case for Vice President Harris' election to not just the delegates here, but everyone who is watching at home. And, Wolf, just in a sign of how they are treating this as a moment with a respectful nod to President Biden, I'm standing here in the Delaware delegation section. We are standing right here. Pennsylvania is right to my right, and that is a nod to President Biden. Typically, this would be where the nominee and their delegation would be. California is right over here to my right. Wolf, I will say, President Biden is a delegate for his home state, so he does have a seat designated for him, though we don't expect to see him given, of course. He has quite a large security contingent with him, with the Secret Service on stage. But, Wolf, I will say, you know, something that we've noticed and reporters certainly at the White House President Biden, since he announced his exit from this race, is kind of his mentality is how he's talking to reporters in a very loose and sometimes carefree kind of manner. Earlier when he was on stage and he was telling us the America will have to stay tuned for his speech, we asked him about, you know, former President Trump's insistence that is amounts to a coup, the fact that he is no longer the top of his ticket. He kind of just laughed and shook his hand and said that Donald Trump's stability is in question. We'll see what he says as he's making the case though in a vision for Vice President Harris in just a few hours, Wolf.",

But behind the scenes, it's clear that those hard feelings really do persist. And that's why I think all of the dynamics that we see play out on this stage are going to be very closely scrutinized and watched, because the reality is, compared to a Shiva, I mean, this is a straight up celebration.

And so I just think the fact of her presence is really important here is going to be, is going to be a powerful statement about the stakes of what's at stake here in terms of if Kamala Harris wins or if she loses. One other thing, you know, one of the subjects that I know she will talk about is the question of rights and freedom. And one of the strongest selling points that Democrats have is abortion and the overturning of Roe with the Dobbs decision.

She had, in fact, pushed aside the Joe Biden. She had been seen as, you know, waiting patiently in the wings. This is the first time in decades that the country is going to have an option of a presidential ticket without, you know, a Bush, a Clinton, or an Obama on there somewhere on one of the two major parties. And I think that's a big part of the energy in this room, because I have to say, I covered Hillary Clinton's campaign in 2016 on the plane.

Bush, his vice president, was coming in the old fashioned way, succeeding him, not, in a sense, pushing him out. And they had a turnover the next day at the airbase.

This has never happened, right, in my lifetime and people's long lifetime, third time, same Republican nominee, three elections in a row, three different Democratic candidates in each of those elections.So, what is this convention about? Protecting the 2020 map. If you just take a look at it, these are the three blue wall states, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, Georgia blue, Arizona blue. Why do we focus on those? Because Hillary Clinton, four years before in the first race against Donald Trump, lost all of those. Now, Arizona and Georgia were viewed as red states then. They were surprises in 2020. But the blue wall states are the backbone of any Democratic path to 270 electoral votes, and she lost them. Why? Why? Well, the third party candidates were one factor, but she also did not perform as well as Joe Biden did in 2020, when you come back to 2020, among white, blue collar workers. Joe Biden performed a little bit better. That was enough to flip those three states, the three blue wall states. Down in Georgia and Arizona, it's something different. It's the population shifts, it's the changes, it's the fast growing suburbs, it's more diversity, it's higher education. Those states, the Sun Belt states, you could add North Carolina there, it's been frustrating for Democrats. Obama won it with historic African-American turnout back in 2008. That's this one here, but you see, you know, it's been red since, right? So, the Democrats are looking at a map that demographically, the Sun Belt states are moving in their direction, but the Rust Belt states, the blue wall states, are actually getting older and whiter, which is more of a challenge. So, can Kamala Harris keep the Joe Biden map, or at least something close to it, or does she go back to the Hillary Clinton map? And one of the interesting things for me is, number one, can she keep senior citizens? That was a Biden question constituency. He performed better than blue collar white voters, right? She's going to perform better than Biden most likely among black women and probably black voters overall. Can she get young voters back the protests outside this arena, one of her problems in this convention.",

So that doesn't bode well for an Erie County, Luzerne, Lackawanna County, where Joe Biden did very well, those are the places where he did better than Hillary Clinton did. And I'd expect Kamala Harris will not do as well as Joe Biden in those counties, maybe in Northampton County. So, that's why I still think that Trump has the advantage in Pennsylvania.

You're going to win a state by 80,000 votes. You win that county by a little bit there. It's a challenge for her.He thinks she can't do it. I'm not sure we know the answer to that question.

I want to quickly listed in.MAYOR BRANDON JOHNSON (D), CHICAGO:  It's where Democrats will celebrate President Joe Biden and nominate Kamala Harris for president of the United States of America. As the son of a family that worked to make ends meet, I know that Kamala Harris, the daughter of a mom who worked hard every single day, she is going to look out for the interests of everyday people. I know that as a fellow former social studies teacher, that Governor Tim Walz will never shriek from standing up for our democracy and for those most in need. And as a Black man raising a little Black girl on the West Side of Chicago, I know that my daughter, Braedyn, will see not only a reflection of ourselves in the White House, but she will experience the deepest part of American values. Think about it, what will it take to build the middle class and make it easier for families not only to get by, but to get ahead? It will take someone with toughness to stand up for us and let me tell you, America, Kamala's got it. What will it take to defend our fundamental rights and our freedoms? It will take someone with leadership who would fight for us and let me tell you, America, leadership, Kamala, she's got it. And what will it take to defeat MAGA Republicans and move our country forward and not backwards? It will take everyone, and let me tell you all, Kamala, she's got us. From Mississippi so Pennsylvania to Delaware, Kamala Harris, she's got us. From Michigan to Wisconsin so Nevada to California, and right here in Illinois, Kamala Harris, she's got us. To the child care workers, to the tipped workers, Kamala Harris, she's got us. And to make sure that this country ensures that families will have access to real affordable housing, to create a pathway to the American Dream, Kamala Harris, she's got us. Together, we can build up better, brighter future. And there's no better place to start that, then right here is the greatest fricking city in the world, the city of Chicago. God bless you all.
