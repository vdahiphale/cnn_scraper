The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said at least 178 people have been killed since the truce ended. Despite the resumed fighting, a U.S. official said talks to release more hostages are ongoing. The IDF believes 136 people are still being held in Gaza, including 17 women and children. The families of three hostages have now confirmed that their loved ones died in Gaza. Sources tell CNN that both the U.S. and Israel fear young women abducted at the Nova music festival are among the remaining hostages. Hamas has been insisting they did not have any more nonmilitary female hostages to release. And hospitals in southern Gaza say Palestinian casualties have been mounting quickly since the truce ended early Friday. CNN's Matthew Chance has our report -- and a word of caution, some of the images are disturbing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This is what Israel vowed would happen if Hamas stopped releasing its hostages. After a seven-day pause and more than 100 freed, Gaza is being pounded again. Israeli officials say military pressure will force Hamas to release more.",

The world is on track for significantly more warming than the Paris agreements agreed to or aspired to get to in 2015.While there are commitments to cut emissions, there is record gas production and gas exploration -- oil and gas, that is, across the world. And it's that disconnect between what people are saying and what actions they are doing on the world stage. Of course, the COP28 is hosted by the United Arab Emirates, a significant oil and gas player. Some have pointed to the deep irony of that.
