I'm Amara Walker.President Biden is set to make his first trip as president to the southern border later today, the purpose behind his visit and what it could mean for U.S. immigration policies. Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin post a message to supporters as the NFL honors him in the first game since his collapse. We've got a look at the tributes. And more than half a million people across California are without power this morning as high winds and rain hammer the state. We've got a look at the forecast including where we could see record flooding. Plus, Harry tells all. The revelations in his forthcoming memoir coming up on CNN THIS MORNING. Welcome, everyone. It is Sunday, January 8th, a new week. Thank you so much for waking up with us here on CNN THIS MORNING. A lot of news to get to. Up first, President Biden heading for the border while the 118th Congress prepares to get down to business. The president stops in El Paso, Texas, today on his way to a summit in Mexico City. This will be his first visit to the border during his presidency. The administration is under fire from Republicans and some Democrats over the migrant crisis along the southern border as the surge continues. The border crisis is one of the issues House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and Republicans are vowing to tackle now that they are in control of the House. First they have to set a new set of House rules. That is at the top of the to-do list when the House convenes tomorrow at 5:00 p.m. Now, President Biden will get an update on the migrant crisis when he visits the border today. White House correspondent Arlette Saenz has more.",

The president will also be joined on this trip by Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. And officials have also said he -- the president wants to learn more about the efforts to stem fentanyl flow into the country. Now, this all comes as the president has faced pressure not just to visit the border but also address these issues regarding the border as it has quickly become a political liability for President Biden. The Texas governor, a Republican, Greg Abbott, said that it's about time that President Biden paid that visit down to the U.S./Mexico border. But on the other hand, the president has also accused Republicans of engaging in demagoguery, saying that they need to come to the table to pass comprehensive immigration reform, which this White House says is the only way to fully ease these issues relating to the border. Now, earlier this week President Biden did announce a new expansion of a migration program. The U.S. will be expanding the Humanitarian Parole Program for four countries, Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela, allowing up to 30,000 migrants each month to apply to come to the U.S. from those countries through that program. But it also includes plans to expedite expelling those migrants who come from those countries but have not applied through those legal processes to get here. Now, after this trip down to the U.S./Mexico border in El Paso, President Biden will travel down to Mexico City for the North American Leaders Summit. It is there where he will meet with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and also Mexican President Manuel Lopez Obrador, who is a key partner when it comes to addressing these issues of migration. The White House says that migration is not the only topic that will be discussed at the summit. They will also be talking about security and other economic issues as well.

Here is a look at all of the rainfall totals that we've had for some big cities just since the beginning of the year. San Francisco Airport picking up over six inches, Sacramento over four, even Los Angeles picking up over two inches which under La Nina advisory it is very rare for southern California in a La Nina year to pick up significant amounts of moisture. For today, the bulk of the rain is really going to be focused over northern and central portions of California before continuing to push into the Intermountain West. Because we are talking about a significant amount of rain on top of many inches of rain just over the last two weeks, we do have flood watches in effect. And you see for a lot of areas here totaling over 15 million people under just that watch alone. As we push this forward, again, you start to see that second wave begin to enter as early as this evening, and it will continue through the day Monday and for some areas even into Tuesday as well before another round pushes in in the latter half of the week. Overall when we talk about additional rainfall amounts, you're talking widespread four to six inches.

So, it is unfortunately rather one-sided.One thing I will say is that we don't hear publicly but that is being said and you can -- you can really see it on his faces that Prince Charles is on the outside coping very well, but anxious inside of the woods. And I will quote Jonathan Dimbleby who, of course, Prince Charles interviewed with who had said that, of course, he's saddened by this. And Prince Charles is a very gentle soul who wants to be reconciled with his son.",

One was the privacy, but then moving to LA and hiring PR firms. And the second was for the safety of his family, which we can all relate to. I think many people will concern for him and his children.

But, you know, since it was, all the Chiefs needed to do was beat the Raiders yesterday and they would earn that one seed and buy in the first round in AFC playoffs. And the Chiefs just toying with the Raiders in this one. Look at that. at one point, they played Ring Around The Rosie before Patrick Mahomes would end up getting this ball back on this play. He would throw a touchdown to Kadarius Toney. The play was actually unfortunately called back for holding, but the Chiefs still want easily 31 to 13. So, the Chiefs are the one seed, but since that Bills-Bengals game was canceled, if the Bills went today and then meet the Chiefs in the AFC title game, that game is going to played at a neutral site despite the Chiefs having that top seat. The Jaguars, meanwhile, completing the journey of going from worst to first. Under three to go in this game against the Titans, Josh Allen gets his fumble recovery. He's going to take it for a touchdown to beat Tennessee 20 to 16 and win the AFC South Division. The Jags is the second team ever to start the season three and seven and end up making the playoffs.
