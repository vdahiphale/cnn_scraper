But first, we're going to bring with -- bring in the breaking news out of Russia. That is that a military plane carrying 74 people has crashed near the border with Ukraine. It's according to Russian media.The governor of Belgorod, where the plane went down, says all on board were killed. Social media video shows the plane going down and bursting into a fireball. Russian news agencies quote the defense ministry, which says 65 of those on board were Ukrainian troops heading for a prisoner swap. Ukraine is investigating those claims, but earlier said the plane was carrying missiles for an air defense system. CNN's Fred Pleitgen has the latest details for us from Eastern Ukraine. Are you getting a better picture, Fred, of what actually happened?",

      "sentences": "Well, we're at least getting a better picture, or more of a picture of -- the accusations at this point in time. I mean, one of the things that we're certainly seeing is that this was a major incident that took place with that plane crash.Just alluding, Max, to that social media video that we've been seeing of the plane as it was going down and then that big fireball that appeared shortly afterwards. And you're absolutely right, the governor of the Belgorod region, he came out and he said that no one survived that plane crash. However, then we get to accusations and counter accusations that have been going on between the Russians and the Ukrainians. You were just noting that the Russian Defense Ministry came out and said that the plane was taken down by the Ukrainians, that it was a Ukrainian surface to air missile system. The Russian Defense Ministry claims that took that plane down and that those missiles, the surface air missiles were fired from near the Russian border, very close to the Russian border. Now, the Ukrainians so far have not commented on the matter. They certainly haven't said that they would have been responsible for taking this plane down. But you are right that there was Ukrainian state media that came out earlier, citing defense ministry sources saying that the Russian plane was allegedly carrying surface to air missiles itself called the S- 300, which the Russians do sometimes use from the Belgorod region to shell areas within Ukraine. Now, the Russians are saying that there were 65 POWs onboard that plane, Ukrainian POWs, that were supposed to be flown to a prisoner exchange with the Ukrainian side. The Ukrainians also not commenting widely on that. However, they have now confirmed that there was a prisoner exchange, a large one that was supposed to take place today, and that that prisoner exchange is now not happening. In other words, that it has been called off. So there might be some of these things that are becoming a little bit more clear. However, at this point in time, it is still very early to say, as you've noted, the investigation into all of this is still going on right now. However, the local authorities, the local governor of that region confirming that no one has indeed survived that plane crash, which once again, we did see on that video. The plane coming down, seemingly out of control, then impacting on the ground. And then that giant explosion, that fireball and that smoke appearing in what was that major crash that happened to the northeast in a very rural area around the town of Belgorod. The Russian authorities also saying that apparently at least no one on the ground suffered any injuries, Max.",

That until there is an Israeli government and a prime minister that's willing to accept that sort of language and that sort of diplomacy, then all the things that might flow from there are essentially on hold. And I think the understanding in the region is this is something that Israel will want. This is something that will do Israel benefit in the long term, but it's not something that the Prime Minister Netanyahu will consider because he's had very clear warnings from members of his coalition government. Itamar Ben-Gvir was the latest saying, you know, if you move in that direction, any kind of deal over hostages, any kind of deal to end the fighting, I'm out of the government, which collapses the government. And the polling all indicates Prime Minister Netanyahu would not win a reelection, so there's no incentive for him to soften his position.

And then as you see here, the aircraft appears to be headed down. And then we'll see fireball of pretty severe it is, that could actually, you know, indicate not only the actual impact of the crash, but before that, there might have been a puff of smoke that was consistent with a missile shooting down this aircraft, whether it was a Ukrainian missile or a Russian missile. Of course, we don't know, but that is the kind of thing that could happen. As far as what it means, it could very well be a, you know, a significant interdiction of Russian arms shipments. The plane have been used to transport weapons from a place like Iran, there's some speculation on social media. That this tail number that is assigned to this aircraft was last seen in Iran before coming back into Russia.

This marks the first time in the modern era that a non-incumbent Republican candidate was victorious in both the first two nominating contests. With the majority of the votes in New Hampshire counted, the former U.S. president beat his last challenger standing, that's Nikki Haley, of course, by just over 10 percentage points. During his long and rambling victory speech, he appeared agitated over Haley's refusal to drop out of the race and encouraged two former Republican rivals turned supporters to attack her whilst on stage. Haley got in some swipes as well, suggesting Trump's too old and is a loser. She's vowing to carry her campaign to her home state of South Carolina, which holds its primary in a month.

And they're showing that he had in Iowa a couple of days ago and perhaps any other wins that he might be able to rack up over the next several months are going to translate into the general election.And we have a little bit of evidence so far about how voters are feeling. For example, Nikki Haley, a significant share of her supporters here last night were independent, undeclared voters. So while Trump has the support of Republicans, he doesn't have the support of everybody. And then, of course, there's the other major Trump factor, which is the fact that he's got four different legal cases against him and he's facing 91 charges. However, there are some polls that give us an idea about how voters are feeling. About half of New Hampshire voters told us that they would still find Trump to be fit for president, even if he were to be convicted of a crime. That is according to our CNN polling. So it is likely and judging from last night's speech that he made that we are going to see a bit of a return to a vintage Trump where he attacks his critics, attacks his opponents. He mocks them on the campaign trail, and he is likely going to bring this campaign trail right into the courtroom, which is what he's been doing over the last several weeks as we geared up towards Iowa and New Hampshire. He's been sitting in a New York City courtroom listening to testimony from E. Jean Carroll, even though he is not technically required to be there. But it is clearly part of his political strategy to make this a centerpiece of his campaign. Max?",

In fact, in anticipation of going to South Carolina, the campaign bought a significant amounts of airspace in that state, which, as you know, is very expensive.So the campaign not necessarily struggling for dollars just yet, but we are far and away from a Super Tuesday, from other key elections in this process where Haley is going to need a lot of support. So that's going to be a key question here. One of Haley's key donors is the owner of Home Depot here in the United States. He had said that he planned on making a significant contribution to her campaign if she was able to pull off a win here in New Hampshire. But for some of these millionaire and billionaire donors, for anyone that might be donating to a Super PAC, it becomes more and more, you know, harder to convince them that they should continue to devote their resources to a candidate that just doesn't really appear to stand a chance throughout the next few months.",
