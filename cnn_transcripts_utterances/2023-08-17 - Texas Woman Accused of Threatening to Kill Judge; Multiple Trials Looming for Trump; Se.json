This is what we know.Police say a Trump supporter in Texas is in custody after she allegedly threatened to kill the judge presiding over the 2020 federal election case if Trump does not get elected in 2024. In Georgia, new concern for the grand jurors who just issued an indictment against Trump. Photographs, social media profiles, even some of their purported home addresses published on sites, including forums previously linked to violent extremist attacks. Experts tell us that some anonymous users are calling for violence against these grand jurors. Now, this comes as Trump and his accused co-conspirators have eight days to surrender at a jail in Atlanta, which is where we find CNN's Nick Valencia right now. And, Nick, these threats are of serious concern.",

A Texas woman is now in custody after threatening to kill a judge who's overseeing Trump's federal election case. The judge, who is black, received the phone call in his judge's chambers on August 5th with the call allegedly saying, \"you are in our sights, we want to kill you.\" The call also allegedly included some racist comments. It was on August 8th when special agents with the Department of Homeland Security caught up with the woman. She's now currently in pre-trial detention.Meanwhile, here in Georgia, some far right users online are calling for violence against some of those Fulton County grand jurors. Overnight, posts from their social media profiles, photos, also even home addresses of some of the grand jurors reportedly be - to be connected to some of those grand jurors found their way online. CNN cannot independently verify those posts, and we're not naming the websites where they appeared. None of the grand jurors have spoken publicly so far about the process. And we should mention, as part of Georgia law, their names were made public as part of that indictment.

We have seen this before. Cesar Sayoc put 16 IEDs in the mail in his support of President Trump. We saw Ricky Shiffer take it upon himself to attack an FBI office with a nail gun that ultimately led to his death. So, as these trials progress, there's more media coverage of them. The president's fate gets closer to being determined in any one of these cases.

We know from the testimony we've heard from many of the January 6th defendants, we know from the things that people who have been arrested for engaging in this activity have said, they hear statements like that and they think of them as a signal to them to start taking action. This is similar to the comment in the presidential debates - presidential debate, to the extremists the president said, stand back and stand by. We know from watching social media traffic that many of his most extreme supporters saw that as a message to -- that he was calling their attention, that he was telling them to stand by to take action. We know that his -- the infamous tweet about the -- in advance of the January 6th riots was the thing that motivated so many of those January 6th defendants to come to D.C. Come to D.C., it'll be wild, the president stated to that -- words to that effect. So, this happens before. They hear his - they have listened very closely to his comments and they take it as a message or a signal to take action.

I do think there is time to try two, at least, of the major cases. Of those, the first of the criminal ones is Jack Smith's, which is requested for January. My view is that Judge Chutkan, in D.C., because of the preeminent importance and the federal statute, Kate, the speedy trial act, says the public interest must be taken into account, that case will be set. Alvin Bragg has already said that in the interest of justice he's willing to flex his calendar. That might mean he would make room for the Jack Smith case. It might mean he would make room for the Fani Willis case. We have to be realistic about that Georgia case. And I think it is good to have a case that is as large as the alleged conspiracy itself, but with 19 defendants will we really be able to get that to trial by March? We'll see.",

Also just - I'm just being told in my ear that CNN has learned that Donald Trump is expected to surrender in the Georgia case - to surrender to fact those charges next week. The deadline is the end of next week to surrender, but that gives some window into he's not likely to be surrendering to authorities today or tomorrow.But on the Georgia indictment, it has been described as a tight timeline when you're talking about 19 defendants and you're talking about a racketeering case. What is your view on that? I mean do you think the Georgia trial, there's a possibility it could start on the March 4th date as requested?",

The realistic assessment, though, is you have three prior cases that have been stacked up on the criminal side alone, put aside the two major civil cases, the civil fraud case in New York set for this year, and the second defamation trial of E. Jean Carroll set for early next year. You already have three important criminal cases, the Mar-a-Lago case, the Alvin Bragg, 2016 election interference case where the allegation is that the former president falsified documents to cover up hush money payments to avoid a 2016 election scandal and, of course, the Jack Smith federal case.So, my guess is that that Georgia case, it's good for the DA to be aggressive. If it were the only case, it probably could go in March. But my guess is that we'll see some slippage there. The place where I don't think we'll see a lot of slippage is the federal January 6th case. It's lean and mean. It names Trump only. Smith designed it to go fast. And I think it is going to go fast. And that's going to set the tone for the rest. Fani Willis probably wants that case to go first and fast because it sets the tone for her more sweeping 19 defendant case.",

The confirmed death toll has now climbed to 111. And the process of identifying the dead has proven a slow, delicate, and very tough task. Just nine people have been identified by authorities as of this morning. And putting names to other victims could take months. The names of just five of the nine identified have been publiclyreleased. They range in age from 71 to 90 years old. And we're learning just a little bit about their lives today. Buddy Jantoc, he's among them. He was a musician who sang, he played drums and guitar and even toured with the band Santana. Melva Benjamin is another one of the victims who has been identified. She was a beloved grandmother. The other names released so far, Robert Dyckman, Virginia Dofa, and Alfredo Galinato. Today, crews continue to comb through the rubble and the ash to try to find more people. So far they have only searched about 38 percent of the fire zone. So far to go.

There are more than 40 cadaver dogs that are on the mission to find any remains that can be salvaged. And the police chief yesterday told us it is one of the worst scenes he has ever seen. It is catastrophic. The governor has compared it to searching through a war zone or the remains at Ground Zero after 911. As you said, only 38 percent of the area has been covered. So, they are working nonstop to finish that process. In the meantime, the people of Lahaina here are asking for answers. They want to know why the alarm system was not deployed.

And according to \"The Journal\" it wasn't until 2022 that it sought state approval to raise rates to pay for safety improvements. But that has not yet been approved. CNN has reached out to Hawaii Electric for comment. The power utility is now facing a lawsuit, saying the power lines were in part to blame for the spread of the fires.
