      "sentences": "Hello, and welcome to Inside Politics. I'm John King in Washington. Thank you for sharing your day with us. Digital breakdown, Ron DeSantis starts his 2024 campaign with embarrassing technical dysfunction. When we could hear him, he sees abortion and spending as clear contrast with Donald Trump, and says, he will not be timid in using presidential power to get what he wants and to punish those he doesn't like.Plus, right now, a sentencing hearing underway here in Washington. A federal judge deciding how long couponers (Ph) Oath Keepers convicted of January 6 related crimes will spend behind bars. And your Congress not at work. The government could default on its bills as soon as one week from today. But the House speaker sends lawmakers home because negotiations are moving so slowly. Up first for us though, a day too riddled for Governor Ron DeSantis. How to prove to voters, to donors and well, maybe to everyone that he's ready for primetime. The governor now plotting a campaign kickoff tour through the early voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. That a traditional early state blitz and one his team hopes, hopes a race is some of the basic competence questions raised by his error 404 riddled unconventional campaign debut. DeSantis bet on Elon Musk, and he bet on Twitter and its spaces platform and that turned out to be a very bad bet. Many people who wanted to listen last night couldn't or had to join in progress because it took so long to decipher just where and just how to tune in. The glitchy from the go launch was followed by interviews and more familiar haunts Fox and conservative talk radio. In those, we did get a very clear sense of how DeSantis plans to differentiate himself from the front runner Donald Trump. And we heard an unapologetic test the guardrails DeSantis take on the use of executive power. Let's begin in Miami with CNN's Steve Contorno. Steve, day two trying to get back on track.",

But they remain very bullish on Governor DeSantis. And they have a lot of reasons to be, he has a ton of money.He's here in Miami today or he's going to be here in Miami today, raising even more money. They're being told it's time to start dialing for dollars. And they expect to bring in. They've already brought in $1 million, they say, and they expect that amount to continue to grow in the days ahead. And they believe they have a compelling message that they are -- have a candidate who has shown that he can get things done. He has pushed through a very conservative agenda in Florida, a six- week abortion ban, getting rid of concealed carry permits in Florida, forcing to get more restrictions on how transgender people can get healthcare. All of these things they feel like are, they bring -- they can bring to this fight and really start illogical race and make this about issues that are animating Republican voters right now. Now, of course, Donald Trump has spent the last 24 hours gloating online about DeSantis's performance, but DeSantis is ready to sort of move ahead. You've heard him, take some -- make some very sharp contrasts with the former presidents in this blitz of conservative media that he's going through. He had appearances last night with Trey Gowdy and Mark Levin, where he talked a lot about the spending under President Obama, and saying, that he would be a more fiscally conservative president if he were reelected. So, we're starting to see DeSantis come out of his box a little bit, sharpen his attacks against President Trump. And we'll see if he continues that next week on the campaign trail as well.",

I think that, you know, there was moments of silence, there was an echo, it was uncomfortable for people who are listening. And you really didn't get much out of the announcement. And even afterwards, with the conversation between Elon Musk, there was no real substance. It seemed at some points Musk was talking about himself for a very long period of time in Twitter.But I do think that down the road, it doesn't actually matter to voters. One of the things that we have realized from 2016 and from Donald Trump is that all of the things that we once thought were so important, really aren't to the American people. And I believe that one of them is this presidential announcement. Sure, it didn't go the same exact way people want it to go, DeSantis wanted it to go, but doesn't really matter. I'm just not sure it does.",

So, he really -- Governor DeSantis really missed that chance to have that first image of being introduced to the American people, as a presidential candidate to have the big rally with the people behind him and the American flag, sort of like what we saw with Senator Tim Scott earlier this week.We just kind of, we didn't even see anything. We kind of heard this glitchy audio just sounded like a an out of station, radio station or whatnot. But ultimately, at the end of the day, I mean, what I'm watching right now is first of all, they touted after the Twitter's faces event that they've at least raised a million dollars in the first hour. So, I'm watching the fundraising numbers. For comparison, Tim Scott raised about 2 million in the first 24 hours.

We don't know the answer to this question that he can campaign mostly, go to the traditional states and do your events and spend most of your media time in the conservative media silo.He mocks mainstream media all the time. He says, we're not objective and all that. We'll see if that can play out. But we did learn a lot last night about who he is. We'll get a bit later in the program to some contrast, direct contrast with Trump and others in the Republican race, but about who he is. And listen to him here. Republicans like to say that the Justice Department, the FBI are weaponized against them. Chris Wray, Trump appointed FBI director, you get a 10-year term, Ron DeSantis has made me president, he's gone. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: No, I would not keep Chris raised Director of the FBI. There'll be a new one on day one. I think the DOJ and FBI have lost their way. I think that they've been weaponized against Americans who think like me and you. Republican presidents have accepted the canard that the DOJ and FBI are \"independent.\" They are not independent agencies. They are part of the executive branch.

So, he's been able to get things through the legislative process.If he gets to the presidency, he's not going to have a supermajority. And so, we're already starting to see him talk about, using executive authority to fire the FBI director, to tell the DOJ that it's a new day and the president is going to tell you how to operate as the ones independent Department of Justice and use other executive authority. That's one of the things he's saying that he's going to be different than Trump in terms of being able to use the levers of power, as president to be able to push forward a number of different things in advance in agenda without using Congress because we know how dysfunctional Congress can be at times.",

And it means that Rhodes can face a longer sentence than the crimes he's convicted of on their face. They can be given a harsher penalty. So seditious conspiracy is that main conviction that he has there. And we've already heard some harsh words about what Rhodes is did on January 6 and in the planning. Before that, he was just saying in court, that Rhodes was calculating. He was planning. There was a specific purpose. And he was targeting an institution of American democracy at its most important moment. Some of the things that Rhodes was saying, he was talking about bloody revolution and civil war, that those are the sorts of words that led the judge to find that he could be qualified as someone who was committing domestic terrorism on January 6. And you're right, he has not said any remorse. The judge noted that he has not had a single message of her regret in many, many messages he has sent and that the Justice Department has documented in this case since January 6. And just now as we speak, Stewart Rhodes appears to be still addressing the court and what he started with saying, the first thing he said when he stood up there, my colleague, Hannah Rabinowitz just captured it. He said, he's a political prisoner. And like Donald Trump, the only crime he has committed is destroying, opposing people who were destroying the country. He continues to speak.
