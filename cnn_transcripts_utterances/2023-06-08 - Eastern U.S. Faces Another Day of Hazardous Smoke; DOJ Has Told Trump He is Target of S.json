This is a sign that prosecutors could be moving closer to indicting Trump, that he was informed about this through what is called a target letter that his lawyers received. Multiple sources have had that letter described them, but not of our sources have personally seen this target letter.Now, most the time when you receive a target letter, it means that you can, if you would like, appear before a grand jury, though it's unclear if the former president would avail himself of that option. We know the former president's lawyers met with the Justice Department earlier this week, and he has repeatedly insisted that he has done nothing wrong. The fact that he has been informed that he is a target of this investigation, it's clear that the prosecutors are looking not just at the people around him, but they are specifically looking at the former president. Now, in the other special counsel investigation into the events surrounding January 6th, we have learned that longtime Trump ally and former White House advisor Steve Bannon has been subpoenaed to testify in that probe. Though it's unclear how cooperative he'll be as a witness. He's currently facing prison time for being held in contempt of Congress. Now, for a more cooperative witness, we've also learned that Alyssa Farah Griffin has been talking to investigators. She sat for a voluntary interview where she was questioned at length. We have learned from former President Trump's state of mind, the extent to which he truly believed the lies he was pushing in around January 6th. It is a sign that investigators are still focused on Trump's mindset in and around January 6th. It also shows that the January 6th investigation is likely not quite as far along as the other special counsel investigation into the possible mishandling of classified documents.

When there's an investigation, a grand jury is convened. A grand jury generally consisting of 23 people on a majority, a majority, right, that means 12, are needed to vote out an indictment.The grand jury process is not predicated on proof beyond a reasonable doubt and you just have to establish in the grand jury that there's reasons to believe a crime is committed and the subject or target of that investigation committed it, and therefore, as a prosecutor, you put forth various facts, evidence by virtue of witnesses, documents, et cetera. And then you move to have the grand jury generally hears from. The grand jury is here from witnesses on one hand, those people who are possessive of knowledge and information relevant to that grand jury inquiry. On the other side of that is a specific target to your question of the investigation. That is the person about whom you believe you engage in criminality. So, a target means that there's substantial evidence, which would indicate that a crime would be committed. In the middle of that, you have a subject of the investigation and so, although he's the target, they can be multiple targets, right? The issue is, if you are subject to the investigation -- are you a witness? Are you a target? We're not sure. So those are three categories, the target being the worst. That's the person who we are looking to indict and move forward again. So, if you've got that target letter, Christine, what it essentially means that you could be indicted. We know the Trump lawyers have met with the Department of Justice as a very significant development.",

As a defense attorney, what you have to do is to assess the realities and whether or not you should put your client before a grand jury.The first thing you do, is what the Trump team did, and that's the going to try to convince the Department of Justice that, hey, maybe there's another way. Our client is not guilty of these crimes. There have been prosecutorial misconduct, was the alleged accusations that they have been making. We have known specifically what occurred. There were reports of that occurred. I believe that, so far, that's been unpersuasive, and if you have any other information, you would give that to federal prosecutors. They would consider. Thereafter, however, you certainly have a right to appear before the grand jury, but you waive immunity. Remember, Christine, we have a Fifth Amendment right against self incrimination. That means, generally, defendants don't say anything at all. Of course, Trump is on record having said a number of things pertaining to this. I think when you're in a hole, the conventional wisdom is you stop digging, and I think his attorneys will stop digging right now and not put him before a grand jury.",

We've heard from him many times.But what could be the reason beside a possible indictment that Trump would be informed he's the target in the probe? JACKSON:  Yeah. I think that is the essence of it. I mean, the reality is, is that the Department of Justice has specific guidance as it relates to informing people that they are targets and permitting to have the opportunity to testify before grand jury. And so, really, a target letter which gives the indication that you are a target speaks to the issues of concerns, and the government is really a precursor, Christine, to an actual indictment. Again, indictment, not proof of, guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, but it is proof that the department of justice believes that you're guilty of a crime, beyond reasonable doubt, and it would seem to me that if evidence have been presented, right, to the special counsel since November of last year, you know, the indictment may very well be imminent and or on the verge of significant history here.",

We had a fairly extensive briefing from the surgeon who took -- took charge of the pope yesterday, and he told us -- Dr. Alfieri, told us that, in fact, the pope responded to the anesthesia just fine and to the operation and came out of the operation joking. He said, the pope at one point said, that he was -- felt well, and the doctor told me that he wouldn't be lifting weights anytime soon. The pope said in response, I don't lift weights. So in any case he still has a sense of humor after the operation. And I think, you know, this is the kind of thing that doctors are watching carefully, the Vatican has just -- as a matter of precaution has basically canceled all people events for the next ten days till the 18th of June. Then after that we will see, they're concerned because the pope has a busy schedule come up in August, including a trip to Portugal for the World Youth Days, it's a very demanding schedule, and later on a trip to Mongolia.
