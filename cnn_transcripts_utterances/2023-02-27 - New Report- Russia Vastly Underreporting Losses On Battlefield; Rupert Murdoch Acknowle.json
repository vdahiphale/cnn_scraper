And that's not all he's confessing as Fox fights a $1.6 billion lawsuit. And an OUTFRONT investigation tonight, our David Culver traveled to the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak, as the U.S. Department of Energy in a new report says the virus likely leaked out of that lab in Wuhan, China. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, exclusive new information about Putin's staggering losses. Russia has now suffered more combat deaths in Ukraine than in all of its wars combined since World War II. This is according to a new analysis by the group CSIS, which has been tracking Putin's movements since before the war. You'll remember, we were bringing you those satellite images every day as the buildup happened. The number of Russian deaths per month now, they say, is 25 times higher than it was in Chechnya, 35 times the number killed in Afghanistan. In a moment, we're going to have much more on this new analysis. I also want to bring you tonight the new video we have into OUTFRONT that clearly shows the brutal and bloody battle going on the front lines now, where all this death is happening. Here's a Russian tank being attacked near Vuhledar. Within seconds, the two men who survived take cover in another burnt-out tank. Ukraine spots that, and that tank is hit again. And then watch as this Russian tank on the horizon is destroyed by a Ukrainian strike. All of this filmed. You can actually see that tank operator running for his life, literally running for his life. And the Russian fighters on the front line, they know this is happening. See the death, the death of their peers and they're angry that they're being sent to the slaughter. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RUSSIAN FIGHTER (through translator):  All we have are small arms and shovels, which just ended up with us getting massacred. We've suffered losses, both dead and wounded. We are simple laymen with civilian jobs. And now they want to send us back out for another assault back to these fortified areas. In the 21st century, the greatest, strongest army of the world is sending people who responded to the call to defend their homeland like cattle to the slaughter. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

This has been going on for months.This was a city. A year ago, it had a population of 73,000 people. The Ukrainian commander there posting on telegram that little will be left of Bakhmut and that, quote, Wagner fighters are attacking in all directions. Little will be left. Little is left. Another commander on the ground posted this video. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UKRAINIAN COMMANDER (through translator):  They want to encircle us.

Today was the day of the special operations forces here in Russia, and Putin addressed Russia's special operations forces praising how they're fighting, the way he calls, the special military operation, and saying that they were protecting the Russian nation and Russian lands.

Thank you so much, Fred, live from Moscow tonight.And, now, Seth Jones, director of the International Security Program at the CFIS, the Center for Strategic and International Studies. He was an adviser to the commanding general of U.S. Special Operations Forces in Afghanistan and he wrote the new report that we mentioned at the top of the program. Also with me, retired Army Lieutenant General Ben Hodges, the former commanding general of the U.S. Army Europe, who spent a long time training Ukrainian troops. So, thanks to both. So, Seth, I want to start with you in new report, because you said the U.S. government was shocked at your finding, and obviously, you've been doing so much tracking of this, and troop buildups and satellites, since the beginning of the war, actually, since well before the beginning of the way. You found a number of Russian soldiers killed so far as good in the entire number of Russian soldiers killed in always combined since World War II. Can Putin continue at this pace? SETH JONES, DIRECTOR, INTERNATIONAL SECURITY PROGRAM, CENTER FOR STRATEGIC &amp; INTERNATIONAL STUDIES:  Well, that's unclear, Erin. He is going through Russian soldiers at an astounding rate. As our data shows, there are more dead Russian soldiers than all of those wars since World War II combined. That includes Afghanistan in the 1980s, that includes Chechnya in 2000s, that includes even the first couple of years of Ukraine and Syria, Czechoslovakia and Hungary. So, Russia has not had to suffer these kinds of losses since World War II. Part of the answer depends on how much he can continue to lie and get away with it to his population, and his security service can continue to crack down on this population. But every day that goes by, it's going to be a more difficult job for Putin to keep the lid on the opposition.",

When Russian forces are wounded, they're not coming back to the battlefield. They don't want to. Understandable.But in Ukrainian case, much higher numbers -- are also seeing a lot more innovation among Ukrainian forces and how they're using drones, not just the way I use them when I was in the government for strike or intelligence and surveillance, but for electronic warfare, for targeting, for artillery, and a range of other ways. The software they put together -- just innovation in many ways that shows they are a learning organization in ways that the Russian military is not right now.",

I mean, in places like Bakhmut, it changes by a tenth of a percent over days. Thousands of lives are lost for that one tenth of a percent that then goes the other way a day later.

That area is important, but it's not strategic. It's not decisive.Yet, the Russians are willing to spend thousands of soldiers to take a town that, if Ukraine loses, it will only move the line a little bit further West. What really matters, of course, is Crimea. Without Crimea, Ukraine will never be safe or secure, and more importantly, it will never be able to rebuild its economy. And big investors will not invest any Marshall Plan if there's no ironclad security guarantee for Ukraine. So, Crimea is the place. I think the general staff knows that. So they're building up an armored force they will use later, I think, May, June timeframe, away from this meat grinder, and instead go down to the southeast isolate Crimea. That means that we have got to provide -- we've got to provide clarity. What's our desired end state, and that give capabilities, which means, really, long-range precision fires.",

What that means is enormously significant, quite apart from the $1.6 billion or more that I expect Fox News will have to pay to Dominion. Quite apart from that, it will change the national conversation. It's not going to be easy for any of these hosts to say to people, you know, we admitted on the slide that we made suckers of all of you, and now listen to us. A lot of people who bought into the lie are going to think twice. I think that is going to change the national conversation going forward.

But maybe Lou Dobbs, maybe Maria as commentators. And the back and forth continues. Question, we went through Fox host Maria Bartiromo. Yes, yes, come on. Fox host Jeanine Pirro. I think so.

That according to two sources.It's a claim that infuriates Chinese officials. China's foreign ministry Monday calling on the U.S. to stop smearing China and stop politicizing the issue of the virus origin. Our first of three trips to Wuhan investigating the virus' outbreak was in January 2020 when COVID-19 was still a mystery illness. Officially, China had only listed about 200 cases of COVID-19 at that point, including three deaths. But our reporting revealed the real number of infected was far greater, and the crowded lunar New Year travel rush was underway, allowing COVID to spread rapidly. Security outside the original epicenter, the Huanan seafood market told us to leave. Chinese officials linked some of the cases to this market, suggesting it might've started naturally, jumping from animals to humans. But as the virus went global, the U.S. and other democracies further questioned its origins.",

The Chinese government has repeated repeatedly denied claims that the virus was released from the lab. And its state media unleashed a relentless propaganda campaign, using digital articles, TV reports, documentaries, even a rap song.The aim: to sow doubt and deflect blame. They've also pushed conspiracy theories, including a lab leak, not a lab in Wuhan. But this one, Fort Dietrich in the United States, the home of a U.S. Army biological laboratory. Though there is no evidence the virus leaked from here, that has not stopped Chinese officials from pushing their version of a lab leak theory. Monday's response from the foreign ministry also cited the World Health Organization, which throughout the outbreak, regularly echoed the Chinese government's narrative, taking them at their word. In January 2021, the WHO sent a team of international experts into Wuhan to research the origins. But that was already more than a year after the initial outbreak. The team initially considered the lab leak theory to be highly unlikely. But when the WHO requested a second field visit for more research, China said no. (END VIDEOTAPE) CULVER (on camera):  So, Erin, as you listen to all this reporting, you see that there doesn't really seem to be a unanimous decision or a conclusion from the intelligence, right? But the majority of the intelligence community still leaned towards this either having occurred naturally or that there just isn't enough evidence to make a decision either way. Put that all aside, though, and you saw all the propaganda. And you and I have been talking about this for nearly three years, it feels. And the propaganda is starting to penetrate into the population. So while they may not, in China, believe that it started in the U.S., it's caused enough of noise and deflection and blame to really sow enough doubt that really just muddies the water, and that's what the Chinese narrative is hoping for ultimately from the government perspective.",
