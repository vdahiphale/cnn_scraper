At this point we do know that has been burning for quite some time and is expected to burn for days. The state fire marshal here says this smoke is definitely toxic given the plastics that are burning and the chemicals they give off when they burn.And I want to give you an idea of their efforts right now. I'm going to step out just for a second so we can adjust for this sun. You can actually see fire crews spraying water on the edge of this fire right now. This is at the border of the factory. You see them using their ladder, essentially, to get a high vantage point and get that water down into where these flames are burning. We've been told that the fire is contained in the sense that it's not spreading to other parts of this city for now, but their efforts now are trying to whittle this down, again, for a blaze that they do expect to burn for days. Thankfully, everyone who was said to be inside this fire has been accounted for, or inside this factory, I should say, has been accounted for. Now, as for what specifically caused this, we still don't know, and officials are trying. They think they'll have a better clue once this dies down. But we did hear from the fire chief that the owner of this building is someone that they had cited multiple times previously, and that this behind me is frustrating for the fire chief. And to use his words, we knew it wasn't a matter of if. It was a matter of when this was going to happen. So a lot of questions here, including air quality questions. You see, obviously, how high this smoke is going, and even though cars are still going back and forth, these evacuation orders affecting about 2,000 people so far in this 35,000-person town. But the air quality report is something that we are waiting on this morning. We were told sometime around daybreak, and obviously it will help give some significant clues to how much of an issue this is going to be not just for this part of Indiana, but obviously the surrounding areas as well.",

To what extent we do not know, for what specific reason we do not know. But again, that quote of it was a matter of if, but when is pretty striking to come from a public official who deals with fires.

You can hear them, and that's when the partner, Officer Galloway, is telling him to back out. And almost immediately, and I just want to stop here for a second. You see Galloway here, he's the training officer. He goes to the trunk to retrieve his long rifle.Almost every police department now because of active shooter situations, they ride around with these rifles now to respond to these types of situations. It's part of their training, and almost immediately you see, that's what Officer Galloway here, what he does. And then now, look at his video. They are being shot at, and it's just remarkable, the fact that they are facing gunshots, the fact that they're being fired on, they still go towards those gunshots, they go towards the threat to try and eliminate. And that is where you see that rookie officer with just four shifts, 10 days on the job. He gets shot. He goes down. But Officer Galloway is also shot. He is grazed, and then he runs down. He realizes that he needs to get behind something, and he gets behind this pillar here, and he is still taking gunshots, trying to get site onto the gunmen. He eventually shoots and kills the gunman. What is really remarkable here, also, Don, is the fact that they could not see the shooter. They couldn't see him. They were basically fired upon. It was an ambush. They could not see him, and he was able to shoot them. Both of them were shot. Luckily, Galloway was only grazed. And then here's a bystander footage, and then you see here more of some of that action as they're trying to get towards the shooter and take him out.",
