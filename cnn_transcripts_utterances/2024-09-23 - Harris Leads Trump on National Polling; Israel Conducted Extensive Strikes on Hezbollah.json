Ahead on \"CNN Newsroom.\" Closer and closer to election day in the United States. Vice President Kamala Harris has a slight lead in national polling. Her opponent, former President Donald Trump, is already hinting at what he will or won't do in the next election cycle.Israel carries out more strikes on Lebanon. Why the escalation of violence is worrying the White House? And deadly floods hit Japan in an area that's still recovering from a devastating earthquake. Well, there's just over six weeks left in the race for the White House. And in the latest CNN poll of polls, Kamala Harris is holding 50 percent support to Donald Trump's 47 percent. The results suggest a slight shift in Harris's favor since the ABC News presidential debate almost two weeks ago. But that difference is just inside the typical margin of area for a national poll. The Democratic nominee says she will lay out her economic vision in the coming days. Harris will push what she refers to as an opportunity economy. Her plan will address the aspirations of voters while tackling the challenges that they face. Well, this race is far from over, but Donald Trump is already fielding questions on what he would do if he doesn't win the U.S. presidential election in November. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And when I look at this polling, I try remain skeptical and understand that of course there's the chance for a polling error like we've seen in previous years. But more generally in a close race, all the numbers can really tell us is that it is close and that in those key battleground states, the seven toss- ups that will determine the election, either Harris or Trump has a clear path to win.

It's the first cycle in 40 years where it was not organized ahead of time by the Commission on Presidential Debates, which is a nonpartisan entity that both campaigns typically work with. They schedule three presidential debates, one vice presidential debate, and they all conform to the same kinds of rules. This has really been the Wild West of debates this cycle.Both candidates independently negotiating with a variety of news networks and each other to set up the debates. We had that incredibly early debate back in June that kicked off the whole set of events that led to Joe Biden's stepping down as the Democratic nominee. That was not supposed to happen. Nobody expected that to happen. So, the fact that Donald Trump is refusing to debate Kamala Harris a second time isn't the least expected thing to happen in this election cycle. However, of course, he said it's too late. The reality is we've had debates later in the election cycle than the October 23 suggested date from Harrison's CNN. Just in 2020, Joe Biden and Donald Trump's final debate of that cycle was actually a day further than the October 23 would be this year. So it's not unprecedented, but clearly given the results of that first debate in September, unsurprising that Trump isn't really interested in sharing a stage with the vice president again.",

But it appears those rockets that weren't intercepted hit other areas causing a few injuries and some damage to property. While Israel continues to strike targets in southern Lebanon, more than 300 between Saturday and Sunday. In Beirut, Hezbollah held a funeral for Ibrahim Akhil, one of the group's senior commanders killed along with more than a dozen other militants in an Israeli airstrike on southern Beirut Friday. The strike also killed more than 30 civilians, including women and children. At the funeral, Hezbollah deputy leader Naim Qassem vowed that Hezbollah's strikes deep inside Israel were an installment in what he called a battle without limits, and said despite the pager and walkie- talkie attacks and Friday's strike on Beirut, the group will continue to fire into Israel.

I mean, is either side listening? They don't seem to be. President Biden and his team have been engaged in intense diplomacy over the last several months, trying to get the parties to back down from their positions and so far, have not been successful. Now, initially what the Biden administration was trying to do was try to take the route of peace in Gaza first, ceasefire first, and then that will have a ripple effect throughout the region in terms of getting these other organizations to back down like Hezbollah, like the Houthis, and of course you know, behind the scenes of it all, Iran, and that hasn't seemed to be working. At one point or the other, one of the two parties either Hamas or the Israelis have not wanted to really signed that dotted line and commit to a ceasefire. Both parties are absolutely and completely to blame for this. And the fact that the U.S. pressure hasn't been working, there has been criticism of course that the U.S. hasn't really been applying all the leverage that it has vis-a-vis Israel to try to get Netanyahu to sign that dotted line to commit to a ceasefire.

But our law enforcement sources tell us that this search warrant is related to documents that Donlon might have held on to from his previous jobs in law enforcement. We're also told that this latest search warrant is not related to any of the four other investigations that are currently ensnaring city hall.Now, Commissioner Donlon did release a statement on Saturday evening confirming much of this information, saying in part that federal authorities took materials that came into my possession approximately 20 years ago and are unrelated to my work with the New York City Police Department. This is not a department matter, and the department will not be commenting. So there's a very specific effort in that statement by the commissioner to separate this latest search warrant and any other investigation. And that's important because one of the four investigations that is currently unfolding does involve the NYPD. Now Tom -- Thomas Donlon has a long career in law enforcement including a specifically as a special agent with the FBI. He was also director of the New York Office of Homeland Security, and he helped run the Joint Terrorism Task Force here in New York City. So the question is if authorities are searching for documents that may have been classified, that he came in contact with during that period of time. What's less clear to us right now is why this is happening, right now. Now, city hall has not said much about this. They did release a statement saying that they expect all their employees to follow the law, but this is certainly adding to a series of questions for Mayor Eric Adams, who continues to face scrutiny about these for federal investigations involving his campaign and senior members of his staff.
