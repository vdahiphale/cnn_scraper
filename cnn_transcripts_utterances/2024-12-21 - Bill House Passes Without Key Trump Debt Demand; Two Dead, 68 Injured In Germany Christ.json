And this is CNN Newsroom.We are following two big stories this hour. Lawmakers in Washington have now passed a spending bill averting a government shutdown and also a deadly attack on a crowded Christmas market in Germany. We know that at least two people were killed, dozens more, about 68 or so were injured. This video you see here appears to show police arresting the suspect on scene, the suspected driver on scene. And officials are saying that he's a 50-year-old permanent resident in Germany who's originally from Saudi Arabia. Let's start in Washington, though. We're just after the deadline and after days of a lot of chaos, lawmakers have now averted a crisis. The U.S. Federal government is now avoiding a shutdown after the Senate just passed a stopgap funding bill by a vote of 85 to 11. The House of Representatives passed it earlier as well. The bill now needs President Biden's signature. The so called Plan C extends government funding into March. It includes disaster relief and farming provisions. But it does not, and this is crucial, it does not include a debt limit suspension, which of course was a key Donald Trump demand. That piece was stripped after a bipartisan revolt on Thursday. Apparently that frustrated president -- former -- former President Trump, President-elect Donald Trump, so much so that he said to one lawmaker he was disappointed that the deal couldn't include a debt ceiling hike. A source says the President-elect now realizes that there are certainly some issues that conservatives will not budge on, even for him. Ron Brownstein is back with us. So just in terms of what happens next, the current proposal is going to fund the government up until March 14th. And that sets up basically another showdown in the early days of the Trump administration. I think a lot of people would agree that the system is broken, Ron.",

And typically in the last few years, more often than not, have found a way to avoid tumbling over into the abyss. But at times they have. I mean, you know, we have seen government shutdowns.And even before we get to that, maybe around the same time as that, we are going to have another crisis on -- on a more consequential issue, which is the debt ceiling. And, you know, we've had this kind of brinksmanship really, since the Obama presidency on -- on the debt ceiling, with Republicans typically refusing to raise the debt ceiling unless Democrats, Democratic presidents make concessions in terms of spending and -- and being accused of gambling with the entire global economy, because the consequences of a U.S. debt default obviously could be catastrophic, rippling through the world's financial system. Now, we are in a situation because Trump did not get what he wants, where in all likelihood, virtual certainty, Republicans are going to need Democratic votes to raise the debt ceiling sometime this spring, avoid that kind of cataclysm. And that will be a moment where Democrats may have their -- the most leverage they will see at any point in the early months of the Trump presidency.",

      "sentences": "Right. I think in general, his position is stronger. He has fewer constraints than he did when he came in 2017. The Republican Congressional leadership is much more deferential to him than Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan. Don't forget, those were the Republican leaders in 2017 who were quite skeptical of Trump. The Supreme Court is more deferential to him. It was four to four at that point with a very uncertain swing vote in Anthony Kennedy.Now it's a very solid 6-3 majority. His Senate majority is slightly bigger. The media seems a little uncertain. Democrats until this week have seemed quite uncertain, you know, more muted in responding to his Cabinet appointments than we see before. The one place where the shoe is clearly tighter is the House. He had 241 House Republicans when he entered in 2017. Now they have 220 seats. They've won but several vacancies. They might be down to as little as 217 at some points this spring. And what we saw again this week is that there are members of the kind of the right flank in that Republican caucus who simply are unwilling to kind of make the concessions you need to, to govern even when Donald Trump ask 38 House Republicans voted against the deal, you know, in opposition to giving him a blank check on the debt ceiling. When they had unified control in 2018 and he had to raise the debt ceiling, 67 House Republicans voted no. So there may be points at which Republicans in the House, some of them will not go for him, but it's --I think, important to understand those are likely to be from the right, not from the center. So to the extent there is pushback on Trump, it is to push him in a more militant direction than in a more compromising direction.",

Germany's chancellor is scheduled to visit the city in the coming hours. We know that two people were killed, 68 injured, when a car drove through the crowd. This video appears to show police arresting the suspected driver on scene. Officials say that he is a 50-year-old man from Saudi Arabia and that he's a permanent resident of Germany and he's lived there for about 20 years. CNN's Matthew Chance has much more on the attack and the man suspected of driving the car.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN CHIEF GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This is the moment a vehicle plowed into a packed Christmas market in Germany, causing horrific casualties. Video from the immediate aftermath in the city of Magdeburg shows the market in disarray with items scattered all around and people tending to the wounded. It's now known an adult and a toddler were killed in the attack about 100 miles west of Berlin, leaving the city on edge. DORIN STEFFEN, MAGDEBURG RESIDENT (through translator): We are shaking. We are full of sympathy for the relatives. Also, we hope nothing has happened to our relatives, friends and acquaintances. CHANCE (voice-over): Police say they've arrested the driver of the car, identified by a senior German government official as a doctor originally from Saudi Arabia. The suspect is reported to have lived in Germany since 2006 and to work in the region. A government official says it's believed the suspected attacker acted alone. REINER HASELOFF, REGIONAL PRIME MINISTER OF SAXONY-ANHALT (through translator): We are currently in the process of compiling all further data and also carrying out the interrogation. According to the current information, it is an individual perpetrator. So there is no longer any danger to the city because we're able to arrest him. CHANCE (voice-over): It's not the first time a German Christmas market has been targeted. Back in 2016, a dozen people were killed and many more injured when a crowded Christmas market in Berlin was struck by a truck driven by a 24-year-old Tunisian man. That attack was later claimed by the Islamic State. Now the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz is set to travel to the scene of the latest attack as Germany reckons with a horrific act of violence just days before Christmas. Matthew Chance, CNN, London.

You're looking at boosting police presence in -- in places where these incidents might occur, strengthening your capability to respond if there is an incident.We saw the Germans handled that very capably last night. And then certainly the -- the physical measures. Remember though, that even though we're looking here again at a tragic vehicle attack, we've also had attacks, for instance, with firearms on Christmas markets. So just blocking physical access for vehicles is not going to be the answer, as we saw in December of 2018 in Strasbourg, France, where the attack was with a firearm.",

What steps did we see in this planning? Was this person trained for this planning or self-trained for this planning? How long a process was this? And -- and what was prepared here?So did this person walk the ground here? Was he familiar with the place that he targeted? Was he familiar with prior Christmas markets? Did he know what the setup was? Did he know what the weak spots were? How to maneuver this vehicle that he apparently rented in order to get the maximum effect that he was after? So I think as the day progresses, we'll be hearing more from German authorities. Just what went into this planning in a first take. After that, it's going to take several more days before we get the details. But you raise a very important point, and that this horrific action, of course, when we're looking at the general numbers, is already one of the worst terrorist incidents in Europe in years in terms of total casualties. So the alarm here for other Christmas markets and of course, also the new year celebrations, traditional mass events in large parts of Europe are already now considered a concern, irrespective of what the motive was, just in case we have other people plotting or in case this may spawn copycats.",

But given the fact that over the years, ISIS has been incredibly weakened, I mean, the world does seem to have moved on from ISIS to a certain extent. And these sorts of attacks with somebody driving a truck or a car into a crowd are -- are sort of less common. Does that give rise to a certain level of complacency in the security field?
