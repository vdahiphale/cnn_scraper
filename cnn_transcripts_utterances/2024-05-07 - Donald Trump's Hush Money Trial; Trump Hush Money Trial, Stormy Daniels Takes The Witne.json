Two of the lead prosecutors, both men, have done the direct examination of most of the key witnesses. So, I think it was strategic to have Susan do this.Now, a lot of curiosity about Trump's reaction. He's right now whispering to his lawyer. As you said, when she walks in, she's going to walk in behind the defense table. We're told that Trump's son, Eric Trump, who is sitting in the gallery, would be able to see her, did watch her as she walked across to the witness stand. Unclear what Trump's reaction was. But this is a challenging witness. You want to get out the information you need. But you're dealing with sex. You're dealing with a former porn star.
