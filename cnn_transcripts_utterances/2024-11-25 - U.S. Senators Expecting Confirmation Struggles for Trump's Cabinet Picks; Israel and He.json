Just ahead, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's cabinet is taking shape. We look ahead to the fight to get his picks confirmed by the Senate.A source tells CNN a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hezbollah is quote, \"very close,\" even as both sides carry out strikes across the border. And a cargo plane flying from Germany has crashed near an airport in Lithuania. We'll have details. Good to have you with us. Well, the Thanksgiving holiday week is starting with a pretty clear picture of Donald Trump's cabinet picks and the fight he could face to get them confirmed. Trump will be sworn in as U.S. president in less than two months. CNN's Alayna Treene looks at what's ahead, especially for the president-elect's more controversial choices.",

      "sentences": "Well, President-elect Donald Trump has moved very quickly to fill out his cabinet. He only has a few more names left to announce. But now, really, the attention is turning to how he is going to get these different candidates through their confirmation processes, particularly the ones that we know are more controversial and that are causing some consternation up on Capitol Hill.And that includes Tulsi Gabbard, who many senators questioned her position on surveillance and also her deep distrust of some of the agencies that she'll be overseeing. There is also RFK, Jr. who his past comments supporting abortion access may not sit well with a lot of the staunchly anti-abortion senators that will be dealing with his confirmation process. There's also Pete Hegseth who's Donald Trump's pick to lead the Pentagon. He has been dogged by a recent sexual assault allegation, but also a lot of people raising questions of whether or not he has the credentials for that role. So all of this together is what I know the Trump transition team is going to be focusing on very heavily between now and Inauguration Day as they prepare all of these different people to go through the Senate process. Now, we did hear some members address this today. I want you to take a listen to what Republican Senator Markwayne Mullin of the deep red state of Oklahoma said in trying to address some of this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. MARKWAYNE MULLIN (R-OK):  This isn't a new administration coming in. And so when people are criticizing his picks, the president has done this job before. He knows exactly what he needs. He knows who he wants to put in those positions. That's why he's been able to move fast because he knows he has four years to reach the mandate that the American people said. They want the government going in a different direction and these nominations he's putting forth are actually going to deliver that for him. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Now, what Mullin said there I think is pretty significant and it does align with what I'm hearing in my conversations with those working with the Trump transition team, which is Donald Trump chose these people even though he knew they were controversial for a reason. He wants disruptors, people who will go into these different agencies and buck the establishment and really try and go in a different way, break from traditional norms.That was his goal in these selections and that is why we've seen him publicly put pressure, Donald Trump himself, on many of these senators and encouraging them to support him. Now, one key thing to keep in mind as well, though, is that we do know that Senate Republicans have a backbone, that even though Republicans have control of the House and the Senate, we did see them weigh in very publicly about Matt Gaetz. I mean, Donald Trump was all in on Matt Gaetz, we had been told, and really wanted him for his attorney general pick, but it was clear from his meetings with senators and the conversations they were having that he was not going to get the number of votes he needed to get through the Senate and ultimately Gaetz withdrew. And so that is definitely weighing on the back of a lot of people's minds at Mar-a-Lago and something they're going to continue to be working toward as they ready all of these different selections for those hearings.

And I think that Gabbard is probably the most vulnerable of the remaining because she can be attacked from the right and you saw last week Nikki Haley who described her as an Iranian, Syrian, Russian, Chinese sympathizer. And I think Republican senators who are going to be reluctant to dissent from Trump too often, given the magnitude of his hold on the party, may feel more comfortable opposing nominees when they can do so from the right.",

I think for many Republican national security hawks, the thought of putting Gabbard, who has had such close relationships with Russian media, you know, parroting the Russian line for so many years, putting her in charge of national intelligence is just head-spinning.

The Lebanese capital was one of several areas hit by Israeli attacks over the weekend. Officials in Lebanon say those attacks across the country killed dozens of people. And in Israel, at least seven people were injured after the Israeli military says Hezbollah fired around 250 projectiles from Lebanon on Sunday, some of them, as you see here, intercepted by Israel's air defenses.

And a source in the region has said he feels that it's close. In the context there you have the battle tempo picking up more than 250 Hezbollah rockets and drones fired into Israel over Sunday. That is a huge number, much bigger than we've seen over recent days.And Israel for its part increasing its strikes in the center of Beirut over the past week on early hours of Saturday morning, a strike there killing more than 29 people. It appeared to be a strike going after a senior Hezbollah figure, although none were killed in that strike. Eighty-four other people over the weekend, more than 84 killed in Lebanon, more than 3,000 killed since the war began there. And on Sunday the IDF actually hitting a Lebanese army base, killing one soldier, damaging equipment and injuring several other soldiers. The IDF apologized for that, said that they were targeting Hezbollah. But the indications are over the past few days that the battle tempo has been heating up. And if you look back at the ceasefire in 2006 between Israel and Hezbollah back then, in the days before the ceasefire came into effect, the battle tempo heated up as well. It doesn't mean necessarily that there will be a ceasefire, but it does indicate that both sides are really putting their backs into the fight for maximal gain. The biggest consideration, it appears, for Prime Minister Netanyahu, getting what he wants during that 60-day ceasefire, getting the right to strike back at Hezbollah if they break the ceasefire. That seems to be one of the key issues that's holding out there. And the Iranians weighing in from their part, Ari Larijani, a senior advisor to the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, saying that Iran would strike at Israel, threatening that possibility, something we heard them saying several weeks ago when the talks seemed to be breaking down then. Now putting their voice in again at a crucial time in these ceasefire talks and it appears as if Iran is adding pressure. Is there going to be a green light for the ceasefire talks to progress to a point of conclusion? That isn't clear. Battle tempo, talks and discussions, diplomacy seem to be pointing that it could be close. But let's not forget we've been here before so it's not a done deal. Far from it.

This is expected to bring some heavy rainfall along the coast and some very heavy snow especially in the sierras, could see 2 to 3 feet over the next few days by late into the day, Monday, again you'll start to see that first system begin to spread into the areas of the Mid-Atlantic, as well as the northeast overnight into early Tuesday. Also, looking at some showers along the southeast coast, too. The other system we're watching, that's the one that moved into the West Coast now starting to overspread into the Rockies and eventually into the central portion of the country. Once we get towards Wednesday, this is going to have mostly rain here as the temperatures wont quite be cold enough for snow. You're really going to have to go pretty far north to get the snow into the mix but by overnight Wednesday and into Thursday, those temperatures starting to creep down in some areas, allowing a few more spots to get some snow or even a rain snow mix heavy rain at times possible across the Tennessee Valley. Even cities like Nashville, Atlanta and Knoxville could have rain in the forecast. Then by midday Thursday, you're looking at more of that moisture over spreading into the Northeast and into the Mid-Atlantic. So, any last minute travel or local travel on Thanksgiving Day itself, the biggest concern is going to be the Northeast stretching all the way down into the Gulf Coast, where you're going to have the bulk of that really heavy moisture. So then the question becomes, okay, what about the famous Macy's Day parade. Here's the thing. We've got that rain coming in. The heaviest will hold off until the afternoon and evening hours of Thursday. So the first few hours of the parade should, in theory, be okay. But those rain chances go up very quickly for the back half of the parade. Temperature wise, also, not exactly going to be very warm. You're looking at those temperatures likely only in the low 40s.

It is the first time that we'll see them in nearly 30 years. After they were convicted and sentenced to life in prison for the killing of their parents, and it is nearly 30 years later that this judge will also decide what happens, whether they appear in person or virtually.It is likely that they will appear virtually and it is a hearing that will start at 10:30 a.m. at Van Nuys courtroom here in the Los Angeles area. The judge also setting very strict rules around what happens in this hearing. There will be no cameras and no cell phone. In fact, the cell phones will be sealed in bags. Journalists will be allowed to attend, but only 16 members of the public will be allowed in that courtroom. And they will get their seats via a lottery. There is huge attention and interest in this case especially after a 2023 docu-series on Peacock where a member of the boy band Menudo also alleged that he was a victim of sexual abuse by Jose Menendez, the father of the two brothers, so that along with a letter that Erik Menendez wrote before the killings describing the sexual abuse is what the defense team says should be used and is why they are asking a court to reconsider the sentence and the conviction. And so, the district attorney here in Los Angeles agreed with the defense. The problem for the defense is that that district attorney was essentially voted out of office. Nathan Hochman, the incoming district attorney here in Los Angeles, sees this case a little bit different. Here's what he told us. NATHAN HOCHMAN, LOS ANGELES COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY-ELECT:  Now as to whether or not I'm going to support that particular motion or not. You got to do the hard work to make that decision. You got to review thoroughly the facts and the law. You need to actually speak to the prosecutors, speak to law enforcement officers, speak to the defense counsel and speak to any victim family members as well. Only after I do all that work will I be in a position to weigh in on the Menendez case, because then I'm not only going to weigh in on it, ill have to defend that decision in court.",

The perpetrators have not been identified, so players are being encouraged to be more cautious on social media and to take steps to increase home security.

We spoke to one farmer that lost 60,000 trees on his family- owned farm. That farm has been in the family more than 200 years, dating back to the English monarchy.With 60,000 trees gone, they are trying to make ends meet with wreaths and smaller trees for the season. That farmer also unfortunately lost his home. This farm here lost 270,000 seedlings. These are baby trees that would have eventually gotten planted to become those bigger trees that often get cut and sold for Christmas time. But when the flood waters came in, it contaminated all of these trees with that pollution and root rot, and these are just not viable anymore. A lot of these were also supposed to go to other farmers in the industry, and that's just a loss for them this season. Christmas trees take seven to 10 years to grow, so it is possible that we really won't understand the impact of Helene on the Christmas tree industry for another decade.
