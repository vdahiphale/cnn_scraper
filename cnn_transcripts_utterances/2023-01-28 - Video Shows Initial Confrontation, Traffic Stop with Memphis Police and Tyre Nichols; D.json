I do think it's an aggressive charge on the second-degree murder here. And here's why, as you said, in order to prove second degree murder under Tennessee law, you have to prove a knowing killing of another person. And what prosecutors ultimately will have to prove to a jury is that it was reasonably certain to each of these officers that their actions would result in the death of Mr. Nichols.Now, this is a really important point, Michael. I want to make sure people understand this. The jury in this case will not return a verdict. They will return 35 verdicts. Because we have five defendants here, charged with seven counts each, the second-degree murder being the top count. So that jury is going to have to go defend it by defendant, assess their acts, and decide whether this person is act knowingly aimed at and done with a reasonable certainty that they would result in the death of this person. We could have different results as to each defendant. We could have different results as to each count.",

I can imagine these defense lawyers wanting to parcel each of these cases, and perhaps pointing a finger in a different direction. In broad strokes, then, OK, just thinking about this as a composite. The prosecution is going to say, what? The prosecution is going to say that they did knowingly engage in such conduct, those baton blows are going to become key, the video taken from the light pole is going to be most important. And also, the kicks to the head. The defense, it seems to me is going to be stressing, just give us your hands, just give us your hands, just give us your hands, all the way through, all four videos and say, he resisted. You know, in that fourth tape, there was some claim that maybe he was high. And we also heard some information about him potentially reaching for someone's gun.

Now, this is a really important point, legally, because this is a sort of new development that we're seeing in some of these police cases. We saw in the Derek Chauvin trial, in the killing of George Floyd. The theory around all of those officers is that, in addition to causing George Floyd's death, they failed to render medical aid, and therefore causes death. Now, that was a fairly novel legal theory at the time, but the jury accepted it. And now we're starting to see that kind of theory brought to bear more often. In this case, it's actually the basis for some of the lesser charges in this case, still significant, but lesser charges, the official misconduct charge, and the official omission charge, as we call it, if you look further down the charges here.And so the theory is, by standing around doing nothing, first of all, I think I would argue as a prosecutor that tells you something about their mindset, their intent, they didn't care what happened to him. But also, that's a crime in and of itself. And we're seeing prosecutors use that kind of theory much more aggressively and charging police officers, and with some success.",

Prosecutors plainly must have considered that charge. But I don't think the proof is there. I think they've charged this as aggressively as they can charge it. I'm all in favor of charging aggressively. That's what I used to do as a prosecutor, Michael. But the risk is, if a jury thinks you have overcharge, that can actually backfire, because that can compromise your credibility. But the prosecutors really took an aggressive approach here. I think it was warranted. But I do not think it's a safe assumption to think everyone's going to get convicted across the board, and that's that.",

Yes, they absolutely need to be acknowledging what just happened.

In fact, one sheriff said, these aren't police officers. These are savages and they have no business being in our profession. I talked with a major city police chief who said, \"Here we are, again, and we did it to ourselves.

After the murder of George Floyd, the House passed the George Floyd justice in Policing Act of 2021.

So, today there are still no national standards for Americans roughly 18,000 Police Departments.

He's provided expert testimony regarding police procedures and use of force and more than 200 cases mostly for the plaintiffs against police departments.

The culture in law enforcement is that, you know, you -- if we have to chase you, then you're going to pay for that. And normally the payment is a beating.

But you can imagine how the conspiracists delighted in that type of misinformation.A French newspaper used it to float a theory that the encounter was some sort of a preplanned gay rendezvous. Elon Musk then amplified that by tweeting a link. This claim was somehow seen as proven by the fact that Pelosi was in his underwear. Well, it would have been unusual if he weren't in his underwear given that the break in took place at 2:00 a.m. The San Francisco DA Brooke Jenkins felt it necessary to hold a news conference saying she needed to clear up the distortions that had emerged on social media. And as \"The Chronicle\" reported, \"Police determined there were only two people in the home at the time of the incident. We have nothing to suggest that the two men knew each other prior to this incident,\" said Jenkins. Also released on Friday was the police body cam footage beginning when officers knocked on the Pelosi front door. I've got to warn you. This is really disturbing to watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
