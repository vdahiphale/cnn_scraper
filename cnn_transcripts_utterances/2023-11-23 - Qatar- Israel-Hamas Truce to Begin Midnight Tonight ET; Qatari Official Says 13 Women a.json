So you've received the lists for the first batch. Do you expect there to be similar complications and you know, contentiousness around setting the list each day.And is there a specific time that's been set each day for -- OK, the lists needs to be set for the next day at -- you know, whatever it is, 5:00 p.m. the day before. And I didn't quite catch the response on the drone surveillance. We understand that, that Israeli drone surveillance won't be happening during a certain part of the day to allow for the hostage chant over -- what happened is that, is it justice really a surveillance? Because it also -- understand that the Americans and maybe some of the Europeans have drones in the area. AL-ANSARI:  OK, so regarding the list that are going out every day, it's a day-by-day process, we'll be receiving those every day and handing them over on the Israeli side to the most hardened, they will handle, you know, the lists from their side also, so we can give it to the other side. Whenever we have both lists confirmed, this is where we can begin, you know, with the process of getting the people out. But there's an agreement on the time until those, so it's -- there will be a group each day released, and that of course is as I said, it's pending, that's coming in. But obviously, as we have laid out the timeline and the operational plan, it should go, you know, without necessarily any fault in getting the lists through. Our teams are working day and night. I can tell you why. I have been liaising with the team as late as 2:00 a.m. yesterday and as early as 4:00 a.m. Today, they're working on this to make sure that everything happened as quickly as possible. Obviously, it is in nobody's interest to delay the beginning of this agreement and the implementation of the humanitarian -- which was every moment that goes by is translated into a life lost. And therefore it is very important for us to do it. But we need to do it the right way. We need to do it in a way that would guarantee the safety of the hostages and the success of the truce itself and the sustainability of the truce. Yes, Becky.",

Has -- beyond this first group of 50 hostages or so that we expect to be released in this first four days, has Hamas provided you a more comprehensive list of the hostages that they -- that they do have? Have they gathered more hostages than 50? How many hostages do we expect there are alive in Gaza now?AL-ANSARI:  OK, Andrew, I can't comment on the numbers right now, because we don't have information -- verifiable information over the hostages and their status at the moment. I can tell you that one of the things that we're looking to happen or during the four days of pause is to collect more information of the hostages. Those who we have been told are not all with Hamas. And to get to know the numbers, to get to know the information that would help in a second wave that we are hoping by the fourth day, we'd have an agreement in place to release more and more hostages and thereby extend the pause in Gaza. I forgot to answer the question it seems on the drones. So I will tell you there's a -- as you rightly mentioned, there will be a period of time where the skies will be clear, and that would allow for the hostage release to happen in a safe environment. As you might imagine, you know, in the -- in the first deterioration of this one, the mediation secured the release of two American ladies, one of the main challenges was, of course, the sounds that are coming in. You know, the drones flying over whatever that might be -- mistook for an attack at the time. So, of course, we need to make sure that the movement happens in a very safe environment, so it doesn't cause any problems with the hostages.",

Do you see the potential for more cooperation with Iran when it comes to the need to expand this into more of an extended truce that could pave the way to a settlement between the Israelis and Hamas?AL-ANSARI:  We have been in constant contact with all our regional international partners over this, including Iran, the Iranian foreign minister has been in Doha two times already, and this would be his third visit to Doha. We have discussed with the Iranians the aspects of regional -- over of this conflict, and we have made sure that we relate to all our partners in the region, the complexities that would result from any regional spell over and the need for us to work together to make sure that this conflict is contained. And that we work together also to walk back from the 7th October into -- I can turn to the -- turn to peace in the region.

The moment you have to step in to say no, we have to put it this way.AL-ANSARI:  We of course, we are not on the ground which is always a handicap for overseeing the deal itself. But what is happening right now is that the operations we're hearing in Doha has direct lines of communications with a particular office here in Doha, Hamas, and with the Israeli side and with the Red Cross, and it's all happening in real time where we are monitoring everything that happens. I think it all that might come in of any breach, any report about the hostages, any additional information that we can relate between the three sides that we are working with, along with our partners in the region including Egypt and internationally, including the United States. So, we can make sure that we immediately jump into continuing our mediation work, and to make sure that we troubleshoot any issue that might arise on the ground. So the operations room is very instrumental and working with those parties I mentioned is very instrumental to make sure that the deal goes through the way it was agreed upon. Yes, Stephen.",

But can we expect that the ICRC's involvement this time will be similar or the same as -- and perhaps, you can, you know, use whichever term you think best expresses what's going to happen. You know, because we have seen this before. So is it going to be similar too, the same as? AL-ANSARI:  I would assume that as long as it's happening within the same parameters and in the same conflict, then within the same situation, that it would of course, fall into the same mechanisms. As I said, they are working with us in the operations room in real-time. There are people on the ground who will be ready to receive the hostages.

You've just expressed that you're not on the ground and that's difficult in and of itself in this -- in this humanitarian pause and affecting the operation of this hostage release. So how about journalists getting on the ground, have you had any discussions? AL-ANSARI:  Well, I know that a lot of respectable organizations are trying to get people out at the moment, and get them into safety, which is of course, something that we are all working towards a mediation process. I am not aware that the agreement includes any caveat about getting journalists in. We applaud all the coverage that all the brave journalists have been doing inside, and those who gave up their lives, and we give our condolences to them and their -- to their families and to the organizations which they gave for so many -- so long of a time. And the bravery of those who brought us the truth from the field is something that we should all be thankful for and something that we agree is in all instances a level of bravery that a lot of us would not -- would not have.",

And as you're right, confirming the list of the first 13 women and children who are supposed to come out, beginning at 4 O'clock tomorrow afternoon local time. And then he said that will effectively continue.Every day, there will be a list of names that are provided, the prime minister's office confirming just a short time ago as you pointed out that they have received that first list of names, they're cross- checking that list with what they know about the list of hostages who are in Gaza, and that they're already in touch and will be in touch with the families of the first 13 hostages to come out. The spokesperson there for the Qatari Foreign Ministry also said that families will be together as they come out, they will not be broken up. And then he also emphasized multiple times throughout that press conference, the commitment from both sides to adhere to the terms of the agreement. The commitment of Israel and Hamas not to resume fighting. He was asked, well, what happens if fighting does break out, if one side violates the agreement and there's assumption in hostilities, he said that would be immediately communicated to both sides to make sure there is a walk back from the edge and that there isn't an immediate deterioration in the situation. In terms of what the delay was about, he said, look, there were ongoing discussions late into the evening, essentially to make sure they could troubleshoot all the different scenarios that might arise. And that was part of the delay. The other part, as you pointed out was that they hadn't yet received the list of the first 13 to come out. When he was asked could this release of the first 50 Israeli women and children over the course of the next four days lead to a wider agreement. Is he confident that it will? He said he is hopeful, he wouldn't use the word confident there. So in terms of what he is seeing, the commitment as to this initial agreement, and he said if we get to the fourth day and we have seen the agreement work as it should, the release of 50 Israeli women and children for 150 Palestinian women helped -- women and children held in Israeli jails. Then he said there is hope that the agreement can be lengthened, that there can be a longer pause in the fighting, more aid going into Gaza, more Israeli hostages released and more Palestinian women and children released as part of the agreement there.",

And another question was also on their condition.He did confirm that all 13 women and children who as Oren noted, some of them are members of the same family are alive. There have been questions about their condition. The other thing, M.J. that stuck out, which I know, the U.S. has obviously played a key role in is the drones that have been flying over Gaza, that has been giving Israel key intelligence into where Hamas is operating, where these hostages may be. There is going to be a pause as these hostages are being released. They say that there will be clear skies over Gaza, meaning, no flying of the drones during at least some portion of each day as this temporary pause is going to be under way.",
