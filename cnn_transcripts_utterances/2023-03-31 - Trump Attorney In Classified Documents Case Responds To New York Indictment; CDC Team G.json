You win on legal issues. And this case is all about -- it looks like from the outside right now -- mental gymnastics that don't add up. I mean, legal gymnastics. They're going to fall apart. So I would think in very short order you'll see a motion to dismiss or several motions to dismiss, talking about this kind of impossible theory of stacking a federal crime into a state misdemeanor, the statute of limitations issues, and very importantly, the intent to defraud that's an element of these false recordkeeping charges. That's just not present here. Under even the most dreamy of Michael Cohen moments it's not part of the case. So there's a lot to look at.

There's an ends justify the means mentality that is unlike anything I've ever seen in prosecutorial circles.You've got people like Letitia James and now Alvin Bragg announcing we will get him. You've got an attorney general of the United States doing press conferences after a search warrant, which is completely unprecedented and unethical.

That's nothing that's ever happened in history. You've got thousands of classified documents sitting in Chicago for the Obama Foundation. No similar treatment. And that's really what President Trump is fighting about and that's what we're fighting about is the idea that somehow this whole criminal justice system can be turned on its head because of him. One person gets differential treatment across the board, whether it's criminalizing a civil dispute about documents, whether it's ignoring peaceful words on January 6, or threading together this ridiculous misdemeanor through the worst credible -- the least credible witnesses you can imagine in New York.

They were part of a 15-member team that was sent there to conduct what is called an assessment of chemical exposure, or an ACE investigation. They went door-to-door in an area near the derailment. Apparently, seven members of the team said they started feeling sick. Their symptoms included sore throats, headaches, coughing, nausea. These are some of the same symptoms that both residents, first responders, and rail workers had also complained about. When CNN asked the CDC about the investigators a spokesperson said the following. Quote, \"Symptoms resolved for most team members later the same afternoon, and everyone resumed work on survey data collection within 24 hours. Impacted team members have not reported ongoing health effects.\" It's unclear what caused their symptoms. The eight other team members did not report any symptoms. The EPA has repeatedly said, as you guys know, that all of the air and the water there is safe. But what is unclear at this point is in the spirit of transparency -- and, you know, in the very beginning of this government officials said over and over we want to be transparent about what we're finding and what we're doing here.
