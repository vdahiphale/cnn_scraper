The House Minority Leader, Democratic Congressman Hakeem Jeffries joins me in just a moment for an exclusive interview.In Ukraine, at least two people are dead and more than 30 injured after a Russian attack on a medical clinic, Ukraine claims was deliberate. This hour, we'll have a live report from the warzone. And as Americans prepared to set out for the Memorial Day weekend, CNN is at the airports and on the highways with everything you need to know about one of the busiest travel days of the year. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer, you're in the Situation Room. Our top story this evening, the U.S. Treasury says debt limit negotiators have slightly, slightly more time to try to strike a deal, but it's still not clear if the two sides can reach an agreement before the nation defaults. From Congress to the White House, CNN is covering these very tense negotiations from every angle. Let's begin over at the White House with CNN's Jeremy Diamond. Jeremy, what more are you learning about this new default deadline?",

      "sentences": "Well, Wolf, this is the first time that the Treasury Department has actually given a definitive date by which they believe that the U.S. government is going to run out of money to pay its bills and to pay its debt obligations. They had previously said early June with the possibility of June 1 as the earliest possible date. But now in a letter to the Speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy and other congressional leaders, the Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen says that there is a specific date and she says that it is June 5, a week from this coming Monday. She says in the letter, quote, \"based on the most recent available data, we now estimate that Treasury will have insufficient resources to satisfy the government's obligations if Congress has not raised or suspended the debt limit by June 5.\" She also notes that even next week, the Treasury Department is already going to be running at an extremely low level of resources, based on the fact that $130 billion of payments to Social Security beneficiaries, veterans, is going to be made in the amount of $130 billion next week.Now, I just spoke with a senior White House official to get their reaction to this new June 5 deadline. And the bottom line here is that this doesn't altogether change the timeline for negotiations. They are still operating on a very tight timeline. It gives them slightly more breathing room from that earliest possible date of June 1st. But this official noted that, look, they believe they are now in the final stages of negotiations, and they believe that they are on track to strike an agreement in time for that June 5 deadline.",

Thank you very much.Joining us now for an exclusive interview, the House Democratic leader, Hakeem Jeffries. Leader Jeffries, thank you so much for joining us. We're only a few days away from June 5 tonight right now. That's the new date that the Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen says the U.S. will then run out of money to pay its debts, causing what economists say would be a totally catastrophic default. So where do these negotiations from your perspective stand right now? REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-NY): Good evening, Wolf. Great to be with you. We certainly are only a few days away from this manufactured default crisis, which is very real right now. We shouldn't be in this situation because America should always pay our bills and do it in a manner consistent with what has been done on the Democratic presidents and Republican presidents without gamesmanship, partisanship or brinksmanship. We are in this place now thankful for President Biden and his team of designees for working hard to avoid a default in the face of a group of individuals, some of whom clearly would take the position that blowing up the economy, crashing it and triggering a recession, apparently, they've concluded and no one's to their political benefit. And so, we're hopeful that cooler heads will continue to prevail over the next day or so, we can arrive at a bipartisan agreement that makes sense that's consistent with democratic values and we can get past this dangerous default crisis.",

And so we have to have some visibility into how many votes House Republicans are going to produce in terms of the ultimate resolution. And then we can speak with some specificity, Wolf, about how many votes are going to be needed on the Democratic side.What I can say is that we're committed to making sure that the United States does not default. We're committed to a bipartisan agreement. We have full faith in President Biden's ability to arrive at a resolution that is consistent with our values and prevents the economy from crashing, which is clearly what some folks on the other side of the aisle, some extreme MAGA Republicans would like to see happen.",

The so-called work requirements are not a serious public policy proposal, because work requirements already exist under federal law. And that has been the case going all the way back to 1996. To the extent that there are anything in the law that Republicans would like to discuss in terms of additions to the changes that have already been put into the law related to work requirements going all the way back to 1996, then the appropriate place for that to be discussed is the Farm Bill, not as part of a hostage taking situation where the full faith and credit of the United States of America and potentially crashing the economy could result in the failure to arrive at a resolution.",

Now, some of the good signs, according to some experts that we spoke with that are optimistic about what we could see this summer around is that the preventive measures that airlines have taken including adding more than 48,000 employees putting out more realistic flight schedules also trimming down flights at New York's busy airports to account for that shortage and of course flying larger airplanes to meet that demand.

Of course, just yesterday, Governor Henry McMaster signed that new law into effect that would have banned abortion after six weeks, but less than 24 hours later, today, a judge issued a temporary hold on that law, saying that it needed to first be reviewed by the state Supreme Court.Now, well, that's something that's familiar to many people, especially in South Carolina, because earlier this year, the state Supreme Court struck down a previous six-week abortion ban saying that it violated the state constitution and guarantees to privacy. This is something that many of the opponents to the law argued during debates in both the House and the Senate, those five so called Sister Senators, three of them who were Republicans saying that they warned their colleagues that language that had been tweaked would not go far enough. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. PENRY GUSTAFSON (R-SC): We know those clauses were a problem. Yet the house, you know, put them back in there reinserted them. And that's -- that was one of the main reasons why I voted against it because I don't think it can be upheld. And the longer we extend this debate, and the more that this legislation is picked off, truly the more abortions will take place. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Thank you, Dianne.Turning now to the 2024 race, the war of words between Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis is clearly heating up after the Florida Governor finally announced his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination. Let's get analysis right now from our political expert. I'll start with David Axelrod, the DeSantis campaign, David, is touting the $8.2 million it raised in the first 24 hours after he became an official presidential candidate. That's nearly, what, 2 million more than Biden raised in his first 24 hours back in 2019. So how significant is this?",

He'll be able to get his message out. He'll be able to survive the ebbs and flows and duking it out with Donald Trump who also has significant resources.It's not a guarantee of anything, however, I mean, the real question with DeSantis is he's offering himself as a new and improved Trump, Trump without the crazy, you know, he'll fire the FBI director, he'll pardon the January 6th folks, he'll bring the DOJ to heal and so on. And the question is whether people are looking or at least the Trump base is looking for a new and improved Trump, they seem to like the Trump they have. So, you know, there are a lot of questions yet, but fundraising may not be one of them. He seems to be able to do that quite proficiently.",

So clearly wouldn't put those kinds of statements out if you weren't threatened at all. And I do think the other level of concern here, and I know Michael just talked about how they aren't that different on policy. But one thing that DeSantis is able to do when he is running on this Trumpism without Trump without Trump's baggage is pick and choose which policies he wants to double down on. What we saw today was actually quite striking. DeSantis said that he was going to repeal Trump's Criminal Justice Reform Act, it was a landmark act. And he said that it was just basically jailhouse bait that was too lenient. This is something that we know Trump himself has been concerned about. This is something that was passed in 2018. He didn't even run on this in 2020. DeSantis now has the opportunity to pick and choose the kind of policies of Trump's that he wants that he wants to latch on to, but also disregard those that weren't so popular within the GOP.",
