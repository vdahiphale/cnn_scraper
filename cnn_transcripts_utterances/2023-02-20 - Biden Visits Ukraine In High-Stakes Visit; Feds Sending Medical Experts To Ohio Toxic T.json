All of the NATO countries, particularly those on the Eastern Front.When you take a look at the Baltic countries and down into Poland, Romania, and Bulgaria, they are at risk. They know that if Russia is successful in Ukraine, they're next. They're the next in the -- in line for the Russian aggression. So, all of NATO and the European Union are standing together. It was just two years ago that NATO was in disarray. The European Union, even the French were talking about building a different security system outside of NATO because basically, Trump had done his best for four years to diminish and destroy NATO. Biden came in, NATO is solid, European Union is solid, sanctions are in place, new sanctions are going to go in place in the next weeks ahead. This is an extremely important moment. And the president's visit puts a capital exclamation mark on it. We're in. We're all in. We've got to see this through to the end because it's not just about Ukraine. It's about NATO. And frankly, it's also about China.",

So, if anyone is having any sort of symptoms, they can come here and get themselves checked out. Meanwhile, you've got the governor, you've got other federal officials who say that the air and that the water is safe. And in fact, the governor says to date, approximately 500 homes here in East Palestine have been tested and found no sign of contaminants. So, you've got this disconnect right between what the federal and what state officials are saying versus what people are feeling here on the ground.
