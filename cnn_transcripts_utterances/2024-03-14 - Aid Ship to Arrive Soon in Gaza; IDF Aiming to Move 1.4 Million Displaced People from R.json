      "sentences": "A very warm welcome to the show, everyone. I'm Isa Soares.Tonight, as famine spreads through Gaza, the first ship loaded with food could arrive as soon as this very hour. We are tracking its progress, and of course, we will keep you updated. Plus, Donald Trump is back in court in Florida, where he's trying to get the classified documents case against him dismissed. And then later, CNN partners with young people all around the globe for My Freedom Day, a day of student-led action against modern-day slavery and bonded labor. We'll be speaking to some activists, in fact, later in the show. But first tonight, the first ship loaded with desperately needed aid is due to reach Gaza shore soon, perhaps even during this hour here with you. The European Union's humanitarian aid chief today warned that Gaza is already experiencing pockets of famine. Of course, this can come soon enough. The ship is carrying 200 tons of food from a port in Cyprus. A charity, World Central Kitchen, plans to distribute the meals. And it posted these images of the jetty where the ship is expected to dock, telling CNN it was built from the rubble of buildings destroyed in Israeli strikes. Israel, meantime, is giving more details about its planned ground offensive in Rafah. It says it intends to move 1.4 million displaced Palestinians to \"humanitarian enclaves\" inside Gaza before the attack begins. Today, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made it clear, it's a question of if, but when. Have a listen, (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator):  I will continue to push away the pressures. We will enter Rafah. We will complete the elimination of the rest of Hamas' battalions. We will restore security. And we will bring total victory for the people of Israel and the State of Israel. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We're talking about 200 tons of food. That's over 500,000 meals, according to the World Central Kitchen, and they've constructed a jetty that is nearly 60 meters long, stretching into the sea in order to receive this aid. They've got many volunteers, contractors on the ground who are set to help distribute this, but there's no question that there are major questions about exactly how this aid will be distributed and whether it can be distributed safely. We have seen in the past, of course, as these convoys, as these airdrops have been swarmed by desperate and hungry Palestinians, sometimes, resulting in deaths as well and violence. The Israeli military has opened fire near some of these convoys in the past. There have been stampede incidents, trampling, et cetera. So, there are significant security considerations about how this aid can actually be delivered. Now, in terms of the amount of aid, the World Central Kitchen says they're currently prepping another ship in Cyprus that is being checked and loaded as we speak, containing 300 tons of aid. So, even as this ship is set to arrive, perhaps as early as tonight in Gaza, another one will quickly be on the way as well.",

It's extremely, extremely significant. And I have no doubt that the Israeli prime minister will at some point, want to respond to that. He has already, of course, been coming under increasing pressure from the White House over the conduct of Israel's military campaign in Gaza, and this will only further ratchet up those tensions between Washington and Jerusalem. Now, in terms of what effect it will have, that remains to be seen. But I would note that it comes a week after Benny Gantz, a member of the war cabinet who is also Benjamin Netanyahu's chief political rival, the man who would likely be elected prime minister if elections were held today, just was in Washington last week, met with Chuck Schumer, met with the White House.

You don't see asitting president or a sitting vice president visiting an abortion provider clinic like this, and we are about to see the vice president make remarks so that visual is incredibly striking. As we know the White House and the Biden campaign are set on making the issue of reproductive rights a central issue in the 2024 election. We have heard, you know, Democrats talking about the fact that they believe reproductive rights is a galvanizing and mobilizing force for voters and that they think they can point back to the recent midterm and off year elections as proof of that. And all of this, of course, coming on the heels of the Supreme Court here in the United States, overturning Roe v. Wade. And if you look at some recent public survey, including a recent survey from KFF, you see that about half of registered voters say that they believe that the 2024 election is going to have a major impact on access to abortion. So, that gives you a little bit of insight into how a lot of people are thinking about this issue as they get ready to vote in the elections upcoming in November. Now, as you suggested, the vice president has become a very high-profile voice and face of the administration and campaign on this issue. She launched this Reproductive Freedoms Tour back in January, and this is her sixth stop on that tour. As she and the president are really on a travel blitz in recent days to make sure that they are hitting up every single battleground state here in the United States in light of the president's State of the Union remarks last week. So, a very busy time for this campaign. And again, we are just seeing, very vividly, how much this issue of reproductive rights is one that Democrats are banking on to help them get voters out to the polling stations come November.",

I've gone to the right school. I have two years of journalism experience behind me. So, I put together my resume, and on the resume, there was, you know, my name, Hala Basha. My dad's last name was actually Ibrahim Basha. Removed the Ibrahim early on, my family did because that was kind of a mouthful, as many immigrant families do, by the way. They modify their name. They anglicize it or they -- whatever westernize it. And I had Arabic as a spoken language. And I wasn't getting any callbacks. And so, one of my friends from school said listen, I would recommend that you remove the Arabic because, you know, in France, it's a society where there is institutional racism and certainly discrimination against members of that minority. And that's proven in numerous experiments where fictitious resumes are sent with an Arabic name versus a Western name, and the Arabic name gets a lot less traction. So, I removed that. I took Gorani, which was a Western sounding name. I added a photo, blonde and blue eyed, don't look Arab. And I removed the fact that I spoke Arabic, which is grotesque because it's an asset.",
