I don't know if you can see this, but there are bullet holes from the side door and window. U.S. officials believe a Mexican cartel mistook the Americans for drug smugglers.My panel is going to join me here to talk about it. But first, CNN's Josh Campbell is on this story for us. Josh, what we do we know at this hour about these missing Americans?",

      "sentences": "Alisyn, a source familiar with this investigation tells me that it appears as though this was a case of mistaken identity and that these four Americans, who had traveled from Texas into Mexico in order to, what the source says, obtain a medical procedure, were targeted by this cartel who thought that they were attacking a Haitian drug smuggling group.Of course, we've seen rival gangs and rival factions along the U.S.- Mexico border engage in violence. It appears as though these Americans were caught up in that. Now, a source tells me that the reason why investigators believe they were there for medical procedure is because they actually processed the scene after this attack and found inside that vehicle receipts indicating that there was a procedure that was underway. And so, again, this is just extremely frightening because we know that there are so many Americans and Canadians, for example, who frequently travel into Mexico in order to obtain low-cost prescription drugs, in order to obtain lower medical services. I want to show you this video. I warn you that this is extremely graphic. This is what a source says happened at the end of this incident. Now, we don't know if these individuals are the actual Americans. Again, a source says this is related. You see people being loaded into the back of this truck at gunpoint. Again, this video is graphic. You see a woman who is being shoved in the back of a vehicle. You see a number of individuals who don't appear to be moving, who are then loaded into that truck. So, at this hour, investigators are trying to locate where these American citizens are. Alisyn, the FBI right now is offering a $50,000 reward leading to their rescue and the identification of their captors.",

I mean, the FBI can't go wherever it wants around Mexico chasing down leads. And so, they're having to work closely with Mexican officials in order to determine if they can find out where these people are, in order to try to make a contact with these attackers.I have nothing -- I wish I had better news. This appears very grim because as an FBI agent working in these cases, the first thing you ask yourself is, do the captors appear to be prone to violence? Do they appear to be rational and reasonable? In this case, according to a source I spoke with, they said that this began with a violent act, this cartel unleashing a barrage of gunfire. And so, you know, the question is, what did they do with these individuals after they took them away? I will end with this. You know, this is somewhat of a personal note. You know, I have no doubt that the FBI is working hard. I know, in talking to sources, that they're working to find these Americans. But, you know, it's now just after 11:00 on the East Coast. For people who are winding down their day and getting ready to call it a night, I could tell you from experience, as an FBI agent, there is no greater sinking feeling than knowing you are ending the day while there are victims that are still being held captive. It is a gut-wrenching realization. It's a motivating realization in the sense that you want to work relentlessly. So, I have no doubt that the FBI agents down there are working tirelessly to try to find them. The question is, Alisyn, will they be able to find these Americans before any further harm is brought to them?",

You know, the biggest trading partner with the state of Arizona is Mexico. That's our biggest trading partner. America, obviously, it's a huge trading partner for us. So, there is commerce and trade, there is the immigration issue, and then there's border security. They are all connected. But border security is the most important part of it. In Arizona, we know that the fentanyl that's coming into this country is largely coming through the ports of entry. They are just outnumbered at the border right now. The only people that are benefiting from this situation are the cartels. And I agree with you, the last thing that they're going to what is America's involvement, because remember what happened with the cartels in the 80s and the 90s when George H. W. Bush got serious about Columbia, there was -- that's when you finally saw an end to the Cali cartels and to the Medellin carters. Does America have to get that involved again? There are some people that are saying that that's what's going to take. I think it was one of the former secretaries of state or one of the former attorney generals that said, we got to treat this like a war, like we did terrorism.

There are more than 100 million Americans who have medical debt. In 2019, before the pandemic, just over 1% of people who are traveling internationally were doing medical tourism. The fact that that has persisted in a global pandemic when people are also weighing the risk of COVID exposure and contagion and still deeming it, you know, something worth undertaking, I think that's a scary prospect that we have to consider and ask some deep questions about the way our health care system is functioning for people or not functioning.",

We have seen presidents before get involved in conversations, talking about what the characteristics are. In this case, a lot of the trade that in the tourism that Mexico is reliant on with the United States will be part of a conversation if it gets to the presidents having to communicate with each other.
