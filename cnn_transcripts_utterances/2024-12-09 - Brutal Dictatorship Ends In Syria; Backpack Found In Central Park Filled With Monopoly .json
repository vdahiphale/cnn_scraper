      "sentences": "President Biden has cast this as a moment of opportunity for the Syrian people as the country is now rid of the crushing regime under Bashar al-Assad.But at the same time the president has acknowledged that there are also risks and uncertainty here. Managing those risks will be a key priority for President Biden and his team in the coming days and weeks. The president is expected at some point to speak with counterparts about the situation and he will also deploy top U.S. officials to the region. Now, among the top priorities is trying to ensure that there isn't any room for a resurgence of ISIS. The president in remarks yesterday said that they acknowledge that ISIS could try to take advantage of any power vacuum in Syria at this time to try to reestablish their capabilities. That is something that the U.S. adamantly does not want to see happen. And that is why the U.S. had launched dozens of airstrikes in Syria on Sunday. They targeted about 75 ISIS targets using a range of Air Force assets in the region, including B-52 bombers and F-15 fighter jets. Now, in addition to trying to ensure there is no resurgence of ISIS the U.S. also has to figure out how they navigate this rebel group, which toppled Assad. That group is known as HTS, and it is a group that the U.S. has deemed as a terror organization. U.S. officials have said that they also believe that significant portions of HTS also has ties to ISIS. President Biden did voice some cautious optimism about the words coming from the rebels but also said that they will be judging the group by their actions going forward. The U.S. is also concerned about the -- any chemical weapons that could be in Syria. And U.S. officials said that is something that they will be trying to identify and work on in the coming days and weeks. Now, perhaps complicating all of this is that this is playing out as President Biden only has six weeks left in office. This is an issue that President-elect Trump will inherit when he is coming into. So far, he had urged the U.S. to stay out of this matter as the situation was unfolding. And really, he's offered very few clues for what he thinks the future of Syria should be like. For President Biden's part he said that is a decision that is up to the Syrian people. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And Syria's future very much, as we said, an open question. Iran has also been hurt deeply by the sanctions regimes that the United States has kept and increased on them as, as well as our European partners. And, of course, they've been degraded militarily by some of the strikes that Israel has conducted. So they're looking at a very different Middle East when they're waking up today, and it doesn't include one that has them with the ability to execute any hegemonic ambitions that they had once had. Russia, the same way. Russia wanted Assad in power so that they could have a footprint in the Middle East. Now that footprint is in question because their proxy, Assad, is no longer there. And they need to answer, by the way John, for why they're harboring Assad on Russian soil -- a brutal dictator who killed millions of Syrian people. BERMAN:  In a little bit I'm going to have the family of Austin Tice, the American journalist who has been held in Syria since 2012. They will be on with me this morning.

On the other hand, it's not as if we were making great progress with Assad to get more answers on Austin.
