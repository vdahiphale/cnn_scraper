It is sixo'clock in the evening here where for the first time in its history, Turkey's presidential candidates will head for eight momentous run off race. Taking the world we'll have to wait about two weeks to find out who wins this country's pivotal Presidential election. Turkey's Supreme Election Council announcing a runoff will take place on May the 28th after no candidate crossed the 50 percent threshold needed for outright victory. What we do know now is that, with nearly all votes counted President Recep Tayyip Erdogan leads his main challenger opposition coalition candidate Kemal Kilicdaroglu by nearly 5 percent. Pre-election polls had shown the opposition leader with a slight lead. Well, a third candidate Ultra-nationalists Sinan Ogan got just over 5 percent of the vote and supporters could prove crucial to securing victory for one of these candidates in the runoff he has yet to endorse either candidate.

Other killer drones are capable of reaching deep behind the Russian front line in order to try to break the logistics spine of the Russian operation. Psychological operations now being conducted including by President Zelenskyy with his soon, not so soon, quite soon, type hints at when this offensive might start. But really what the Ukrainians are doing is mustering as much support as they possibly can in the form of modern high tech, NATO type equipment and NATO type maneuver warfare. A lot of big units have been trained up to do maneuver warfare rather than the Soviet meat grinder mass attack that the Russians have been using, ahead of this moment when they're hoping they'll be able to launch an offensive probably in multiple different directions, certainly trying to use the element of surprise in order to break the frontline of the Russians. And as you were alluding in your last hour or two, there has been the latest reporting or latest claims from, you take the Ukrainian intelligence saying that they don't believe the Russians have it in them anymore for significant defensive or offensive operations. That may well be because over the last few months, they've really been digging in, particularly in the south of the country where there's a strong expectation that ultimately the Ukrainians will want to be pushed through the southern front line and aim down towards the Crimean peninsula, Becky.",

The Palestinianhealth ministry says that Israeli forces clashed with Palestinians during raid in Nablus. The Red Crescent says one Palestinian was killed and another is in critical condition of being shot. Islamic Jihad there say the man who was killed was a member of the group. The Israeli Defense Forces have not commented. Well, these events provide some illustration of the long running mistrust between the two sides. And Arab News asked YouGov to survey Palestinians about what they want from their leaders and indeed, from the peace process loosely termed. They spoke to 953 Palestinians living in the Palestinian territories; half don't trust their leaders to make peace with Israel. Almost half say neither Hamas nor Fattah represent them and two thirds say they don't trust the Israeli government to make a lasting peace deal. I'm joined now by one of these people behind that hole, or at least the person who commissioned the poll Faisal Abbas, the Editor-in-Chief of Arab News. And I just want 953 people, it's not a huge amount, but it's a survey and nonetheless, what are you taking out of it? What do you think that survey achieved for you? FAISAL ABBAS, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, ARAB NEWS: Oh, thank you. Thank you for the question, Becky, it was very important to hear the voices of Palestinians. It seems to us working in the media that everybody speaks on the Palestinian behalf apart from the actual Palestinians. So as you've seen from the numbers earlier, the people have spoken, there is a huge percentage. 63 percent of Palestinians believed neither Fattah nor Hamas represent them. Clearly, that's an indicator that people have had enough of politics and want actual results, although they have as if the numbers show very little trust in their government to actually deliver that piece. That's only over shadowed by the lack of trust in the Israeli government's ability to deliver a piece particularly this government, spearheaded by Benjamin Netanyahu, and the ultra-Right Wing government. 86 percent of Palestinians do not believe peace is attainable with this Israeli government. So this is a very clear indicator that, you know, for the average Palestinian as per the data, they want results and less politics.",

Is it clear that there is an alternative, you know, a credible alternative there for, the sort of Palestinians, the man and woman on the street that you've been talking to?",
