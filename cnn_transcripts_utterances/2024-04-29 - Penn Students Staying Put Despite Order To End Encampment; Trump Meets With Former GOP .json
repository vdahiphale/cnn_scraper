You can see there are students right here basically having breakfast and getting ready for the day -- beginning their organization.Everything, like I said, is pretty calm here after a bit of a tense weekend because back on Friday night, the university actually told these protesters to disband this encampment. But as you can see, obviously, that has not happened. Now, this encampment went up back on Thursday night. It was a joint effort between students from Temple, Drexel, and the University of Pennsylvania. There was a peaceful march on Thursday. They came here and set up shop. Initially, there were only about 10 or maybe about a dozen tents that went up. Now you can see quite a bit more. The demand here, of course, similar to other universities we've seen disclose -- divest some of the investments that the university has. Now, what I can tell you is that the university initially said that they respect and support the right of this community to protest. But then about 24 hours, John, after that initial announcement the university put out on Thursday night -- well, then on Friday, the university really turned its page right there, saying that this encampment had blatantly violated the university's policies. That they got credible reports of harassing and intimidating conduct. And there is -- there was even incidents of -- incidents, I should say, of antisemitic graffiti that the university reported that they are investigating at this point as a hate crime. But that was the -- basically, the impetus for them then calling for this encampment to disband. Well, that was on Friday night into Saturday morning. Obviously, as you can see, this encampment has only grown since then. So at this point, it's a little unclear what will happen next. But these protesters -- as you said, John, they say they're here to stay until those demands are met. We'll be out here all day, John, to keep you posted on what happens here in Philadelphia -- John.",

They met for several hours yesterday -- their first meeting since DeSantis dropped out of the Republican primary in January, you'll recall, after his 30-point loss in Iowa to Donald Trump.DeSantis endorsed Trump after he left the race, but he endured months of attacks, and name-calling, and demeaning commentary from Donald Trump. You will remember the Ron DeSanctimonious nickname, of course. CNN's Alayna Treene joins us now. She's got a lot more on what was -- what happened inside the meeting. It seems proving, especially in politics, time heals all wounds, but what are you learning about this meeting?",

I mean, on one hand, I wouldn't say that all of a sudden, Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis are kumbaya and going to become best of friends after this one meeting, but it's a mutually beneficial thing for them to have some sort of peace right now.And you're right. Ron DeSantis immediately endorsed Donald Trump when he dropped out of the race in New Hampshire. However, the two have not spoken since then. They have not met yet. And so, that's really a hugely significant part of this meeting yesterday. And here is part of the thing. Donald Trump needs help fundraising, and he asked Ron DeSantis yesterday, we're told, if he could do that. And Ron DeSantis agreed. He said that he would tap into this donor network for the former president. At the same time, DeSantis also benefits from having this more smooth relationships with the former president. A lot of people close to DeSantis, as well as just in Republican politics in general, think it's untenable for DeSantis to continue to have kind of this chilled relationship with Donald Trump, especially, of course, as he is the presumptive Republican nominee. He could potentially be president. And so, it benefits DeSantis as well. Now, this meeting, we're told, was organized by Steve Witkoff. He's a luxury real estate developer that both men know very well in Florida. Witkoff is actually hosting a fundraiser for Donald Trump next weekend in Florida. And so, this meeting lasted several hours, and they really did try to smooth some things out. But again, when I talked to Donald Trump's team about this the way that I view it is a lot of people in Donald Trump's inner circle and the former president, himself, still harbor some tough feelings for the Florida governor, but they want to see this path forward because it helps them and it helps DeSantis as well -- Kate.",

I mean, Ron DeSantis is in the same category now as people like Ted Cruz. Listen if somebody talks about my wife like a dog, I don't care what they're running for, I'm never going to crawl back to them and do anything for them, let alone tap dance like Ted Cruz. Now, Ron DeSantis just kind of folding after calling Trump all of these names and saying that he wasn't fit to do this and that. I understand political banter. But there's going to be a book written long after Donald Trump is gone about how he was able to just get men to mold in his hands and kind of become shells of themselves. It's very interesting to see. I don't think this benefits Ron DeSantis too much but it definitely benefits Donald Trump. So I agree with David. It's a net-plus for him.",

Look, we see that with the current president's dogs. He had some German Shepherds there that probably weren't so best suited to be around a lot of people in the White House.

Ex-Trump fixer Michael Cohen's former banker Gary Farro will likely be on the stand. Remember, this entire case is about allegedly falsifying business records in order to cover up a relationship or a dalliance with former adult film actress Stormy Daniels. Farro is expected to walk the jury through how Cohen funded payments to Daniels through a home equity line of credit. With me now is criminal defense attorney William Brennan.I want to shift the focus to the gag order because still, we have no ruling from the judge on this. Donald Trump has talked about the jury. He's talked about witnesses. He's talked about family members of the judge. Why is it, do you think, that the judge has not issued a ruling -- a contempt ruling yet? WILLIAM BRENNAN, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY (via Webex by Cisco): Well, good morning, and thanks for having me. I think the reason that Judge Merchan has not yet issued a ruling is that he's juggling a lot of balls right now. He needs to get this trial to the jury. And he's really in a difficult position with regard to penalties because the ultimate penalty would be jail time, and if he puts this particular defendant in jail, it will be absolute chaos. Not only would it disrupt the trial, it would have a national ripple effect. I think he's holding the scepter of penalty over the defendant's head in the hopes that it will temper the future remarks of this particular defendant.",

He really is in an extremely difficult position there.So if you -- if you -- if you flip it on its face and -- say he issued a ruling today and it was -- I think in New York, the maximum penalty per count is $1,000. And he says well, there's 15 allegations, there's $15,000. I mean, what effect practically would it have on this particular defendant? So he's in a tough spot. I don't think that the ruling is as pressing as the threat of sanctions. He could always impose sanctions after the trial, but this thing is rolling along.

But then, that number jumped to more than 321,000 in 2023. And, John, so far this year, we're already at more than 94,000 measles cases.The reason why health officials say we're seeing this rise is because we're seeing a drop in vaccination coverage. And we know that measles can spread so easily if people are not vaccinated. I mean, the virus is so contagious if an infected person coughs or sneezes it can linger in the air for up to two hours. But with the vaccine, we know two doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine is 97 percent effective. So that is our best defense against this virus. And that's why health officials say this rise in cases is alarming and something that they're watching very closely, John.",

The League sent out a memo yesterday about the changes that are planned and they're also promising to make the lettering on the back of the uniforms bigger. The MLB Players Association blames the issues solely on Nike's new design, saying in a statement and memo that at its core, what has happened here is that Nike was innovating something that didn't need to be innovated.
