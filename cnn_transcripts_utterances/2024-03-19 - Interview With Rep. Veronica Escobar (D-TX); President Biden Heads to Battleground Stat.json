He says he was bound by executive privilege. So, I asked him when he took questions if he regrets not just going to the House Select Committee and explaining that privilege to them. And he said that, no, he has no regrets. He wouldn't have done that, because that would have been breaking his oath of office. Here's a little bit more of what he had to say to the media today.

They both got these subpoenas in the House January 6 investigation and didn't respond to them in any substantial way, didn't show up for testimony. But Bannon's difference is that he had a letter that served as what he believed could be some sort of evidence showing that maybe he was directed by Donald Trump not to show up. Now, why he's appealing and why it's on hold is because that particular letter, because of the law, he couldn't show that at his trial. So, his attorneys are appealing on a lot of legal issues around how to prosecute these cases, what actually he could bring into court about executive privilege and as a defense, a very different situation than what Peter Navarro is experiencing.

Don't complain about the length of his sentence, which can be off- putting to people who have been in prison for a long time. He can do his job with humility.

Or he can do what so many prisoners do, sit in the chow hall and lament and complain. The great thing about complaining in prison is, it will eventually be your turn, and there will be others who will be willing to listen to those complaints. The choice is his. But if someone tells you cannot find respite or privacy in federal prison, that tells me they haven't been to federal prison. If he wants it, he can do it. But it's going to require an adjustment, I think, in his attitude. Again, it is a little blip in his life. Use the experience for good to teach, rather than complain, which is what too many new prisoners do. All eyes will be on him. I hope he adjusts properly for his -- for his sake and his family's sake.

Ultimately, more than about 120,000 people -- 120,000 people were evacuated from Afghanistan, but the U.S. military lost members, several members, in the process. On August 26, a suicide bombing at the airport killed 13 American troops and more than 150 Afghans.

Expect also Mark Milley, who's the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to reiterate that he has regrets about how this was handled and his recommendations to the president and to the National Security Council that they begin evacuations much sooner than they were actually started, which was really at the 11th hour, in August, right before the Taliban began to overrun Kabul.

They have demanded that people be fired for it. And, importantly, they have demanded that some testimony from the surviving service members, surviving Marines be taken into account in the Pentagon's investigation of what happened here, because, at least one former -- at least one Marine said that he had the opportunity to take out the attacker that was responsible for this Abbey Gate bombing, but he was not given the appropriate permission to actually do that. Now, the Pentagon has conducted a new review, an additional review of what happened at Abbey Gate, and they have just completed that investigation, including testimony from 12 additional service members who were not interviewed as part of the first probe. The findings of that investigation have yet to be released, but they have been briefed, we are told, or they will be very soon, to the family members.

We saw the way that he demonized communities, Latino communities. My own community was demonized as well.

But on the issue of immigration, with President Biden backing that bipartisan Senate bill that would have sharply restricted asylum claims, it would have allowed him to shut down the border, all without providing a pathway for dreamers and the other priorities that Democrats have had for years on immigration, do you think that that slightly more aggressive approach on border security resonates with voters, like in your district in El Paso, where, as I noted before, the very negative aspects to unfettered immigration are felt the most?",

And he gave us a bill. He gave Congress a bill early on in his administration that would have provided a pathway to citizenship for dreamers, that would have provided legal pathways for immigrants. In the end, people -- Americans want solutions. And, yes, this moment calls for opening up legal pathways and providing opportunities for new Americans, but we also have to change outdated border policies. I have my own particular views on how to best do that, but the president has shown time and again he wants to work with Congress to address this. But if you don't have a willing Republican Party -- and, in fact, in many ways, the Republican Party of today wants to create as much chaos as possible -- we are going to tell the American people about that. We're going to make sure that we remind them it's Republicans who have refused to provide Border Patrol and other law enforcement agencies with the resources that they need.
