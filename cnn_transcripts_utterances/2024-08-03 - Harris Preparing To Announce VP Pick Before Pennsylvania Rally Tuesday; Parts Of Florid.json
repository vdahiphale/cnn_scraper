      "sentences": "Hello. Thanks so much for joining me. I'm Jim Sciutto, in today for Fredricka Whitfield.A pivotal moment in the race for the White House. This weekend, Vice President Kamala Harris is preparing to make her most important decision perhaps, since officially becoming the presumptive Democratic nominee. Harris is now in the final stages of choosing her running mate. Sources familiar with the process say she is meeting with the top candidates this weekend, job interviews, you might call them. Just moments ago, CNN crews saw former attorney general Eric Holder entering the vice president's residence. Sources tell us he is handling the vetting process for the VP pick. On Friday, Harris won enough delegates to become her party's nominee for president. And she will now become the first black woman, first Asian-American to lead a major party ticket. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez is here with me. Priscilla, it's a big decision for the campaign. I'll ask you, how close do you think it is but also how she's handling the process?",

      "sentences": "Well, it's also a big decision for the vice president herself as someone who also holds that position now.Look, the vice president likes to take her time. This has been true over the course of her political career. She asks a lot of questions. She pours over data again and again, but she's on a truncated timeline this time. So they have to make these decisions quite quickly. So that is how sources -- tell us she's approaching it the same way with the knowledge, of course, that she's going to have to also depend on the team around her going through vetting to come to this decision. Now as to who is on that shortlist, we have Pennsylvania Governor Shapiro, Minnesota Governor Walz, Arizona Senator Kelly, see their photos there, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. So quite a few lined up there. The vice president is expected to meet with them over the course of the weekend. And one of the things that's under consideration as well is who helps her the most, whose strengthens her chances. But also an awareness that whoever she picks is going to give us this early window into how she's thinking about the next few weeks and months, and what her policies may shape up to be. So this is a massive decision and one that they want to roll out by Tuesday because she's going to have her rally in Philadelphia where they're going to unveil the running mate and then go on a blitz across battleground states. Ao again, we've talked so much about how quick all of this has been since President Biden dropped out of the race. And this is just another example of that in this just probably unprecedented timeline.",

CNN's Alayna Treene -- Alayna Treene joins us now ahead of tonight's campaign stop. So Alayna, we got a difference of opinion here. Trump agreed to the ABC debate.

      "sentences": "Well, it's unclear how this is going to be worked out, Jim. But this is what Donald Trump and his campaign have been saying for weeks now, ever since Joe Biden had ended his campaign.They have argued that he is not bound by the same rules and the same agreements as before, meaning that he, you know, just because he had agreed to a debate with Joe Biden, doesn't necessarily means he had agreed to debate Kamala Harris. Now we did hear Donald Trump say last night on Truth Social, his social media site that he does still want to debate her, but he wants to do it with Fox News and with a full audience. Again, very different from the original terms for that ABC debate on September 10. I'm going to read for you some of what he wrote. He said, quote, \"I have agreed with Fox News to debate Kamala Harris on Wednesday September 4. The debate was previously scheduled against Sleepy Joe Biden on ABC, but has been terminated, and that Biden will no longer be a participant.\" He went on to say that that he was in litigation with ABC and that they will have different rules for that Fox News debate. In a separate post, he continued to say, \"I've spent hundreds of millions its of dollars time and effort fighting Joe. And when I won the debate, they threw a new candidate into the ring. Bot fair, but it is what it is. Nevertheless, different candidate or not, their bad policies are the same and this will be strongly revealed at the September 4 debate.\" And again, as Priscilla just laid out to you Jim, Kamala Harris has not agreed to that debate. So it's very unclear what is going to happen here. But I want to focus on that second post that I just -- that quote I just read for you because that is exactly how Donald Trump and his campaign are feeling about this. They recognize that their entire campaign has been upended and they are still trying to figure out the best way to define Harris and to go after her. And I do think that this change in venue this change of the host for this debate as part of them trying to reclaim control. And of course, I know that they also believe that perhaps Fox News may be friendlier toward Donald Trump. So it's very unclear how this is going to move forward.",

Instead he delved into a racist attack and it's kind of reminiscent of his 2016 playbook. However, now that he has made those and that they are out there, I am told when I talked to his campaign, he is not going to run away from it and said he's going to continue those lines of attack. Weve seen him do so already. And the messaging moving forward is going to try to be to paint Harris as quote, unquote \"phony\".

And yes, perhaps getting all the way up to about 75 miles per hour, which would in fact be a category one hurricane. That's why they have hurricane watches in effect for portions of the Big Bend of Florida. And then a lot of tropical storm warnings along much of the western coastline that you can see here. From there, then the storm kind of begins to push back out over open Atlantic. But as you'll notice it just kind of sits. It doesn't really move all that much. And that's not just the National Hurricane Center's forecast. If you look at the models I mean, it looks like something a five-year-old withdraw. They're all over the place. And there's a reason for that because you may look at it and say, ok, why? Well, there's a lot of steering factors involved here. Right now. Youve got this high-pressure system here that's starting to push it a little bit farther east, ok. But you have this front right here that's blocking it from going too far north and also pushing it east. But then you have this high pressure that's saying hold up not too far east. So it has this very narrow corridor here where it can end up going in a very slow period of time. So you're talking about a tremendous amount of rain, Jim.

And back in 2006 when the airport was struck at the early days of the war by Israeli war planes, the U.S. did manage to evacuate some of the U.S. nationals out of here, but it was quite chaotic. Now, for instance, Kuwaiti Airlines is the latest airline to announce that it's going to stop flying to Beirut. Tomorrow they said is their last flight? And it's not clear when they will resume flying to Beirut. That's just the latest airline to make such an announcement. Today, we also heard from the Minister of Economy and Trade who warned people not to hoard food. He reassured the public that there is an adequate amount of food available. At the moment, you don't really get the sense that there is panic but there is real fear that when Hezbollah, when Iran retaliate for these series of assassinations here in Beirut and in Tehran, that this time, it's not going to be like in April where it was a very orchestrated telegraphed strike by Iran 12 days after that Israeli strike on the diplomatic complex in Damascus. This time it's widely believed that not only will Iran strike, but all of its allies in the region. Hezbollah, of course, and we've heard secretary general of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah say that's what they're going to do but also the Houthis in Yemen and various pro- Iranian militias in Syria and Iraq.

Well, as you heard in that piece, they said the Secret Service never asked us what our perspective was of the event that day. Well, the acting director said yesterday that they do plan on interviewing the local sniper teams that were on the ground as part of their review.

And her toes may have scraped the roof on that arena.She reclaims her Olympic gold from the 2016 games. Her first vault, Jim, she did the Yurchenko double play. To put it simply, it's a vault that includes a full extra flip than any other gymnast there. She says every time she does it she's terrified, but she smiled and sighed after landing. Her mom was jumping. Farrell, John Travolta, Allyson Felix (ph), other celebs there to witness greatness and after nailing her final vault, it was a wrap. She became just the second ever to win two Olympic vault titles. Rebecca Andrade of Brazil took Silver and Jade Carey of the U.S.A. took the bronze. She was all smiles, getting hugs from teammates afterwards. Now Simone, seven Olympic gold, this more than any American gymnast. She now has three here in Paris with still a chance at two more. And behind me, the U.S. women's soccer team, they're moving on. It was a packed house, loud at Parc des Princes, the home of Paris Saint- Germain for the U.S. versus Japan quarter final match. Fans were chanting during the wave. Match was scoreless in through regulation time. But in the first half of extra time, the U.S.A. Trinity Rodman scored a phenomenal strike. They hold on to earn their trip to the semifinals. The'll face the winner of Germany- Canada next. Finally, humans who continue to defy the odds and gravity. One of them is Team U.S.A shot putter Ryan Crouser. He pushes the limits of strength of power repeatedly breaking his own world records. I sat down with the gargantuan, two-time reigning Olympic champ, and quickly realized he's actually a gentle, cerebral giant. Check it out. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RYAN CROUSER, TEAM U.S.A., SHOT PUTTER: A third gold for me would be so special simply because I'd be the first to do it. No one has ever won three golds in the shot, let alone three consecutive golds. So just honored to have the opportunity and the chance to make history. And I'm going to go out there and do my best.",
