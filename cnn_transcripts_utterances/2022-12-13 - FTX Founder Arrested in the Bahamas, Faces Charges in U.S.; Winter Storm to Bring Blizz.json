This whole system spins eastward and is going to cause quite the issue. Notice the ice across parts of North Dakota, back into southwest Minnesota and into northwest Iowa. Ice storm warnings are in effect. We are talking about picking up half an inch to roughly a quarter of an inch. Regardless, it's going to cause widespread power outages if that's the case.Blizzard warnings also in effect for parts of the upper Midwest and back down into the Northern Plains. This is where we're picking up winds of 35 miles per hour over a three-hour period of time, dropping visibility down to a quarter of a mile or less. Winds already strong. We had advisories in place for Iowa back into the Midwest and high wind warnings where we can expect wind gusts over 60 miles per hour at times. Not only that, but we're also focused on this here. Notice how the winds stay strong even when the snow stops, it doesn't take much. Visibilities will be wiped out for the next 24 to 48 hours. Forecast snowfall totals picking up Pine Ridge here over 30 inches within just the next three days' time and that's across the Rockies. So higher peaks could pick up more. Look at this, Bald Hill Dam picking up already 1/10 of an inch of ice. And this is in north and South Dakota as of this morning with additional ice accumulation. We talked about quarter of an inch to half an inch here, you can see where it's going to fall. The purple showing you where we'll have the thicker ice. And again, it doesn't take much for widespread power outages, trees to go down and then of course, slick spots all over. So, travel not advised within the locations. But within the warm sector, the area between the warm front and cold front, we have a lot of warm moist air coming in from the Gulf of Mexico. Windshear and of course the lift from the boundaries. So, you see that area highlighted in red traveling eastward. Right now, we are expecting this to come into play late tonight and into early Wednesday with an enhanced risk for severe weather. What's that mean? Well, we have a greater risk of damaging winds as well as long lived strong tornadoes. So, we really have to pay attention to that. And on top of it, the threat for flooding picking up an additional 2 to 4 inches of rain -- Max, Bianca.",

They couldn't get a deal to fund the entire federal government so they punted 12 appropriations bills to fund all federal agencies, punted that until this Friday creating a new deadline of this coming Friday but they are unable to meet that deadline as well.So, Congress is expected to delay it for another week to give them more time to try to cut a large scale spending deal. The final number has not been decided yet. But it could be around the range of $1.75 trillion. If they do get an agreement on that large bill, it would be unveiled and likely be pushed through Congress in a matter of days giving lawmakers very little time to review it. Now if they don't get a bill on that big bill, that means it will likely be punted into the new Congress. That will be a whole new power dynamic on Capitol Hill. Republicans will control the House. Democrats have a narrow majority in the Senate. It's uncertain still who will be next speaker of the house. Kevin McCarthy is pushing to do just that. But he will have a narrow majority in the new Republican House -- 222 seats. You need 218 votes to pass legislation. And the question will be if they just punt it into next year getting this conference on board behind something that they are divided over, as well as getting agreement between the Senate Democrats and the Democrat in the White House, all raising major questions about whether they can get there. Which is why there is an enormous push to get this done this year. Get this done in the final weeks of this year. Get an agreement that would include all funding not just for the Pentagon and key agencies like that, but also funding for Ukraine, $37 billion to fund the effort in Ukraine. As well as policy issues such as overhaul the Electoral Count Act which would be aimed to prevent another January 6th. So, can they get there? It's still an open question as lawmakers struggle to get a deal after months of talks. Manu Raju, CNN, Capitol Hill. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

That means they've succeeded in taking two hydrogen atoms and using 192 powerful lasers to force those atoms to fuse together unleashing the same kind of energy that powers the sun and stars.Until now that has been incredibly difficult to replicate here on earth. The key is though that they've been able to release more energy from the reaction than they use in the fusion process itself and that's critically important. For anything to be a viable source it needs to have a higher energy output than the energy input used to generate the power. So, this is huge moment, mostly because the discovery could eventually unlock an unlimited cheap, clean power source for the world. Now this discovery has also proved this is a viable energy source and no longer a hypothetical scenario. But as major as this is, in the quest to pivot away from dirty energy sources, like fossil fuels, we are still a far way off from powering our homes by way of nuclear fusion. It's estimated it could take two, even three decades before this energy source is widely used. Rene Marsh, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
