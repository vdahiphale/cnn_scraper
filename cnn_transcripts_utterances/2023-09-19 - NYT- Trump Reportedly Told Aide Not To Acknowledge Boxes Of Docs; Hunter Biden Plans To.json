A major development in the Justice Department's investigation into Trump's handling of classified documents. According to \"The New York Times,\" Trump specifically told Molly Michael, his former assistant, to play dumb if she was questioned by federal officials about the boxes of sensitive documents stashed at Mar-a-Lago. And we understand the words, according to a person briefed in her comments, \"The New York Times\" says the specific words he used were, you don't know anything about the boxes. That's what he told his assistant. You don't know anything about him. Well, of course, these are those same boxes that you've seen pictures of so many times, right, that were openly stored in a ballroom, and of course in, a bathroom. Now, Molly Michael worked for Trump in the White House and in his post-presidential office. She also reportedly is telling investigators that Trump would give her to-do lists, sometimes just written on documents that when she looked at them, she realized were marked \"classified.\" This is also according to \"The New York Times\" report here that I've got in my hand. Now, it's unclear what those classified documents were about. We don't know that at this point. We do, of course, know, that Trump's kept documents about the U.S. nuclear program, plans for attacks, and more, in those boxes. I want to go OUTFRONT now straight to Trump White House attorney Ty Cobb. And, Ty, appreciate your taking the time to be with me. So, again, the quote here Molly Michael, former assistant to Donald Trump tells investigators, quote, you don't know anything about the boxes. What do you hear when you hear those words?",

Molly very highly regarded person, very loyal to the president, but there's a difference between loyalty and breaking the law. And that's not a line she was going to cross.

Could that have impact on the case in Fulton County? CHRIS TIMMONS, TRIAL ATTORNEY &amp; FORMER GEORGIA PROSECUTOR: Absolutely, Erin. I think it's got three possibilities of coming in. One, the least likely is a re-indictment including these additional predicate acts and further into the conspiracy. I don't think it fits quite that neatly. Second, it could be brought in and there'd have to be a motion filed under what's referred to as similar acts, that it's -- that it's close to or even brought in as maybe kind of a distant part of the RICO scheme but under a motion what we refer to as evidence Rule 404B. And then the third one, I think the -- I think the former president is going to take the opportunity to testify in the Georgia case. I really do. A number of people think that he's not going to. I think he's not going to miss that opportunity to be on every television in the entire world. And if he does testify, Erin, then at that point it comes as impeachment evidence and it shows that he lacks credibility and is dishonest. So, I think it's coming in under one of those two ways.

This is a debate, though, that Republican voters will be watching closely across the country and in the state of New Hampshire, that crucial early voting state. It's been make or break in history. And John King has just returned from a lot of reporting there, doing what he does best, getting at the heart of the issues with the people who will decide the winner, the voters. And John King is OUTFRONT at the magic wall. So, you know, John, I know you've spent so much time just talking to people, going and spending the time. So, how much momentum does Trump have in New Hampshire? Obviously, the context is nationally he's, you know, it's not even a contest in the polls. What about New Hampshire?",

There's no doubt from our conversations with voters from talking to politicos in the know, other political strategist across the campaigns, that Trump has a lead. This is 2016.Remember, New Hampshire was his first win. There's no question he's at least this good for Donald Trump. Some people think he's even stronger. He got 35 percent and he won. Remember, like, then there is a crowded field of candidates now. And so, Donald Trump has all these other opponents. He has a lead. The momentum question is interesting, though, because even some Trump supporters now, Erin, say, you know, he's run before he's not new, why isn't he tweeting more and being more combative. He has these legal issues that have turn some Republicans away. So, a lead, yes. Momentum I think is an interesting question.",

Let's go back into 2016 timeline. This is Andrew Konchek. He's a commercial fisherman up there. He was drawn to Donald Trump in 2016, outsider, businessman, he wanted him. Pete Burdett, 20-year-plus navy veteran, drawn to Donald Trump in 2016. Different, promised to help the veterans, a different voice. This is Natalya Orlando. She was for Rand Paul back in 2016. So, we'll put her there in the other Republican candidates. Lucas Raymond here, also a commercial fisherman. Again, saw Donald Trump as an outsider. He's registered as an independent but he voted in the Republican primary back then. This Stanley Tremblay leans Republicans, sat it out. He's disgusted with politics. This is 2016, right? So, you see Donald Trump. Of these five voters, getting three of the votes. Here is where we are now, though. Pete Burdett, he liked Trump then. You know what, Erin?

But just the opposite has happened. Whistle-blowers in a number of African countries have told CNN that the Kremlin is consolidating its power over Wagner networks -- in the Central African Republic, in Sudan, in Libya and in Mali. And now that network has expanded further, this time into Chad. Chad has really been impacted by the fighting in neighboring Sudan. And, yet, it's emerging as a key transit point for supplies to the Rapid Support Forces in Sudan, part of an expansion of Russia's influence in Africa. Cross-referencing testimony from intelligence and military sources active in the region with satellite imagery, CNN has uncovered evidence that Wagner arms crossed through Chad within the last two weeks to get to an RSF military base in Sudan. If you look closely, you can see over a hundred vehicles including scores of trucks at the base, proof the supplies provided by Russia, Wagner continue. A strike on Wagner-backed forces in Sudan would constitute a blow to Moscow. If it is Ukraine, they will have raised the stakes for those willing to accept Wagner's backing in the future.
