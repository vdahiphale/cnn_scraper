First up, though, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is in Italy are protesters there urging him to take his controversial judicial overhaul plan off the table. Nearly half a million people in Ukraine second biggest city are without power that's Kharkiv following Thursday's strikes across the country. A shooting rampage in Germany leaves several people dead police still searching for a motive. And later in the show, I'll speak to Pakistan's Former Prime Minister Imran Khan, about the political crisis brewing there. Right you with us for the second hour of \"Connect the World\". After a seven year cold spell and a rivalry that goes back decades two of the Middle East's biggest players, Iran and Saudi Arabia have agreed to resume diplomatic ties and reopen their embassies within two months. Now this deal was brokered notably in Beijing. The country's cut off ties back in 2016, when Saudi executed a prominent shear cleric. But the consequences of the Saudi Iran rivalry is hard to understate from sectarian violence across the region to a devastating proxy war in Yemen. So tonight, we ask what will be the impact and consequences of a Saudi Iran rapprochement. Well, Salman Al Ansari is a Saudi Political Research. He joins me now live from Riyadh.

I actually have some kind of like mixed feelings about resumingrelations between Saudi Arabia and Iran, since I and many others survived an assassination attempt by the Iranian regime when I attended an Iranian opposition conference in Paris in 2018. But to answer your question, definitely the official statement of resuming Saudi Iranian relations via Chinese mediation, with no doubt a bold, geopolitical move in an extremely sensitive time. And as we all know that the Saudi - the King of Saudi Arabia was forced to cut ties with Iran after the Iranian outrageous attack and burning of the Saudi Embassy in Tehran in 2016 plus, also attacking the Saudi Consulate in another city in Iran, which is called Mashhad. Anyway, resuming the relations will surely have unprecedented global strategic implications. And I'm saying global, not only regional, why, because the U.S. has, as you have seen, has praised the move publicly. But somehow I can surely sense that there are the Americans are not very happy for the fact that China was behind the mediation. But you guys in the U.S. can actually tell more about that, since definitely, the U.S. sees itself as the security guarantor of the Middle East. And China is posing itself as the one who can facilitate peace between the two biggest rivals in the Middle East.",

And definitely, the United States is considered to be the security partner of Saudi Arabia and the number one security partner in the Kingdom. But at the same time, as I said, we need to have a different way of looking at things because if you always do what you've always done, you'll always get what you've always gotten. And we don't want to keep repeating the same appeasement policies with Iran through the Western nations. So we need to find someone who has more leverage on Iran than the U.S. and the West at large. So I think that's going to be a strategic move.

Look, before I let you go, these are busy times on the diplomatic front, for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia across a myriad of files let's just go through those files. Just this week, rapprochement with Iran, Saudis Foreign Ministry in Moscow, offering to do \"Whatever is necessary to resolve the conflict in Ukraine\" while there, he also reiterated calls for a ceasefire in Yemen. And we see reporting in Western press today that the Kingdom is looking to reset relations with Washington, possibly through the lens of normalization, with Israel.

So all of a sudden, we've seen today, the announcement of this agreement that has been mediated by China. So it shows that Saudi Arabia is all about having zero conflict with everyone. Because the Saudi model is very clear. And I actually call it the development model, because Saudi Arabia, as we all know, has been ranked by the United Nations just recently, a couple of weeks ago, as the biggest donor or provider of development aid in the whole world. And when it comes to our rival, unfortunately, Iran, they have been providing what bloodshed, destruction, and tourism. So all what we want to tell to the Iranian regime is that your regime is not sustainable and they have no option whatsoever to survive if they don't change course and become a normal nation that rather than just a revolutionary one. And the Saudis succeeded on setting this model of development and we want everyone to go through the model that Saudi Arabia and rational states in the region, the region one so yes.",

Well, authorities in Kyiv say power and water now restored but that isn't the case in the nations' second largest city nearly half a million residents of Kharkiv are without electricity after Russia's attack on Thursday. Mean time in Kyiv they are honoring a fallen hero from the fighting in Bakhmut CNN's Ivan Watson was there as Ukraine made a solemn farewell. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) IVAN WATSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): This is how Ukraine is honoring one of its fallen warriors, a young man 27-years- old named Dmytro Kotsiubailo. He was the youngest battalion commander in the Ukrainian armed forces killed this week in that grinding battle of Bakhmut that has gone on for months. Now he went under the codename Vinci. And Kotsiubailo was famous in Ukraine, because as a teenager, he had joined the pro-democracy protests here in Kyiv's Maidan Square a face off against the security forces in which the protesters ultimately won and a pro-Russian President fled to neighboring Russia. And he joined a militia group after that battling pro-Russian forces in the Donbas region, a group called \"The Right Sector\" whose flags had been demonstrated here and patches as well. Now Moscow considers that organization a terrorist group and denounces them as Nazis. But last year, the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, gave the Vinci the award calling him a hero of Ukraine. Now, he is being laid to rest and as you can see, he is truly regarded as a hero by many Ukrainians. This underscores the immense costs that the battle for Bakhmut the cost that is incurring on the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Ukrainian commanders insist that this battle is bleeding, the Russian military dry, but it is also causing immense sacrifice for the Ukrainian Armed Forces. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

So, we're learning that the U.S. and Western officials, including NATO officials haveseen evidence of Russia capturing Western provided weapons on the battlefield, including Javelin anti-tank missiles and Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, and sending them to Iran. And that is likely because Iran is going to try to reverse engineer them, and try to make their own kind of system that they can then proliferate in the region. Now, this is significant, because of course, this is part of the growing partnership that we're seeing between Russia and Iran, which has really intensified over the last year amid Russia's war in Ukraine, where Russia increasingly desperate for help in that war has turned to Iran for a lot of its military equipment, including drones. Well, now we're seeing that that is starting to go in the other direction as well. Iran is asking Russia for military equipment. And as part of this partnership, Russia is now giving some of these western weapons to Iran so that they can basically take them apart and reproduce them which Iran is actually very adept at, and has done many times in the past with U.S. weapons that they have captured. Now, we should note that the U.S. and Western officials that we speak to say that this is not an extremely widespread issue. It's not systematic, but they have seen multiple instances of this happening. And they're able to track it somewhat because the Ukrainians actually tell the Pentagon every time, they are unable to rescue essentially a U.S. provided system on the battlefield, either because they are overrun, or they have to withdraw it very quickly. And so, they tell the Defense Department, every time a U.S. provided weapon falls into the hands of Russian forces. So, the U.S. is aware of this, they see it as kind of a regular part of warfare, right? It is kind of unavoidable. But the part about the Russian sending this equipment to Iran is a little bit more concerning. And one expert told me that it could pose a really serious risk to the region considering all of Iran's proxy forces that are proliferating throughout the region. And of course, the fear that many Middle Eastern countries have about Iran's growing influence there, Becky.",

They say that they have had patients a targeted as they've tried to go to the clinic that is not safe, that there have been stray bullets that have hit their clinic. And simply for the time being at least that they cannot continue to provide medical services in this part of the Haitian capital and that will mean for the hundreds of thousands of people that live in Cite Soleil, that they will not have access, many of them at least to any medical services, because this is one of, we're told one of the few clinics that is operating in this part of Port-au-Prince. And what that will mean as the gang violence has gotten worse and worse over the last several months is that, that the aid groups that provide these very basic services because these are services the government in many parts of Haiti is not able to provide. And they will simply become unavailable to many of the Haitians who desperately need these services. And the Haitian government has called on the international community to provide more assistance to the Haitian police to combat these gangs. And then there has been assistance by the part of several foreign governments. But what the Haitian government has asked for actual for military boots on the ground has not come a few countries, no countries at this point; seem to be willing to provide that. So as Haiti, the situation gets worse and worse for the people on the ground and Haitians that are trying to go to work, trying to go their school, trying to just receive medical attentions.
