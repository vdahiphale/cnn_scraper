But, Richard, that just certainly has not been what has been shown in the voting so far. And I would suspect tomorrow as well, we know that he finished that disappointing second finish in Iowa because, remember, it wasn't even a close second. It was a very distant second. And he was able to go home to Florida. It was the first time he'd been back since December 26 on Thursday. And that's when those conversations really started for him to take it all in. One source I was talking to that is within the fundraising world for DeSantis, they knew it was going to be harder to keep raising money. And that's what makes these campaigns go at the end of the day, right, all the money. And so, it just a political reality really set in. I mean, we're told he made that final decision yesterday right before, you know, in short order, the video was recorded and the announcement was made that there just was not a way forward.

And when you have a former chief for the IDF, like Gadi Eisenkot saying, we cannot defeat Hamas militarily, then that thought begins to sink in, that Hamas cannot be vanquished 100%. The Army speaks about destroying their military capability and their threat to Israel, but these realities are settling in. And I think it is accepted that every day this many IDF soldiers on the ground inside Gaza is a danger to their lives and unexpected things happen in the battle here. We had just a couple of weeks ago a large number of soldiers caught out in a large blast. These are terrible losses individually for every family, but they're blows to the country as well.
