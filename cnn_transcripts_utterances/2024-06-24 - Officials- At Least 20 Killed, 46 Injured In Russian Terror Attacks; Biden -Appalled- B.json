      "sentences": "Yes, it turns out three of what we think of five or six attackers here were actually related to a local official, the head of the Sergokalinsky region, a part of Dagestan called Magamadamorrow (ph).Now one was his son, one was his nephew, and one appears to be a slightly distant cousin who was also a local MMA fighter. Now, it is unclear what affinity this group may have had with the usual suspect you point the finger at from an attack like this, ISIS- K, the offshoot of ISIS, that works in Afghanistan, Central Asia. And more recently in Russia, responsible for that horrific attack on a shopping mall just three months ago now. But this was, it seemed, coordinated, targeting Jewish and Christian places of residence, relatively well prepared. Some questions as to exactly how the civilian toll appeared to be so low. About four were of these 20 dead civilians that we know of at this point. Russians are always very transparent about these matters. And so many of the dead policemen. But the images are of clashes in Makhachkala and Derbent, the two cities affected by this, clashes in their streets for hours, it seems, as police struggled to get this under control. And there were two real abiding questions here that many Russians and Dagestanis, too, frankly in a pretty poor and troubled region where Islamic violence has been an issue for decades now. Firstly, could this have been prevented if most of the Russian military wasn't currently fighting Putin's war of choice in Ukraine? So many of the soldiers who've died in that war have, in fact, come from Dagestan where we saw protests just a couple of years ago now because people were so angry at so many of their sons being sent to fight this war. And secondly, what of Islamist extremism in Russia. Putin essentially came to power back in 1999, saying he would kill the Chechen separatists, who he said were responsible for apartment bombings in Moscow. Well, then we had many, many terrorist atrocities since then. And now still that Islamist extremist threat is in a new generation, a new threat, causing attacks like this that, again, Moscow, it seems is powerless to prevent. Back to you.",

This marks the second spacewalk in recent days that's abruptly been called off for space suit issues. It's also the latest in a string of setbacks for the current crew aboard the ISS, which includes those Boeing Starliner astronauts whose return home has been delayed.

That's Joe Biden. At the same time, I think it's a little bit naive for some of the people to think that if Israel would just suddenly just stop doing what it's doing, that rainbows and bunnies and sunshine would break out over the Middle East it would all be -- you know, all be fine. The hostages have to be returned. People have called for a ceasefire, call for ceasefire on both sides. Hamas is still firing its rockets. They still have hostages kidnapped. So this is a complex issue. But here's what's not complicated. Politics can be complicated. Geopolitics can be really complicated. How you treat your neighbors, how you treat people in your community is not complicated. You don't run up -- I haven't seen Jewish people running up on mosques with Israeli flags. If they did that, I'd be denouncing that, too. There are certain things you don't do. It is a red line. If you want to be a part for protests and they say we're going to go to a Jewish community center, we're going to go to a mosque, we're going to go to a Jewish restaurant, that's not a protest. That's the pogrom. That's an anti-Jewish bigoted act. If you want to be a part of a protest, let's go to a mosque, let's go and harass the Muslims. That's not a protest. So we've got to get clear in our country what is a fair protest about policy and you can agree or disagree, and what's going after people, human beings, terrifying moms, grandmas, children, who are trying to be a part of a neighborhood. The Jewish neighborhoods in L.A. are well-known. Nobody is confused where they are. So if you show up, they're wearing Kafia (ph), you show up there with your face covered, you show up there chanting \"river to the sea,\" that'll be just like a white person running up with the Confederate flag in Harlem. You're not trying to start a -- a conversation. You're trying to start a fight. Stop doing that. Don't do that. We don't want more violence. We don't want more fear. We don't want more terrified people. We've got to be able to come together as a country. If either side had an easy answer, it would have been solved. I'm less concerned about the politicians now. I'm concerned about the people in my community in Los Angeles moving in a direction that is more and more dangerous, more and more scary, more and more destructive. The Jewish community does not need to have people doing those types of things. It's not helping anybody in Palestine, but it's making America a much less safe place for everybody.",
