If you plead the Fifth, you can then -- the opponents can go in a court and say to the world, look, he has pled the Fifth, he must have something to hide. So, it cuts both ways.The other thing is that there is this other case among many going on with the state attorney general in New York where he wouldn't even admit to basic facts like, does the Trump Organization exist? And they're seeking to have him held in contempt of court over that. It's -- it's a way of gaming the system and not actually participating fairly in it.

A lot of Republican leaders are incensed that he got involved and helped Doug Mastriano become the nominee, and then the wipeout occurred. So, he has made -- he has picked up a lot more barnacles.

And the numbers are stunning. You talk about the historical context and where we are right now.Just for part of it, the survey found that the percentage of Americans who believe in antisemitic tropes has actually spiked in the last three years. Eighty-five percent now believe in at least one anti- Jewish trope compared to 61% in 2019. Why do you think that is?

So, we have a lot of context and a lot of experience.And indeed, in a world in which our leaders are normalizing antisemitism, whether from the right or from the left, blaming the Jewish people or the Jewish state, they normalize tropes like globalists, the idea that Jews control the banks and Wall Street and whatnot. It has become part of like the political conversation, Laura, in ways that were unimaginable few years ago. So, number one, you have politicians weaponizing antisemitism. Number two, extremists feel emboldened. They can make wild claims, again, about Zionists or globalists. These are euphemisms for Jews. And literally, they are running for office on such wild charges. And then, thirdly, social media is a super spreader of stereotypes. I mean, what we are seeing on Facebook and Twitter and TikTok would make your head spin. So, taken together, whether it's the extreme right demonizing the Jewish people, the radical left demonizing the Jewish state, we get caught in between. That is why, in addition to the attitudes, Laura, the anti-Jewish incidence have reached an all-time high. We have been tracking that for almost 45 years.

Trump is complicated, Laura. He has Jewish grandchildren. Yet he's dining with neo-Nazis. It is hard to square that. But at the end of the day, what is real and what is undeniable is with the rise of antisemitism, we need Jews and non-Jews, all people, to realize that this problem, as the prime minister said in the earlier segment, is not just a Jewish issue, it is everyone's issue because it starts with the Jews, but it never ends with us.

The zoo says that the cause and manner of death, they are trying to figure that out. But they do say that the death of the vulture was not by natural causes. So, they are investigating. They are trying to figure out who killed this vulture. And there is $10,000 reward for the arrest and the indictment of the individual that is responsible for that.

In the film world, we say, always point it in a safe direction. And the safe direction is open to interpretation. We might have a gun pointed at a camera, but there will be a sheet of (INAUDIBLE) or polycarbonate there to safety that. So, it's always not pointing at a person, per se, technically. But again, I think they're putting so much onus on the actor. He -- in my experience, we are supposed to safety the stage as though the actor can -- so that the actor can play fully, almost like a four- year- old, so they can completely be in that character, in that space, and not worrying about any other details. So, we make it very realistic and ultimately entirely safe. So, hence, blank use for over 100 years.
