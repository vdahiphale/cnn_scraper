More now from CNN's Kristen Holmes(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Donald Trump and his team were expecting an indictment and they were expecting an indictment imminently. However, they were still surprised when it actually came down. I've talked to a number of sources close to the former president who said that they met with lawyers. They heard about the summon. They have not yet actually seen this indictment. All they currently know is that there have been seven charges and that one of them is a conspiracy charge. Right now Donald Trump and his team are huddled at Bedminster. They are coming up with a plan to respond to this. We saw a short video that Trump put out. But they are looking at a larger plan of what exactly this looks like. Is he going to have to appear in Maimi? Is he going to give remarks in Miami? Is he going to come back to Bedminster and do that? We know that Donald Trump this weekend has two campaign events, one in North Carolina and one in Georgia. And I am told by number of sources that that is not going to change. He is still going to appear at those events. One of the things that we heard when he had the Manhattan indictment was that nothing was going to change and that is still the same messaging that we're getting now. Now of course, it is still early. This indictment is still new. There is a lot that can happen. But right now, they are planning on going forward with his 2024 campaign and you are likely to hear from the former president talking about how he believes that this is election interference. I've talked to a number of people close to the former president who say that they are going to be pushing that narrative. We do know that Trump's team has been calling his allies on The Hill shoring him up, making sure that they will get out there on the airwaves and defend him. So something to be watching for closely. Again, so much is still unknown even to the former president and his team. All they know is this is unprecedented and they are still working through what exactly the next several days are going to look like. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And in those types of cases having to deal with a grand jury, it's probable cause to believe that a crime was committed and that Donald Trump is the person that committed the crime.Of course, it's completely different than presenting the case at a jury trial where you have to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt. It's still too early to tell. However, we did get some insight as to what the evidence -- what evidence actually exists and we got a that when the probable cause affidavit was unsealed a year ago.

We are talking about a criminal case having to deal with the federal government. So, in terms of it may be possible and actually almost certain that he can be campaigning next year in 2024 and still have various cases lingering. We know that the New York case, that the New York district attorney's office, that case is slated for trial in March. The question will be, which case will go first. Is it going to be this case coming out of Florida? Is it going to be the New York case? Or is it going to be possibly the case coming out of Georgia? We just don't know at this point.

It is unconscionable for a president to indict the leading candidate imposing him.Now of course, we have to point out, President Biden didn't indict Trump, the U.S. Justice Department did. Now others in Congress are reacting to Trump's indictment. Republican Elise Stefanik tweeted: The radical far left will stop at nothing to interfere with the 2024 election in order to prop up the catastrophic Biden presidency. Florida Republican Senator Marco Rubio tweeted: There's no limit to what these people will do to protect their power even if it means ripping our country apart. California Democrat Adam Schiff says: For four years Trump acted like he was above the law but he should be treated like any other law breaker and today he has been. Republican presidential candidates are reacting to Trump's indictment. Florida governor Ron DeSantis claims the prosecutors are overly zealous and the law is being applied unevenly. Others spoke out even before the news of the indictment. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CHRIS CHRISTIE, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It's a bigger problem whether he's indicted or not. Because these are all self- inflicted wounds. SEN. TIM SCOTT (R-SC) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It is very, very dangerous to see and or feel like the Department of Justice is being weaponized against anyone in this country.

A lot of rainfall happen there. That was some good news. And obviously, we still have the smoke from British Columbia and Alberta that the fires are burning there.This is a PM2.5 detector. This tells us how many particles are in the air -- parts per million. And right now in the studio, there is five -- 005. When I took this outside earlier, it said 70. So there was 70 parts in the air outside. Well, it's better to be inside if you are looking at five compared to 70 and that's why they say, please go indoors or of course wear a mask. But watch what happens to this. This is my own personal 2.5 detector. I'm going to light a match, I'll put it out, and I'm going to blow a little bit of smoke. Just a little bit from one match. And watch what happens to the numbers here. From 100 to 300 and higher, it probably ends up somewhere 999 if it pegs all the way out. But at some of these -- this is the stuff that you are breathing in, these fine, fine particles that are in the air. So let's get to it. Where is the air quality bad? Well, still bad all up and down I-95 in the eastern part. The populated corridor of the United States. Also still bad up in Toronto, even a little bit across parts of Montreal. And that is the area where the smoke is coming from, where the fires are still, of course, burning out of control. Here's what the computer model thinks the smoke is going to look like by morning, by 5:00 in the morning here. Very heavy smoke here from about Windsor, that's Sault Ste Marie right there and then back across parts of Buffalo, Erie, into parts of Pittsburgh. That would be Somerset County and then all the way back towards Washington, D.C. Watch the orange though as I push the button and move this it into the evening. The orange begins to disperse a little bit. There's a bit of wind in the atmosphere for tomorrow to try to push this around and not make it so concentrated. And by Saturday afternoon most of the Northeast is cleared out, but still quite a bit of smoke here across parts of Ohio and into Pennsylvania. Another thing that's going to happen to help us get rid of this is some rain. We need the rain over the fires obviously, but we also could use the rain across parts of the areas that have seen so much smoke in the air. But something that's really going to play a big, big, big help here, is the wind. The wind will push this away into the Atlantic and away from the United States and eastern Canada. Here's how much rainfall we could get, half inch to an inch in some spots, especially over those fires, that will definitely be helpful for the firefighters. And then the wind and wind direction, coming from the south, bringing in drier air, cleaner air from the Atlantic Ocean, and then pushing it away by it looks like Tuesday this should all be a bad memory. But there's still fires and they're still smoke being emitted. So this may be a long-term issue for the eastern part of Canada and Northeastern U.S.",

Still so far over 2,300 people have been evacuated. About 120 of them are children. But Ukrainian officials want to see many more towns, villages and settlements downstream from the dam cleared as well as civilians. And then there's just the wider consequences here. Of course, you'll remember that this dam sits right on the frontlines, right on the Dnipro River. Ukraine and Russia have been trading accusations as to who's to blame for this massive humanitarian and ecological disaster. But President Zelenskyy in his nightly address minced no words. He says he accuses Russian troops of intentionally causing the dam's collapse as part of their battlefield strategy. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): This man-made disaster at the Nova Kakhovka hydroelectricity plant is not a natural disaster or a manifestation of the climate crisis.

You also have the concern for access to clean drinking water to potentially tens of thousands of people including families in Russian occupied Crimea could lose access to clean water because of this disaster. You have the concern around land mines. This is a frontline area.Again, there were land mines planted in that area. Ukrainian officials saying those land mines have shifted. It is unclear where they are. They are in the water. So another area of potential concern north of the dam, you have the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. It used the water, the reservoir from the dam to cool its nuclear reactors. So yet another potential concern. And then you have to remember again, this is a battlefield, this is the frontlines for Ukrainian troops. This makes it ever more difficult to cross the Dnipro River and reclaim those Russian occupied regions on the other side. And all of this of course playing out in an active war zone.",
