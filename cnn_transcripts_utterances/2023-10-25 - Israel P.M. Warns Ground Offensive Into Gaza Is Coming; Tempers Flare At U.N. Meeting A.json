Security Council Tuesday, Secretary General Antonio Guterres drew backlash from Israeli diplomats when he appealed for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONIO GUTERRES, U.N. SECRETARY GENERAL: I have condemned unequivocally the horrifying and unprecedented seven October acts of terror by Hamas in Israel. Nothing can justify the deliberate killing, injuring and kidnapping of civilians or the launching of rockets against civilian targets. It is important to also recognize the attacks by Hamas did not happen in a vacuum. The Palestinian people have been subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation. But the grievances of the Palestinian people cannot justify the appalling attacks by Hamas. And those appalling attacks cannot justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people. Excellencies, even war has rules. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And what Israel says is that it fired a number of rockets towards Syrian Army positions. Yesterday, hitting in its words, military compounds and artillery posts of the Syrian army.And also radar systems in response to missiles that were fired from Syria towards the Golan Heights, which Israel took from Syria and annexed a couple of years ago. So, tensions rising there, it's not the first time we've seen Israel firing back at positions inside of Syria. But clearly there is a concern that that could escalate with the Syrians, that things could escalate further with Hezbollah in the South of Lebanon. And of course, we're also seeing rising violence in the Israeli occupied West Bank as well. So, Israel's main front of course, remains the Gaza Strip. It says that it is still planning to go in and Yoav Gallant, the defense minister saying yesterday, the war is just starting.

This is the reality on the ground. And demanding Israel give its enemies fuel that will be ultimately used to keep their tunnel system operating or to keep their weapons firing at us is, you know, that would be immoral to our own people. So I would say, first of all, use the fuel that already exists in different reservoirs throughout the Gaza Strip that Hamas is stockpiling. That is the fuel. You know, Hamas, even a few days ago, took fuel from the United Nations, from UNRWA, and commandeered it for their own needs. That is the fuel that needs to go to the hospitals.

And regarding the evidence, of course, before this all happened 19 days ago, before Hamas came into our towns in the South of Israel and beheaded babies in butchered people and raped women, the fuel was flowing through Israel's crossings into Gaza.So we know what Hamas has, because it came through us. This is the absurd situation. There is fuel in Gaza, there is sufficient need. I would also add that over the recent years, all of the main facilities, especially hospitals, have all developed solar energy power. So there is power in the Gaza Strip. It's just who is responsible for the Gaza Strip? It is the governing authority of Gaza. That is Hamas. Israel is responsible for securing the safety of the people of Israel. We would refuse to be held hostage by Hamas. The international community and specifically the humanitarian aid organizations need to be part of the solution of ridding this world of this brutal merciless organization that has no regard for human life, Israeli or Palestinian.",

And they are part of the solution to this crisis. This is not a war we asked for. It is a brutal offense against our sovereign borders.It is an offense against our people. It is an offense against all decent people in the world. And so, it needs to end with a very clear message that people need to be released, they need to be released now. The International Committee of the Red Cross needs to have access to assess the situation and the well-being of the hostages that are being held against their will. The unfathomable crimes that Hamas has committed, they need to be held accountable for them, and we intend in changing the paradigm once and for all. What we are asking from the world is to support this effort to change the paradigm to flee Israel from this looming threat from the never ending sort of death that Hamas wields above our heads. But also, free the people of Gaza from this terrible organization that has failed them miserably as a governing authority, as an organization, as a terrorist entity that has no regard for anybody's life.",

We are very clear, if you attack us, we will respond, and we will respond with force. Lebanon needs to understand, for instance, that these attacks happening from Lebanese territory are jeopardizing Lebanese security. So they need to get Hezbollah under control and make sure and stop them from attacking us. And to all of those terrorist organizations that think that this might be a good time to challenge Israel, look very carefully how we are dismantling, destroying Hamas, and pursuing their leaders, really think very well if you want to cross that threshold.
