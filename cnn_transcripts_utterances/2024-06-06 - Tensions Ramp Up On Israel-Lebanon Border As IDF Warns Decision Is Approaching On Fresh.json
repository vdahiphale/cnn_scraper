Meanwhile, an attorney for Donald Trump and Georgia Steve Sadow cheered on this move by the appeals courts as he looks forward to arguing that the case against Donald Trump should be dismissed, and Willis should be disqualified for what he calls misconduct.

Here's the headline from the piece behind closed doors, Biden show signs of slipping. There you go. With details of dozens of interviews for both Republicans and Democrats claiming to have witnessed a decline in the present state of my -- state of mind and physical abilities. Well, the White House suggests it's nothing more than a partisan political hit piece, given the fact that Democrats were not quoted in the in the story at all.

      "sentences": "According to The Wall Street Journal, they spoke with some 45 people over the course of several months, including Democrats, Republicans and administration officials who met with President Biden or were briefed on some of these meetings that included the president, and some of these people telling reporters that he seemed a little slower, less sharp, essentially showing his age. He is, of course 81, and is the oldest person to serve in the role of president.And importantly, the story did say the most of the people who were critical of the president in the story happened to be Republicans. Now we saw on Wednesday, the White House and Biden allies furiously pushing back on this story. And one person in particular that was quoted throughout the story that really seemed to aggravate the White House. This was Kevin McCarthy, the former House Speaker, who of course, spent a lot of time with President Biden in closed door meetings and negotiations. And he said in the story that the President at times, rambled, always have to use cards. He said, he just wasn't the same person that he was when he was vice president. And the White House's response to this was basically that is BS coming from somebody who at the time when he was in these negotiations had said, even in public that the President seemed sharp when he was interacting with him. Now, I think the broader pushback that we are getting from the White House on this Wall Street Journal story is essentially that the Republicans that are featured in this story are using the story to go after the president in a political way ahead of the November elections. And we did also just get a real sense of how sensitive the issue of age is for this White House in the campaign. One interesting moment, from the story is where it said that several Democrats had shared with the White House either a recording of an interview or details about what was asked by the reporters. And some of those lawmakers spoke to the Journal a second time, and once again, emphasize Biden's strengths. And Congressman Gregory Meeks from New York, a Democrat said they said that I should give you a call back. They, they're referring to the White House. Now, the Wall Street Journal reporters said that, you know, there have been debates about how the President is in public versus how he is when he is performing behind closed doors. And they sought to try to show any differences between how he is publicly how he is in private, of course, for observers, including reporters who report on the president day in and day out, we do see sort of a mixed performance at times. We see him on days when he seems incredibly sharp, incredibly focused and energized. And then of course, we definitely see moments where he is tripping over his words, or is forgetting people's names or mixing up places. So this, of course, comes at a particularly sensitive time for this President given that it is an election year and his opponent, former President Donald Trump, who is in his late 70s. He has tried to seize on every one of these moments where the President has tripped up to his political advantage. MJ Lee, CNN at the White House. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

I think what is driving this overwhelmingly is what voters see, you know, what they basically see with their own eyes. It's the way that he presents himself both kind of the timbre of his voice, the way he moves, you know, Biden mangle sentences when he ran for president in the 1980s. I covered that campaign, you know, he's never been in artful speaker. I think the core issue here is that, as one Democratic strategist said to me, he said, look at Biden, turn off the sound when Biden is on TV, and that, this person said is what many Democrats believe is driving this overwhelming consensus that he is too old. And the way the way that he can respond to that, John, I think is not by, you know, Democratic senators saying no, he's absolutely sharp and a meeting or foreign leader saying that many of which will say that. I mean, he's really got a resolve to the extent this can be resolved, it's going to be resolved by him in big moments where people are watching, and he delivers a performance that reassures them that he is up for the job, not only in a second term, even now, I mean, there's this big concern. So I think, like the debate with Trump, if it assuming it happens, is going to be much more important to these perceptions than kind of the back and forth over, you know, differing representations of the way he performed in private meetings.",

I mean, you're not -- by no means are all elected or rank and fileDemocrats on board with this when he said right before COVID in March 2020, at that appearance in Michigan, that he saw himself as a bridge to another generation of leaders. There are a lot of Democrats who took that to mean that he was not going to seek reelection. You know, the presidency ages everyone. Donald Trump is not who he was in 2016.

I mean, no one would say that this is someone who is undiminished from where he was only a few years ago. So yes, I think I, look, this is not a problem that is that is going to go away for Biden. It is also a problem for Trump. I think the bigger problem for Biden, his frustration over inflation, and alienation, is the fact that key constituents of the Democratic Party have never been that enthusiastic about him, especially a young people. But as I say, if to the extent that Biden can bring this under control, he's going to have to do it, and he's going to have to do it, when the lights are brightest.

I mean, what he achieved legislatively in those first two years in a 50-50 Senate was truly remarkable that troika of bills, the Inflation Reduction Act with all the clean energy provisions, the Infrastructure Bill, and the Chips Bill, the Electoral Count Act revisions. I mean, it was a kind of maestro performance and he generally has been successful at working with allies, certainly in orchestrating the response to Ukraine. But I have always felt that, you know, part of the presidency is not only what you do behind closed doors. It's the ability to communicate with the public and to drive a message and to build support for your agenda. The famous political scientist Richard (INAUDIBLE), you know, famously wrote 40, 50 years ago, the power to persuade was the most important power of the presidency. Biden wasn't graded that when he was 50. He's less effective at that when he's 80 and I think that is the core of the concern about the age that the people see him do not see strength, they do not see him mastering events, and obviously the chaos in the world and inflation at home kind of compounds that. So he is the one, he is the only one who can make a dent in this problem. I think it doesn't matter what Nancy Pelosi says about how effective he is behind closed doors. People have to see him in a way that gives them confidence that he has the personal capacity to do what they expect of a president maybe unrealistically, which is master events at home and abroad.",

One eyewitness told CNN, painful procedures were carried out by underqualified medics, treatment the medical worker told us, amounts to punishment. While the case at the Israeli supreme court essentially questioning the legality of this detention facility at Sde Teiman in southern Israel, the fact that so many hundreds of Palestinians have been held there since the Hamas attacks of October the 7, in dire conditions without proper access to medical facilities. And of course, the reports of abuse and torture as well. In response to that court hearing, the Israeli authorities inside the court said they were in the process, essentially of phasing the detention center out. [01:49:45]",

And that they were going to do hundreds, move hundreds more out in the weeks ahead.There's still a question over what happens to the detention facility though in the months ahead, whether it will remain open or whether it will continue to be wound down and eventually close. That's something we expect to see be clarified over the coming days. There's another court hearing in a few days from now, again, in Israel to try and get a clearer sense of what the Israeli government's intention is for Sde Teiman and detention facilities. But look, make no mistake the investigation that our team carried out into the abuses there had a huge impact overseas, first of all. The White House said it was deeply concerned about the allegations of abuses that were exposed inside Sde Teiman, the German government, which is normally very supportive of Israel, expressed its concern. The U.N. did the same even the Israeli army announced that it was launching an investigation into the allegations of abuse in Sde Teiman and other detention facilities. But the most important impact I think has been the way in which this detention center has really rallied human rights activists inside Israel -- not, not critics of the country from outside, but human rights activists who are, for the most part against the direction that Israel has been taking in its war in Gaza. This has been a real rallying cry for them because they believe that Israel has gone too far and the court case that we saw today is an expression of that concern, that increasing number Israelis feel about the direction in which Israel has gone when it comes to this conflict against Hamas in Gaza.
