The service though is now closed to the public because of increased security concerns.The California Democrat died last week at the age of 90. She was the first female senator -- I should say a female mayor of San Francisco. That's a position she held for 10 years. She later served in the Senate for more than 30 years. CNN Senior National Correspondent Kyung Lah is with us now. Why the security concerns? What's going on here?",

So, out of an abundance of safety and with the Secret Service needed, they decided to make this you know a private ceremony. Something that people could watch on a live stream in San Francisco.It is scheduled to be a one-hour memorial service on the steps of City Hall. Expected to speak today, Kamala Harris -- Vice President Kamala Harris, Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, as well as some tape remarks by President Joe Biden. So, this is a return really of California's native daughter, the former mayor of San Francisco, as you mentioned, John, but someone who had a five-decade career plus of representing the state as well as the city. So, this is a poetic return for Senator Feinstein. A way to remember her legacy, someone who wrote the 1994 assault weapons ban, but also, you know, we spent so much time focusing on the end, John, she's somebody who broke so many glass ceilings. And it's a way for the city to remember her John.",

CNN's Chief Law Enforcement and Intelligence Analyst John Miller is here with more on this. Pick -- can you pick up the -- pick up the story if you will from there, what is the link between this tragic accident from years past and the indictment that they're facing now? JOHN MILLER, CNN CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp; INTELLIGENCE ANALYST: Well, complicated web. But as you set it up, she needed a car. Wael Hana, the Egyptian American businessman who was reaching out to Menendez for favors for the Egyptian government and also supplying allegedly half a million dollars in cash, this new Mercedes, and other things over a period of years, he had another partner who was under investigation from the New Jersey State Attorney General. And he was looking to get Nadine Arslanian later who would marry Senator Menendez to get the senator to intervene with the state attorney general. And he actually, according to the indictment, held a meeting with a prospective federal prosecutor who he said you know can we take a look at this case, and you know -- you know, this is a good guy and it's a bad case, and so on.

This study in JAMA found about a one percent or lower incidence of these more severe risks for these GLP-One drugs.
