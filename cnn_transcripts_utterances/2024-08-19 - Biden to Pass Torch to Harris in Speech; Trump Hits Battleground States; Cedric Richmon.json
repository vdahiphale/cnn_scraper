Blinken has called it maybe the last opportunity to finalize a ceasefire and hostage deal.

Santos, who was, remember, expelled from the House last year, had initially pleaded not guilty to 23 federal charges, including illegal use of campaign funds and also falsifying personal financial information. And new this morning, a nightmare situation unfolding in Italy. A powerful tornado off the coast of Sicily struck a yacht, killing one person. Fifteen people were also rescued, but six more are still missing. Italy's coast guard said the yacht was carrying mostly British passengers. It was anchored about a half mile from the nearby port.

Obviously, Donald Trump did veer off the economy at that point, attacking personally Kamala Harris, but this is the runway that the campaign is setting up.So, let's talk about where he's going to be this week because they're all battleground states. He's going to be today in York, Pennsylvania. That is going to be a speech focused again on the economy. On Tuesday he's going to be in Howell, Michigan. That is a suburb of Detroit. It's going to be focused on crime and safety. Wednesday, Asheboro, North Carolina. Thursday, it's going to be just south of Tucson, on the border there. Obviously, talking about immigration. Friday, he's going to be in both Vegas and Glendale, Arizona. Now, Glendale, Arizona, that is going to be a rally, but the rest of these again are going to be called messaging events. Now, Donald Trump himself, as you said, his allies have been begging him to stay on message, but it appears harder for him to do and something we've seen for the last eight years, it is harder for him to do. This was him this weekend at a rally in Pennsylvania. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Crooked Joe have - what happened to Biden? I was running against Biden. All of a sudden I'm running against somebody else. It's true. You know, it's interesting, I said, who am I running against? Harris. I said, who the hell is Harris?

CEDRIC RICHMOND, CO-CHAIR, HARRIS-WALZ CAMPAIGN: Well, they're certainly two different people. But I will say, the common theme is that they both put people over politics, and that they wake up every morning trying to figure out how to make people's lives better as opposed to what's in it for them. And so I think the best example of that is watching President Biden pass the baton, because it was in what he thought was the best interest of this country. And so, I think that's the common theme.

Statesman worry about the next generation. And when he came off the sidelines four years ago, he came off the sidelines to beat what he thought was an existential threat to this country, and that was Donald Trump. And he was so concerned about America's future that he ran for president. And he beat Donald Trump. And this time it - I think it was the exact same, that he was so concerned about our future, he was so concerned about the division that he once again said, this is not about me, this is about the country. So, I am going to remove myself from this process. I am going to pass the baton over to a very qualified, brilliant, legal scholar and political - public servant, Kamala Harris. And that's what I hope he talks about tonight.But the other thing I want him to focus on is his historic accomplishments and how we got to this moment. Kamala Harris is vice president because he picked her. Ketanji Brown Jackson is on the Supreme Court because he picked her. And he has been so forward leaning into uniting this country and using the talent of everybody, regardless of what they look like, who they love, of anything else. And I hope that that brings us together and I hope that it doesn't just bring Democrats together, but that it unites the country.",

Project 2025 is the closest thing he has to policy, but he's distanced himself from that.But if you ask him what is it that he's proposing for the American people, he doesn't have an answer. And if - I hate to always go back in the past, because this race is about tomorrow. But if you ever want to know what someone's going to do, look at what they did in the past. And his handling of Covid, coming on TV saying drink bleach or one day it's just going to magically go away was irresponsible. He wrecked the economy and cost peoples jobs and it costs so many millions of - so many hundreds of thousands of Americans their lives. And so, I'm very concerned about what a Trump presidency would look like. But a Trump campaign also hurts this country because he just divides and pits people against each other. And so I hope people see that difference. But he doesn't have the discipline. It's just not in him. It's the same reason a mule can't win the Kentucky Derby. It's not in him. And he cannot stay on task. He cannot stay focused. He cannot talk about issues because everything he does goes back to schoolyard bullying of calling names, and just degrading and dividing people.",

Today is the day of the major protests. As we have said several times, this area, Kate, is home to the largest Palestinian population in the United States. And for months we have seen thousands of people take to the streets in Chicago in protest of the war in the Middle East. And certainly we are expecting that these protest groups are going to use the DNC spotlight as an opportunity to bring more awareness.They - the major protest group is the coalition to march on the DNC. That's a group of around 270 organizations that have come together to try to, again, bring tens of thousands of people to the city of Chicago to protest. This is a very hard security perimeter here at the DNC. Let me show you, Kate. What you see for several blocks outside the United Center is this non-scalable fencing. And this is actually what they have at the McCormack Place as well, which is that other DNC location. Again, this goes on for blocks. It is complemented, Kate, by thousands of law enforcement on the ground. Thousands of Chicago police officers, hundreds of mutual aid officers. They're also getting support from the air, as well as on the water. And then, Kate, in addition to this massive law enforcement presence, Illinois' governor says that around 250 members of the Illinois National Guard have been authorized. So certainly law enforcement is looking at the potential for huge protests and saying that they need to have enough staffing to try to mitigate any problems. As far as making sure that peoples' First Amendment rights are protected, Chicago police have gone through extensive training to make sure that that First Amendment protests can be respected and remains peaceful. But they say they have zero tolerance for criminal activity, Kate. And so (INAUDIBLE) Chicago Police Department. But again, they say that they are leaning on their months of training to try to make sure there are no problems in the surrounding neighborhoods throughout the city, and that this protests can happen peacefully, Kate.",

And I want to make it just really simple. Who led in a national poll in this month in August. And what we see here, I think it's pretty straightforward in - we have ten polls that meet CNN's standards for publication. Eight of the polls showed Harris ahead. Just two of the polls showed Donald Trump ahead. So, I think it is fair to say on aggregate that Kamala Harris leads nationally. And what a change that is from a month ago when Joe Biden got out of the race, where more than - than more than 50 percent of the polls, Donald Trump was ahead nationally.
