He reportedly had a manifesto with anti-Semitic language and the representative's name on it. Moskowitz is Jewish. Police confirmed that they arrested 41 year old John Lipinski on firearms charges. They said evidence suggested he may have been planning some kind of criminal act. Special counsel Jack Smith has apparently taken the first step in preparing to wind down the federal election subversion case against Donald Trump. Smith told the court he will decide by December 2nd how he plans to resolve the criminal case against the new president-elect related to attempts to overturn the 2020 election. Smith also asked the federal judge in the case to remove all upcoming deadlines in the case so that his office can assess how to move forward as Trump returns to the White House. Meantime, House Republicans who have been investigating the former January 6th committee have officially told Smith to preserve his records and comply with previous requests for documents. Well, one person who will have the president-elect's trust and ear is Elon Musk. When Trump was connected on the phone with the Ukrainian president the day after the election, Musk was also in the room. CNN's Kristen Holmes has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

They insist this was not a planned situation. They also say the call was polite and cordial and that Donald Trump put the call on speakerphone. And Zelenskyy thanked Musk for his help with Starlink and communications. Musk has assisted with bringing communications to Ukraine during the Ukrainian-Russia war. Now also, these same sources again say it was positive, cordial but also a very quick conversation. They said it was roughly seven minutes and that there was no policy discussed. Obviously all of this is notable. One of the things Donald Trump has promised is that he would put an end to the war in Ukraine in a matter of hours after he became president. However, no one has seemed to get an answer from him on how exactly he would do that. He has just essentially praised his relationship with Vladimir Putin of Russia and now has said that he has a good relationship with Zelenskyy as well. We'll obviously have to wait and see how all of this plays out -- Kristen Holmes, CNN, West Palm Beach, Florida. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Now top of mind for Defense officials, here is, of course, just how the future president plans to deploy the U.S. military domestically, something that is highly controversial here within the Pentagon. And, you know, Trump has hinted many times -- and he has outright said at times -- that he does intend or that he would support the use of the U.S. military to conduct domestic law enforcement here in the United States. So the U.S. military officials that we have been speaking to say that they are gaming out scenarios under which that would occur and how they would respond. For example, what that chain of command would look like and how they would push back or accommodate other requests made by Trump that were deemed more controversial. Another aspect of this, of course, is Schedule F, which is an executive order that Trump issued during his first term. That essentially would reclassify a huge swath of apolitical government employees to make them easily -- more easily fireable. And that is something that the Pentagon is also bracing for and has been scrambling to try to address before president Trump takes office on January 20th. So the bottom line here is that given the very hostile relationship that the Pentagon had with Donald Trump during the first Trump administration and the fact that so many of Trump's former senior military officials have spoken out against him in recent weeks, months and years. With John Kelly, his former White House chief of staff and a retired general, going as far as to call him a fascist, Pentagon officials, largely at the senior level here, are bracing for a potentially similar relationship with the incoming White House -- Natasha Bertrand, CNN, the Pentagon.

And so it's kind of a way of kind of amping up the publicity angle. And he, you know, they're looking for media attention. Look, it's no -- it's no secret. Gavin Newsom has been trying to build his national political profile. Whether he intends to run for president or not that's another thing.

And they're vital parts of industries. Farmers, for example, they can't operate without those folks working out in the fields. That's not the only conflict, however. There are conflicts over water. Trump, during his first presidency, tried to help the farmers get more water while the state was trying to reduce water to farmers. The state has a very ambitious climate change program that would include banning all gasoline-powered -- sale of gasoline-powered cars by 2035. That's -- they clashed over that issue during his first presidency. And it's probably going to happen again. So there's a there's no shortage of issues. California, after all, is the nation's largest state and is a -- has a global sized economy. And so this is a -- this is going to be kind of a, I don't know, mano a mano between the governor of California and the incoming President of the United States over who calls the shots.

And it was that that rising of tension online and in terms of the social media videos that had led Dutch police to add extra policemen and women to the streets for Thursday night. But it proved too little to protect the Israeli fans from these hit and run attacks that targeted so many of them. Those fans then evacuated to Ben-Gurion. We've also seen the images of their return with more anti-Arab chants that were -- that were sounded there. Now Israeli authorities are working with Dutch police. They're very keen that prosecutions should be brought in terms of those very violent attacks of Thursday night. And many of the questions now surround what's likely to happen next week, because this very, very same football team, Maccabi Tel Aviv, will be traveling to Paris to take on Paris Saint-Germain in a match there. French authorities have said, despite what happened here in Amsterdam this week, they are going to go ahead with that match and not bow to what one of their ministers described as anti-Semitic pressures. Still, given France's very large Muslim community, its very strong pro-Palestine views that have often been expressed in protest, there are questions about just how safely French authorities are going to be able to manage the fallout from that fixture.

And what we've seen over the course of Israel's aerial campaign, particularly in Beirut, is areas that are not only filled the civilians but also key civilian infrastructure being targeted or at least within the targeted area. CNN analysis has shown that a number of hospitals have been within lethal proximity to the airstrikes taking place in parts of Beirut and other areas of Lebanon. Of course, this is taking place as the country continues to grapple with a significant mass displacement of the population there as a result of these airstrikes.

She says she expected a competitive primary after Biden stepped aside in July. But Biden immediately endorsed Kamala Harris instead. Democrats quickly united around her. Here she is. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, PODCAST HOST:  You had reportedly said you wanted a sort of an open primary when if Joe Biden stepped down. Did you change your mind because you saw all the excitement around Kamala Harris? REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), FORMER U.S. HOUSE SPEAKER:  No, I didn't change my mind. We had an open primary and she won it. Nobody else got in the race. Yes, people could have jumped in. There were some people who were sort of preparing but she just, took off with it. And, actually, it was a blessing because it -- there isn't that much time. There wasn't that much time between then and the election and it sort of saved time. So it wasn't that we didn't have an open process. It's just that nobody got in. (END AUDIO CLIP)",

Starting the game on a 20-2 run. Cleveland was up 17 after the first. They were up 41 at halftime. Cavs are the first team in NBA history to start 10-0, scoring at least 110 points in every single game. They walloped the Warriors 136 to 117, to remain the NBA's only undefeated team. Now Kevin Durant and the Suns, they have only one loss this season and it remained that way last night in Dallas, tied at 113 in the closing seconds. The Suns have the ball here. They're going to miss. But Jusuf Nurkic is going to end up with the rebound. And he gets fouled with less than a second left. He hits one free throw to give him the lead. And then Luka Concic's prayer at the buzzer not answered. Suns win 114 to 113. And Mavs head coach Jason Kidd was not very happy with his team's effort afterwards. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
