One, Donald Trump is now a former president. While it's not impossible for a former president to invoke executive privilege, the courts have said that it's much more difficult for a former president to invoke executive privilege than a sitting president, so that's number one.The other problem Donald Trump has is, this is a criminal grand jury subpoena. And usually, courts are going to honor criminal grand jury subpoenas. And typically, with some exceptions, by typically executive privilege does not prevail over a grand jury subpoena. So, it's a shot in the dark here. I think it's got a chance of succeeding, but only a very long shot chance here.

Now, that still means that there's still a very bleak picture on the ground for Ukrainian forces, who really have been struggling to hold this city in recent weeks and months. The major vital supply route that had connected Bakhmut to a nearby village, it was that supply route that brought weapons in, that brought supplies in to those troops. But also provided a corridor for aid for the four and a half thousand civilians still trapped inside. That supply route was blown up in the last couple of days, cutting off this very besieged and vulnerable city from the rest of Ukraine.

But it does indicate this continuous growth several years in a row. And also, given the size of China's economy, it translates into $224 billion U.S., really dwarfing those of China's neighbors, many of whom are having territorial disputes with Beijing. Not to mention rising geopolitical tensions between the United States and China. We have seen the U.S., for example, in recent months expanded its access to military bases in the Philippines, and also teaming up with the U.K. and Australia to develop nuclear-powered submarines for Australians. So, there's quite a bit of regional arms race going on. So, that's why this newest increase from Beijing is very concerning for many. But the most concerning issues for many legislators here this year is probably the economic recovery, after the government abruptly ended its zero-COVID policy. Remember, that policy really wreaked havoc on this economy for much of last year. But after that initial chaotic and even deadly exit from this policy, we have seen a very strong rebound in this economy. Official data really showing very strong numbers in manufacturing, services, and construction starting in late January. So, some were predicting the growth target for the GDP would be something closer to six percent for 2023, but the official figure, around five percent. So, that relatively modest figure may be a reflection of the leadership's hesitancy in terms of how sustainable this growth is, as well as the realization. The strong headwinds that continue to face both domestically and internationally with, you know, severely unprecedented slump in the real estate sector grow -- a very, very high youth and unemployment rate, not to mention high interest rates around the world and the war in Ukraine, and of course, the growing U.S. restrictions on technology transfer to China.

      "sentences": "The energy of trauma, and pain, and also anger palpable here. I have to say, everyone I speak to is absolutely traumatized. I guess it hits home, because this is a route that so many people have taken -- and security. As you say, the station master will be appearing before prosecutors to give his version of events. He initially said it was a technical fault, then admitted it was human error. We also heard that sound where he was telling the train driver to skip the red lights and also did not give the order to change track where then that resulted in the fatal accidents.Quite significant today, the prime minister coming out with a statement and apologizing and he says, everyone, and above all to the relatives of the victims, a big sorry. Both personally and in the name of all of those who have ruled the country for years. We cannot, and will not, and must not hide behind human error. He also goes on to say, which is quite interesting, if the remote system had been completed, this accident would have been practically impossible and the fact that that control system was meant to come into effect in the next two months is no excuse. This is really significant. The prime minister initially said this was human error. And as the investigation goes on, you're hearing just so much more that is coming through. Greeks have so many questions. I want to show you a couple of newspaper headlines that have come through in the Sunday papers. This one says guilty and fatal, and showing the faces of the people in charge, the prime minister, the former chancellor administer that also resigned, the station master, and other people leading the institution within the railway system. This one, I guess, perhaps more telling of the way people feel. This is black with the candles that have been lit. Churches around the country hosting memorials, vigils. Protesters are said to take to the streets around the county as well in commemoration of those that had lost their lives, 57 people losing their lives. There are seven people in critical condition. Interestingly, that first carriage which we've spoke about, (INAUDIBLE), where most of the people were found dead, one person survived. He was thrown out of the carriage. He is in critical condition. There's one person that is unaccounted for. No one -- no loved one has gone to search for them. So, there's a lot of, you know, talk about how to find this person's relatives and family. Importantly here, as well. I think Greeks want to know how this happened, why it happened, and what kind of responsibility comes with all of this. The station master, of course, in the middle of this investigation right now. He's going to be the person that I think everyone turns to. But here's the thing, we've known for many years and there have been many voices throughout the years talking about the fact that there was lack of safety in the Greek railway system. Greece has the worst rating in the whole of the EU over the past 10 years. In the meantime, people are coming to terms and grips with what this means for the nation. And as I say, the energy here, you can just feel -- I mean, everyone you speak to, regardless of who you bump into, is talking about this and wondering what the next steps are. We also have to keep in mind that Greece will be hosting general elections in the next few months. This might be a critical momentum for Kyriakos Mitsotakis and his government. How they handle this, how they deal with this, and what the next steps are. Kim.",
