One local resident told us whereas before mortars were flying over their heads, now it's bullets.WEDEMAN (voice-over): Soldiers prepare trenches inside the city. New defensive positions if the Russians push forward. Sandbags with wood on top says Valentin and three firing positions. On the ever so slightly safer western side of the city, a make shift market offers basics. With no electricity or running water, commerce is conducted in the open. DENYS, BAKHMUT RESIDENT (through translator): My two shops were destroyed, says Denys, so I'm selling on the street. WEDEMAN (voice-over): But this food is only for those who can afford it. And Serhii isn't one of them. SERHII, BAKHMUT RESIDENT (through translator): I'm living like an f'ing animal, he says. WEDEMAN (voice-over): Ivan returns home after collecting firewood, the bitter cold is deadly as the shelling. IVAN, BAKHMUT RESIDENT (through translator): People have frozen the death in their apartments, he says. WEDEMAN (voice-over): On a bluff overlooking Bakhmut, this artillery officer nicknamed \"Pilot,\" says they're up against troops, many of them convicts with the private military company Wagner. \"PILOT,\" ARTILLERY OFFICER (voice-over): We're fighting against soldiers brought to the slaughter, he says. These Wagner guys have no choice. They're sentenced to death. WEDEMAN (voice-over): And then the order comes to open fire. (END VIDEOTAPE) WEDEMAN (on camera): And as you see in that report, they're not only digging trenches inside the city. We also saw them digging trenches outside the city. One commander we spoke to said come back in two days. It's going to be even hotter. Now regarding that strike on Saturday on the apartment building in Dnipro, the death toll now stands at 45, six of them children. 19 people are still unaccounted for -- Victor, Alisyn.",

What are you doing, what can you do?BRUCE BLAKEMAN (R) NASSAU COUNTY, NY EXECUTIVE: Well, here in Nassau County, my office is dealing with the problem as if George Santos was not a member of Congress. We will have nothing to do with him. We can't trust him. His whole resume was built on a pack of lies. His campaign was built on a pack of lies. Personally, I think he's delusional. And I think the sooner he realizes that his road to recovery is through him stepping down, resigning, get help, because obviously he's not normal, and then, you know, try to put your life back together. I feel sad for George Santos. He doesn't realize the length and breadth of the untruths that he told to the people in my county. And fortunately, I have a Congressman, Anthony D'Esposito in my county, and Congressman Andrew Garbarino in my county. So, if I have issues with the federal government, I can deal with them or I can call up our majority leader in the Senate, Chuck Schumer, who's from New York, who always has been responsive to Nassau County. So, we've got ways around George Santos, but for the benefit of his district, and for the benefit of his reputation, and trying to put his life back together, he should step down and get help.",
