And, you know, when you look at some of the Democratic candidates that the President has campaigned for in these final days, you really do see that these are Democratic candidates that are running against Republican candidates who are election deniers or skeptics.But one thing that I would say on that is that yes, as much as the President has felt that it is important to focus on that issue. We also know because a poll after poll has shown us that the issue that voters overwhelmingly care about here in the U.S. is the election, excuse me, and is the economy and inflation. So there is a question about that political strategy. And some Democrats sort of raising the question of whether it's a mistake to basically focus on anything other than the economy at this late stage, close to the midterms now what we're going to see on this final day before Election Day, tomorrow is the President heading to Maryland. This is sort of where he kicked off his midterms campaigning earlier this summer. So it is sort of a bookending of sorts, that we're seeing the cycle. And it is also a state where Democrats feel like they can sort of end things on a bright note. You know, this is a state where Wes Moore is the Democratic candidate for governor. Democrats are feeling very good that he's going to win this race. So it is one way in which they sort of hope to end things on a bright note, because they hope that the governor's match and there will go from red to blue.
