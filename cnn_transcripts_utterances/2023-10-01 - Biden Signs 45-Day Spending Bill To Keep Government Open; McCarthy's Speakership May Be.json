But beyond foreign policy just speaks to a country that's afflicted by entrenched interests. You know, it goes without saying that this hyperpolarization is the chief cause of why Congress so rarely passes government spending bills on schedule. A lot of that does speak to the fact that we're in an era of unstable shifting majorities where there's no one party dominance, and that perpetual threat of power swings between the parties, really disincentivizes a compromise.But it's not just a Democrat Republican divide, it's really within party splintering, that's to blame for a lot of this dysfunction. You know, one of the benefits of these big tent modern parties is that they can coalesce very diverse interests. But right now you have a huge gap between the far-right wing of the Republican Party and GOP moderates. I think it's at least as wide as the gap between GOP moderates and the median Democrat.

I think there's value to that outcome. It's conscious move. So there's a political agenda at play always. In 2018 and 2019, it was Trump wanting leverage over building the border wall in 2013. I think the goal was to delay enactment of the Affordable Care Act. This year, it's really Ukraine that the fight many hardline Republicans seem to want.

One of the things that we have to keep in mind is, of course, the United States is by far the largest donor of military aid to Ukraine.And, you know, one of the things that we recently saw a very up close on the battlefield here in Ukraine is that when the Ukrainians for instance, go on the attack, and they use a lot of artillery, and other heavy weapons, a lot of that is, of course, U.S. supplied, and they do need a lot of them. If you have a nighttime battle, for instance, a lot of artillery shells are fired. And obviously, all of that needs to be replenished. So certainly, it could have a big effect. But we also need to keep in mind that the -- the quality of weapons that the U.S. supplies to Ukraine really transcends pretty much all forms and all shapes of the battlefield here. It starts from small weapons, like for instance, machine guns, machine gun ammunition, small bullets, all the way to anti-aircraft systems, which of course, are extremely important, but also very expensive for U.S. taxpayers as well. But those are things that directly keep Ukrainians alive. You have of course, the HIMARS system, for instance, which has made a huge impact on the battlefield here in Ukraine has certainly helped the Ukrainians in some of these battles, turn the tide on the battlefield. So that in itself would have a massive impact on the Ukrainians as far as their mobility is concerned, as far as their firepower is concerned, as far as their soldier staying alive. And in many cases, also their civilian staying alive as well. But one of the things that we've been talking about here in Ukraine, we've been speaking to Ukrainian soldiers and people fighting on the battlefield, they said, look, obviously they're very concerned about some of the things that are going on in the U.S., and whether or not the funding for their military campaign and for their defense is going to continue. But they also say whether or not it continues, they are going to have to keep on fighting because they believe that the existence of their country is at stake. And you mentioned the fact that the Ukrainians today are memorializing the people who have been killed on the battlefield. Well, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the president of this country had a message that catered to that which also included a part where he said, look, the Ukrainians defending their country is not dependent on other countries, it will continue no matter what. I want you to listen to some of what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): No one should or will be able to turn off our resilience, endurance, grit, and fortitude, neither on a regular nor any emergency basis. None of them have the expiration date, and end date or a final point, after which we will stop resisting and fighting. There is only one such point our victory, as we bring it closer every day, we say we will fight for as long as it takes. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They are going to need a lot of ammunition. They are going to need a lot of weapons, and they're going to need that supply to continue.

The E.U. already has one of those countries to contend with. It certainly doesn't want to have to.And also, from a Ukrainian standpoint, it needs all the help -- they need all the help they can get in one less country providing military aid surely will be detrimental, though, Slovakia is obviously a small country. The message from Robert Fico, the -- the leader of the Smer party, former Prime Minister twice over has proven to be more popular than polls predicted it to be, won by more comfortable margin and his message, I mean, though, he's taken the Russian line and blamed Ukrainian Nazis and fascists in his words for provoking Russia into war. His message he sort of framed it as one of peace that look, the longer we supply weapons and ammunition to Ukraine, the longer this war will drag on. And he believes that it's a war that Ukraine can't win because Russia will simply never concede. But politically, Laila, Robert Fico is not the Prime Minister of Slovakia quite yet. He still needs to go through and find a coalition partner and we've just heard this morning from his primary opposition party, the leader of that party, the progressive Slovakia or PS party has said that look, he will do everything in his power to try to prevent Robert Fico from actually forming government. He thinks that it is bad for his country and bad for Slovakia's international standing. Now, if you look at the results that we have thus far, Fico's party, the Smer Party is taking home about 23% of the vote right now. You have the Republic Party, down there at the bottom. They are a far- right party that shares Fico's views of Russia and Ukraine and he hadn't ruled out working with them and a coalition but they haven't reached the minimum 5% threshold that is required in Slovakia to actually get seats in parliament. So more likely, they'll be trying to pair with the third place Hlas Party with 15% or so of the vote. That's actually an offshoot of breakaway offshoot of Robert Fico's own party. They've been rather vague on the Ukraine issue. They say that look, Ukraine -- or Slovaks have given all they have to give to Ukraine, but they also support continuing to send ammunition to Ukraine because much of it is actually manufactured in Slovakia and they figure that it is it's good for the economy. So there's still a lot to shake out here. This could take several weeks before we figure out who's in this coalition. And if Robert Fico is in fact, the next prime minister of the country. Laila?",

Take, for example, Sioux Falls, going from a high on Sunday of 93 degrees back down to only 76 on Tuesday, keeping in mind however, that that 76 is still actually above normal for this time of year, just not quite as extreme as the high temperature will be on Sunday.
