This is by far the most significant defamation trial in generations and most significant case against a media company perhaps ever. It all comes after this mysterious 24-hour delay that did raise questions about possible settlement talks. But, if one is not announced in the coming minutes, and believe me we are monitoring it very closely, opening statements will begin after a jury is seated. Now, if Dominion gets what it's asking for, it would mark the largest defamation decision against a U.S. media outlet.CNN's Danny Freeman is outside the courthouse in Delaware.

And then, after that jury selection, we're expecting opening statements to take up the bulk of the majority of the day. Now, as you said, yesterday at this time there was a delay in this case for about 24 hours, prompting a lot of speculation about a potential settlement. But I can tell you today, neither side is expecting a settlement at this point. And both sides are getting ready and preparing for those opening statements and to embark on this potentially six-week trial. I want to read you some statements kind of as a scene setter from both Dominion and Fox. First, Dominion said, quote, in the coming weeks we will prove Fox spread lies, causing enormous damage to Dominion. And we look forward to trial. Meanwhile, Fox, this week, also released a statement saying, Dominion's lawsuit is a political crusade in search of a financial windfall, but the real cost would be the cherished First Amendment rights. Now, again, we've been watching these two parties go back and forth for a number of weeks, really since -- for two years since this case was first brought up, this lawsuit first filed.

Obviously, as you can imagine, there are a lot of media members out here all covering this trial from all over the world. But the interesting thing is, while this is the main entrance of the courthouse, there is actually a back entrance of the courthouse where sometimes sensitive or high-profile witnesses do have the option of going through. We were able to get some shots of that yesterday. And that may be in use for some of the witnesses that we potentially could see over the course of the next few weeks testifying at this trial.That could include Rupert Murdoch, of course, the chairman of the Fox Corporation, Lachlan Murdoch, his son, Suzanne Scott, the current president of Fox News, and, of course, the highest profile perhaps would be many of those Fox News personalities, Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson, Laura Ingraham. We're not sure 100 percent right now which, if any, frankly, of those will be called to testify, but we expect that Dominion would want at least some of those folks to take the witness stand as this trial gets underway to prove their case, saying that Fox News defamed them. Of course, Fox, still standing strong. But again, the trial seems to be, as you said, game on starting today and this morning. John.",

It is clear here that this was two or three hours where they questioned the suspect. He was able to go back home that evening. The investigation continued.
