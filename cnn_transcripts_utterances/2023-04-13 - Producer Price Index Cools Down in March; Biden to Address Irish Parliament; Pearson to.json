Here's a look at some of the top stories coming in right now.Protesters are in the streets in France setting dumpsters ablaze and breaking into the headquarters of LVMH. And they're really just getting started. It's all leading up to a final decision on whether French President Macron's pension plan gets the green light. That plan would raise the retirement age from 62 to 64. And we expect that ruling tomorrow. And in Florida, it's being described as a one in 1,000-year event. Right now, catastrophic flash flooding is hammering parts of the state. Some areas have recorded an estimated 20 plus inches of rain. The Fort Lauderdale Airport has been closed. The Broward County mayor says it's the most severe flooding he's ever seen. Much more on that throughout the show. Sara.",

That is the biggest drop we've seen in a couple of years.And when you look overall prices grew 2.7 percent year over year. What does that mean? Well, the Fed's trying to inch inflation closer to 2 percent. This is the closest we've seen in a couple of years. You compare that with last year -- last month when year over year was something like 4.6 percent. So, this is a dramatic one-month downgrade in the inflation situation.",

So, that got a lot of people's attention.Yesterday, we had a consumer price number that showed grocery prices falling for the first time in two years. Again, good news on the inflation front. But then that was tempered by this worry that even though we have good news on cooling inflation, there still could be trouble -- a little bit of trouble for the economy later in the year. No one knows for sure. The crystal ball is incredibly murky. I'm just telling you what the latest little pieces of the puzzle are. Good news on inflation. Jobless claims rising a little bit.

But it's only with love that I express that sentiment towards Berman.Look, Kate, I think you hit on a critical point here, this is such a personal trip for the president, whether it's stopping in pubs, whether it's greeting thousands outside places where his ancestral homeland very much resonates deeply inside him, inside his family. But today is very much about the bilateral relationship that is to some degree equal in importance, particularly given some of the geopolitical strife that the Biden administration, the president, has been confronting over the course of the last year plus. And you mentioned the president - or the meetings with President Michael Higgins this morning. The Taoiseach Le Varadkar earlier today. But this speech to parliament I think will be very much an effort to express, yes, the long existing ties and how critical those are both on a personal basis for the president but also to the U.S. But also spinning things forward a little bit. You know, when you talk to U.S. officials they make clear, Ireland, particularly on the humanitarian side of things, has been a critical component of the western alliance that's been behind Ukraine since Russia's invasion last year. Ireland also, at the moment, trying to weigh whether or not their military neutrality is something they will maintain given what they've seen happened in Ukraine over the last year as well. So some complex issues that they're grappling with as well. But I think the unity between the United States and Ireland is certainly something the president wanted to discuss, and also Northern Ireland. Obviously, that was the first part of the president's trip. He met with the five political leaders up in Northern Ireland, where they are still -- even though stability and peace are at a place that I think was unimaginable 25 years ago, 26, 27 years ago, before the Good Friday Agreement, they are still dealing with their own complex political issues and trying to convey what the president heard from those political leaders to the Irish officials here, to the Irish parliament here, and trying to find a pathway forward there politically. So, a lot of very important, bilateral elements of this trip as well. Certainly the personal, probably the most important in the president's mind. But when you talk to U.S. officials, they want to make that very clear, this is a day not of just the ceremonial and the personal, this is a day of the substance, Kate.",
