She didn't say that, I imagine, about some of the attacks on Democrats, but what is she and the RNC doing to back that up given the prominence of voices still in the party of Trump or, say, Marjorie Taylor Greene? LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST:  Yes. We have not seen any indication whether it is from the RNC chairwoman or other Republican leaders that they're going to take any type of firm line when it comes to consequences for GOP candidates who really attack each other in very vitriolic and nasty ways. We saw that last time around, that was how President Trump was able to basically beat back the rest of the competition, and it is likely expected that that is what is going to happen again. Right now, when a lot of these candidates, as Margaret said, are asked about Trump, they say that they don't want to talk about him or they say that they still agree with him and we are happy that he was president. That's what Senator Tim Scott said recently. And, again, they don't differentiate from him on any policy, even to say that they disagree with the fact that, recently, he called for the suspension of the Constitution.",

Why would you do any of these things if you were not intending to run? The question is, what is the rollout, what's the timing of that announcement, how do you stage it? And we can see some clues from the ramp up event around the book release and around his decision at this point not to participate in CPAC because he does not have to.

He's already trying out a bunch of nicknames for him and attacking him, saying that he is responsible for DeSantis' success. How does that potential rivalry play out in any Republican primary? I mean, are other Republicans, do they see opportunity perhaps that DeSantis and Trump consumer each other?BARRON-LOPEZ:  Potentially. But I think that a lot of the Republican strategists I have talked to think that the more the candidates that jump in, the more that that benefits the former president, Trump, in particular with DeSantis, I mean, he is the biggest threat to the former president. And the former president does have some avenues to try to differentiate himself from DeSantis, particularly on something that we are hearing a lot of from President Biden right now, which is Medicare and social security. Trump did this last time around, pointing that a lot of these Republicans supported potential cuts to entitlement, and DeSantis was one of them, and that is something that I think we could see the different little policy differences that the former president tries to point out particularly with DeSantis.",

And for those in Southeast Turkey who have already been displaced by the initial earthquake, hundreds of thousands of them, you can imagine the trauma, the fear, the apprehension that they feel each and every day as we continue to see these aftershocks. And this comes just a week after a more powerful aftershock that we felt last Monday, 6.3 in magnitude.But this is the amount of aftershocks that this country would expect to see in about four months. So, you can imagine that this is a hugely difficult time for those living in Southeast Turkey. And according to the authorities, at least 69 people have been reported injured, 29 buildings in Malatya, in Southeast Turkey, now collapsed as a result of this latest aftershock. And we've been visiting some of the areas hardest hit by that initial earthquake and the subsequent aftershocks, including Antakya and Iskenderun in the Hatay Province, was among the hardest hit by the initial earthquake. And the destruction in these cities is inconceivable. It is hard to put into words. I mean, Antakya feels like a ghost town now and many, many have nothing left in their city. They are all living in these camp cities that have sprung up across Southeast Turkey. At least 900,000 people living in tents at the moment, and that number is expected to grow. Many of the families that we spoke to were still living on the street, unsure of when they would be given a tent or any other form of temporary accommodation. This is a huge challenge for the Turkish government. They say they plan to rebuild the affected areas within one year. We've already learned that construction work has begun in parts of Gaziantep and more apartments, around 30,000, are expected to be built in the coming months. But there has been criticism over this decision by some, including the Union of Engineers and Architects here in Turkey. They say it is simply too hasty, there needs to be further geological investigations, further preparations to ensure that these areas are safe. And the fact that we are still seeing these powerful aftershocks is only underscoring that concern. But, of course, with elections looming, there is a significant amount of pressure on President Erdogan to provide a long-term solution.",
