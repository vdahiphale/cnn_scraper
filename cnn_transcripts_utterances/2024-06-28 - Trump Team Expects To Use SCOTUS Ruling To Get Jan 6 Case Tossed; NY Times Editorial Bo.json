Plus, even with no Supreme Court decision yet on Trump's claim of immunity for January 6, how one Supreme Court ruling today will affect some January 6th defendants. Good evening. Thanks for joining us. We begin tonight with this, Time magazine's new cover, which certainly speaks to the panic many Democrats felt waking up this morning. More than 51 million people watched last night's CNN debate in Atlanta, 51 million. And within moments of what they watched, a halting performance by a fragile looking Joe Biden, seemingly unable to counter a torrent of lies by the former president. The calls began from within the Democratic Party to consider the possibility of him bowing out of the race. Today, there were also calls for the exact opposite. Chill the F out, is how Pennsylvania Democratic senator John Fetterman put it today. And now, at the end of a traumatic night and day since the debate, both the chill out and freak out Democrats have something to point to, because today in North Carolina, even as he acknowledged his debate shortcomings last night, it was a markedly different President Biden on the stump.

This is kind of his central political mantra, and it's been a part of his life for a very long time. The question now is, does he believe it so strongly that he is perhaps not as open to seeing what the other evidence is that's going to come out over the course of the next weeks and days about - days and weeks about what sort of support he has.

You are making critical, important decisions, getting information from the staff that you hire, the administration that you build, and you're using all of that information to make decisions and to pass legislation and to defend our democracy.And that is what Joe Biden has done so well, surrounding himself with outstanding staff members. 40 of 44 of Donald Trump's senior staff members will not endorse him. They worked for him and they refused to endorse him. And what he will hire will be political hacks, extremists who will bring our country down. And that's the critical difference here.",

I mean, clearly, when you look at what happened to Reagan and Mondale in that first debate, Reagan himself confessed that he had flopped, and the RNC chairman said that it was a dismal performance. That he had blown it.And yet somehow they were able to realize that he was filled with too many facts, too many things, a sort of an echo of Biden in a way. And then the second debate, he came out roaring, not only with that great comment, I won't make age an issue and I won't exploit the, you know, the inexperience and youth of my, of my opponent. But it was rather Reagan became Reagan. He just relaxed and did what he did well. At the same time, we saw that when President Obama debated that first time with Mondale, he looked like he wasn't interested in it. He seemed like he was rusty He didn't seem to really throw himself into it and it got a very bad performance and he realized that. He acknowledged it and was able to come back. I think this looms a little larger, however, I mean because age was the main thing that everybody was worried about and that was what seemed to show. He acknowledged today and I think it's a good thing that he acknowledged that he wasn't the same debater that he had been. He may not have walked as well as he did before. And that -- but he was still, he would claim, somebody who could tell the truth to us, et cetera, et cetera. But then the campaign put out a comment that said, we're not changing our strategy. I think they have to change their strategy. He's going to have to get out there more. He's going to have to have press conferences. He's going to have to have interviews that are unscripted. If it's true that what he does inside the White House, which people who know him say he seems very competent and up to the job, he's going to have to prove that now over again, starting from a difficult position to the country at large, because the voters are going to make this decision. We'll see what happens in the polls in the weeks to come, but it's still going to be an uphill challenge, I think, for him from here on.",

It somehow gets lost in the way we evaluate. Debates and who makes a gaffe and who's raised the most money and who looks better and who looks weak. I mean, what -- whether this person has humility, whether this person has empathy, whether they can acknowledge errors, what kind of a team just to go to your question, what kind of a team are they likely to create? Are there people that can argue with them? Do they have strong minded people? Do they have an accountability for their word? Do they have an ambition that goes for something larger than themselves? These are the qualities that have made up our great leaders. And somehow we have to be able to sort those through as we look at the two people that are going to be running for president, that's even more important than whether they do something in a debate, except it shows in a debate, standing up to pressure, it shows whether you're prepared correctly.

Separately, a slightly different 6-3 majority narrowly -- narrowed the usage of an obstruction law by federal prosecutors to potentially add years to the sentences of January 6th rioters. Also on Monday, the last day of Supreme Court decisions were expecting one on the former president's immunity claims.

It doesn't apply to, for example, just storming the Capitol in a way that interferes with the counting or the process itself, as opposed to something impairing evidence used or some kind of object used in that proceeding. And the way that the special counsel has framed the charges against Trump, there actually is an object or evidence used in the official proceeding at issue, which is namely the slates of electors. And the Supreme Court in language, even in the majority opinion takes pains to say that one could violate this statute by creating false evidence, not only by destroying other evidence.
