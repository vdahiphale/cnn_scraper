Good to have you with us.Just ahead, a match that shocks the world of football, but a victory for diplomacy in the Middle East. Saudi Arabia beating Argentina in 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Then, a new critical phase of unrest in Iran. Military forces reportedly using heavy weapons against protesters in Kurdish cities. And it's a race against time to rescue those trapped under rubble in Indonesia after a devastating earthquake. We'll bring you the latest. Well, let's start with a historic win for the Middle East. Underdog Saudi Arabia defeating Argentina 2 to 1 at the World Cup in Qatar. And take a look at this photo, pretty much summing up the mode in Argentina. That's Lionel Messi, who is considered one of the tournament's favorites. On the other side of the pitch, the Saudis who are amongst the biggest long shots, overjoyed. The king has declared Wednesday a public holiday. But this win is about so much more than football. CNN's Becky Anderson explains why. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BECKY ANDERSON, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Sometimes, the beautiful game is just that, a game. And then there are days when it is so much more than that. For these Saudi fans, today was one of those days. The Falcons stunning Argentina, one of the tournament's favorites. 2-1, inarguably one of the greatest upsets in World Cup history. How do you feel?",

Until last year, Qatar and Saudi had fallen out a big time. In 2017, Riyadh cut off diplomatic and trade ties, along with three other Arab nations, accusing Doha of supporting extremist groups, allegations which Qatar still denies. That economic squeeze offered Qatar billions of dollars. Throughout that for your spat, forces here told me in private, they believed it was a move borne out of pure jealousy. Doha had won the right to host the world's biggest sporting party, a competition Qatar always insisted was meant for everyone. HASSAN AL THAWADI, SEC. GEN., SUPREME CMTE. FOR DELIVERY &amp; LEGACY:  From day one, we said this is a tournament for the region and it still continues to determine for the region. We always work and strive toward ensuring the benefit of the World Cup and that it extends beyond Qatar, to the people of the region.",

It appears that the regime's crackdown has also intensified. Activists and Hengaw Organization for Human Rights, that's a human rights monitor based in Norway, but it's been documenting human rights violations, mostly in the western part of the country, in the majority Kurdish areas. And they have been telling us that they have seen a significant increase in brutality over the past week with forces opening up at protesters and using lethal force against the population. They say, I can tell you tonight, there is a lot of concern about the situation about it being described as critical. But especially in those Kurdish areas. Lynda, we do have to warn viewers, they may find some of the video in our report graphic and disturbing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KARADSHEH (voice-over):  Hundreds poured into the streets of Piranshahr, united in their grief and anger. A martyr for Kurdistan, they chant. They chant for 16-year-old protester, Karavan Ghader Shokri, one of the youngest lives lost in a week of carnage across Iran's Kurdish region. At his burial, his father tells mourners, I dedicated my son to Kurdistan. Every funeral brings more anger, more defiance from the minorities oppressed by the ruthless republic. Iran's minorities, including the Kurds, have borne the brunt of the unforgiving a crackdown. Kurdish cities and towns turned into war zones, the regime sending troops and heavy weapons to suppress an uprising that's been growing stronger by the day.",

But they are telling us, it is very, very hard for them to get information out of these areas. Because of the governments internet disruptions, it's disruptive communications, making it very hard for them to get up to date information. But with the information that's been trickling out, they've been able to confirm that at least 45 people have been killed since last Tuesday in this crackdown, they say, and more than 1,500 people have been wounded.

We have seen over the past couple of weeks, the Russiansreally switch their military strategy towards targeting with heavy missiles, the energy, the critical energy infrastructure of the country, apparently, with the express purpose of trying to disable power lines, to cause power cuts, and shortages. And that's been a successful, in the sense that, you know, across the country now, millions of Ukrainians are at least partially without power. And it's causing enormous logistical problems for the Ukrainian authorities that they're working 24/7 to try and reconnect power lines wherever possible. Power cuts are common, and, of course, we are looking at a time where temperatures are freezing, and plunging rapidly, as winter really sets in, which is the period of the year which requires the most energy, especially in this part of the world. So heating, cooking, things like that, this bombardment that Ukraine has been suffering is critical on the energy infrastructure.

The first royal dignitary to be invited for in official state visit under the reign of King Charles III. The South African president arriving just in time for some more favorable British weather. This is a moment of history, but also one of tradition. And preparations have been underway for weeks, from lining the mall with the South African flag, to rehearsals with the royal carriage procession. A special menu for Tuesday's state banquet has even been designed. South Africa's national flower carefully being recreated out of sugar. The British monarchy shares a long and complex relationship with South Africa. A former colony, and enduring commonwealth nation, and Britain's biggest trading partner on the African continent.
