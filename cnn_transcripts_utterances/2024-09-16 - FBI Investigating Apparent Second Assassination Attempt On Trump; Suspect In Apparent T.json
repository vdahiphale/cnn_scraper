It's kind of, you know, button hold into a tight space right there near the road. I don't know for sure, but I've had other agents tell me that I've been on golf course details that they always clear that tree line in the bubble ahead of the president. It looks like that's what the agent heroically did. And good on him for taking decisive action and taking the shooter down. I also want to praise both the Florida sheriffs and the Secret Service, the acting director, for immediately going to a press conference.I think this is a tell the public what you know, as you know it immediately, given that we're in the heat of the campaign, and given this is two assassination attempts in just two months. It's really mind blowing. And then thirdly, the FBI is taking a different posture. The FBI is, you know, they're drawing a line between the Secret Service and the FBI. The Service is looking at their internal failures as it led up to Butler, and now we'll be looking at any failures as it led up to yesterday. But the FBI is looking at the background of the shooters, the encrypted accounts, the motives, and they're taking a -- it's under investigation. We can't talk about it posture. I think that's unacceptable. They need to be more forthcoming. And when you layer on top of that, that we have foreign threats, that we have an adversary of the United States, Iran, openly talking about killing a leading political candidate. You want to talk about election interference. And I just have to say, we've heard nothing from the administration. I'm glad President Biden called for more resources, but we need consequences for Iran for its ongoing plots to kill the presidents as well.

I mean, I think that makes sense if maybe you're Jimmy Carter or W. Bush that, you know, is painting and living a retired life, but it needs to match the threat. And if the threat is clearly greater than a sitting president or vice president or anything with the Iranian threats plus these domestic threats, then you need to get the president whatever protection he needs, period, to match the threat, not these established protocols. And what agents are telling me is that it's a budget issue. That DHS and Mayorkas set the budget and they don't want to blow up the budget, you know, by -- because President Trump has multiple residences, plays golf and is an active campaigner.

What you see is as millennials, for instance, have gotten older, they haven't shifted dramatically to the right. And when you look at Gen Z, while Gen Z men are actually a pretty available group to Republicans, Gen Z young women are more likely to identify as progressive or liberal than young women ever more 20 years ago.I mean, this is a group that has gone very far to the left, both in terms of ideology labels and the policies that they support. And it does not seem to me that Republicans have a great strategy to win them back, especially if it involves saying, I hate Taylor Swift.",
