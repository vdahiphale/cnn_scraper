That is rare. What that is -- people have heard of, you know, what shingles can do on the body, you oftentimes get a lot of pain and a rash.Think about that same thing happening, John, but on your face. And specifically, the nerve that it involves is the seventh nerve or the facial nerve. When you're a kid, you have chickenpox. The virus that causes that sometimes does not go away, gets reactivated, and can affect that nerve, you would develop weakness, even paralysis of the face. You might get lesions on the face, even in the ear and the mouth, and the eye. It can be super painful as well. And it can be treated the same way that you treat shingles, which is with antivirals, and sometimes steroids. But it can take a while as well for that to go away. A lot of times people say is this like Bell's Palsy? There are different things but similar except that Ramsay Hunt oftentimes lasts longer, and is more severe.",

Alleging so many other things in proprieties with respect to a state representative prosecuting the case, which is unlawful under the Constitution, had to remove him -- remove herself, excuse me from that prosecution. Alleging that the gun was damaged. Alleging that the search warrants were improper, not predicated upon probable cause. So much there. But the essence of it is the evidence.

I mean when you take a look, again, that very hazy orange color just settling in not only over parts of Canada but also even over the U.S. But obviously what we're looking at some of the worst air quality is really going to be across Canada, specifically around the Alberta area where you just have so many wildfires triggering so much widespread smoke. But again, all of that smoke doesn't just disappear, and in many cases, it can infiltrate down into areas of the U.S. And recently we've seen it mainly focused mainly across the Canadian-U.S. border. But now we're starting to see that especially in the last few days begin to progress southward into areas along the Mississippi Valley area, Ohio River Valley, and even the Midwest. Take a look. This is what's supposed to be St. Paul, Minnesota. Again, you can barely see this time-lapse video with how thick that smoke is. And we've really got two main focal points here. Obviously, you've got that area from Calgary stretching down across portions of Montana, Wyoming, and Colorado. But this other area across portions of the Midwest where the air quality is intensely, intensely high. Part of that is because of this cold front here, it's pulling down a lot of that smoke from Canada behind. So, even after the rain moves through, a lot of that smoke is coming back into many of these areas. And going forward.
