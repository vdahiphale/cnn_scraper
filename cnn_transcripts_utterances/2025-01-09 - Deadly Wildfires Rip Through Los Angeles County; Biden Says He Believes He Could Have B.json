This is typically one of the wettest months of the year in Los Angeles but it hasn't rained significantly in months. Last year we got a lot of water all at once in California, created a super bloom of weeds and other vegetation which is now bone dry fuel up in these canyons and with 60, 70 mile an hour winds as this thing broke, spreading it out, the winds died down a bit overnight but it also spread into Runyon Canyon. This is an area right above the Hollywood Walk of Fame, the famous handprints and stars, those hills just north of that area were evacuated last night as the fire crept over the canyons there. This is extremely difficult terrain for first responders to fight in and they weren't able to fly a fixed wing or even helicopters to fight these flames during the first 24, 36 hours of these blazes.

You know, in the OK Boomer term, did the rounds over the last couple of years used more as a disparaging term than one of warmth. And I think that's the challenge here.We see the benefit of understanding the generations and of helping people see where the generations sit so that they can firstly understand something of themselves, where they sit, that they're not just floating freeform in a world. But there's generations that went before, there's generations coming after, and that context is important. And that there are differences that shape us, the times, the events, the experiences, the technologies, and indeed the life stages that we share within a generation and that are different across the generations. And all of that, I think, develops that understanding and hopefully helps us see not only the diversity and the difference, but focus on bridging those gaps to engage. Most people's early experience of life is a multi-generational one, that is, in the family where they are raised. And so there's generally warmth to the different generations, grandparents, parents, children, and our hope is that that continues on. And I think by understanding something of when the generations start and finish, something of the labels that help us see a sense of continuity and context is helpful. We're big for putting forward these labels that aren't laden with meaning. They're scientific nomenclature, Greek letters, alpha, beta, because it's not the name that they're given that matters, it's the name that they make for themselves over the decades ahead. And I think in 10, 20 or 30 years, when we use the term Gen Alpha or Gen Beta, there'll be a lot of meaning to it because this generation will have created that meaning as they've shaped their own pathway in life and distinguished themselves as they solve new problems that really are going to need fresh eyes.",
