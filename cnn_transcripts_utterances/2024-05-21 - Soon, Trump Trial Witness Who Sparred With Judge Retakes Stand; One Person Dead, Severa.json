      "sentences": "So, you can see there, Sara, it's a small text at the bottom of this video, but still obviously drew very fierce backlash from many people, including the Biden campaign. And I want to be clear, the word Reich typically refers to German empires. However, it's obviously been more closely associated with Adolf Hitler's Third Reich. And that's why, of course, this is receiving so much backlash.Now, the Trump campaign in a statement to me this morning tried to walk this back They said that this was a video that was shared by a staffer while Donald Trump was in the courtroom and that they did not realize that it had this language in it and try to really distance themselves. Here's a statement from Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt. She said quote. This was not a campaign video. It was created by a random account online and reposted by a staffer who clearly did not see the word while the president was in court. Now, despite that, I will say the video is still up and this was brought to their attention yesterday. I asked the Trump campaign, you know, if this is what you're saying, why haven't you not removed this video from Donald Trump's account? We did not get an answer to that. Now, here is what the Biden campaign is pushing back on. They said, quote, America, stop scrolling and pay attention. Donald Trump is not playing games. He's telling America exactly what he intends to do if he regains power, rule as a dictator over a unified Reich. And that's from Biden campaign spokesperson James Singer. And, look, we did see as well, the Associated Press first reported this, but the language in that video seems to be copied word from word for word from a Wikipedia page referencing World War 1. And so this is very troubling. And obviously we know that Donald Trump has shared some kind of anti-Semitic rhetoric and images on social media before. And so this is something that many people are calling attention to. And, of course, we saw the Biden campaign speaking out against this very sharply. Sara?",

But, look, it's a chamber of Congress day. It's beautiful outside. There's no rain. There's nothing wrong. We've only seen a handful of people go inside this polling center to vote.
