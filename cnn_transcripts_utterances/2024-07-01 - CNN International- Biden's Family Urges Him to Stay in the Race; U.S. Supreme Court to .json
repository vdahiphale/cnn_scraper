Now, this comes despite growing calls for President Joe Biden to step aside after his poor performance during last week's debate. Mr. Biden's family also reportedly discussed whether top aides should be fired. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez has the latest now from Washington.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

But looming over this visit was Thursday night's debate and all of the immediate fallout. Now, two Biden advisers tell CNN that the president and his family talked about the debate and the family encouraged the president to stay in the race.These advisers say that the conversations were focused on how the family can help and not whether the president should reconsider his candidacy. Now, the president himself has also been eagerly collecting data, anecdotal and through public polling. Of course, all of this as there has been criticism from all corners of the Democratic Party, going from Democratic lawmakers and Democratic officials as well as donors racked by anxiety over Thursday night's debate performance. Now, the president did have a fundraising blitz over the weekend where he too conceded that the debate on Thursday was not his best but still maintaining that he would stay in the race and that he would fight hard for voters. Now, of course, there are still plenty of questions unanswered here and there is still the immediate fallout that the campaign continues to have to wrestle with, particularly on calls over the course of the weekend trying to reassure their supporters that at the end of the day it is two vastly different records between President Biden and former President Donald Trump and that is where the focus should stay. But the very least, on Sunday, the president having those conversations with his family who are all pivotal to his decision- making and then offering their support moving forward.

He is accused of trying to overturn the 2020 election, including his actions on January 6th. But the court's decision could impact other criminal cases against him.Trump argues that without immunity, presidents would be hamstrung in office and worried about facing charges after leaving the White House. An appeals court ruled earlier this year that Trump is not entitled to any protection. Joining me now is civil rights attorney and legal commentator Areva Martin. Appreciate you being with us.",

What ruling are you expecting on this?[04:05:00] MARTIN: I expect that the Supreme Court will rule that there are definitely some actions taken by a sitting president that are immune from prosecution, official actions taken by that president. But I also expect that the Supreme Court will either determine that some of the actions of Donald Trump were not official actions and were in fact private actions or they will send the matter back to the district court judge, Judge Tanya Chutkan, for her to hold an evidentiary hearing to determine which of the actions are indeed official actions of a president or those that are private actions for which there is no immunity. So I don't think this is going to be the win that Donald Trump and many of his MAGA supporters are expecting.",

So when a president vetoes a bill, clearly you would not want to criminalize that conduct and you would want the president immune from any criminal prosecution related to criminalizing -- I mean, to vetoing a bill that wouldn't be criminal conduct. However, in the case of Donald Trump, with respect to trying to submit a, you know, a list of or a slate of fake electors, electors who were not selected by those individuals in the state, actions by this president to subvert the 2020 legitimate electors and the legitimate process that was done to elect Joe Biden as president, those are actions that would be actions of a candidate Trump, not a President Trump. So you can see where the Supreme Court would want to draw a line between those private actions that an individual takes that are not advancing the office of the president versus those like vetoing a bill which are clearly under the purview of a presidential, someone sitting in the White House as the president.",

      "sentences": "My guesstimation, and of course, you know, I don't have a crystal ball and can't say definitively what the Supreme Court will do, but my suspicion is based on the historical record and everything that we've seen, is that this court is likely to send this matter, remand it back to the district court, remand it to Judge Tanya Chutkan for her to hold an evidentiary hearing, almost a mini trial, so it's for there to be a determination by this judge as to which actions were indeed official actions and which actions were indeed private actions.And I think it's important to note that Special Counsel Smith, Jack Smith, made it very clear in the indictment that the actions engaged in by Donald Trump to subvert the 2020 election were indeed not actions of a President Trump, but as candidate Trump, and there's a big difference. There's no immunity, or no immunity that I believe that this Supreme Court will afford to someone acting as a candidate, as essentially a private citizen for all practical purposes. So I think we're going to see this matter remanded back to the district court for there to be an evidentiary hearing and for this judge to be the final arbiter. Now, of course, we know Donald Trump, whatever decision is made by the district court, is likely to be appealed again if possible. So I don't think there's going to be a quick resolution to this, but I do not think that the ruling that we are expecting in several hours is going to exonerate Donald Trump from all criminal liability.",

The worst he's done since being in power. But the broad trend, as you say, this in the United States, the potential for Donald Trump to be reelected, what we're witnessing in France or what we've witnessed this weekend, what we saw about a month ago in the European Parliamentary elections there, and even within the sort of gains that have been made within the right-wing groupings within the European Parliament, there is a narrative and a trend to sort of move beyond, let's say, Giorgia Meloni, the Italian Prime Minister, right-wing, came in with sounding like she might be something of an outlier within NATO and the European Union, but actually works with NATO and the European Union in strong support of Ukraine. But there's a drift towards potentially right-wing parties taking a position like the AfD in Germany, who are more right-wing and don't cooperate with their representatives within the European Parliament. So if that drift to the further right happens as a result of Marine Le Pen's success and her party's success in France, that pushes Europe more to the right, and I think the way that you would see that most immediately would be tougher policies on immigration, and that's certainly a direction that Marine Le Pen, Jordan Bardella want to take France in right now.",
