It includes those three potential crimes relating to Trump's mishandling of federal records and national defense information and the role that he played in the January 6th Capitol riot.There are also key differences in why exactly Garland decided to appoint special counsel to these probes.

And that's what begs the question of full transparency. And it's not just us. The Washington Post editorial board this morning says the same thing, that if the president and this White House answered more questions directly like that exact timeline, that would, quote, promote trust and pre-empt this criticism.

So, I would hope that House Republicans under speaker McCarthy would reach out to us, will reach out to them, I intend to sit down with Republican leaders in the Senate and the House and try and get things done that can help the American people.But this past week has been very discouraging. What did they do? Let's look at each of things they did. None of them helped the American people. The first thing they did is protect multimillionaires and billionaires from being audited. It's been a long thrust of some of these MAGA Republicans that these people should get away with all the loopholes they use. And so, finally, we were able to say, let's put some -- the IRS is short of people because Donald Trump cut the people, the tea party cut the people. In fact, under Donald Trump -- HARLOW:  A lot of people are retiring from the IRS.",

Under Trump, you were more likely to be audited if you made -- this is the reports -- $40,000 a year, than if you made $4 million a year. They said the EITC comes in. The Republicans come in and do that. Then they put in a budget that would require us to cut so many things. Their ten-year budget would cut Medicare and social security. Wow. Then they put in some things on abortion that would allow doctors to be prosecuted, criminalization in certain instances. And the final thing they did is launch a lot of committees to investigate. You know what the American people want us to do? They want us to do things to make their lives better. They don't want just Congress to investigate, investigate.One final point. So, there are a whole bunch of Republicans who are not MAGA. My hope is, and I believe this, that after a little while they will see that following this extreme fringe is like following Thelma and Louise over the cliff and that they will come and start dealing with us in a serious way. We'll have disagreements, but in previous Congresses, we were able to come together and get things done. If the Republican Party rejects these MAGA extremists after a while, the mainstream Republicans, we can get a lot done, and that's my hope.",

If you are worried about inflation -- and, by the way, we've cut the deficit in the IRA, we reduced the deficit. If you're worried about an inflation, a default would be huge. So, it always has been done in a bipartisan way.Three times when Donald Trump was president, twice when the Republicans had the House and Senate, we cooperated with the Republicans and raised it because, after all, these are debts we've already incurred. We're just paying the bill. And then under President Biden, we worked out an agreement, bipartisan, where the Republicans didn't have to vote for it but they allowed 50 votes to pass it and we got it done. That's what we should do again, get it done in a bipartisan way. They rejected that in December. But I think, as we get closer and closer, the real -- the way we have to do this or the month we have to do this looks three, four, five, six months off, that they will come to reality and, again, do the same thing we did the last four times.",
