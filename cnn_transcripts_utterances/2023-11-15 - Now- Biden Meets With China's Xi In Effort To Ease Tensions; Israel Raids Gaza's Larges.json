It is an objective fact that China and the United States are different in history, culture, social system and development path.

Israel says the controversial military operation at al-Shifa has provided them with \"concrete evidence\" that Hamas was using the hospital as a command center. As images of damage and panic inside the hospital emerge, the Israel Defense Forces have begun presenting their case in the face of harsh condemnation from the U.N., the World Health Organization, and medical officials in Gaza.Earlier today, Hamas said the hospital complex is now fully in Israel's hands. The WHO said it has lost contact with the facility. Let's bring in CNN's Nada Bashir in Jerusalem. Nada, any more details about the evidence the IDF claims it has?",

      "sentences": "Well, look, the IDF has long held that they believe a Hamas command and control center was positioned in the basement of the al-Shifa Hospital. Following that overnight raid, Israeli defense officials have released further details around the evidence they believe they have uncovered at the al-Shifa Hospital.They say they found evidence of weapons, of military equipment, as well as technological assets which they have attributed to Hamas. And, of course, it is important to underscore that CNN has been unable to independently verify these claims to Hamas. And doctors on the ground at al-Shifa have long rejected allegations of a Hamas presence at the al-Shifa Hospital. And as we know, of course, there is a huge amount of concern over the safety and security of patients inside the hospital as this raid takes place. As we know, of course, the Israeli Defense Force has said that it is focused on uncovering Hamas positions. It is focused on prioritizing the safety of civilians. But as we have seen over the last few days and particularly today amid that ongoing raid, we have seen Israeli bombardment edging closer to the premises of the al-Shifa Hospital complex. One doctor speaking to CNN overnight, describing the shelling as edging closer and closer to the hospital, shaking the walls of the hospital complex. You could hear the gunfire in his voice recording as well. So there is a huge amount of concern. You mentioned there the condemnation from the United Nations. We've heard from the U.N.'s humanitarian relief coordinator describing the military raid as appalling, saying that hospitals should not be turned into battlegrounds, and calling on both sides to prioritize the safety and security of patients and civilians, as well as medical staff inside the hospital. As we know, there are some 1,500 patients and medical staff in the hospital right now, believed to be, according to officials, on the ground, as well as hundreds of other civilians who are taking shelter on the hospital complex. And there have been calls for civilians to evacuate. But the warning, the message that we've been hearing from doctors, from hospital officials, is that it is near impossible to evacuate patients and civilians in the current conditions. With the current bombardment around the al-Shifa complex, it simply isn't secure enough for civilians. Doctors from Doctors Without Borders have described sniper fire being experienced as people are trying to move between different buildings on the very large al-Shifa complex. And as we know, many of those patients require specialist medical care. And the humanitarian situation has been deteriorating. They are now unable to provide the care that is necessary. And of course, in order to evacuate many of these patients, they require specialist medical evacuations, which have not been offered with no safe guarantees either for that evacuation. Pamela?",

But exactly what that deal would look like isn't entirely clear for what we have learned from various sources here in Israel and in the U.S. as well, that the broad parameters of this negotiation could involve the exchange of a large number, of hostages being held by Hamas, not all of them, but a large number in exchange for a day's long ceasefire. But the specific details simply haven't been revealed.And all of this is unfolding as the families of these hostages continue to try to mount pressure from around the world to get the focus back on these hostages, to get them released safely. There is a long march from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem that is currently taking place with the families of hostage members, so a great deal of concern there. We also learned, just to kind of add more details to just how simply distressing this is for so many of these families, in a letter that the first lady of Israel, Sara Netanyahu, wrote to first lady in the U.S., Jill Biden. In that letter it was included the details that Israel has learned of a hostage that has given birth to a baby while in custody there in Gaza. So clearly the urgency of this moment is not lost on the hundreds of family members who are desperately waiting for news as to how all of this will unfold. But the negotiations are moving painstakingly slow. And it's not exactly clear, given the military operations that are unfolding inside of Gaza, how this will play out in the days ahead. Pamela?",

And I have heard some of the folks you've interviewed talk about the conditions. What I'd like to add to this is that communication is cut off. So truthfully, we don't know what's going on inside the hospital, except through the lens of the Israeli soldiers there.Their - that communication cutoff has both been probably because communication is cut off by those soldiers entering, but also there's a lack of fuel. So al-Shifa Hospital has been running on fuel-powered generators because the electricity has been cut off in the siege. And we know in the last 24 hours, very little communication has gotten through. Yes, there are patients, hundreds of patients, doctors and there are many people who sought shelter there ahead of this raid. And we know that, as was indicated, again, by those you've interviewed, there have been sniper shots at those who've been trying to leave or go between buildings. This is not just over the last 24 hours. This is over the last couple of days. And that there are so many bodies to bury that they can't safely take away from the hospital. So they've been forced to bury these bodies in the hospital compound, which we all know is an incredibly - is very unsafe for the spread of disease.

It is just unfathomable to think of what folks are going through right now, what civilians are facing.And I worry very much this - al-Shifa is one of the oldest and largest hospitals in Gaza and was one of the few functioning hospitals after electricity has been cut and fuel has run out. People have nowhere left to go. If they tried to get out of that hospital, they're getting out in unsafe conditions. Even 102 of my colleagues at UNRWA have been killed, 70 percent of those below the Wadi Gaza line in the south. We have over 50 UNRWA installations have been hit, have been damaged. There is no safe place in Gaza right now. And hitting any U.N. installation is a violation of international humanitarian law.
