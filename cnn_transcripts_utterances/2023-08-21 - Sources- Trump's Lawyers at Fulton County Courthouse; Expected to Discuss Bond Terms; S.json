Former President Donald Trump's lawyers are now at the courthouse set to meet with District Attorney Fani Willis and negotiate his surrender on RICO charges tied to his effort to overturn the 2020 Election.A short time ago, John Eastman, a former Trump lawyer and a primary architect of that 2020 Election subversion scheme agreed to a hundred thousand dollars bond. And pro-Trump poll watcher, Scott Hall, agreed to a $10,000 bond. Let's get you straight to the courthouse now with CNN's Katelyn Polantz. Katelyn, Eastman obviously one of the biggest names of the 19 defendants, not including Donald Trump, what's the latest that you're learning about what's happening at the courthouse behind you?",

      "sentences": "Well, what we're learning now at the courthouse from our own Zach Cohen and Kaitlan Collins is that Donald Trump's lawyers are here indeed doing the negotiations for his own bond terms. Donald Trump being one of the 19 defendants in this criminal case, there are several different defense lawyers that are negotiating bond terms, just like John Eastman, you just mentioned has that a hundred thousand dollar bond set.Another defendant in this case who was trying to - who was accused of trying to access vote tabulating machines in Coffee County, Georgia, he has a $10,000 bond. And so the big question of the afternoon and throughout the rest of this week is going to be exactly how is Donald Trump treated here compared to the other defendants in this case and then defendants writ large in the state of Georgia, in Fulton County, who are being accused of white collar crime or racketeering charges. Does he have some sort of bail term that is set and very similar to these other defendants? Is he treated the same as other defendants? We won't know that until we see what the agreement is that his lawyers reach with the prosecutor's office here and a judge signs off on it. But once we get that document, that is what we're going to be looking for. And then once that document is in the system, along with the documents for these other 18 defendants alongside Trump, they then all have to turn themselves in. They all have to be arraigned. They have to visit the jail. And they will have to enter their pleadings of not guilty. And so that arrest process, that arraignment process, that's what's teed up for the rest of this week, perhaps arraignments going into next week. We're going to be watching all of that play out as Donald Trump and others working around him, including people who were closely affiliated with his campaign, people who were lawyers for him, as they run a face with the criminal justice system as criminal defendants being accused of taking actions that were illegal in the state of Georgia after the 2020 Election to help the former president maintain power, even though he lost this state and others across the nation.",

That includes things like not intimidating witnesses, not contacting co- defendants except through counsel.Those are things that are pretty standard conditions that I think will be easily resolved and agreed to. The big questions will be whether they come to an agreement about the bond amount and then also whether they come to an agreement about the terms of surrender that is due to happen by Friday. Well, that is usually in the realm of decision-making with the sheriff's office as to how to handle it, so that's things like whether or not the defendant has a mugshot ...",

I think that that will occur here, especially now that we've seen John Eastman has a bond of a hundred thousand dollars.As Katelyn mentioned, however, that is not the actual amount that you have to pay. You usually pay about 10 percent and the rest of it is more like an assurance that you will pay it. So I don't - I think that what we will see is that Trump will have a bond that is higher than Eastman's. It seems to be the case that what we're seeing here is a higher amount based on the involvement or alleged involvement in the conspiracy.

So it is a place that certainly no one wants to end up. And Trump will have to walk through that facility and like any other defendant, spend some time there.

I was lucky enough just to jump in with a dedicated team of volunteers. Maui Rapid Response is an ahupua'a-based, citizen-led crisis response team. So ahupua'a is our traditional form of land management. It means, as was stated in the last individual, we let the community lead, the Lahaina community, the upcountry community, who also lost a lot. As soon as this tragedy started happening, we just kind of started activating the community. There's no one person here, even no one agency spearheading this. This is a completely decentralized, distributed community supporting itself. A bunch of people got together. We organized collection centers and distribution hubs. Obviously, at first, getting over there via roads was difficult. It was cut off because of safety measures. But we're pretty industrious and we can get things done, so we got helicopters and boats and jet skis and everything to get help out to those people.
