And then on the shooter himself when he was killed by law enforcement, he had a transmitter with him.Now, I do want to add one important point here, is at the moment, it looks to us -- again, ongoing review, and I can't say that too many times, at a moment, it looks like because of the on-off position on the receivers, that if he had tried to detonate those devices from the roof, it would not have worked, but that doesn't mean the explosives weren't dangerous.",

The flight from Montana was perfectly fine, on time. We knew that there was going to be a two-hour delay in Salt Lake City. No problem.So, we get into the club room and it's pretty evident something's going on that's not good. And, what was it, two-hour delay went to a three-hour delay, went to a four-hour delay, went to a five-hour delay, and then went to a six-hour delay. And once it hit six, our delay, soon after that, the flight was canceled. I -- mine was not the only one. Matter of fact, it was virtually everyone. In the club room there in Salt Lake City, I tried to get with a service representative. I had -- I was given a time of 222 minutes before I could speak to anyone. So, I called Delta and was on hold for over two and a half hours, and my 222 minutes came up before, and I actually did get to speak to someone. I was also trying on their Delta website to rebook a different flight, and it would never rebook. It would never answer me. It was just shut down.",
