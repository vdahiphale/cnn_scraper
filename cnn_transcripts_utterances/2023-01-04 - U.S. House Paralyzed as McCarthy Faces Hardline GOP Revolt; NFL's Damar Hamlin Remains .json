Very soon the House is supposed to convene. Kevin McCarthy insists he will not be dropping out of the race and insists he can get to 218, despite failing to secure support in three separate votes. It is the first time in a century that the House did not elect a speaker on the first round of voting. At the heart of this mess is a small group of conservatives, about 10 percent of the Republican conference, all of whom want more power, all of whom are taking advantage of the Republicans' slim majority. But it's messy from here on out. Lauren Fox is standing by. Phone calls, sleepless nights, lots of back room and basement discussions. What is happening right now?",

The options today are twofold.They can either go to the floor and vote or potentially try to adjourn to give themselves a bit more time to wrestle this out behind the scenes. So far the discussions are not yielding any more yes votes for McCarthy. But the question is whether Democrats will allow McCarthy to try to adjourn to give himself more time. I think it would depend on how long they want to adjourn for. We are hearing Democrats will try to whip against adjourning until tomorrow. So it's a sense of the pressure cooker up here. Meanwhile, the President of the United States making a clear statement about what he thinking of this mess over on the other side of Pennsylvania avenue. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  For the first time in 100 years, you can't move. I really mean it. I know you know international relations. It is not a good look, not a good thing. It's the United States of America. And I hope they get their act together. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Congressman, just your take on this moment. The options are either have a vote at noon or push it off another day, if Kevin McCarthy can even get people to agree to that. Which is the better option for you? WILL HURD (R-TX), FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE:  I think neither sound like good options. I have to step back and say it's shocking that the fringe minority, they must have been on vacation in November and didn't see the outcome of the elections in 2022. The American voters said very clearly they wanted people to fight for them, solve problems on the horizon, like inflation, border security, China, not this. This notion that Democrats are going to help McCarthy now? They were giddy on the floor yesterday. President Biden is excited to be in Kentucky today to show contrasts to this. I don't call this fringe minority -- I call them the fringe minority, because they say they want conservative things to happen in Congress. But the only thing they're doing is helping the liberals to show the country, hey, this was potentially a bad decision, because these folks may not be able to govern.",

In fact, I just talked to one of the members involved, Brian Fitzpatrick, one of the more moderate members of the conference.He's been having some of the discussions with some of the detractors, some of the McCarthy detractors, trying to understand what the opponents need to get to yes. Trying to put together some offer, some proposal that they could then present to the rest of the conference, see if the rest of the conference agrees with the changes. They include giving the rank-and-file members, the far-right members key committee assignments, more power to use nor leverage over the Speakership. The question, though, is can the rest of the conference agree to it? That's why there's been active discussions all day long about whether they can delay the vote for another day. They want more time to have those discussions play out in order to get a deal. The real fear among the McCarthy allies is that he will lose votes on the fourth ballot. He could go from 20-21, maybe even beyond. If he does, that undercuts any ability to showcase he's regaining momentum. That's a real risk to trying to achieve 218 votes. His allies believe he is still the only one that can ultimately get there in this razor- thin Republican majority.",

What's going to ultimately be required to get through this standstill is some leader emerge out of the conference to say, listen, this is not good for the conference. This is not good for the institution, this is not good for the country. We need to find who can lead us. Let's be clear, the motivations of these 20 folks, their stated motivations, they want additional power. In reality, all they want to do is throw bombs. So this notion -- and they probably don't care who the compromise candidate is, because they got the eyeballs on their social media pages. They got on cable news to talk about these things.

There's a need for regulation and we need to make sure we're preparingour kids for the future. Congress has a role in that. But one of the lessons we have to take away from this is the situation Kevin McCarthy is in right now is of his own making. If this doesn't happen for him, he's not a martyr. The fact that he tried to negotiate with this fringe element, sometimes to the detriment of his allies, I think he would love for Peter Meijer and Liz Cheney and, you know, Jaime Herrera Butler to be back in Congress.

It was built 60 years ago to accommodate about half the traffic it now currently sees every day. Local and business leaders say that costs millions of dollars in economic losses. So ultimately, what President Biden is here to talk about is what can be done when Democrats and Republicans work together and also, of course, this contrast. Already the president was looking to kick off 2023, as he faces this new reality of divided government in Washington by touting the bipartisanship, standing alongside Mitch McConnell to talk about this project. But that contrast has sharpened, even more so, given what we are seeing with the House Republicans unable through infighting to actually pick a speaker. That will certainly be a split screen that the president enjoys today.",

He was very mature beyond his years. Even his charitable efforts began at a young age. I think he hosted in his heart the dream that so many kids do, of playing in the National Football League. But he felt sure he would do it and wouldn't let anything get in the way.

It's kids from different neighborhoods and different socioeconomic backgrounds. But we consider ourselves a brotherhood and they certainly formed that. Damar was key in reaching across lines that anybody, was always willing to help a lesser student, a lesser athlete, just someone to look to. In his older years, he took up the mantle of that. He was a real treat to be around and to coach and to -- you know, you retire from football, which I have. But you never retire from these kids' lives.
