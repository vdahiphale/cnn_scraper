Others sit underwater. Casualties of a dam and reservoir finished a decade ago.

You can probably guess where it is. (On camera):  For decades, Japanese young people have been fleeing their small rural towns, lured by the draw of big cities like Tokyo and Osaka, all of them connected by the bullet train. (Voice-over):  But there`s no magic bullet for Japan`s population problems. Even in Tokyo, the towers are high. Birth rates hit record lows. Japan`s population plummeting for more than five years. If the trend continues, experts fear it will fall past the point of no return. (On camera):  Why are so few women in Japan having children?
