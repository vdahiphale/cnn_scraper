What's clear is that there's no question that Hamas is dangling the possibility of releasing additional hostages in order to achieve that very goal of delaying, perhaps inevitably, an Israeli invasion. What's also clear is that the Israelis, even if they're willing to delay that ground invasion for a time at least, that they're not going to do so indefinitely. Whether you listen to the defense minister or the IDF Chief of Staff or other top generals, it is very clear that they intend to move forward with a ground invasion. Frankly, to cancel those plans would be to suffer some kind of political embarrassment in the country, a country that has certainly been preparing and in large part is eager for some kind of ground operation inside of Gaza after those shocking and barbaric terrorist attacks like Hamas carried out two weeks ago.

You had Hamas terrorists going from house to house in the Kibbutzim. So, going into the little houses, into the bedrooms of the families, and shooting parents and children in their beds. This wasn't a military attack. This has nothing -- you know, people talk about you have to understand the context of the Israel-Palestinian conflict, and yes, the context of the Israel-Palestinian conflict is very important. But this is not just that -- this is not the only context even people being marked down for extinction because they're Jews and if anybody still has any argument, this is not because they're Jews. It's because they're Israelis, because they're Zionists, because they're occupiers, and so on. Why are all these many cases which you just mentioned now of Jews around the world being attacked in the wake of this, of what happened on October 7th in Israel. There is a clear linkage here to a desire of Hamas -- of their supporters wherever they are to harm Jews, to kill Jews, to exterminate Jews. It has nothing to do with any of the ideological arguments over what is the best solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict. Yes, that is part of the story, but the way in which this was carried out, the direct intention of exterminating entire Jewish communities in Israel is not a question of politics. It's -- it's classic Jew hatred. And I think that we still have people alive with us today who remember another period in which Jewish people were marked down for extinction and it's simply recurring. This is not a second Holocaust. It's not happening on the same scale as the Holocaust and Jews today have a state which can, in this case, suddenly failed to protect them, but can protect them, and does endeavor to protect them.

MUSTAFA AL-HAMARNEH, JORDANIAN SENATOR: The Israelis were always adamant about no return of refugees. And that's why the Palestinians cling to what they call Law of Return or the Right of Return Back. So, any eviction, any new mass of Palestinian refugees for us is a repeat of 1948.

      "sentences": "I think Hamas is very aware of the objective of the Israeliwar against it. Israel decided that after the horrific, barbaric attack that killed thousands of Israeli citizens, children in front of their parents, pregnant women, raping and burning, and all the atrocities, should not be happened again. And Israel is going to destroy Hamas. Hamas try to delay the Israeli ground move into Gaza. And he has in his eyes, in his perspective, some chips to play with. And the two women were the first play to see that they are still controlling Gaza and they still can deliver the hostages back. Israel demands the release of all the 30 kids, nine months old baby to five, six, eight years old children. Some of them lost their parents and they want Hamas to release the kids. The women that as we speak are continue to be raped and the elderly, some Holocaust survivors that need their medicine. At least this humanitarian package should continue. Hamas is very cynically trying to use, to release them in groups of two, but Israel will not agree to it. So, Israel has to handle the tension between the military objective to destroy Hamas and saving as much hostages as possible through a deal or through a military rescue operation.",

However, with more difficult conditions because we have the 200 hostages and you had an amazing large coalition of 65, maybe 72 countries and nobody supported Daesh. Hamas is supported by some countries and we don't have any coalition, only the U.S. which is our largest and sometime only a lot.",

A pool of dried blood, evidence of what happened. David Moshe was shot and killed here, holding onto the door handle to prevent the gunman from getting in. ANAT (ph): He was a hero. And he was shot. So, there are three gunshots on the door that succeeded to break through the door. COOPER (voice-over): Their attackers dragged Adina Moshi out through the safe room window. She later appeared in this video posted online sandwiched between gunmen on a motorbike in Gaza. Some of the missing have been found. The bodies of 80-year-old Carmela Dan and her 13-year-old granddaughter Noya were identified this week. Her former son-in-law, Afar Calderon, is still missing, as are two of his children, Sahar and Erez. This video shows Erez being dragged away by gunmen, one of whom appears to have blood on his hand. The geo located where the video was shot. This is the last known location of Erez Calderon. He was twelve years old. He was kidnapped by Hamas gunmen and he was videotaped as they were dragging him away in this direction. This is the fence to the kibbutz. Gaza is only about a mile and a half away. You can see an explosion that's just taken place in Gaza off in the distance. So, the gunmen didn't have far to take him in order to get him back into Gaza. There's video of Shari Baba (ph) being kidnapped as well, clutching her two children, Arielle and Kafar. Her husband is missing, too. We talked to her cousin last week.",
