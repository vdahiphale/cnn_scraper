Number one.Number two, the Ukrainians are running out of ammunition. The ammunition they used to call them 155-millimeter weapons. This is a -- this is a war relating to munitions. And the running out of those -- that ammunition and we're low on it. And so, what I finally did took the recommendation of the Defense Department to not permanently but to allow for in this transition period where we have more 155 weapons -- the shells for Ukrainians to provide them with a something as a very low dud rate. It's about one -- I think it's 150, which is the least likely to be blind. And it's not used in civilian areas. They're trying to get through those trenches, and those -- then stop those tanks from rolling. And so -- but it was not an easy decision. And it's not -- we're not signatories to that agreement, but I -- it took me a while to be convinced to do it.

That is intolerable to us.(END VIDEO CLIP) WRIGHT: So, there we just heard from Sullivan at the podium. The reality -- but the reality is -- here is that despite his defense, it could cause some consternation with allies as President Biden is set to head to Europe for a NATO Summit next week. As it's banned -- these cluster munitions are banned in more than one hundred countries. And even on the books here in the U.S., there are laws against transferring it to other nations. But one thing that we heard President Biden talk about, we heard Sullivan talk about from the podium is that dud, right, which is basically the percent to which these bombs do not explode. Now, Sullivan made the case that the cluster munitions that the U.S. would send to Ukraine have about a 2.4 percent dud rate, whereas the ones that Russia's are currently are using that are currently on the ground in Ukraine have about a 30 to 40 percent dud rate. Making the case that what Russia already has in the ground provides way more of an impact on civilians than what Ukraine would use. But ultimately, Sullivan made the case that they received written assurances from Ukraine that they would really try to make the most of not having a major civilian impact when using these types of munitions. Basically, saying that they're motivated not to because these are in their homeland with their own citizens. But, of course, this continues to be a controversial decision and we may hear more about it as the week goes on. Victor.",

Welcome to you both. Jeanna, let me start with you. And just explain for people who are listening to Matt's report there where they say -- you know he's quoting Mark Zandi of Moody's, Goldilocks June report. Not too hot, not too cold.

But at the end of the day, the Federal Reserve is still looking at what is a pretty hot job market with four percent -- 4.4 percent annual wage growth.And that wage growth is making Fed officials a little bit nervous. They're not sure that inflation can get the whole way back down to normal at a time when people are earning a lot more because that inspires companies to charge more, it means that we can all afford slightly higher prices, and that can keep inflation rising. And so, I think we are likely to see another rate move in July. Investors basically see it as a done deal at this point.

That's why the teamsters who staff United Parcel Service -- UPS workers are threatening to go on strike in a couple of weeks. They want better work conditions. Low unemployment means just in a very basic supply and demand way that you've got to pay people more to get them off the sidelines. And that's -- a good thing is what the White House is banking on that people will feel better about their chances. They'll feel better about the fact that prices are in fact coming down.

So, people will feel it.As long as people feel it, that they see the help wanted signs, that they can get work if -- when they're looking for it, that they can afford the things that they want, even if the prices are a little bit more than they'd like to pay, there'll be some dissatisfaction but they liked the idea. The polls really do sort of support this, that the economy is trending in the right direction. So, there was 75 percent dissatisfaction with Biden's handling of the economy a couple of months ago. It's down now to 70 percent. So, most people are upset, but they're recognizing it seems that things are moving in the right direction.

This is basically, at this point, one of the strongest labor markets I think we've ever seen here in the United States.

And I was really startled because there was almost nothing there. They're talking about more and more tax cuts. They're talking about changing depreciation schedules for small businesses. Really kind of marginal stuff that might move the needle a little bit, but it's not designed to really strike at the core of the economy and reach millions and millions of Americans and improve their life chances in the -- in the short term.So, I'm not sure that's going to necessarily work for them. In fact, I think the reason that you see the Democrats resorting to what they're calling Biden-nomics is that they're trying to sort of capture that ground and leave the Republicans not much. And that's why I think we, unfortunately, are going to expect to see them move to the so-called cultural issues. And they're going to talk about immigration. And they're going to talk about, you know, Hunter Biden's laptop. And they're going to talk about things like -- you know what school books are being assigned in high schools around the country because they don't have much of an argument on the economy. Again, when the numbers are trending in the right direction, record low unemployment and inflation, while still too high, is it six percent now down from nine percent, it doesn't leave them a lot of room to come in unless they've got something new and innovative.

Hopefully, a little bit more quickly. But we're still not close to sort of complete total victory here. And so, I think it's going to be a while before the Fed is going to lower interest rates. They're going to have to see a pretty you know substantial cool down in the economy before that happens.

By prosecuting that destructive case, Mr. Giuliani, a sworn officer of the court forfeited his right to practice law. He should be disbarred. The three-person panel was unanimous in its recommendation. Giuliani's attorneys previously argued to the committee that he had reason to believe the claims and litigation were true, adding that he was relying on what others working with the Trump campaign had told him about the fraud allegations. Now, this recommendation from the disciplinary committee isn't the final word. D.C.'s board on professional responsibility will still need to consider the case against Giuliani, as well, the D.C. Court of Appeals. A political adviser to Giuliani called the report a \"great injustice.\" Adding, the decision makers at the D.C. bar association are nothing more than an arm of the permanent regime in Washington.

The vice premier also mentioned the Chinese spy balloon incident and said it was \"a pity it had occurred\" and cause difficulty to bilateral relations. As you may recall, that spy balloon was shut down over the U.S. back in March and sent U.S.-China relations to an all-time low. Earlier, Janet Yellen took part in a roundtable with climate finance leaders, where she said the threat of climate change was a top global challenge in both countries, as the largest emitters of greenhouse gases must work together. But Yellen's most important meeting was yesterday with Chinese Premier Li Qiang, where he described Yellen as a builder, working to improve economic ties between the U.S. and China. Beijing sees Yellen as a voice of reason within the Biden administration. She's argued against tariffs and warned that decoupling would be disastrous. Yellen's meetings wrap up this evening.

The Federal Aviation Administration has really been trying to tackle this problem and held a safety summit, convened to review boards. Also called for new training for its air traffic controllers. But now, the Department of Transportation's independent inspector general wants to know if all of that is enough? The inspectors review will also look at how the FAA tracks and analyses data about the so- called runway incursions. The FAA tells us it welcomes this review, which is set to start this month.
