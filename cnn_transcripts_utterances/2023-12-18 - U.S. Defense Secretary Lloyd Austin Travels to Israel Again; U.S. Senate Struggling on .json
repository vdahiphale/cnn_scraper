Thanks for joining us. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin will be sitting down with Israeli officials in the hours ahead on his second trip to the country since the October 7th attack by Hamas. Austin's visit comes after a stop in Bahrain and once in Israel, a U.S. official says he will get updates on the war. But he's also expected to press Israeli officials to define specific operational milestones and work to drill down on efforts to boost humanitarian aid to Gaza. His visit comes as the Israel Defense Forces says it's uncovered the biggest Hamas tunnel in Gaza, wide enough to drive a large vehicle through. That tunnel, which the IDF says was secured a few weeks ago, was made public on Sunday. One IDF spokesperson described the Hamas tunnel system as a quote, \"underground terror city.\" Elliott Gotkine is following developments and joins me live from London. Good morning to you, Elliot. So, U.S. Defense Secretary Austin will meet with Israeli officials in the coming hours amid increasing pressure on Prime Minister Netanyahu to define the next phase of this war and to make a deal with Hamas to get more hostages released. How far might Israel go on all of this?",

So, I think Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will be very respectful and listen, but probably won't waver from his position, which is that this war will continue until Hamas is destroyed militarily and no longer poses a threat to Israel and, of course, getting all of those hostages back.But of course, within that scope, there are many details to be discussed. And as you mentioned, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin keen to get more details from Prime Minister Netanyahu, also Israel's defense minister, Yoav Galant, and also members of the war cabinet, such as Benny Gantz, to get a real sense of where Israel is in its operations against Hamas and to define those milestones, those metrics that it needs to meet, when it's going to meet them in order to transition to the next phase of its war against Hamas, perhaps a lower intensity phase. The other two main issues, I suppose, is the civilian and humanitarian issues and perhaps more broadly speaking, regional security. In terms of civilian issues, again, pushing Israel to allow to ensure that more humanitarian aid gets into the Gaza Strip. It's still running at about half the level that it was before October the 7th, but the humanitarian situation inside the enclave is that much more desperate now. It will be seen as a step in the right direction that the Kerem Shalom crossing between Israel and Gaza is now allowing aid to go directly into the Gaza Strip, but Israel will be pressed to do more. And on top of that, of course, and we heard those warnings from President Biden about Israel's, in his words, indiscriminate bombing, Israel needs to take much greater care to minimize civilian deaths.

And I think the question is whether congressional Republicans can take yes for an answer. By any historical measure, in any earlier era, I think it's pretty clear that Biden is willing to give them what would be considered a significantly policy victory in terms of changing the asylum process in ways that makes it tougher for those seeking asylum to stay in the U.S. or to have their claims approved. But he's not in all likelihood going to be able to give them everything they want and I suspect that among senate Republicans, there's enough desire to find in fact aid to Ukraine and Israel that they would be willing to make a reasonable deal. I'm not sure that's the case in the House. I mean the House Republicans may simply not want to make any deal because it's kind of (inaudible).

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANNA COREN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  In a small, dimly lit room in the outer suburbs of Karachi, Pakistan, a 15-year-old girl will call Azer (ph) lays on a cot. With eyes closed, she slowly inhales. Her skeletal frame rises slightly, an action causing pain and an enormous amount of effort. Don't worry, you'll be fine, says her brother, kissing her hand, we are with you always. Her older siblings, who asked not to be identified for security reasons, smuggled her in from neighboring Afghanistan five months ago following a series of events that would irrevocably change the course of their lives. We don't try to force her to remember what happened, he says, but once I asked her and she replied, crying, that she was tired and had given up all hope. But Azer didn't always feel this way. Seen here in pink dancing on cell phone footage, the teenager was happy, studious, and had big dreams to one day become a doctor. But that all changed in August 2021 when the Taliban retook control of Afghanistan after the U.S. withdrawal following its 20-year war. And one of the first edicts the Taliban enforced was a ban on female secondary education. She would say, I hope we move from this place, explains her sister, I don't want to be here, there is no education. Over the following months, her mood darkened, but nothing that alarmed her family, until one day in July this year. She came into the room, and I saw her eyes were abnormal, she says. I asked her what had happened, and she said she'd drunk acid. I didn't believe her, so I put my fingers in her mouth, and she vomited up blood. Azer's sister said she had drunk battery acid in their home in an attempted suicide, a trend that is spiking amongst teenage girls across Afghanistan, according to health professionals and human rights groups. An Afghan doctor who spoke to us anonymously, fearing retribution from the Taliban, tells CNN he's seen a 50 percent rise in the number of mental health cases among girls at his clinic who have considered suicide in the past two years. Of these cases, at least 10 percent have taken their own lives, drinking chemicals, overdosing on pain medication, even consuming rat poison. He believes this is the direct result of the education ban and other draconian restrictions that are being placed on girls. AFGHAN DOCTOR (through translator):  I try to give them hope that education will start again, but I don't see any good future for anyone in this country. Everything is in a very dark situation.",

An online flyer for the rally calling on a boycott for other of Sasson's restaurants. In 2021, Sasson told \"The Detroit Free Press\" that he has been not only previously targeted with antisemitism but by many negative reviews of his establishment, given his support for Israel. CNN did reach out to Heirloom Hospitality, the restaurant group involved here. A representative for the company declined to comment, adding it did not want to increase already heightened tensions. That's really the overarching theme here in terms what was we've seen in the U.S., given the conflict in the Middle East. Recently, just a few weeks, it was a Philadelphia restaurant that what we saw similar scenes play out. In fact, an identical chant there.
