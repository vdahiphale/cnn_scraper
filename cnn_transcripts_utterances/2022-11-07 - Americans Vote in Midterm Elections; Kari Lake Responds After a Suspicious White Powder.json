As you say, the world is nowhere close to meeting those emissions targets that will mean that we warm by on or less in 1.5 degrees centigrade, and we could go way hotter than that.And if you look just at this year, the climate catastrophes we've been dealing with, Hurricane Ian in Florida, the massive floods in Pakistan that already flooded much of that country leading to massive devastation. Scientists have now proven that these kind of disasters are worse because of climate change. Others like the heat wave in Europe wouldn't have even happened before. They're impossible without the existing climate change that we're dealing with right now. Like global leaders from around the world are descending on Sharm El-Sheikh on the Red Sea to try and hash out some kind of agreements. But as it stands now, all countries need to improve their emissions targets, including the U.S. and China, particularly to get us to a more livable future. President Biden will be here later this week, trying to rally people around the White House's plans regardless of what happens during the midterm elections. One of the big contention points though, is that developing countries, poorer countries feel that they have very little to do -- very little responsibility over climate change with historic emissions, but they're being punished by the effects of climate change. One tense bit of negotiation here, Christine, will be those countries trying to get money, funding, not just to adapt to what we see in the future, but also because people are now admitting that we haven't done enough to stop climate catastrophes like those floods, droughts and hurricanes I spoke about. And so they need funding to get over those systems, to try and get their lives back together. This really is a critical decade to solve the problem of climate change, whether they can do this in the next two weeks remains to be seen, but there will be very heated discussions I think, indeed.
