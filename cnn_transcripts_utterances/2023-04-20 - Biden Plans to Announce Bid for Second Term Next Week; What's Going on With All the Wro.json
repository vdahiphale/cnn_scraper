Sources tell CNN that Joe Biden will formally announce that he's running for a second term next week. Team Biden will reportedly put out a video on Tuesday, which happens to be the four-year anniversary of his 2020 campaign launch. His announcement will come a week after a spate of young people getting shot for innocent mistakes. Today, it's a basketball rolling into the wrong yard. They got a six-year-old and her parent shot in North Carolina. In the past week, there's been a 16-year-old shot for ringing the wrong doorbell, a 20-year-old shot and killed for pulling into the wrong driveway and two cheerleaders shot for opening the wrong car door. Is this uncontrolled anger or widespread fear? Author and Presidential Candidate Marianne Williamson is going to be on our panel to share what she thinks is at the root of this sickness. Also, I sit down with a group of dedicated Fox viewers who share their thoughts on Fox's historic $787 million payout for spreading falsehoods about Dominion Voting Systems. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And he needs to address this not only in a video but also moving forward with a lot of unknowns. And it goes to what his campaigns about, the uncertainty around the debt ceiling and what that's going to create and tying in that the fact that even though the economy is in a better place and inflation is falling, voters aren't feeling that way is numbers are in the tank when it comes to his handling of the economy, and that's going to be as big driver for his re-election.",

They certainly like where his poll numbers are, want to keep them there. But the question then is also who do they have that's going against Donald Trump.

So, I think a lot of younger voters are going to be asking themselves which of these candidates can actually navigate through some of those trickier things, some of the technology issues, not just the culture wars, but climate change is real.

And I thought it was so interesting before, L.Z. talked about it as almost a political asset, right? You're saying Biden is smart to get out now because people are coalescing around Trump. I mean, I wonder how that will play. I mean, I can give you all you want on the legal nuances of the indictment, you probably heard enough from me on that, but I'm curious how you all think that will play politically. JOHNSON:  You know, I think it helps the Biden campaign. It's going to help Democrats because, again, we know who the enemy is, and not just Trump, but the Trump MAGA Republicans. It's not just him doing the bidding. It's the DeSantises of the world, it's the McCarthys of the world, it's all these people. In addition to that, he's an indicted, crooked criminal who is running for office. And this is just one case that we've seen in New York.

It is so clearly both. Our policies are definitely on the side of wanting an assault weapon ban, of wanting stronger red flag laws, federal flag red flag laws, the bump stocks, the high-capacity magazines and so forth. But it's also true. We have to ask ourselves what is happening in our culture. Our culture has lost any sense of reverence. Our culture is not centered around humanitarian values any longer. We are centered around economic values. Short-term profit maximization for huge corporate entities has become our governing principle. This has been going on for decades. It's like left so many people in economic despair, economic anxiety, and this is what's not being addressed on the level of cause. It's not being addressed on the level of policy or of attention and focus.

Also, there's a lot of conversation, as you've already covered here tonight, about how there are people on television making a lot of money breeding fear. We have a culture where people are actually making money breeding fear. And it's not just gun manufacturers. It's journalists and journalistic corporations.We need to come back from the brink here in terms of what all of us can do as individuals. I think everybody in their own life can ask, who am I not forgiving, who am I not loving, where am I not showing up kindly. How many times when we see something like these young men, for instance, and others who have who have committed these mass shootings and you ask yourself, what happened in this person's life. What one person might have made a difference. And I'll tell you something, we have the sociological experts who have explained that to us, but our lawmakers are not listening. Too many people in America are falling through the cracks. Too many children are falling through the cracks. We have children who are traumatized before preschool now. We have elementary school students on suicide watch. We have millions of American children who whose daily life is a level of post-traumatic stress. So, until we are ready to get down and recognize the level of irreverence that is at the center of how we are organizing our society today, all of us need to get off our smug high horses and stop pointing the finger at other people and asking in our own lives and in our own attitudes, where both politically and personally we might become more harmless, more loving, more compassionate. And don't leave politics out of that either, because when you neglect a child you are adding to the Petri dish of societal dysfunction. You think we have a mental health crisis now, Alisyn? Look at what we're going to have 10 or 15 years from now, having raised a generation of children praying every morning, I won't be shot at school today.

And I can tell you, because my therapist has told me I'm not okay, like that has an effect on people. And so I believe it 1,000 percent correct that the toll of gun violence, not just on children but the parents and the family members who -- the friends who didn't get shot but survive having survivor's remorse. We're just beginning to talk about the mental weight of what gun violence is doing to us as a nation and even compound the fact that, come on, we haven't begun to flesh out what 2020 did to us in terms of the isolation from COVID. So, when I look at those two things added in with the economic stress, added in with the racism and the hate that's coming up, I can see why it feels as if the world is falling apart. But I do believe that once we get to a point in which Democrats and Republicans are saying enough is enough that we can get past this as a nation because we've been here before time and time again, and we worked our way through it.

I mean, because I think there is a vast misunderstanding of what these laws do and do not mean. Stand your ground laws do not mean you get to shoot anyone. They do not mean that even if you're in your own home and someone is on your property, you get to open fire. That is not what they mean in all circumstances. You can only use lethal force, shoot a weapon if you have a reasonable belief that somebody is about to kill or maim you or somebody else and a basketball or pulling into a driveway or pulling open a screen door does not get you there.",

In Florida, where Trayvon Martin happened, they do have standard ground laws, which enabled Robert Zimmerman to say, I don't have a duty to retreat.
