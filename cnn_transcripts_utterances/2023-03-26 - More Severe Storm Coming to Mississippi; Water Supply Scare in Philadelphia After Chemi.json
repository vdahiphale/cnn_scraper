Yes, the Philadelphia water department is saying now it is safe to drink up until tomorrow night, so Monday night. But let me explain a little bit about how we got to this point. So, this is all actually started back on Friday evening. There was word of a chemical contamination right up against the Delaware River in Bristol Township. It's in Bucks County. It's actually 20 miles north of here. But, of course, Philadelphia gets a lot of its water from the Delaware River. And then that barrel and barreled. The coast guard was out here, state environmental protection officials were out here as well. And this morning, the city Philadelphia said, hey, out of an abundance of caution, we're going to make that advisory to folks to go out buy bottled water. Don't drink it from the tap and don't cook with it either.

But I think that the city of Philadelphia is doing the right thing in giving people advanced warning, saying to use an abundance of caution, get bottled water, in the meantime, prepare for in case we do detect these contaminants in the water.

It seems that people are beginning to head off and we've seen in the last few minutes a number of police vehicles turning up as well. So, things may be winding down for the evening.But this is a Sunday evening here in Israel. This is a spontaneous protest in response to that sacking of Israel's defense minister, Yoav Gallant. He's from Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister's own Likud Party. After he came out and gave that press conference on Saturday night in which Gallant called for a halt to this judicial overhaul. When Netanyahu came back from a weekend in London, he summoned Gallant, told him he'd lost his confidence and sacked him and that is really what sparked getting these crowds out onto the streets on a Sunday. They usually out on Saturday evenings, on Thursdays. They've been coming out in the hundreds of thousands over the past three months, but they're never usually out on a Sunday. And also, in response to that sacking of Gallant, they are out on the streets to show their support for him and to reiterate their opposition to this judicial overhaul that would lead to pretty much all checks and balances on the government being overturned. The government be able to pack the supreme court with allies, the supreme court would no longer be able to strike down laws passed by the government, except in very narrow circumstances. And in addition to what's going on here and the sacking of the defense minister, the Histadrut, Israel's main labor union, has called for a general strike tomorrow. The Israel's envoy to New York has resigned in response to what's going on here as well. Universities say there will be no classes on Monday, either in response to what this government is doing. And meanwhile, tomorrow, on Monday, in the Knesset, the government will continue to try to push through elements of this judicial reform, judicial overhaul, which has got these hundreds of thousands of Israelis out onto the streets week in, week out, for the past three months. So, Netanyahu is trying to clearly quash dissent in his own ranks to ensure that no one else tries to stand up to him. But certainly, what it seems to be doing is galvanizing protesters even more and the actions against this government, not just protests, but now calls for a general strike on Monday seemed to be escalating too, Jim.",
