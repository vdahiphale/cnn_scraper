      "sentences": "A very warm welcome to the show, everyone, I'm Isa Soares. Tonight, a major decision from the U.S. Supreme Court asjustices rule Donald Trump is entitled to some presidential immunity in his January the 6th case. We'll have all the reaction, of course, to that landmark ruling. Then opponents of France's far-right are in a race against time to keep the National Rally Party out of power. More on that dramatic first round of voting. That is coming up. Plus, Hurricane Beryl makes landfall as a potentially deadly   Category 4 storm. We'll have the very latest for you from the Caribbean this hour. We begin though with a historic decision from the U.S. Supreme Court that allies of Donald Trump are calling a massive win. Justices ruled Trump is entitled to immunity from prosecution for official acts. It's an outcome that almost certainly means the case against the former president for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election will not go to trial before this November's election if at all in fact. The 6 to 3 vote was along ideological lines in a blistering dissent. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote that the ruling breaks new as well as dangerous ground. The question of what constitutes an official act is now being kicked back to the lower courts to actually decide. We are covering, of course, a number of angles on this. First, I want to go to a CNN senior crime and justice reporter Katelyn Polantz in Washington. And Katelyn, I mean, this ruling clearly shows a dispute, a divisional -- a division, I should say, along ideological divide. Just explain to our viewers what this decision actually means and what it means for the presidency here. KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME &amp; JUSTICE REPORTER: Yes, the dispute along the ideological lines with the liberal wing of the court condemning this as fearful for the democracy, for them, in their opinion, that is about the presidency, and what presidents may be able to do in the future under the constitution and not face any issue, any fallout ever if one of those things in the world outside of the presidency would be a crime. That's where the immunity is. It is around the official actions of the presidency in its core functions that a president could not be charged and prosecuted for something that would result in a crime. Some of the dissenting justices saying it, that would include things like threatening to kill the Attorney General instead of just asking the Attorney General to do some sort of bidding, that is where that split is. But for Donald Trump, that is a different issue. He remains a criminal defendant in this case, and his side that is calling this a huge win today, they are largely doing that because it is a win on timing. The ayes now go to the district court, the trial court in Washington, who over the next couple of weeks, months is going to have to work out how in this case, this decision can be applied and what Donald Trump was doing after the 2020 election, what actions there, even potentially communications with his then Vice President Mike Pence, with other people about overturning the election or the electoral vote in Congress. Where is their immunity if any there? And the Supreme Court says that in some cases may be a difficult thing for the Justice Department to show that there's immunity, but there are very many things that Donald Trump did after the election that the Supreme Court says it just wouldn't be immune.",

And what's so striking is that Justice Barrett identified a possible area of concurrence for the two sides, but the chief wasn't able to muster the troops around that holding. What's so significant, maybe the most significant difference between the majority and the dissent is that, you can no longer use evidence of the president's official wrongdoing to prosecute unofficial acts. So, that example that Justice Sotomayor gave, even if the President stood up and said I want to stop my opponent from passing this bill and then ordered him murdered, that you couldn't introduce evidence of the president standing up in order to prove the murder case. And that's just unnecessarily broad. It could have been avoided, and it really is a striking example of the very different visions of executive power by the majority and the dissent --",

The answer is not intuitively obvious, and different judges might reach different conclusions.

      "sentences": "Well, for now, we are seeing the Biden team at least try to seize on this new cycle to home in on whatis supposed to be central to their political message heading into November. And that is that, the events of January 6 show the true Donald Trump, and that it demonstrated just how reckless and dangerous he is and what a threat he is to democracy and democratic institutions. To give you a sense of that, this was a part of the statement released by a senior Biden adviser. They said, quote, \"today's ruling doesn't change the fact, so, let's be very clear about what happened on January 6th.\" They said, \"Donald Trump snapped after he lost the 2020 election and encouraged a mob to overthrow the results of a free and fair election. Trump is already running for president as a convicted felon for the very same reason he sat idly by while the mob violently attacked the capital. He thinks he's above the law\", they said, \"and is willing to do anything to gain and hold onto power for himself.\" This adviser goes on to say in the statement that Donald Trump now is actually worse, is more unhinged than the Donald Trump we saw during the four years that he was president, even pointing out the comment that he recently made about how if he were to get a second term, he would be a dictator on day one. But I think it's important to note here as we're talking about the Biden world's reaction to all of this, that the Biden White House and the campaign and advisors around him have been extraordinarily careful to not weigh in and give any sort of idea or impression that they are trying to sort of politically influence what goes on in the legal process. And so, we are not likely to see at all anybody in the Biden campaign, and Democrats really questioning sort of the judicial decision that has been made. But I will say, you know, Democrats in general would have absolutely loved a scenario where President Trump, the former president would have gotten himself mired in yet another trial. This is something that obviously now seems even more remote of a possibility, but that is a political scenario that Democrats would have been certainly happy with, particularly given what a political disaster the debate performance a couple of days ago was for President Biden. Of course, the other thing that is going on right now is all of the president's advisors are really in survival and crisis mode right now, fielding phone calls, panicked messages from everybody within the party that are asking, can he go on? Can he continue fighting? And for now, the message has been a resounding yes.",

They can be deadly, they can bring a lot of problems with them, but they're not catastrophic storms. A hurricane like this one Category 4 storm now is an entirely different kind of storm, sort of haven't really explode in a space of 24 hours from a tropical storm to a Category 4 storm, something that very few people in the Windward Islands have had to deal with in some time. And so, early on in the season, only July 1st is the beginning of hurricane season, not -- this is kind of -- kind of a hurricane you would see in August or September when the waters of the Caribbean are usually are as warm as they are now. And that's what's really changes the waters -- are so much warmer, they are the fuel for hurricanes. And so, you normally have a storm that has developed as quickly as this one, but it is just so powerful, and after it leaves Windward Islands, it is expected to have impacts both in Haiti and Jamaica until it finally, according to forecasters' predictions right now, hits Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. So, the storm has already caused a lot of damage and will cause even more damage, and of course, here, unfortunate reality is, it is still very early in the season, a season that forecasters say will be one of the busiest on record.",

And we should all be concerned for democracy, irrespective of if we are Democrats or we are Republicans. Why is that? Because there is so much power that is now concentrated at the top of the ticket in the executive office, in the White House. And so, I think Justice Sotomayor's dissent is actually spot on, because what it does is that this decision says that as long as there is justification for this to be considered -- for things to be considered presidential acts or under the purview of the president, then therefore the president is immune from being prosecuted for those things. There is no kind of establishment of what might actually constitute a presidential act.

If the occupant of the office misuses official power for personal gain, the criminal law that the rest of us must abide will not provide a backstop. With fear for our democracy, I dissent.

Yes, that is important. However, what this means is that the actions that we saw -- we've seen in past presidents, to think Richard Nixon and Watergate, if Richard Nixon was under indictment right now for doing something that he said absolutely was within his official capacity as president to do, for example, paying people to break into the Democratic National Convention offices, what the Supreme Court is telling us is that that would no longer be subject to criminal prosecution. It opens an entire kind of bag of worms for how we think about the actions of presidents. Does this mean that presidents can assassinate their political opponents? Does it mean that presidents can stage coups? Can they stage insurrections because they are doing it in the best interest as their capacity as president to ensure or hold on to power? We don't know. It puts an enormous amount of pressure on the lower courts, on judges, on things like that, people within the legal system, to decide whether or not something is in the official capacity of the executive office, the executive branch, or the president.

The problem is it's going to be very difficult to erase that picture of a president who looked bewildered, lost, incoherent in front of 50 million viewers during that debate. I think Representative Raskin is talking about there are serious conversations going on among members of the House, because that's the part of government that it appears that Democrats have the best chance at this point of hanging on to on November. Whether that ever crystallizes into a critical mass, whether there's ever a spokesman that can direct that and make it a real serious threat to Biden, I think it's far too early to say at this point.",

The firstone, of course, would be Vice President Kamala Harris. Her problem is that she's not been widely seen as a successful vice president. She had her own campaign back before she was named as vice president. That didn't work out very well. So, she's seen as vulnerable. There are a lot of other Democrats for the future, key swing state governors, Josh Shapiro in Pennsylvania, Gretchen Whitmer in Michigan. People talk about Gavin Newsom, the governor of California. But at this point, it's all speculation. The chances of there being an open convention in which the party would choose a new nominee in August, at this point, seems a bit of a pipe dream.
