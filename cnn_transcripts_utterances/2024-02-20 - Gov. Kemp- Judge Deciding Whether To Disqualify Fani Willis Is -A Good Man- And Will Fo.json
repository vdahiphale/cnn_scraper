I'm glad the RNC or whoever the powers that were be that were trying to inaugurate, I guess, President Trump, to be the nominee, didn't do that. I think it's best to let the process play out the way it's designed. Certainly, it's up to Nikki Haley's, her campaign and herself to decide whether she wants to keep running or not. And she is.

They assured us that the person, who was reporting that, from a third-party, was a reliable, confidential human source. Why were they so certain, back then, that they would tell Chairman Comer, I mean, that this guy was a reliable source? He clearly wasn't a reliable source, or he had not been thoroughly vetted. So, I'd like to know that. But the critical thing now, to understand is that it's a complete House of Cards, built on a lie, and a conspiracy theory. And it's all gone. The House of Cards has collapsed now. And Chairman Comer should simply terminate the investigation, and say, there's nothing there. That would be the intellectually honest approach, at this moment.",
