The air war being focused by Russia on trying to break the capacity of Ukraine to sustain its civilian population through the winter, and then the ground war, the continuing grinding activities, which so far at the moment over the last few months, the Russians have been effective on the back foot but that does not mean that that is not a bloody and bitter exchange. The Ukrainians meanwhile, asking -- getting to the point of demanding more international aid to give them the capacity to defend themselves in the skies against those cruise missiles that are so damaging as winter approaches, Erica.",

So, picking up where Sam left off there, there's been a lot of talks than just the last couple of days about these air defense systems that Germany had offered Poland. Poland is saying, hey, we think Ukraine should have them. NATO Secretary General was asked about that this morning, Poland or Ukraine, here's his answer. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Look, I think the recent, you know, sort of alarm over what turned out to be apparently an errant Ukrainian air defense missile hitting and killing a couple of Polish civilians is a reminder that as long as the war is so close to NATO's borders, the risk factor has gone way up. I do think that increases the appetite even in countries that are members of NATO but are more wary of doing anything that might be perceived as escalation on the part of Russia. I do think that you know you're going to see more air defense aid both to Ukraine, and beefing up of those NATO allies like Poland, in particular.",

That has increased the pushback inside Russian society with hundreds of thousands of people leaving, but those remaining in their families are extremely alarmed that the prospect of their children being used as cannon fodder.I remember when we lived there during the Second Chechen War it was the mothers -- the mothers of the soldiers who provided the real emotional power and what existed of resistance inside Russia to that conflict. I think you're going to see the same dynamic playing out here. There's a level of casualties that the Russian government simply can't hide from its own people. So, I think it's an unusual step by Putin that reflects the enormous concerns that are growing inside Russia today when Children are being used as cannon fodder. [11:35:02]",

We found out that this guy is a 28-year-old man and he was located -- he went overboard at 11She tells authorities that he said he was going to the bathroom but he never came back. She reports a missing noon the next day. There's a search and rescue that gets underway at about 2:30. And according to details just released here by the U.S. Coast Guard, he was found at 8:25 the next day. So, by my math, that's almost about 20 hours in the Gulf of Mexico. The U.S. Coast Guard said that he was a passenger on the Carnival cruise ship, the Carnival Valor. They were set for a five-day cruise to Cozumel, leaving the Porta in New Orleans and making their way to Mexico when this incident happened. He was spotted actually by a crew of a vessel that was alerted by the Coast Guard that an individual was missing in the Gulf of Mexico. Just listen to the Coast Guard Lieutenant that we had on earlier this morning on \"CNN THIS MORNING\" describe this holiday miracle. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. SETH GROSS, SEARCH &amp; RESCUE COORDINATOR, U.S. COAST GUARD: I'll be honest with you. You know, a 17-year career, this case is unlike anything I've been a part of.

His family went on the cruise to Cozumel. They kept going. They left him behind in New Orleans to recover. So, we're reading between the lines there. His family didn't stay with him to recover.

Here in Beijing right now, we're basically in a de facto lockdown. And increasingly, it is the restrictions themselves, not COVID itself that are being blamed for the heartbreaking deaths that are fueling nationwide outrage.Adding to that anger is a fire that broke out in the capital of China's far-west Xinjiang region on Thursday night. 10 people were killed and nine injured in a fire at an apartment building. Widely circulated videos, which have now been censored in China show that COVID lockdown measures very likely delayed firefighters from getting to the scene. Now, most parts of Xinjiang had been under lockdown for more than 100 days. State media is now claiming that people in the compound were not blocked from leaving, but the video you see shows fire trucks unable to get close to the scene because the compound entrance is partially blocked with metal barriers that are normally used as part of COVID measures, Erica.",

There are always surprises.But I think what's marked this one is different, Erica, is there are so many other subplots and narratives. We've got the human rights issue, we've got the situation that the Iranian team are having to deal with, and that's put so much pressure on those players. And I think that was -- what was so impressive about their win over Wales today. I would say that Iran beating Wales wasn't that big a surprise. Iran usually plays in the World Cup, Wales haven't even been in this tournament since 1958. And they certainly deserved their win the way they went about it in the second half. They really, really threw everything at Wales. And although their games get (AUDIO GAP) were very well deserved. And you kind of put all that against the backdrop of what these players have been dealing with, the fact that they didn't sing the anthem in their opening game against England, which was perceived as showing solidarity with the supporters today. Some of them sang the anthem, but they seem to be kind of not really fully invested in belting out the words. There's so much going on with these players. And for them to put in a performance like that was absolutely extraordinary. It really, really was incredible. And of course, we've got this huge game coming up here tonight, USA- England in just a couple of hours' time, very, very excited about that. This is arguably the game of the group stage, of course, the USA, really hoping to get a win over England. And if they can do what they did back in 1950, a huge upset against the English team, they will be absolutely thrilled. Let's see what happens in a bit.",
