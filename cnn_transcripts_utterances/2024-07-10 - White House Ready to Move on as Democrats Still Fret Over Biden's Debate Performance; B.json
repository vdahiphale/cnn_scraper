And rather than worry about the president's political future, a senior administration official told CNN, I'm moving on to my day job. Now the question seems to be, are Democrats on Capitol Hill ready to get on with their day jobs, get along and get in line, or something else? And what about voters, especially now that Biden's rival is back on the campaign trail with commentary like this?

One is that despite what he is saying about Kamala Harris not being as strong of an opponent, Donald Trump and his team are very concerned about what it would look like if Joe Biden is not the person at the top of the Democratic ticket. Part of that is because they have spent millions of dollars on modeling and gathering data focused solely on going after Joe Biden. So, they really don't know what having someone like Kamala Harris at the top of the Democratic ticket would look like.And so his team is very much delighting in Joe Biden saying repeatedly that he is staying in the race and digging in on remaining as president.",

So, incredibly frustrating times, especially as the heat continue to rise again in that region intensely here in these summer months.

The case was brought and then dropped and then brought back and prosecutors go first with opening statements. How do you think they're going to frame this case to the jury? JULIE GRANT, ANCHOR, COURT T.V.:  Sara, good morning, great to be with you. I think prosecutors going to frame it that Alec Baldwin was reckless and negligent when he pointed a firearm, and a real firearm, at the film cinematographer, Halyna Hutchins. That's where their Take things back to what a reasonable person would have done. Would a reasonable person not have checked that gun themselves before pointing it at another human being? You don't have to be a firearms expert to know that the biggest rule in firearm safety is you never point at anything you don't intend to shoot.
