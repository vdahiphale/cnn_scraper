      "sentences": "Well, Brianna and Boris, they have taken issue, obviously, with the coverage and the contextualization about those remarks. They say that this is something that many people have said in the past, essentially saying that Donald Trump was calling her a chicken hawk, that she would want to go to war but never be in war herself. But really, the most notable thing is not what the campaign is saying, but the fact that the former president has now responded on Truth Social. This is what he just posted recently. He said, \"All I'm saying about Liz Cheney is that she is a war hawk and a dumb one at that, but she wouldn't have 'the guts' to fight herself. It's easy for her to talk sitting far from the death scenes taking place, but put a gun in her hand and let her go fight and she'll say, 'No, thanks.' Her father decimated the Middle East and other places and got rich by doing so. He caused plenty of death and probably never even gave it a thought. That's not what we want running our Country.\"To be clear, Donald Trump rarely clarifies his own remarks. His campaign spends a lot of time trying to clean up Donald Trump's remarks. Donald Trump himself just goes about saying what he wants to say. It is very telling that he himself put out a statement clarifying his own remarks here. That means that they believe that there could be some sort of damage done by these remarks or there's a fear hanging over them that these kind of violent rhetoric could cause problems for former President Trump ahead of people actually casting their ballots on November 5th. I think that is the most telling part of all of this. Now, the problem for the Donald Trump campaign and for Donald Trump himself is that despite what he meant or wants to clarify with these remarks, Donald Trump has had a history of using some violent rhetoric or calling Democrats the enemy within, for example, not really building goodwill when it comes to these kind of comments. So whether or not it actually impacts him at the ballot box remains to be seen. But it is clear that they're taking these comments much more seriously than some of the other loose comments that we've heard from the former president or violent rhetoric we've heard from the former president at times before, because he himself is now taking to this to try and clarify what he was saying.",

This is what a senior campaign official told reporters. They said, \"This should be no surprise because he lies all the time and he wants to sow doubt about a loss that he anticipates is coming.\"I read this, Boris and Brianna, as the Harris campaign trying to really project calm and confidence about the possibility and the various ways in which Democrats are expecting Donald Trump, the candidate and Donald Trump's campaign and his allies to create chaos and confusion in a lot of different potential ways next week. You know, we've seen the Harris campaign really go to great lengths to highlight all of the ways in which throughout the course of the campaign, they have been preparing for all different kinds of scenarios, setting up a legal team, making sure that they were looking at all of the ways in which there were various issues going back to the 2020 campaign, whether it is misinformation and disinformation, various lawsuits that could come their way in a lot of different states across the country, all different kinds of threats and rhetoric that could come from the candidate and his allies. So I do think this is something they are trying to stress in these final days. They are basically telling anyone who will listen, we could see confusion, we could see chaos coming next week. But basically, they are trying to stress that the Harris campaign, which, of course, was formally the Biden campaign, has been preparing for this for a while now.",

So, of course, tremendous anxiety there.On the Democratic side, there's anxiety because they see what's happened with these voting precincts, areas out in the counties where there have been officials put in place. The fact that they may, in fact, finally produce the voter fraud that they've been unable to find, and they would do it in favor of Trump. So there's a lot of anxiety about all of this. And yes, this question of what Trump wants. You hear him talk about Cheney. You've heard him talk about so many people that he refers to as enemies from within. Those who have covered him closest over the years have said one of the biggest motivators in Donald Trump's life is vengeance. When he thinks he's been done wrong, he wants to get even. And it doesn't matter if he wasn't done wrong in the first place. So, yes, tremendous amount of anxiety. I've never seen anything like it in any election I've ever covered.",

And the result is going to be, again, the key problem here is when you take a bunch of people and convince them of something that is untrue and Donald Trump did not win last time, period. That's the way it is. They get very, very unhappy with this notion that the system is broken. It's not working. They can't move ahead. They can't get what they want.Here's the way I kind of sum it up in my head here, Donald Trump feels that he won the last election. He knows he was humiliated. And humiliation is a very powerful force for his followers, too, since they want to come back. Honestly, the backwash of this election is going to depend not on the victors being victorious, no matter which side wins. It's going to be how the victors treat the people who lost, how much they recognize their fears, their concerns, their worries, and treat them seriously, because those things don't just go away by being beaten. People have to have a way to move forward. So whichever side wins, if they want this country to be together and work together, they're going to have to pay attention to the other side and listen to the other side, even if they disagree with them. If they don't, I don't see how we don't wind up just going through another episode of this, which has everyone anxious and everyone worn out.",
