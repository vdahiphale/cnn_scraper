Monday saw another day of nationwide protests erupt from Jerusalem to Tel Aviv to Caesarea in the north. Precise numbers are difficult to confirm, but organizers claim hundreds of thousands took part, all demanding a cease fire, with Hamas and many accusing the prime minister of stalling tactics and demanding his resignation.Labor unions also staged an hours long general strike, causing chaos for air travel. Hospitals reduced services and staff and many businesses closed down. Protesters also gathered outside one of Netanyahu private homes, lighting fires and chanting, you are the leader. You are guilty. Publicly, Netanyahu appears to be unmoved, insisting he will not make any concessions and promising Hamas will pay for the murder of six hostages who were found dead over the weekend, murdered by Hamas to prevent their rescue by the Israeli military. Many believe a ceasefire deal could have saved their lives. Hamas is warning further rescue attempts by the Israeli military will lead to more hostages being killed. And there is criticism too from Israel's most important ally. When the U.S. President was asked if Prime Minister Netanyahu is doing enough to secure the release of the hostages, the answer was a blunt, firm no. On Monday, the President and Vice President met with U.S. officials who have been part of ceasefire negotiations and later, President Biden said a final deal is close. The latest sticking point appears to be Israel's demand to retain control of a narrow strip of land which divides Egypt and Gaza, as CNN's Jeremy Diamond reports Prime Minister Netanyahu argues withdrawing Israeli forces will allow Hamas to rearm and once again threaten Israel. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Outrage in the streets of Tel Aviv for the second night in a row, tens of thousands raising their voices demanding Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu strike a deal to bring home the hostages alive. This outpouring of grief, anger and frustration prompted by the deaths of six Israeli hostages whose bodies were recovered over the weekend. Hamas executed them hours before Israeli troops discovered the tunnel where they were being held. But to many here, their deaths are a grisly reminder of the Israeli government's failure.",

There are members of the Egyptian security forces who are complicit in the smuggling under the Gaza Egypt border, and that's why it's been so difficult for the Israelis to get a handle on this. And that's why they are now saying, or at least Prime Minister Netanyahu, is now saying, that the IDF needs a presence on the Philadelphi Corridor.Of course, this is in violation of an agreement, a diplomatic agreement, that agreement, that they need with Egypt in 2005 when they initially withdrew from the Gaza Strip. But nevertheless, this is a significant security concern for the Israelis, and if they do want to make sure that Hamas cannot resupply itself, there is this question of who controls the Philadelphi Corridor and how to plug up those tunnels that are being dug underneath with in some cases, the complicity of Egyptian security services.",

Well, even more so now without his plane. On the surface, at least, these elections seem to be playing out as the previous elections. Maduro claims victory at a rigged vote.

And since then, their presence has grown incrementally all the way up to this weekend where they won one of the 16 state elections. That's a significant development. The problem is with Scholz's words right now is that the party outperformed everyone else coming ahead with 33 percent of the vote.
