It's an argument central to two Biden priorities right now, a short-term debate over whether to cut federal spending in exchange for votes to raise the nation's borrowing limit and a longer- term framing of the Biden reelection message.Our great reporters are back with us. And the short-term challenge, Republicans say it's just simply not true. The President makes the case that they want to cut spending as part of raising the debt limit. But what would they cut? And he says they threatened and he points to historical proposals from Republicans to cut Social Security and Medicare. Republicans say that's not true today. The President's argument is what? Don't trust them?",

And I think it's interesting how, you know, in today, he's actually focusing on Affordable Care Act and Medicaid, not just Social Security and Medicare, because they think that's also politically valuable as well.",

The conditions there have worsened as the ground has thawed, there's flooding in some areas, impossible roads and others.But there's Ukrainian soldiers that saying, look, we're holding firm despite Russian claims. They say Russian forces, even though they've been sending their most battle hardened regular, but also Wagner mercenaries to try and break through Ukrainian defenses. The Ukrainian soldiers saying they simply have not encircled us yet, and that there are still two roads through which they continue to get their much needed supplies, even though they're coming under enemy fire. But really a very grim picture being painted about what those Ukrainian forces are facing as they try and hold firm. Now for several days now, we've been hearing growingly desperate pleas for more allied equipment and help in the shape of F-16s. Now, of course, Washington's ruled those out. But we do know that there is other weaponry coming online fairly quickly. We've just been hearing from an American official speaking to the Armed Services Committee saying that it is some 4,000 Ukrainian soldiers that have not been trained not just in the United States, but in Europe, across Europe, on the Patriot systems, for instance, on the Leopard tanks. And, of course, those are expected to make a big difference. The question is just how quickly when they will be usable here in Ukraine. And what happens in the meantime, specifically for the soldiers, who are very bravely trying to hold out against increasing -- did increasingly determined numerous Russian troops. John?",

He's served as Commanding General, for U.S. Army, Europe and the Seventh Army. General, grateful for your time, especially on this day. You just heard Melissa explain what we're hearing from soldiers on the ground. President Zelenskyy himself calls it challenging. If I could ask the controller to put the map back up, when you look at Bakhmut, and where it is in southeastern Ukraine. If you're in the room trying to debate military strategy here, is it smart maybe to give it up and then come back and fight another day or is holding it of some strategic whether its strategic on the battlefield or strategic in terms of public opinion, public morale, to keep it? LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes, John, all of the above. What we're talking about is an inconsequential city. Before the war, it was a population of about 70,000. It's a small area, small city on the intersection of a couple of roads and near some railroads for resupply. It is not strategically important, but it has become strategically imperative to hold by the Ukrainians and certainly by the Russians trying to take it. I would equate this somewhat like Bastogne during World War II, the Battle of the Bulge. The city itself was not critical. But holding on to it, the Ukrainian saying we are not going to give this up, we're going to suck a whole lot more Russians into this malaise and cause more problems is important to them, certainly. And the Russians need a victory that they have not been able to achieve. John, how long have we been talking about the city of Bakhmut? It's been months now.

We're outside a polling site on the northern side of Chicago right now and this is going to be a fight. I mean, the environment now is different than when it was in 2019. Of course, the last time we had a mayoral election here.We're on the other side of what Mayor Lori Lightfoot is described as once in a lifetime set of challenges among them a spike in crime like we saw here and in places across the country. And look, at this point, enthusiasm is high. We've already seen coming into election day, more than 240,000 early votes cast, which is incredible when you compare that to 2019, where we saw around 165,000. And it's a crowded field. We've got nine candidates in total. Four of them are seen as top contenders. As you mentioned before coming to me, Paul Vallas, a former head of schools in Chicago and Philadelphia and New Orleans. He's pulling or he's among the top contenders seen as that. He's been endorsed by the Chicago police union, the Fraternal Order of Police that hosted Ron DeSantis last week. And some critics, including Lightfoot have jumped on that saying that even in association with a group that's hosting DeSantis shows he's not a Democrat, he says he is. But we've also got Brandon Johnson, a Cook County Commissioner endorsed by the Teachers Union Jesus Chuy Garcia, who ran in 2015, got to the runoff against Rahm Emanuel before losing and is now a U.S. congressman. And now moving forward because of the number of candidates, no person is expected to get the 50 percent threshold needed to become mayor tonight, essentially. And so, what that means is the top two candidates will go to a runoff. But critically, I talked about those mailing ballots, we still got 100,000 ballots mail-in who were requested, but haven't been returned. And because we're now at election day, those ballots can't be counted until after Election Day. And 100,000, that's a lot of vote considering it was just over 550,000 votes that came in in 2019. And with margins, this thin between candidates could make a difference in the coming days, potentially weeks after today. And all of it, of course, happens as mayor Lori Lightfoot is fighting for her political life and at risk of being the first mayor in 30 years here in Chicago not to win reelection though 20 of those years were one person.",
