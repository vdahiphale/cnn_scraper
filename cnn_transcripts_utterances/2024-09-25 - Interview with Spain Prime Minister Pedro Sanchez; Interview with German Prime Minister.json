Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour at the United Nations in New York, where world leaders continue to gather and call for peace after a new round of escalation between Israel and Hezbollah. Israel says it's intercepted this missile as it approached Tel Aviv. This is Hezbollah's deepest strike ever into Israel. The Iranian-backed group says it was targeting the intelligence agency, Mossad. Now, Israel is calling up reserve brigades in the surest sign yet of a potential impending ground invasion. And with more than 90,000 people displaced in Lebanon, there are growing fears the conflict could escalate. Could widen into a regional war. Iran's current vice president for strategic affairs is Javad Zarif. And some might remember him as the former foreign minister who negotiated the nuclear deal with the west.

And they thought that by -- either by increasing the violence, atrocities, war crimes, whatever, crimes against humanity, they could restore that aura of invincibility of Israel. And by dragging others into the conflict, they could expand the war, probably bring the United States in and change the dynamics of the situation. Everybody in the region understood that and has tried, while supporting the people in Gaza, who've been under, basically, the most inhumane system of warfare mankind has ever seen to avoid falling into the trap of the Israelis. And Hezbollah has done a great deal of self-restraint over the past 11 months.

Yes, if the glass ishalf full or half empty, I mean, the world in the last 12 months has not become a safer place, the Middle East, but also in Ukraine. And as we have heard the president, President Zelenskyy, Russia is leading its brutal war of aggression in a dimension of now destroying by purpose and reason children hospital, but also energy power plants. And two-thirds of the energy power plants have been destroyed, meaning, before winter time, that people would freeze to death, and this is just a horror, and this is why we are so strongly calling here, on Putin, to stop this terror, to stop this war of aggression.",

That the IAEA tried, with the support of Germany and France, to say heavy weapons away from Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.

I mean, Russia is the neighboring state, which shows again that obviously the Russian president doesn't know any limits and any borders anymore.

If Ukraine would not continue to defend itself, if we would not support -- not to continue to support Ukraine's defense, I mean, then these nuclear power plants, these energy grids would be totally lost.

It's not an easy conversation to have. Here's what I can tell you. For the last 20 years of my life Arab Americans and Muslim Americans have made secondary the issues of foreign affairs. I can't tell you that between Bush, Obama, Trump, or Biden that we have had alignment or agreement on their global policies. That's not been the case.

Johnson or FDR. But a genocide outweighs all of this. The conflict we're speaking to is unprecedented. You're talking about 2.2 million people where 100 percent are displaced, where whether you're looking to the ministry -- the health ministry numbers or the Lancet medical -- the Lancet journal publication, the deaths are somewhere between 40,000 and 180,000, the majority of which are women and children, and 90 percent of civilian infrastructure has been decimated.

I know he's asserted this to constituents of yours in various ways, but his method of doing so I find would not -- I would venture to say, would not be pleasing to most of your constituents.
