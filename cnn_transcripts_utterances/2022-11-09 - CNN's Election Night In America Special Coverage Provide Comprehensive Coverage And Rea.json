We are following all the midterm dramas, standing by to make more projections. Here's what the fight for the Senate looks like right now: Democrats have 48 Senate seats, Republicans have 49. They need two more seats to reach the 51 required to retake Senate control. Georgia, Arizona, and Nevada are the three states with undecided Senate races. They will determine which party controls the chamber. It could all come down to a December runoff in Georgia depending on what happens in Arizona and Nevada. Now, to the House, these are the most up-to-date numbers: Democrats have won 189 seats. Republicans now have 209, just a nine short of the 218 needed to win control of the House. Thirty-seven races remain up in the air this hour. We are on the ground in all the key battleground states. Let's begin with CNN national correspondent Gary Tuchman in North Las Vegas, Nevada for us. Gary, what is the latest?",

Here in Nevada's most populous county of Clark County where almost three quarters of Nevadans live, there is still a lot of tabulating going on at the Clark County Elections Department.Between today and tomorrow, it is expected that people who work here will be counting an additional 83,000 ballots. Today, they counted 13,000 more ballots. And these are not the ballots of people who voted yesterday in person. Those ballots are all counted. What these are our mail-in ballots. You may say to yourself, why are they counting tens of thousands of ballots like this, it sounds weird, it sounds suspicious. It is not at all suspicious. It is not an all weird. They seem to have been doing a great job. This is to be expected because this state prioritizes mail-in ballots. Every single person who register to vote here in the state of Nevada received a mail-in ballot. So, they have received lots of them over the last two weeks. In addition to that, as long as it was postmarked by yesterday, the mail-in ballot can be received by this Saturday. So, we don't know on Thursday, Friday or Saturday how many more ballots are coming. It could be a huge number also. So, there is a lot still to count. So, when the day started, the race between Senator Catherine Cortez Masto and Adam Laxalt, the Republican challenger, he was up by about 22,000 votes. After the count of initial 13,000 ballots today, she has gained about 5,000 votes. So, she is tight in this race. So, if anyone is going to tell you, we know who is going to win this, one thing you can tell them is, there is no way you know because we don't know how many more ballots will still be coming.

Catherine Cortez Masto who is currently behind in the vote count, the incumbent Democrat, would need in the range of 52% to 55% of that outstanding vote to overtake Laxalt and win this election. For his part, Adam Laxalt, who is ahead, obviously, he only needs 42% to 45% of those 160,000, roughly an estimate, outstanding votes in Nevada. So, when you watch the next batch of votes come in, we will be able to see if these candidates are sort of meeting these targets of what they would need to win the race.",

      "sentences": "Anderson, 24 hours after the polls close on the West Coast, we still have, as we did two years ago, uncertainty about two very important states in American politics, including Arizona and Nevada.So, you just heard from Gary and from Kyung, let's start in Arizona where Kyung is. As she noted, the last time votes were reported, Mark Kelly's lead increased. The key is to watch the next batch of votes and the one after that, if you remember the dynamics. In 2020, it was Joe Biden's lead that kept shrinking. He won the state in the end, but his lead was shrinking as the ballots come in. So, the key is, what happens as we go forward, and David laid out the percentages in Nevada, we have the percentages for Arizona as well, so we have to watch this play out. A vital state. Obviously, a vital race. The Democratic incumbent facing a challenger from a Trump-endorsed Republican there. Critical to the 50-50 balance we currently have in the Senate. Where will it end up? Then quickly, in Nevada, this is where Gary is, he is in Clark County, it is 75% -- 74% of the state vote. The question is, you know, can Cortez Masto improve that percentage as more and more votes come in? That's what she needs to overcome. One other key question there is, can she turn Washoe? Washoe County where Reno is and the rural areas to the north, that's a swing county. Usually, the color of this county in the and can determine who wins the state. Laxalt is slightly there right now. Again, more votes to be counted. I just want to come to this other map just very quickly to get to the question here, which is, why these races matter? Well, of course, they matter to the citizens of Arizona and Nevada. They also matter to the dynamics here in Washington, who controls the United States Senate. This is a runoff, in Georgia, we know that now, on December 6th. The question is, if Senator Kelly can keep his lead here and Senator Laxalt can keep that lead here -- neither of these are guaranteed, by the way. As you heard both correspondence, tens of thousands of votes still to be counted. But they're still consequential because if that happened, if those two races stay the same, well then guess what? Republicans have 50 and Democrats have 49, and once again, the Georgia runoff would determine the control of the United States Senate. If Democrats could get back to 50 where they are now, the vice president breaks the tie, Republicans can get to 51. So, any change in those races affects whether or not this Georgia runoff in December is decisive, Anderson, and we are going to have to wait, listening to Kyung and Gary, for a while to get to that. But just quickly, I just want to come over, you mentioned the House totals at the top of the race. I just want to show you the map as it fills in. It looks like a lot of red. But Republicans are not at the finish line. Republicans thought by now -- they thought by this time last night -- we would be saying there will be a republican majority in the House of Representatives. Here we, Wednesday night, 11:07 p.m. in the east, Republicans are called -- we have called 209. So, they are now nine House seats short of 218, the magic number for a majority. Democrats, 20 seats behind them right now at 189. Let's look where they are ahead. This is really interesting. Republicans are ahead right now in enough seats -- enough seats, if nothing change, to get a majority. But look how narrow a majority it would be if it stopped right now. It is not going to stop right now. Some of these races will take days. Some could take longer than that to count. But you just get the expectation from looking at those numbers where they stand right now. But yes, the probability is Republicans get to majority. It's also likely that that's going to be a very narrow majority. One last point, Anderson, before I come back. Not enough attention in my view has been paid to this. Democratic governor gets a new Democratic governor in Pennsylvania. Democratic governor reelected in Michigan. Democratic governor reelected in Wisconsin. Democratic governor reelected in Minnesota. We talk a lot about the battleground states out here. They matter. Who will win the governorship in Nevada? Who will win the governorship in Arizona? These states right here, long time ago used to call them the blue wall. They are incredibly important and now a little messy. Let me do it one more time. You come up here, right in there. Yes, the governor of Ohio was reelected but the Democrats held Pennsylvania, held Michigan, and held Wisconsin, these governor's races, and I think underappreciated story for the Democratic Party in these midterm results.",

      "sentences": "That's right, Jake. I mean, they ended the night on Tuesday and really into Wednesday morning in the exact opposite place of where they wanted to be. This is what they have been trying to avoid, a scenario in which Trump's candidates fizzled and flopped, and his rival, Ron DeSantis, soared to the top, and that's exactly where we ended up on Wednesday morning.You saw this momentous win by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who is widely seen as former President Trump's most formidable opponent should they both enter the race in 2024. Now we know that advisers are trying to gear up for what they would view, as you said, is the inevitable, a Trump-DeSantis showdown in 2024, trying to figure out what exactly that looks like and how exactly they go after the Florida governor. Right now, that appears incredibly daunting not just because of this huge win that he had in Florida but also because of the momentum that he has picked up from Republicans and from donors. We reported earlier today that Rupert Murdoch, the owner of many conservative outlets, seems more than thrilled to throw Trump to the side and embrace Ron DeSantis as the head of the Republican Party. Because of that, we already started to see Trump attacked DeSantis. In an interview on Monday night, he said this. He said, I don't know if he's running. I think if he runs, he could hurt himself very badly. I think he will be making a mistake. I think the base would not like it. I don't think it would be good for the party. I would tell you things about him that would be very unflattering. A clear threat here. I will note that for months, behind closed doors, Trump has told advisers that he's upset with DeSantis. He feels that DeSantis was ungrateful to him for Trump's endorsement back in 2018, which Trump believes is the reason he became the Florida governor in the first place. So, all of this really coming down to the wire. One thing to point out, though, Jake, right now, this showdown, this battle is really one-sided. DeSantis just won his governor's race but it is Trump who is taking him on. And of course, even though last night was lackluster results for Trump, even though advisers have spent most of the day trying to convince him to delay any sort of announcement for a third presidential bid, it seems, as of now, that Trump is set on announcing next Tuesday for his third presidential bid. So, again, this is just the beginning. One adviser telling me that these insults that we heard Trump saying in this interview are just the tip of the iceberg, that they expected to get much, much nastier. Jake?",
