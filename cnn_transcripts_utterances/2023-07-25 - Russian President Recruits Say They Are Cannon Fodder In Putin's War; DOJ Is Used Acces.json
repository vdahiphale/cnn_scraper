These so-called Stormzy battalions surrendering, hear of death rates hard to fathom. Here are two rare stories, one of incredible survival, and another of a young and quick death, told to CNN at great risk from inside Russia.Ex-con Sergei barely made it back. Now he works two jobs and can't sleep because his ears still ring from Shell Shock. We first talked when he'd been shot for the second time, but he was still sent back injured. From 600 prisoners recruited with him in October, he says, only 170 are alive. And only two of them without injury. Sent again and again in waves to attack Ukrainian positions. RUSSIAN CONVICT (through translator): I remember most clearly the last of the nine concussions I had. We attacked. RPGs, drones flew at us. Our commander yells on the radio, I don't care. Go ahead. Don't come back until you take this position. Two of us found a small hole and dived in there. A drone threw a grenade at us and it landed in the 30 centimeter gap between us. My friend was covered with shrapnel all over. Yet I was untouched somehow, but I lost my sight for five hours.",

It's horrible to say but I already thought of him like he was dead. He left knowing everything. Every day I told him no, no, no. And he didn't listen to me. When he said we're going to storm.

You heard there of commanders shooting the ill-disciplined, the lack of basic things like water, a four-kilometer walk to get water. Eventually, that is going to be reflected in how Russia responds to the months ahead, most likely the most intense part of Ukraine's counter offensive.It is really chilling to hear what Russia seems to do to its own, and particularly to hear from mothers who just see their son one day on a chat group and then into silence the next.
