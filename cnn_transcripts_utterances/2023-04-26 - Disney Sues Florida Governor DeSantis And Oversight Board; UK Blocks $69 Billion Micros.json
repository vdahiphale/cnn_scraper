In fact, all eyes on the big tech companies, they're out with earnings. We'll be delving into some of those numbers throughout the show. Well, those are the markets and these are the main events. Disney sues Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. Microsoft and Activision plan to appeal after UK regulators block their deal. And spring could spell the end of crypto winter. I'll be speaking to an analyst who sees Bitcoin going back to $100,000.00. Live from Dubai, it is Wednesday, April 26th. I'm Eleni Giokos in for Richard Quest, and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. All right, a very good evening. Tonight, Disney is striking back against the governor of Florida accusing him in a lawsuit of retaliating against the company for its opposition to his Don't Say Gay Bill. It is the latest twist in a battle between the House of Mouse and Republican Ron DeSantis, a possible presidential candidate. The feud is raising questions about Florida's business friendly reputation, all right, and it is weighing on Disney's stock. It is down at this moment, let's take a look at those numbers. All right, the company's lawsuit claims that Florida's actions are jeopardizing its economic future there. We have Steve Contorno, who is in Florida for us. Great to have you on the show. Look, this is a drawn out feud. It seems to now be escalating. Take us through the latest.",

Disney spoke out against it; DeSantis didn't like it, and so DeSantis went after Disney's special taxing district and they have been in this tit-for-tat, back and forth over the future of this district for months now. Well, today DeSantis is appointees on that district voted to nullify past agreements between the board and Disney. Disney shot back with this lawsuit that claims that DeSantis, \"engaged in a targeted campaign of government retaliation, orchestrated every step by his administration.\" And they are saying this is punishment, that this is a violation of their contracts -- national contracting laws, as well as their First Amendment rights. Now, the DeSantis administration, though, has fired back and they said they are not backing down. They have released their own statement that says, \"We are unaware of any legal rights that a company has to operate its own government or maintain special privileges not held by other businesses in the state.\" So this is all now headed to the courts where we expect this fight to continue for the foreseeable future.",

Well, Microsoft and Activision are firing back at UK regulators for blocking their $69 billion merger. Activision, the developer of games like \"Call of Duty\" says the UK is clearly closed for business. Its CEO vowed to fight on saying today's decision is far from the final word. The UK's competition authority said the merger would stifle innovation and choice. It said Microsoft already holds up to 70 percent of the cloud- gaming markets, and that merger would strengthen the company's position. All right, Activision's shares fell sharply on the back of this news. They are more than 10 percent lower and well off Microsoft's offer of $95.00 a share, and you can see those playing on your screen right now. Microsoft's stock is up more than seven percent. Mergers typically hurt the acquiring company's share price, at least in the short term. Microsoft's gains also reflect its latest earnings reports. Revenue at its cloud division jumped 16 percent in the first quarter. We've got Clare Duffy, joining us now. Great earnings coming through from Microsoft, a merger that perhaps might not happen. It is being been blocked by competition authorities in the UK.

And so, this is really a blow to Microsoft and to Activision the day after Microsoft's really positive earnings results. So both Microsoft and Activision say they plan to push back on this. Microsoft had already agreed to make a number of concessions in an effort to try to win over lawmakers, for example, by making some of these really popular games that it would be taking over available on rivals' platforms for a number of years, but it appears that was not enough to win over UK regulators. And this really adds to the regulatory pressure that these companies are facing over this deal.

I think more broadly, though, it underscores there is very real concern inside the Biden administration right now, that the direction particularly of domestic politics and domestic sentiment inside South Korea about not just very real concern related to North Korea, its growing nuclear capabilities, the sheer tempo of its nuclear testing, but also it is concerned about the kind of stability or sturdiness of the US Defense assistance agreements that they have right now. And I think what you saw over the course of the last four or five months, this was really put together behind closed doors at the request of President Yoon working together at a very high level from President Biden's national security team is a recognition that while beyond some of the assets and capabilities, this isn't a dramatic shift away from what has long been the extended deterrence posture that the US has kind of offered to many of its allies, putting it in a very concrete, very, I think stabilizing terms and was viewed as essential in this moment in time, not just because of the North Korean threat, but also because of real questions about the US role and leadership in the world.",

I just want to give you a bit of context. It's shocking to see this stock at about $5.50 a share. Take a look over the last 12 months. You can see that before March, the stock price had been relatively stable. It had fallen a little bit since April of last year but had been relatively stable. Of course, SVB fell. For context, this is a bank considered the bank of the rich, for the wealthy. The loan quality is stellar, so this isn't a loan issue. It's not a credit issue. This is not even a depositor issue, because we heard the bank say earlier this week the deposits had, in recent weeks, stabilized after late March, had actually stabilized. This is not a loan issue, it's not a depositor issue; this is a profitability issue. The concern with investors that the spread between what the big borrowers and with the bank can actually earn is shrinking. There are a few potential scenarios that you're seeing being discussed. One is perhaps one of the big banks or private equity firms step up and potentially provide the rescue plan or just buys the bank. First Republic has at one point been under one of those banks, under Bank of America, under Merrill Lynch not too long ago. In 2008, I want to say. So that's a potential scenario. There's also the likelihood that maybe it just skirts along as a stand-alone company. As the senior portfolio manager at Fernwood Investment told me a short time ago, when I asked, what do you think happens here? She says, I don't think that it goes bankrupt. So does the share price languish here for a long time until management can come up with a strategy that's coherent? I think that's probably the best thing to do at this point. Then there is also the scenario that is being considered, that it might go into receivership like SVB. To your question, Eleni, why would the U.S. government not want to step in and make depositors whole like they did with SVB? I'm not sure they want to set a precedent of stepping up to rescue depositors every time a bank goes under. Not to say that they would like to see more banks go under. But I think they made it pretty clear that they want the banks to figure this out amongst themselves. They want some of the private banks to step up. It's very expensive for the FDIC and Treasury Department to step up and rescue depositors. To that point, Eleni, the bank pointed out earlier this week that, of its total deposits, 75 percent are fully insured at this point. It is not a ton of deposits on its balance sheet right now that are not insured. But at this point, at least according to the reports, the government doesn't appear to be wanting to make those other depositors whole, if in fact we get there.",

The first thing that changed, about six weeks ago with SVB and just coming on the back ofyour previous segment, First Republic now as well, those traditional financial institutions are now having trouble. And really, that's what bitcoin was invented for in 2008, which is to have a peer to peer payment system, which allows there to be no issues around trust. Coming into this year, I think we would've thought banks like SVB and First Republic would have been very trustworthy. So the fact that they are having issues now is why people started to reengage with that core use case of bitcoin. Very importantly, that's now seen this go roughly from 20,000 to 30,000. It starts to reopen some other more positive potential stories for bitcoin. Miners are much more profitable now. I estimate the average mining cost is about $15,000 for the large U.S. listed miners. So when we got down to 15,000 last November, a big risk that they could've been selling a lot of coins down there. Now we are up 30,000 roughly. That takes that risk away.",

We now have asituation where centralized exchanges are less trustworthy than they were before. We also have a situation where stablecoins are less trustworthy than before. We had the collapse last May of the Terra LUNA system. We also had, over the SVB weekend, the second largest stablecoin, USDCD pegged for a couple of days. So because of that, within the crypto ecosystem, money is seeking that truly safe high, which is bitcoin. It was the first on the market 15 years ago. And it steps away from those traditional financial backing and, quite frankly, centralized exchange tough issues.",

So the Bank of England is quite a ways down. A consultation process around how to do that and I suspect, medium term, they become the safe asset within a digital asset ecosystem. When we saw central banks become this ultimate risk free asset 10 or 15 years ago, depending on the country, you're talking about when central banks became independent, but also then saw volatility across bond markets come with it as well. I think that when we get regulation and/or central bank digital assets helping that stablecoin type of space, probably volatility will comes well across riskier assets in the asset class as well. So again, a medium term positive for bitcoin. For me, it is the jump on the back of banking concerns, miners being more profitable, regulation medium term, perhaps even risky assets more broadly doing a little bit better once the Fed ends that cycle, which we expect them to do either next week or in June.",

That was part of what President Zelenskyy wanted to get across in thathour-long call, which was longer than the Ukrainians had originally expected the call to last. They are taking that as a good sign as well. One of the points President Zelenskyy made was that there can be no (INAUDIBLE) to find peace, there can be no territorial compromise. Essentially, Ukraine cannot be expected to give up any of its territory. I think that gets to the point that the critics of president Xi's peace proposal put forward, when he was in Moscow a month ago, meeting President Putin. And he does have a close and strong relationship with President Putin and his economic supporter, Russia, at the time of this war, helps President Putin finance the war. President Xi's peace plan makes no recognition of the fact that Russia has illegally invaded Ukraine whatsoever. But from Ukraine's perspective, China was, before the war, going back a couple of years, their number one trading partner, bigger than Russia even. So there is a strong relationship there. They've been wanting to appoint another ambassador to China. And this is something that has now been accepted and gone through. I think that the way that diplomatic process works, it didn't start on the phone today with president Xi. So I think that we can certainly see there was some conversations going on between the Chinese and the Ukrainians about this behind the scenes, behind this, paving the way. I think they see it in a positive light and, from their perspective, doing what President Zelenskyy did, you have to get in China's ear, if you will, if you want to interrupt its thinking on Russia. Because Ukraine believes that China, just by giving that diplomatic and economic support, is really helping to enable Russia continue with its narrative of war. So how they expect to bring the two, Russia and China's positions closer together, how they expect to do that is not clear. But they do hope that this is the beginning of a process that can work to close some of the gaps.",
