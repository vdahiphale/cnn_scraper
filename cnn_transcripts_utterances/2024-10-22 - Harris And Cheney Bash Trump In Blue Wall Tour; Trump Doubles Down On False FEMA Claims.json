And it's feeling more like summer, not like autumn or winter. That's for sure. And we're going to set some major record high temperatures over the eastern and central parts of the country. About 70 locations throughout the eastern U.S. through the end of the week, we'll experience those record high temperatures, including D.C., which flirted with record-breaking territory yesterday. We'll have another day of potential record warmth near our nation's capital and some of the areas across the mid-Atlantic as well. Lots of warmth across the Deep South. I want you to notice this, 80 in Atlanta, 83 for D.C., 77 for Detroit, Burlington, New York, all the way to 80 degrees. So, all of these temperatures are roughly above 70 degrees. So we did a bit of math and we're talking about 93 percent of the U.S. population that will see temperatures above of 70 degrees. That's more typical of early September type weather. So that puts it into context. Yes, there is some cooler weather coming. You have to wait towards the second half of the week to feel more normal and to D.C., places like Atlanta and New York, you'll get it on some of the cooler weather as well, but it will take its time to get here. Here's the seven-day forecast for Atlanta. And this is the front that will actually bring our reprieve from the abnormally high temperatures.
