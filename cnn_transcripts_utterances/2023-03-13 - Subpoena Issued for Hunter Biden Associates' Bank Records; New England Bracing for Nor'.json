It covers 14 years, as you said, and three of Hunter Biden's former business associates. Democrats have slammed this subpoena as overly broad, saying itdoesn't just cover, you know, payments related to this potential business deal they were involved in with Hunter Biden, but everything from the Americans payments he was paying to -- for parking tickets, to what he was paying for his kids' dance lessons. They're also taking aim at Comer, essentially saying, we normally get a courtesy 48 hours heads up, but we just got this subpoena dropped on us, Don.",

And as part of this, the House Oversight Committee reached a deal with Trump's team for Mazars' -- Trump's accounting firm -- to hand over documents related to this last year.Well, Democrats said they learned that this year an attorney for Donald Trump reached out to Mazars and essentially said that the House of Representatives, now that it's run by Republicans, is no longer interested in receiving these documents. So, essentially, you can stop turning them over. So, Democrats are saying, you guys are hypocrites. You only want to investigate Joe Biden, his family. You're not interested in investigating form President Donald Trump. Comer is saying, I didn't meddle in this Mazars issue. This is just about Democrats wanting to get in front of my investigation.",
