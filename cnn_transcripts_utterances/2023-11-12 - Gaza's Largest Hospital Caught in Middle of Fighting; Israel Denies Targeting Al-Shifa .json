This area around the hospital has been the focus of intense fighting in a lot of -- it's unclear as to where exactly the fighting has taken place. People inside the hospital say that Israeli forces had laid siege to the hospital, surrounding it. Israel's Defense Force says that is not happening, but that there is intense and ongoing fighting in the areas around there. And it's important because this is the hospital that has been the focus for years of Israeli military saying that Hamas military fighters used this area underneath the al-Shifa Hospital, which is the largest in Gaza City, as one of its main focal points of its military operations and that's why there is such intense fighting there. And all this comes as a collection of Arab nations -- leaders that had gathered yesterday essentially accusing Israel of committing war crimes in this military operation in Gaza. But despite that, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is remaining defiant, saying that there will be no ceasefire and that Israel will continue with full military force until Hamas is eliminated.",

I mean, they are making it absolutely clear that not only Arab League, but also the Muslim leaders from the region are watching Israel's actions very closely and they have described it as war crimes. They are calling it barbaric and inhumane and that the war must stop immediately. They are condemning the occupation in the West Bank and east Jerusalem.Now, this is a show of force. These multiple leaders coming together in a very rare meeting usually they don't meet together. They came up with this resolution which has around 31 points full with condemnations as well as demands. But in the lead up to this meeting, there was hope specifically from the Arab world that there would be some kind of real tangible action, multilateral pressure that would be put on Israel, and also the United States, which they have categorically said is complicit in many ways in terms of Israel's actions in Gaza. They also mentioned the countries that are selling arms to Gaza, making very clear that any country right now that is supporting Israel and not -- and being silent about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, not calling for a ceasefire, also holds responsibility. Now, what we're seeing on the ground in Gaza plays a very big role in terms of the diplomatic discussions that are currently on the go. We know at the Rafah Border Crossing here in Egypt that we are anticipating that foreign nationals will be evacuated, is a breakthrough deal that has been going on for a week and a half. Qataris led that conversation. Many conversations happening here as well. Hamas leadership was in town on Thursday, the same day the CIA chief was here as well. But in all of this, it's the humanitarian scenarios, the catastrophe that is on the minds of all leadership. I want you to take a listen to what the Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MOHAMMED BIN SALMAN, SAUDI CROWN PRINCE (through translator): We are witnessing a humanitarian catastrophe that demonstrates the failure of the Security Council and the international community to put an end to the flagrant Israeli violation as of international laws and norms and international humanitarian law. It confirms the double standards and selectivity in its application of these laws. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It's the first time Iranian president has been in Saudi Arabia in over 11 years. He is back in the important Arab fold making his voice very heard. We know it's a red line for the United States if Iran becomes involved in this war which we know Iran is backing Hezbollah as well as Hamas. And the question now becomes, will we see sanctions? Will we see diplomatic pressure being exerted by the region on Israel and perhaps the United States as well? I spoke to one expert here that says this united front, the show of force by leadership in the region, is a very important and clear message.
