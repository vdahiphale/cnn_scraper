(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Of course I was entitled as president of the United States and commander in chief to immunity. I'm entitled to immunity. Every president has immunity. Especially one that did the job I did. I did a great job. And I wasn't working for myself, I was working for the country. I wasn't campaigning. The election was long over. Wasn't campaigning. I was looking for voter fraud, something that I have to do under my mandate. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, Donald Trump argued to the trial judge, Judge Chutkan, that he's immune, meaning he cannot be prosecute because he claims that what he's being charged for fell within the scope of his official duties as president. Judge Chutkan rejected that forcefully. She said we don't have kings in the country. Can't be. Now Donald Trump is in the court of appeals, which is the middle layer, one level below the U.S. Supreme Court but above the district court. What's going to happen today is a three judge panel, selected at random from the D.C. Circuit, will be asking a series of questions, really barraging the lawyer. The lawyers are going to get up there one at a time -- first Donald Trump's lawyer's going to get up because he's the one who's appealing -- and he will make his argument, and then the questions will just come rapid fire. And you're trained when you do these arguments, as soon as you see one of the judges start to ask a question, take an intake of breath, you shut down what you're saying, you listen and you answer that question. So, that's going to happen. It's scheduled for 20 minutes, but these courts of appeals will take as long as they want. Sometimes less, but I think in this case it will be more. Twenty minutes then for Jack Smith's team. It won't be Jack Smith himself. It will be a lawyer from his team. And then Trump's team will get back up for a rebuttal. We're not going to get a ruling today, by the way. That will come in a few weeks.",

He's likely going to go into a garage where we won't see him at all.Of course, these proceedings are not televised. We will get some audio of the judge's questions, but we won't be able to see what's going on inside the court, though there will be a sketch artist, so it could be at the end of the day really all we see of Trump during these proceedings is a single sketch from the sketch artist. So, again, as you point out, it's a conscious choice he's making to show up here today. And these are not your usual proceedings. As you've been discussing with the panel, this is an oral appellate argument. So, one lawyer at a time gets up before a three judge panel. They come prepared with an argument. Thought pretty much as soon as they start talking, they're peppered with questions from these judges. There are no witnesses. There is nothing for Trump to do today in this courtroom. But we'll be listening to these judges, as will former President Trump. It's unclear exactly what he wants to accomplish with his presence here today. It's unusual to attend an appellate oral argument, especially when he has so many competing interests on the campaign trail. But really, in addition to the larger constitutional questions that are being litigated today, the big strategy here is to at least get the election subversion case, the federal trial that was supposed to start here in just a few weeks, delayed. So, in terms of winning on the merits, as you experts have discussed, as former member's of Trump's team have said, they're not sure he's really going to win on the constitutional question here, but if he can just continue to get this case delayed, that in and of itself is a win for him.",

The way it was explained to me as a federal prosecutor is, if someone sues you because you indicted them, because you subpoenaed them, you're covered. That's part of the job.

It's been discussed but never decided by the Supreme Court. So, there's really two questions today that Donald Trump has to win on, one, is there such thing as criminal immunity.

She wants to know exactly why you're here and what you're doing about it. That's just two of the three very serious judges.But that also goes to why Donald Trump is there.

That's a really important point we're going to hear a lot about today, aside from immunity. He is suggesting that because he's been impeached, you were part of the January 6th investigative committee, that because he was impeached by Congress he can't be prosecuted criminally outside of that context.What do you make of that, particularly given your experience? AGANGA-WILLIAMS: Well, I think most serious legal scholars have, you know, discounted that argument.

You shouldn't have to face those charges again. So, even though he was not charged with this -- what would be these same criminal charges that Jack Smith has brought, his lawyers are going to say, these are effectively the same thing. You had your shot. You don't get to come back again and try to get me. And they'll basically say the Constitution lays out this process of how to go after a president for such conduct.

The voting is going to start next week. So with us here right now, CNN political commentator and PBS host, Margaret Hoover, and CNN's senior political analyst and anchor, John Avlon. John, I mean, I just wonder how you're looking at this in the sense of how much of what they decide here, even if Trump ultimately loses on the merits, if this - if he loses here or if it goes to the Supreme Court and he loses on the merits, how much of the timing here really could shape what the election itself looks like? JOHN AVLON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST AND ANCHOR: Well, I think, obviously, that's Donald Trump's bet. He seems -- he believes he will benefit from this attention. He will fundraise off it. He will say, I'm not being prosecuted, I'm being persecuted and therefore rally around me, particularly in the Republican base. I think the important thing to remember, though, is, this is another reminder that politics really is history in the present tense. This is history's stakes. This is a test in the court of where presidents have complete immunity, or whether they're ultimately held under account under the law as any other person once they leave office.
