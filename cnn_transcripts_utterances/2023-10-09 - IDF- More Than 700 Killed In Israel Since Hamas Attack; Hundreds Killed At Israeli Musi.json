I'm Rosemary church.The Israeli military is keeping up its strikes on Gaza, saying it has severely degraded the capabilities of Hamas. That word coming two days after the militant group launched a large-scale surprise attack that's killed hundreds inside Israel. An IDF spokesperson does acknowledge Israel is not yet in full control of its territory along the border with Gaza. Overnight Hamas also claiming to have launched a missile attack on the southern Israeli city of Ashkelon. Militants say 100 rockets were fired in response to Israeli Defense Forces targeting their safe houses. Israeli police say the rocket attack made a direct hit on an apartment building. This all comes as Hamas claims to now be holding more than 100 hostages in Gaza, including high ranking Israeli official -- officers. Well inside Israel the death toll from Hamas' multi-pronged attack has now climbed past 700. At least 260 were killed at a music festival. This disturbing image showing the bodies of some of the victims from that festival near the Israel-Gaza border. That site just one of several targeted by militants on Saturday. Our CNN's Nada Bashir is following developments. She joins us now live from London. So Nada, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is warning of a long and difficult war ahead. So what is the latest on airstrikes overnight? And, of course, the hostage crisis gripping the country as it comes to terms with the horrifying death toll.",

Well, among the hostages taken by Hamas militants are young people who were celebrating a Jewish holiday at a music festival near the Gaza border. The Hamas gunmen who stormed the site didn't just take hostages. They also murdered hundreds of festival goers. And we caution you the images of the aftermath we're about to show you our graphic at CNN is Clarissa Ward saw when she visited the site.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CLARISSA WARD, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): What happened just off this quiet border road was a massacre. The bodies of the perpetrators still remain. While the fate of many victims is unknown. Organizers of the supernova Music Festival say that thousands of young revelers had gathered to celebrate the end of the holidays. And just after 6:00 a.m., Hamas militants launched a bloody attack. (on camera): So we're just now on the approach to the kibbutz where that dance party was taking place. You can see there's vehicles all around here that have been shot up. We see the bodies of at least one, two Hamas fighters. I think there are more down this way. (voice-over): Many of the victims spent hours in hiding, waiting to be rescued and calling their loved ones. (on camera): Many of them are still missing. Many of them are dead. It's been very difficult to try to get a precise number. (voice-over): Now a volunteer group that handles human remains says that at least 260 bodies have been found at the festival site. The government here took a bold step releasing an image of scores of body bags in a tent where investigators were tasked with identifying them. (on camera): So you can see over here the body of at least one other person. I don't think you want to get too close to it. It's pretty graphic. (voice-over): Active fighting continued along this stretch of the border throughout the day as Israeli military forces poured in. So we're seeing a bunch of tanks being brought down this way. You can also been hearing a steady stream of booms apparently rockets landing in the distance in that direction. And certainly a feeling that people are on high alert. We tried to push further down that way. We were told and no uncertain terms we needed to turn around. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "The U.S. is sending a carrier strike group the USS Gerald Ford carrier strike group to the Eastern Mediterranean Sea as it watches the beginnings of a war unfold, and Israel promising to carry out a widespread prolonged campaign in Gaza. The purpose of this carrier strike group, which includes the carrier itself, as well as a guided missile cruiser and several guided missile destroyers, is not to get involved in this fighting or take part in any way in Israel's campaign against Gaza. Instead, it is a message to others in the region outside of Israel.President Joe Biden said on Saturday, warning other actors in the region without specifically naming whom, but telling them not to get involved or trying to exploit this opportunity without naming them. That was clearly a message to Iranian backed Hezbollah in Lebanon, and Iranian backed militias in Syria, a message of deterrence to them not only that carrier strike group heading from the Western Med to the Eastern Med, but also several more fighter jets heading to the region as a message of deterrence to Iran. Those fighters won't go to Israel. But the other areas where U.S. fighters are based, again as a warning to Iran not to try to carry out any more aggression or take advantage of the situation. Israel we've also learned from a U.S. official and an Israeli official has requested certain arms from the United States in particular precision guided munitions as well as Iron Dome interceptors, and those are the two munitions U.S. -- Israel has used at this point. Israel has carried out airstrikes in Gaza using proceeded precision guided munitions. So it makes sense that they're requesting more of that. And then Israel's Iron Dome has been incredibly busy intercepting barrages of rocket attacks from Gaza pretty much since the moments this began with an opening salvo of rocket fire. So Iron Dome has played a critical role there, and Israel looking more for more of the Iron Dome interceptor missiles. Israel, of course has its own stocks in it and it uses those. But there's also an understanding that Israel can tap into U.S. stocks, some of which are in Israel in the event of an emergency and certainly, this qualifies as one. Meanwhile, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and his Israeli counterpart, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant spoke for a second consecutive day on Sunday, it seems there'll be keeping up a pretty steady cadence of communications, just to make sure that the U.S. is giving Israel what it has, what it wants, and what it needs President Joe Biden and many in the Biden administration promising full support for Israel.

In fact we heard from President Biden saying that additional support is on the way. He has been in close contact with Benjamin Netanyahu and the Israeli authorities and has been offering further military support as has been requested by the Israeli government. But of course, there have been calls for de-escalation of violence. There is real concern across the region that this war -- this could really could escalate into a full-scale regional crisis and that is a huge concern. We've heard from the likes of Turkey, Egypt, Jordan calling for de- escalation of violence, calling for an end to the war, an end to tensions, an offer in support in helping to mediate and deescalate those tensions.

I was treating people there in critical condition, intubating and doing chest compressions all the time when I met two kids. They both were held hostage, somehow were in a closet for 12 hours, finally escaped. The army came in got them out and after that they said to me, I saw my parents get killed in front of me. I'm hungry. I haven't eaten in the last 12 hours.
