      "sentences": "Good morning or good evening, depending on where you're watching. I'm Rahel Solomon live in New York.Ahead on CNN NEWSROOM, Israel and Hezbollah ramping up the rhetoric and trading new threats of war. We're live in Beirut and Jerusalem with the latest here. A number of blockbuster U.S. Supreme Court cases are yet to be decided this term. We are live in Washington with the latest here. And the biggest star in football is ready for the start of another major international tournament. We are live from outside the stadium with a preview of the Copa America. Well, we want to begin in the Middle East, with new threats against Cyprus from the leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah warning the EU member could become a part of this war if a full-scale conflict breaks out between Israel and Lebanon. In a televised speech, Nasrallah warned that Cyprus not to open its airports and bases to Israeli forces. The threat was part of his fiery response to Israel warning that an all-out war with Hezbollah is quote, \"getting very close\". And a video, meantime, has surfaced from the Rafah border crossing linking Egypt and Gaza, which was once vital for aid deliveries, and it shows the passenger terminal has been burned and severely damaged. CNN cannot determine what caused the damage, but it did happen after Israeli forces took control of the crossing in early May. Now, the Pentagon says that a U.S.-constructed pier meant to facilitate aid deliveries into Gaza, well, they say that could be operational once again this week. U.S. officials tell CNN that the pier has now been reanchored to the Gaza coast. It was dismantled because of high seas. Let's get more now from Paula Hancocks, she is live for us in Jerusalem, and Ben Wedeman is in Beirut. Paula, let's start with you. As we could see in that video, that passenger terminal along the Rafah crossing seriously damaged. What more do we know here?",

      "sentences": "Well, Rahel, this is a key crossing, this Rafah crossing. It's where before Israel took control of the crossing on May 7, about a quarter of humanitarian aid was coming into Gaza. Now, we know nothing has come through that crossing since May 7. And we know also that there are serious fears about not enough getting in. The UN warning of potential famine for about a million people by mid-July, that they could face starvation. So, there have been many calls for this crossing to be reopened.But, what we are seeing now is it is in no shape, able to be reopened. It is badly damaged. It is badly burned. We understand from satellite imagery and footage we have seen that at the end of last month, it was badly burned. It's not clear how that happened. But then, either June 9th, June 10th from satellite imagery, we can see that there was bulldozing in the area by Israel to clear the area, presumably, and they have severely damaged part of that passenger terminal as well. Now, this is a key terminal, not only to allow humanitarian aid in, but also to take some of the more critical cases out of Gaza, so critical patients who cannot get the treatment that they need within Gaza. Just last week, we spoke to someone from the World Health Organization who says they believe about 10,000 patients are critical and currently waiting to come out of Gaza, but they need to do so through the Rafah crossing. And if this is the case that it is severely damaged, then that will raise more concerns that even if the Israeli military pulls back and they try and open it, it simply won't be functioning. Rahel.",

And he said, and I'll just read from what he said, he said, \"If that happens, the Cypriot government will become part of the war, and the resistance will deal with it as part of the war.\" Now, keep in mind, of course, Cyprus is 200 kilometers away. So, it's not clear how actually Hezbollah would be able to do anything in Cyprus using its normal conventional weapons.But, this statement has obviously ruffled feathers in Cyprus. We heard the President describe his statement, Nasrallah's statement as unpleasant, and insisted that Cyprus has no part in this war. And also this morning, a spokesman for the Cypriot government came out and said that Cypriot territory will not be used for any military action. Now, this situation has put the Lebanese government, which is essentially a bystander because of its basically weak nature, and Hezbollah essentially deals as it acts -- as it wants to act, but the foreign ministry here in Beirut came out with a statement saying that Lebanon and Cyprus have a rich history of diplomatic cooperation and continued to be in close communications at all levels.

Hezbollah, I think I'm counting five today, was nine yesterday. But, keep in mind, on Sunday and Monday, there were no strikes at all from Hezbollah whatsoever, although Israel carried on its normal tempo of strikes on targets in the south. Now, this morning, one Hezbollah fighter was killed in a drone strike. Yesterday, four or Hezbollah fighters were killed. I think the total number at this point of Hezbollah fighters killed, acknowledged by Hezbollah, is around 350.So, really, the tempo of action on the border has not been out of the ordinary. But, I think the one thing that really rattled nerves, particularly in Israel, is that nine-minute drone video published by Hezbollah, which, of course, didn't contain anything in the way of specific threats. It was just pointing out what you're seeing on the video. But, it certainly underscores perhaps the vulnerability of some of Israel's most sensitive strategic sites given Hezbollah's obviously enhanced abilities when it comes to what you compare what it had in, say, 2006.

      "sentences": "Yeah. It's always hurry up and wait, Rahel, this time of the year when it comes to the Supreme Court. We did have opinions this morning, also expecting opinions tomorrow. Today, they were relatively minor. There were four total opinions released by the Supreme Court, the biggest one among them, it upheld a 2017 Trump-era tax that taxed unrealized gains on foreign investments. This came from a challenge from a couple who had made an overseas investment.Now, interestingly, the Biden administration actually pushed for the Supreme Court to uphold this tax, which it did. The Biden administration fearing that, if the court had struck it down, it could upend a lot of the tax code, and the Biden team also feared that it could jeopardize any future plans for a wealth tax. It was interesting, we heard from Justice Brett Kavanaugh on the bench, he took the bench this morning to announce the opinion. He stressed this decision does not impact at all any other tax initiatives that might come down the pipeline. So, that was one of the first cases we got. We also got a case from the court greenlighting the ability of a small town Texas councilwoman to sue other town officials over what she said was a retaliatory arrest based on First Amendment grounds. So, relatively, minor cases today. We are still waiting on more than a dozen big decisions. That is a lot of decisions for this late in the term. Typically, the Supreme Court wraps up and is essentially out of town by the end of June. So, we're looking at probably, if they hue to normal procedure, that the Supreme Court should be wrapped by next Friday. We've got about 17 big decisions left, Rahel. You mentioned a lot of them, the big one being whether Donald Trump and former presidents can be immune from criminal prosecution. We also have a case about gun rights relating to a federal law that restricts people subject to domestic violence restraining orders from owning a gun. Then, we also have a case about abortion. It would be the second case this term from the Supreme Court. We saw them sort of kick away a challenge to the abortion pill last week. This one is challenging in Idaho law, and whether or not a federal law which says you have to treat women if they're in severe distress, even if it means performing an abortion, whether that federal law upends the Idaho law that pretty much outlaws abortions completely. And then, the one last case we're looking at, that's a big one, is whether about 350 January 6 defendants who have been charged with a very specific federal charge on obstruction, whether their convictions will actually hold up, and it could sort of impact the case against Donald Trump when it comes to his January 6 case here in Washington. So, as you can tell, Rahel, we are waiting for the big ones here. And every day, we sort of get geared up before 10 a.m. to see what the Supreme Court will release because we never have any indication beforehand. Today, we got geared up. We got four opinions, but none are the big ones. Rahel.",

And on the other hand, you have former President Donald Trump, who will be holding a fundraiser tonight in Ohio, then holding a rally Saturday in Pennsylvania, and not necessarily holding any mock debates, as far as we're told although he has been having some policy briefings with some close advisors, as well as some of his potential vice presidential candidates.And so, you're really sort of seeing two very different approaches to this debate. And we're going -- this is a rematch of sorts.

They have been splicing these selectively edited clips and sharing them of Joe Biden trying to make him look feeble and weak. Well, now, there has been some sort of expectation recasting heading into this debate where we're seeing Trump and some of his allies suggest that they expect President Biden to perform, that he is going to show up there, quote, \"pumped up\".And so, it's been really interesting to see. They've been spending so much time trying to get their supporters anticipating a weaker President Biden, similar to what we saw at the State of the Union address, where that was the same sort of expectation coming in for Republicans, and Joe Biden sort of easily overstepped that bar.

This hotel is on pilings. You can see that there are several inches under this hotel. You can tell by the tire level there in those cars that are under there. Now, this is normal construction for a lot of the coastal areas in Texas. You want that building up high because you want the water to be able to flow underneath.But, take a look around. There is just so much water here. There are some people here on an inflatable boat. And a lot of residents have been trying to come out here. Some of them have been stuck, like the vehicle that you see here in the middle higher ground. And just take a look where the water is coming from. This is the Corpus Christi Bay, and the bay has eaten the street. It has eaten this parking lot. It has eaten this entire area and completely taken over. And if you keep -- if we keep walking around, you'll see how every street, as far as your eye can see, it's just completely covered in water. Now, this scene is replicated in other towns along the Texas Gulf Coast. We have video of Surfside Beach. Now, that is near Houston, Texas. And if you look at that drone footage, you can see that water is running underneath those homes. Those homes are also on pilings. Again, that's by design, because they know that when the water rises from the coast from the ocean, that water can flow underneath, and the family can be safe up high. We also have a video or pictures from Matagorda, Texas, very similar scene. And Rahel, I got to tell you, I talked to officials here in Corpus Christi. And despite how devastating all this looks, they are counting their blessings. They say, no one has died. They have no injury so far.

The travels included a 12-hour drive west, arriving in Moldova for chartered flight to Spain. Two Ukrainian caregivers are staying with the whales for the first few weeks to help with their transition and to help with their care. Well, the \"Just Stop Oil\" group has struck again, this time, potentially aiming at Taylor Swift. The climate activists sprayed orange paint on two private jets at an airfield where the singer's private plane is believed to have landed. Now, this happened this morning at Stansted Airport outside London. The group posted a video showing them breaking into the airfield and spraying paint on the jets. On Wednesday, you might remember, the group spray painted the prehistoric Stonehenge structure. Heavy rains, flooding and landslides have led to the death of at least 31 people in the northeast India state of Assam. That's according to authorities there. Five people died from a landslide on Wednesday. The heavy flooding has affected more than 160,000 people and 15 districts across the state. In Delhi, soaring high temperatures have caused heat waves that have lasted weeks. Temperatures have risen to nearly 50 degrees Celsius or 120 degrees Fahrenheit, and increased power demand to an all-time high. All right. We're tracking new unrest in Kenya over potential tax hikes. Protesters continue to take to the streets and have been confronted by police. Civil society groups say that at least 283 people have been taken into custody since Tuesday.

But, he was very incendiary north of the DMZ from where we're listening to him yesterday. In Vietnam, he knows that this is a non-aligned country.

I think it says a lot about where we are right now. Remember, there are some CEOs who were critical of former President Trump, especially after January 6, and they have changed their tune. Right? They're back on the Trump train. Reid Hoffman, who, by the way, is a director at Microsoft, co- founder of LinkedIn, Reid Hoffman, though, is arguing strongly against that. He put out this OpEd recently in The Economist, titled \"American business should not empower a criminal.\"Now, what's interesting is that Hoffman told me that in the end, Trump is going to hurt Corporate America, really where it hurts the most. And that's the bottom line. He argues that it's Biden who is pro- business and not Trump, because he says that Biden respects the rule of law and Trump does not. It's an interesting argument, especially considering that Trump sees himself as sort of the CEO/President, right? And he has been very pro-business. He has called for lower taxes. He has called for less regulation. He just had a meeting in Washington with a roomful of CEOs, where he said he doesn't just want to extend the 2017 tax cuts. He wants to lower the tax rate even further. Hoffman, though, he argues that none of that matters if there is no rule of law. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

At the end of the day, Rahel, listen, this is not going to be up to the CEOs. It's going to be up to the voters.

I mean, as I mentioned, Trump wants to lower the corporate tax rate even further. President Biden, he has called for an increase. That is a major difference and that's one that those CEOs and shareholders care deeply about. Also on energy, clearly, President Biden has been more in favor of clean energy than former President Trump. Trump has talked a lot about drilling more and more oil, although we should note that the U.S. is producing more oil right now than it ever has before, more than any other country on the planet ever has before, under Biden.I should also talk about their policies around inflation, which is obviously the number one frustration for voters. What's interesting is that Trump has proposed tariffs against China, higher tariffs across the board against all trading partners. And some of the economists I talked to, they worry that that's actually going to make inflation worse. Another major policy from Trump, of course, is on immigration. Right? He has called for sweeping deportations. And this is -- would come at a time when a lot of businesses, they say they need more workers, not fewer, and that's another policy that some of the economists that I talked to are concerned, could actually make inflation worse. It's fascinating to see the contrast here, and it'll also be fascinating to see which of these economic arguments ends up winning out in November.",
