      "sentences": "A very warm welcome to the show, everyone, I'm Isa Soares. Tonight, Ramadan begins across the Muslim worldwith no ceasefire deal for Gaza inside, as tempers frail between the U.S. and Israel. We'll bring you, of course, the very latest. Then western embassy staff evacuate from Haiti as gang violence spikes in the country's capital. I'll speak to the World Food Program on the ground in Port-au-Prince. Plus, royal uproar. The Princess of Wales apologizes over confusion caused by an edited photograph. We'll have more on that controversy coming up on the show with our royal correspondent, Max Foster. But first, tonight, the U.N. Secretary-General says his strongest appeal today is for the spirit of Ramadan to be honored by silencing the guns. But there's no end in sight to the war in Gaza as the Muslim holy month gets underway. Over the weekend, U.S. President Joe Biden warned an Israeli offensive on Rafah would be a red line. But immediately added that he would never abandon Israel and cut off all weapons. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is still vowing to attack Rafah to root out Hamas. But Israel and U.S. officials tell CNN, they don't believe an offensive that is imminent. Some 1.5 million Palestinians are sheltering, as you know, in Rafah, virtually penned against Egyptian border. I want to get more on all these strands for you, our Jeremy Diamond in Jerusalem for more. And Jeremy, an offensive may not be imminent, but it hasn't been ruled out by Prime Minister Netanyahu, and the stakes, of course, couldn't be higher. What are you hearing about this potential offensive and crucially, the possibility of any sort of a ceasefire at this stage.",

Doctors say two newborn babies were the latest casualties. Jordan, U.S. and other countries are air-dropping aid. These pallets floating down on the first day of Ramadan. But it's only a tiny fraction of what's needed to ward off famine. There's also an international effort to get aid to Gaza by sea, but a ship carrying 200 tons of food is still docked at a port in Cyprus. It is expected to depart later today. We'll see across the story for you, and we'll have much more in fact on this story in about 20 minutes from now including a look at how Palestinians in Gaza are marking Ramadan, of course, in the shadow of war. That's in about 20 minutes. Well, hunger and suffering are also being acutely felt in Haiti where gang violence has left tens of thousands displaced. Germany, U.S. and the European Union are evacuating their staff with a source telling CNN, both the German and the EU ambassadors were evacuated on Sunday. The U.S. meanwhile says it's air-lifted out all non-essential personnel from its embassy. And this comes as gangs continue to carry out attacks threatening to topple Haiti's government. One source telling CNN that credible intelligence emerged, suggesting the gangs which have so far been attacking government institutions as you know and police, might move toward embassies and hotels next. Rights groups say there's no end in sight to the chaos, and that the country has quote, \"completely collapsed\". Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has arrived, you can see there in Jamaica for an emergency meeting on the very crisis. Well, with Haiti in crisis, a humanitarian disaster is unfolding. Right now, nearly half of the population requires humanitarian assistance. Food, water, medical care are in short supply. The World Food Program says we are starting to see mass hunger lasting years, which the organization worries will lead to more unrest, more conflict as well as mass migration. Country Director for Haiti for the World Food Program, a well-known face here on the show, Jean-Martin Bauer joins me now. Jean-Martin, welcome to the show. Tell me first where you are. I see you're in Cap-Haitien, and are those -- is that food behind your pallets, behind you? What can you see?

So, we're on the ground, we're active, and at least, in this part of Haiti, life is closer to normal, but it's still quite disrupted.

So, what we need actually is for the fighting to stop, we need security to return, and hopefully, Haiti's traders, the market women, the Mat- Donsahat(ph) do what they do best, which is feed the population.

But you are going to see some of the more fiery questions, certainly from the Republican side, and it will be framed in such a way, I would imagine, as - should we continue to support Ukraine when it became clear that, as we have supported them in the past two years, that they have not managed to claw back so much of the territory that has been taken by Russia. So, it will have a political overtone. And I'm glad you mentioned the elections, Isa. That is going to be a major concern as well. This is an election year. We have seen interference by countries like Russia and Iran in the past.
