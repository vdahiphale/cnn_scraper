It's interesting because Speaker Pelosi in addition to being there, and what they call the enrollment ceremony to sign the bill and send it down to the White House. She wrote an op- ed today in \"The Washington Post\" because she wanted to talk about the importance of this to her, just as I began my career fighting for LGBTQ communities, I'm overjoyed that one of the final bills I will sign as speaker will be the Respect for Marriage Act, ensuring the federal government will never again stand in the way of marrying the person you love.Critical distinction, the federal government, because the state could still and people think with this Supreme Court, you know might open the gateway for states to do it as the Supreme Court opened the gateway for states to act on abortion rights but a pretty important piece of federal legislation here.",

They keep talking about that religious liberty aspect. And it's almost like putting a foot in the door, right, to keep the door open to say, here's an issue that we continue to pursue.",

And that's why the Congress decided they needed to act.LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: The Congress and also President Biden warned about that immediately after the Dobb's decision. He came out and said, this isn't just about abortion access, it's about privacy, it's about marriage, it's about everything that right now, people, a lot of these issues where people thought that they were settled, and that they may not very well be settled. And so again, it's also -- this comes I think, about 10 years or more after President Biden's said got ahead of then President Obama and said that he supported same sex marriage. And so, the White House isn't said necessarily when the President is going to actually sign this bill. But it's come full circle for him as he's ready to support what has that Congress has just passed.",

That's a fascinating question, in the sense that, you know, Republicans would argue abortion rights, you know, many Republicans happy with the Dobb's decision on policy, and yet they just paid a price politically for it. Isn't this issue settled? Maybe not every little detail of it, but the idea, especially with younger voters, that should Washington be telling me what to do about this? Should politicians be telling me what to do about issues, whether it's about gay rights or abortion rights? Are Republicans going to push this issue now that this law is passed to try to challenge it somehow?",

I think that sort of make the argument that it is more settled, that is 39 Republicans in the House, but with Democrats in 12, 12 Republicans in the Senate, you may say, that's not very much. Actually, when you think about especially what you were just saying pointing out that it has just been a decade, it was going into the reelection effort of the Obama White House.And the Obama aides on that side of the White House were actually furious of then Vice President Biden for stepping out and saying he support same sex marriage. So in a decade, that is what has happened. So yes, it is not as far as many activists in the community wanted it to go without question. But this was compromised. This is actual compromise. And it only started because of that House vote. And that's when Senator Tammy Baldwin on the Senate side got the idea that she could maybe get the Senate Republicans, because so many House Republicans surprisingly, actually voted with Nancy Pelosi. This was not -- this was sort of seen as a political vote early on in the summer. And then it became real by seeing so many Republicans on the House side, Liz Cheney and many others, and that gave Senator Tammy Baldwin on the Senate side, the idea that this could indeed happen.

Herschel Walker could not get votes from the same voters who voted for Brian Kemp, the Republican governor, that tells you we have a problem, right?Voters who are available to Brian Kemp, even in the Democratic suburbs, he didn't win. But he did much better than Herschel Walker. Why aren't they voting? Marjorie Taylor Greene says it's not Trump. It's because they wouldn't let people like me help Herschel Walker. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE (R-GA): The audacity and really the frank rudeness of the campaign consultants and Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham, where they thought, you know, we're going to keep Marjorie Taylor Greene away from Herschel Walker. And we don't need her voice at his campaign rallies and events, where we're campaigning all of this -- all over the state, I think is a really major mistake and an insult to me.

If you're Peter Thiel, you just lost a bunch of cash into races where you were not successful. Mehmet Oz just saw what happened when he poured all his money into his race.Democrats were able to put their money to work and smarter ways around more consistent messaging. And they put way more ads on air and they use them to define these candidates, not just in relation to Trump, but in relation to the actual platform of the party in so many ways about Dobb's abortion and other things. So I think the senators feel bold now because they've had a couple of voters come out and they feel like oh, God, OK, I don't have to be scared of Trump.

But there's -- you're trying to make that argument where your only declared candidate for President right now, if you're a Republican thinking about 2024, is Donald J. Trump and Karl Rove, who helped George W. Bush win the White House says, we ought to realize the Trump endorsement is not an inducement to support that candidate, but a warning to beware.

So in many respects, in Florida, they're saying bring it on. He wants a big field.But I think the reality here is I was in Georgia and one thing that Herschel Walker didn't do, he didn't appeal to, he didn't change his message or appeal to those voters. He wanted Marjorie Taylor Greene's district. That was not his problem.

Officials from the White House, the State Department, and across the administration worked tirelessly and relentlessly to see this moment through. As the Secretary of State said publicly in July, we have been engaging in intense negotiations with Russia, pursuing many different avenues over the course of the last six months to secure Brittney's release. And we know Brittney fought tirelessly too. Throughout her ordeal, we saw Brittney, a two-time Olympic Gold medalist for Team USA, demonstrate strength, courage, and dignity. As the President said this morning, she represents the best of America. I had the opportunity to speak to Cherelle Griner a couple of hours ago, who is looking forward to seeing Brittney as soon as she returns home later today. Cherelle, who herself has handled Brittney's detention with incredible strength, asked me to communicate once again her sincere gratitude to everyone in the administration and in their broader -- and in their own broader support network, who made this day possible. She also wanted to reinforce the commitment she and Brittney have made to stand up and speak out for other Americans wrongfully detained abroad. While we're celebrating Brittney's return home today, we have also continued to be in touch with the Whelan family for whom this news brings mixed emotions. In recent weeks, it became clear that while Russians were willing to reach an agreement to secure Brittney's release, they continue to treat Paul Whelan differently, given the nature of the totally illegitimate charges they have levied against Paul. Unfortunately, the choice became to either bring Brittney home or no one. As the President said this morning, he will never stop working to secure Paul's release and return home. And he will not give up. On a personal note, Brittney is more than an athlete, more than an Olympian. She is an important role model and inspiration to millions of Americans, particularly the LGBTQI plus Americans and women of color. She should never have been detained by Russia. And we are, I am, deeply proud of the work that the President has done, this administration has done to get her home. With that, Seung Min.",
