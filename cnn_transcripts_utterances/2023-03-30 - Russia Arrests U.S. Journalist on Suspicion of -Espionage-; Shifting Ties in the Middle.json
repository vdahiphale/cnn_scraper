First up though, an American journalist is arrested in Russia and accused of espionage. The Kremlin says he was caught red handed while \"The Wall Street Journal\" says it is deeply concerned for his safety. Well, security on high alert in Brazil's capital as Former President Jair Bolsonaro returned to the country after three months in the United States. Supporters are gathering outside his party's headquarters. The Vatican says Pope Francis is improving after spending the night in the hospital with a respiratory infection. CNN is live outside that hospital in Rome. And Prince Harry returns to court for a case about the Daily Mail's news gathering methods. Harry says he feels duty bound to expose what he calls a cover up while the tabloids publisher denies any wrongdoing. Well, you are with us for the second hour of \"Connect the World\". I'm Becky Anderson. Let's start with that developing story. More details on the American journalist from \"The Wall Street Journal\" arrested in Russia and accused of espionage. It is a claim that the newspaper vehemently denies. Let's get you to CNN's Matthew Chance who is in Moscow. What's the Kremlin saying at this point, Matthew?",

They're saying this is in thehands of the security services but Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin Spokesperson, saying that as far as he understood, Evan Gershkovich had been caught red handed in the act of espionage. And so Russian officials seem pretty convinced that they have a compelling case against this individual. In terms of what the official charges are against them well, the FSB, the successor organization to the KGB have issued a statement saying that they apprehended Evan Gershkovich in the City of Yekaterinburg, about 1100 miles 1800 kilometers or so, from Moscow. After when he was engaged in trying to obtain secret information about Russia's military industrial complex there was no more details than that. Since then, within the past few hours, the 30-year-old American reporter has appeared at a court in Central Moscow, where he's been arraigned, he's been kept in custody for waiting, here's the start of his trial for one month and 29 days until March the 29th so a long period of waiting in a Russian prison. He is also been emerged from the court that he has not pleaded guilty to these charges of espionage.",

More on it as we get it, of course.Well, a top U.S. General has said increased partnership between Russia, China, and Iran will make them problematic for years. The words of Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Miley speaking before the House Armed Services Committee on Wednesday. He said the three countries are working more closely together. Well, that closeness between Iran and China at the heart of what we have seen recently here in the Middle East Beijing, brokering a landmark agreement between Saudi Arabia and Iran that could see tensions decrease across this region. Well, my next guest says the convergence of the broader strategic interests of China, Iran, and Saudi Arabia here suggests that Beijing's breakthrough with Iran and the Kingdom is likely to serve as the foundation of a new geopolitical reality in the Middle East. This transformation represents an historic challenge for the United States. No longer can Washington simply demand that its Arab allies decoupled from China and unite behind its leadership to combat Iran. Well, tonight then we ask what the new geopolitical reality in the Middle East is. Those were the words of Vali Nasr, Professor of International Middle East Studies at Johns Hopkins University. He joins us now via Skype from Paris this evening. Vali, it's good to have you! I thought the conceit of your piece is well worth exploring. What are the consequences for this region of the moves that we've seen of late?",

In other words, if Iranand Saudi Arabia have found a way through Beijing, to bury the hatchet to reduce tensions between them potentially end the war in Yemen, that generally is good for the region is good for the Gulf, which is also been very nervous about military conflict, that could damage its economy and put it in danger. However, more broadly, the most interesting piece of this is not the Iran piece. It's the China Saudi Arabia piece. So first of all, we're seeing a China that has gone beyond its usual only business to get into security matters. And he's also building a relationship of trust with Saudi Arabia. I think it's a big deal that Saudi Arabia is trusting China to deliver Iran and to monitor an agreement. But even more interesting is that how Saudi Arabia is strategically shifting? How we're seeing a very deft foreign policy that is deliberately moving Saudi Arabia away from the United States, position it as in the middle of the great powers that Saudi Arabia no longer wants to be a vassal and outposts of the United States. He wants to have equal relations with China, with Russia and with the United States. And also regionally, Saudi Arabia does not want to be pursuing a policy that is based on polarization of its relations with its enemies. It wants to build bridges with everybody, talk with everybody, it mended fences with Turkey, after several years, it's mending fences with Iran is opening relations with Syria now. So we're seeing a very different Saudi Arabia who really wants to be treated as a great power in its own rights, and to be a big player in West Asia sitting between the world's superpowers.",

But I just want to sit with the Washington perspective here. Because it would be, I think, going one step too far, way too far to suggest that Riyadh is by any means turning its back on Washington at present. And indeed, it is quite clear that Washington - that Riyadh still has important bilateral needs from the U.S. not least in terms of security guarantees. And we know, for example, in support of its nuclear program, so let's be quite clear about this.

But I think in reality is that Saudi Arabia acknowledgesthat it needs the United States for its security, its military, its intelligence, or based on American military hardware. Where it's changing is that it's not going to follow American policy blindly. It's saying that I have my own interest. My interest also dictates that I don't decouple from China that I actually build ties with Iran. Yes, I'm your partner on military matters. Yes, I'm an ally. But I don't also support some of your policies. I don't want war with Iran. I don't want escalation. It's damages vision 2030, at some level, if there is war in the Gulf, and also I am thinking about China very differently than you in Washington are thinking about it. And that degree of independence of foreign policymaking is just new. I mean, nothing in previous conversations about Saudi Arabia and Washington, suggested that we thought that the Saudis would basically assert this degree of independence. Now for the United States this is glass half, half full, of course. But it doesn't mean that the Saudis are turning against the United States. They just basically saying we don't want to play the game of a polarized game of you, us versus them, you're either with us or you're against us. We want to sit in the middle in the gray area, because that's where our interest is.",

Its relationships with Europe havedeclined significantly as a consequence of the protests and Iran support for Russia and Ukraine. And Iran desperately needs to an outlet. And ironically, it's the hardliners in Iran who don't believe in dealing with the West that have been most interested in opening to their Arab neighbors. So this is a gain for them. But it also, I think it's beneficial to Iran that Abraham Accords now to them looks like it will be bilateral relations between Israel and a number of Arab countries and potentially Saudi Arabia around technologies intelligence and economy. But it will not be an alliance of war against Iran, led by Israel with Arab States basically playing as junior partners in that, because you know, both UAE, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia normalizing with Iran is basically saying they don't want to go down that path. So if the United States looked at Abraham Accords as a kind of a NATO for the Middle East, to go after Iran, that's not in the works. Right now, if the United States looked at Abraham Accords, as the great way in which to integrate Israel into the region and build the basis of peace, then - it's still a win, and it's going to continue and those relations will continue on--",
