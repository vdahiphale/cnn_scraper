Joining me now, CNN senior law enforcement analyst, Charles Ramsey. He led the police forces here in Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia. Chief Ramsey, there has been some criticism from Republicans that this indictment, these indictments are weak, because they're based merely on lies that the president told that day, on January 6th, and leading up to it. You, of course, led police officers here. As you look again at the violence committed against them, in addition to against the institution, were those lies, was Trump himself then, responsible for what we saw that day?",

As a police officer, you have to try to stay as objective as possible, and let the system do its job. But I imagine, like everyone else in America, you have a variety of opinions. But as a police officer, you have to be objective, just do your job. The same thing will apply tomorrow when the former president comes in to be arraigned.

But you have to do it throughout this entire process. I was thinking about the vice president, for example, the former Vice President Pence. What is going to happen in terms of his security as he's on the campaign trail? There are issues that need to be addressed. They will be addressed. And it is a concern. The more the former president stirs the pot, and you have a lot of people that believe in him, that don't see what he's saying as being lies, then the bigger the challenge it is to keep everyone safe and secure.

So who is he? CNN's Brian Todd is here with some answers. Brian, walk us through his career. BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Brianna, Donald Trump has been frustrated enough with Jack Smith over the years to lash out at Smith on more than one occasion. He has called him deranged Jack Smith on at least one occasion. But Smith does have a long record of investigations as a prosecutor, usually keeping a low profile and with some mixed results. In the 1990s, he served as prosecutor at the U.S. attorney's office in Brooklyn. There, he won some tough cases against gang members and crooked police officers. He had two stints as the chief prosecutor for the special court in the Hague, investigating war crimes in Kosovo. He's also served as an acting U.S. attorney for the middle district of Tennessee.

But earlier, he led the DOJ's Public Integrity Unit. That was from 2010 to 2015. As part of that, that's where he had some setbacks. He investigated Democratic Senator Bob Menendez from New Jersey. He was indicted on corruption charges. But that case ended in a mistrial. Also a judge kind of separately acquitted Senator Menendez. Smith also oversaw an investigation into former House majority leader, Tom DeLay, a Republican, but that probe ended with no charges being brought. And he headed that division of justice when the Justice Department investigated and failed to convict former Senator and vice presidential candidate, John Edwards, in a corruption case in 2012. So, Brianna, a lot of high-profile cases. Kind of paling in comparison to what he's about to go through. And we'll see how endures this enormous pressure.",
