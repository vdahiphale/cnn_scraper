It includes various documents, dashcam videos and text messages. We also hear a 911 call from a man who says he's the shooters uncle. It's now been two years since 19 children and two teachers were all killed at Robb Elementary School as their families now continue fighting for accountability. CNN's Camila Bernal is here with more on this. Camila, what are we learning from this newly released information?",

And they we're asking if their photos could actually be taken off the Web site.There's another group chat that mentions the DPS director throwing everyone under the bus. That's obviously referring to the director of the Texas Department of Public Safety. And in a press conference after the shooting, the DPS director did say that the on-scene commander had made the wrong decision and did not attempt to get into this classroom quickly enough. He later said that the first officers that responded acted against active shooter training. And we have reached out to DPS about these text messages. But just last week, the former Uvalde School Police Chief Pete Arredondo told CNN's Ed Lavandera that he felt that he was scapegoated from the very beginning. So there's still a lot of questions when it comes to law enforcement, who was heavily criticized for this failed response. Because remember, it took 77 minutes for these officers at the school to confront the shooter. And the families of the 19 children and two teachers, they're still dealing with all of this. And they still want accountability -- Jess?",

It's a political move, not really so much of a legal move. Many checks and balances built into our justice system. As you know, one of them is the government doesn't ever take an action like this on their own. They go to court and they prove to a judge that there's probable cause to believe that there's evidence in a particular relocation. That's what happened here with Mar-a-Lago. And a federal judge made that determination. Then the FBI is simply executed, conducted their authorized law enforcement activity pursuant to that warrant.",

That's actually not a thing. You're not required to do that. But in this case, as you mentioned, they spent months, half a year, in fact, pursuing -- to try to get those documents back with the participation and the consent of Mr. Trump and his representatives. They -- numerous lawyers they consulted with. And in fact, at one point, the Trump team looked at what they had and only gave some of it back, therefore, making the decision to continue to retain the rest of it, which we now know had dozens and dozens of classified documents in it. So it's ridiculous. It's not going anywhere. And the claims in the suit themselves are -- are absurd.",

So we know, historically, that Iran kind of a waded into the presidential contest in 2020 in a very similar way.They used spear phishing to go after accounts that they thought could get them into the documents and the conversations within political campaigns. That's essentially what's been alleged here. As you said, we don't know for sure if it was Iran. We know that Microsoft said that they have uncovered some Iranian activity, but they didn't identify which campaign it was directed at. And the Trump team has said it was them. It may very well be Iran. But in this case, you see a slight evolution on the same tactic. This time, from the Microsoft report, we know that Iran went to a former campaign adviser, hacked into that person's account and used that account to send spear phishing emails to people in this unidentified campaign. So that's a -- they're, they're upping their game a little bit. They've learned from their 2020 experience, and they're still committed to trying to play some mischief in our election.",

There's not -- we're missing that kind of keystone in the bridge.It may very well exist. But as you said, the feds aren't sharing that with us, which is totally standard. Whether or not the Trump campaign has reached out to the FBI to report this hack and to participate in an investigation in some way, we don't know that either. They haven't answered that question. But even without a contact like that, it is likely the FBI would investigate this anyway, because they are always investigating Iran's malicious cyber activity targeting the United States and certainly targeting our election. They would be investigating it. So very understandable why the bureau is not saying anything at this point until they get a better understanding of who did what here.",
