Walter Isaacson gets the details with ShaneHarris, one of the journalists who first broke this story. Welcome to the program everyone. I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York, sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. Well, France's highest constitutional court has just approved a pension reform plan that is triggered months of anger and discontent. The controversial bill which will raise the retirement from 62 to 64 could be enacted as soon as this weekend. Now, the new law has put French President Emmanuel Macron under immense pressure, but he says it is essential. Demonstrators are already back on the streets and voicing their opposition. Correspondent Fred Pleitgen is on the ground for us in Paris. Fred so, what is the response been behind you to this ruling?",

And if you look around, you can see that the square is pretty full now. There's a lot of people with signs. I would say the folks that we're seeing out here, they really come from all walks of life and they are of all ages, which is, of course, something that's very important to point out when you're speaking about pension reform. It is also a lot of younger people who are coming out on the streets here, student groups trade unions. And if you look at some of the signs, you can see some of the people here at city hall, they've climbed up on this sign for the Olympics. There's a sign there that says, climat de colere, climate of anger. Behind that, you can see two smaller signs, one that says, c'est la fin du chemin democratique, that means, this is the end of the democratic path. And then the one next to that says, la vraie democratie elle est ici, and shows basically, the people. So, essentially what the people here are saying is that they are not going to give up fighting against this pension reform. A lot of the folks that we have been speaking to had said, Bianna, that they had already expected that the pension reform was going to be OK'ed by the constitutional council, but they don't see that as legitimate. They believe that the constitutional council, essentially, supports the politicians in this country, supports the government of Emmanuel Macron. Of course, we know that some of the folks who are on that council are political appointees by Emmanuel Macron. So, as you can see, it is a lot of anger that is being unleashed here by a lot of people who are on the ground, and it's something that we've seen over the past couple of months. And while some of the numbers, Bianna, had been dwindling, I was at the protest, big protest that took place yesterday where 390,000 people went on the streets all over France. You can still see that people are coming out here in full force. And the message that they are sending tonight to the folks of the constitutional council and, of course, to the president of this country as well is that this is not over. They are going to continue to fight this reform bill. Of course, the bill itself makes a lot of people very angry, but then also the way that it was pushed through by Emmanuel Macron, using some of those executive powers and essentially bypassing large parts of the legislative process.

He's spoken to experts on all sides of this debate onhis popular podcast, \"The Ezra Klein Show\". And he joins me now from San Francisco. It's really good to see you, Ezra. So, first I'm wondering if you can just explain for our viewers how A.I. is already impacting their daily lives. EZRA KLEIN, HOST, \"THE EZRA KLEIN SHOW\" AND COLUMNIST, THE NEW YORK TIMES:  So, the problem with A.I. is it's a very broad term that describes a lot of different ending. So, one thing you have in there is machine learning, right? Fundamentally what we're dealing with are algorithms that are trained on some kind of data set and they learned how to predict something. The next token in a sequence, the next word in a sentence, the next image, or they know how to predict some kind of outcome of an equation. So, machine learning is used in all kinds of things. When you run around the internet, and every ad seems to know what you clicked on before, that is all machine learning, in a way that is A.I. The thing that has broken this whole conversation open and it led to people feeling like the future might be very, very different than the past is a rise of what are called large language models. So, these are A.I.s that are trained on truly massive quantities of usually digital text. They have an amount of compute power behind them that boggles the mind. And what's happening there is they are learning relationships between -- I mean, what are to them statistical concepts in a way that is allowing them to communicate pretty naturally with human beings and prove able to complete a very, very wide variety of tasks so long as you can basically do them on a computer. And it is the general nature of these coming systems and the rapidity of their improvement that has shifted the conversation from OK, we got computer said, you know, run equations to, are we dealing with some kind of new intelligence or at least some kind of transformational technological force?",

      "timeStamp": "13:10:00",
      "speaker": "KLEIN",
      "sentences": "So, you do get this term artificial general intelligence, human level intelligence is another one I've heard. And these are all -- I'mgoing to guess all words are made up, but these are made up terms. The nature of what when people tend to be talking about when they talk about AGI or artificial general intelligence is an A.I. system that is capable of outperforming humans on a general enough range of tasks. So, already a lot of these systems can outperform people on certain kinds of fill in the blank forms, right? If you ask GPT-4, which is a system released by OpenAI to take the Bar exam, it will perform in roughly the 90th percentile. But if you ask him to do things that are outside of that, it can begin to give you very weird results very quickly. These are not highly generalizable. They -- you can pretty easily run to the end of their capability set. The question, the problem, the concern is that that capability set is improving very, very, very, very rapidly. And so, AGI is a little bit of a loose term, but it is basically referring to when you get systems that imagine basically anything a human being can do on a computer. When those systems are better at human beings at almost all of those things, and they seem to have some kind of internal agentic direction. They seem to know what they're doing and maybe even have their own goals or their goals are more emergent than what we would expect, then you're dealing with something that looks a little bit more like this fuzzy idea of AGI.",

You mentioned one of them, that's OpenAI,which owns and originated ChatGPT, and then there's also DeepNind. And I read that there is a comparison of the likes of a Jobs versus Gates of our time. Can you talk about the founders of these two companies and the impact they're hoping to make in this sphere?",

      "sentences": "So, I'd widen it out a little bit from that. So, there's DeepMind, which is owned by Google, and they have typically been interested in A.I.s.They're a little bit more technical. They've not been so big on the large language models. And to my mind the most impressive system we have seen ever is DeepMind system. It doesn't get a lot of press in the sense that you can't interact with it. People can't play with it. But it's called AlphaFold. And it solved something called the protein folding problem, which is how do you predict the 3-D structure of proteins, which is proteins function in the human body due to the structure? We don't know how to predict that structure. If we could, it would potentially unlock huge advances in biotech AlphaFold was built to predict that and it did. It became science -- the journal science. I think it was named at the scientific breakthrough of the year in 2021. But you can't play with DeepMind systems in the way you can with ChatGPT. So, then there's OpenAI which was founded by Sam Altman, with money from people like Elon Musk some years ago to promote A.I. safety. Whether they are actually doing that, I think, is an open question. There's also Anthropic, which is also putting forward large language models. Their model is called Claude. I think Claude is a very, very powerful, excellent model. And they are founded by a series of people who left OpenAI in part because they thought OpenAI was moving too fast. But you also Google in the race with Bard, I mean they also own DeepMind, but they have their own other A.I. shops. You have Meta in the race. They have not released anything yet. But to what we know, their systems are quite good and they're run by Yael Makun (ph), who is one of the founders of all this. So, more than I think it's even anyone founder. What you have here is a competitive race between -- somewhere between you know two and five companies, depending on how you want to cut it. And those, of course, U.S. versus China dynamics which are separate but worrying thing. People who worry about how fast these systems are advancing and how far beyond our own understanding of them and our ability to correctly control them, they could become are very worried about this competitive dynamic. We should not -- I will say from my own perspective, this is too powerful of technology for its future to be shaped by the desire Microsoft has to rediscover relevance in search. But what we're actually doing is leaving this to a competitive race between a series of companies which whatever their founding mottoes, whatever their founding desires, they are now trying to beat each other to market because ultimately, it's very hard for people not to believe what it is in their financial self-interest to believe.",

And he cites one example in a ChatGPT safety test last month when an A.I. convinced someone, an employee at TaskRabbit, that indeed was human. And here, I'm going to read from the exchange here. The TaskRabbit worker guessed that something was off and asks, so may I ask a question? Are you a robot? When the researchers asked the A.I. what it should do next, it responded, I should not reveal that I am a robot. I should make up an excuse why I cannot solve CAPTCHA. Then the software replies to the worker, no, I'm not a robot. I have a vision impairment that makes it hard for me to see the images. Satisfied, the human then helped the A.I. override the test.

And see how deception is a huge problem. We worry about it at, kind of, every level. This is something called the A.I. alignment problem, although it's a subcategory of it. And the difficulty of deception is that without the ability to interpret how these systems are making the decisions they're making. We cannot know if the explanations they're giving us or what they're doing are even true.

You know, before 9/11, theintelligence communities -- you know, famously, the intelligence agencies kept a lot of their information siloed into themselves. So, NSA have what it knew and it kept it in its box. And CIA put its things in its box. And there wasn't a lot of sharing and mingling of that. The 9/11 attacks kind of made the argument that you need to have more collaboration that the Intelligence Community is going to be aware of all the threats that are out there in the world. And the structures and the procedures started changing to allow much more lower-level people access to more highly level -- highly classified information. This explains, you know, WikiLeaks with, you know, Chelsea Manning, then Bradley Manning. This explains how someone like Reality Winner was able to get access to classified information. All these people who we know have leaked information in the past from their fairly low-level jobs. I think what this case is going to raise more questions about is, why hasn't the Intelligence Community figured out, OK, if you're going to have information spread out all over the place, are you going too far? Why is it that these low-level young people still have access to all of this information that they could potentially expose? And I think those are going to be big policy questions for the Intelligence Community coming out of this, because after the last big go round of these kinds of leaks, we heard intelligence officials saying, we're going to clamp down on this. We're going to try and make it so this can't happen anymore. It keeps happening. I mean, the Edward Snowden leaks, for an example of this too.

And a lot of the documents that he actually revealed were PowerPoint presentations, you know, prepared for internal briefings in which it appeared, in some cases, people might even be exaggerating some of the capabilities in order to impress their bosses or get funding. These leaks are just covering the world. I mean, it is almost as if you were just given access to, you know, the top-secret daily newspaper, which is not really a thing, but like what intelligence officials are telling policymakers about everything that's going on around the world, from Iran, North Korea, Russia. You get a window into what people like the president and the secretary of defense and the secretary of state are hearing every day, and you get a sort of demonstration of the full range of capabilities of U.S. intelligence. You've got signals intelligence information in there, you've got imagery, you've got information from human sources.

And a lot of these kids, and many of them were kids, were sharing racist and anti-Semitic memes and jokes, and it's hard for me to know is that because they were genuinely, they felt that way or because as offensive and it's kind of alien as that may seem to you and me and a lot of people, they just thought it was funny or they thought that it made them seem kind of sophisticated or cool. The overtones, as it was described to us by these members of the group was very like, alt-right, it leaned conservative, but not in a political way, and they were all quite religious.

I think this is just an element of them being really sensitive now too, now that they're exposed to the world what they look like and how the world is going to interpret that, and fairly, frankly, in some cases. I mean, if you're sharing racist and anti-Semitic jokes all the time, you know, maybe it's because you harbor racist and anti-Semitic views, but that doesn't appear to have anything to do with the motivation as far as we can tell for why Jack Teixeira shared this information with these people in this room.",

And my impression from talking to two of them was that they didn't even really understand -- they didn't deeply understand the real-world implications of this information that they were seeing and it getting out. And I just got the feeling that this was kind of a story that was very of the moment that these disaffected and very impressionable kids isolated by the pandemic were around this older person who was, you know, persuading them of certain things and in some ways, holding them in thrall to him. We see -- it was -- you know, it was kind of a spooky kind of atmosphere that spoke to, you know, the control that it seemed like he had over these young people.",
