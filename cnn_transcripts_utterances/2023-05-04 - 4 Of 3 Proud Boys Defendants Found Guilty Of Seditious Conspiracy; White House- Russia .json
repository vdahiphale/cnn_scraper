Of course, he did not storm the Capitol. He did not break a window there. He did not assault a police officer. The focus has been on whether he encouraged the crowd, incited the crowd to do so. I know that there were freedom of expression barriers to charging someone. But you have folks here among hundreds, right, who have now been convicted of criminal acts. In this case conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding. Do you see -- do you learn anything from these convictions as regards the president's legal jeopardy and the chances that he might be charged for his involvement?",

      "sentences": "Well, a couple things. I mean, first of all, Jim, whenever a defendant is sentenced, one thing that they consider are all of the nature and circumstances of their offense, and all of the history and characteristics of the defendant. That's by law what a federal judge is required to consider.So, I suspect that this will raise the stakes for the former president. Because ultimately a judge looking at a potential punishment in a case involving Donald Trump is going to consider these types of sentences that have been imposed in other cases and is going to be considering the impact that Trump had on our democracy. And the impact that he had, for example, in inciting this attack on the Capitol. Even if that isn't charged, in other words, even if Trump is ultimately convicted of something like classified documents in Mar-a- Lago, if that ends up happening, I do think a judge is going to consider this activity as well. And ultimately is going to be considering whether or not a sentence for something else, you know, potentially is commensurate with the activity that the full breadth of the activity that he's undertaken. So, I do think it will have an impact. Whether it impacts the January 6th investigation itself is yet to be determined. I think a focus there is going to be much more on what Mike -- that Trump was trying to get Mike Pence to do inside the United States Senate to obstruct, you know, that proceeding to potentially put forward false documents, false electors, things along those lines.",

The Kremlin claiming without showing any evidence that the U.S. orchestrated the drone incident that left Moscow's Senate palace damaged. The White House calls that ridiculous and a lie, but Russia is vowing revenge. As we've seen so often in this war, it's Ukrainian civilians who are the ones to pay.Overnight Vladimir Putin released some of the worst strikes that Ukraine has seen in months. CNN's Natasha Bertrand is live for us at the Pentagon. Natasha, it's interesting talking to officials. They do not know who is responsible, but what is clear is that they are saying that Vladimir Putin is very wrong about who he is claiming is responsible for this drone incident.",

We're doing the best we can to try to find out what happened.Let's not lose the bigger picture here. It's not like Mr. Putin has to invent new reasons to kill innocent Ukrainians. He keeps doing it over and over and over again. Now, whether he's going to use this as some sort of pretext is up to him. But just in the last 24 hours, you know, he's bombing shoppers at a supermarket. So, the violence just continues one way or the other. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

They have accused Ukraine of being at the whim of the United States really every step of the way in this conflict with Russia claiming that it's really the U.S. pulling all of the strings in the war. Something that the U.S. of course has categorically denied. Saying that they are supporting Ukraine, of course, providing military equipment, but they have actually explicitly told Ukraine not to attack inside Russia. And that is a big reason why they have not given the Ukrainians the kind of long-range missiles they have been asking for, for well over a year now -- Brianna.",

And so, as we've seen this rapid improvement in AI technology over the last year, it's increasingly blurring the lines between what is AI-generated and what is generated by people. Whether it's text or video or audio.Earlier this month the RNC released an ad that they claimed was their first 100 percent AI-generated ad. It painted this dystopian picture of if Joe Biden were to be reelected president in 2024. Those photos in the ad were entirely generated with AI. Now, to be fair, the RNC declared that the ad in a press release, on YouTube and in the ad itself, said that it was AI generated. That, however, won't always be the case. Look no further than an English channel that appeared on YouTube called \"House of News\" that was broadcasting Venezuelan propaganda. The reality is that anchor that you see right there is completely AI generated. The face, the voice, Synthesia, the company who offers the product there. So, we're seeing how AI can be used by political actors to create images that were not -- that are not real.",

And in his own words said that he was, quote, raising him as a son. CNN legal analyst Norm Eisen here with us now. When you look at this, Norm, how bad is this? NORM EISEN, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: Brianna, it's bad. Even if it didn't come on top of all of these other allegations about Justice Thomas' conflicts, it would raise an eyebrow. But here the latest revelation that thousands of dollars in what I believe were essentially gifts to Justice Thomas who would have otherwise had to pay the tuition for this young man or gifts to a dependent, either way you look at it, it had to be disclosed under federal law.
