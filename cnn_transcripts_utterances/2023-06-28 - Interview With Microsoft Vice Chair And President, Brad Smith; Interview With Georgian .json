As the Kremlin struggles to contain the fallout from Saturday's aborted uprising, Russia continues its brutal aerial assault on Ukrainian civilians. Russian missile struck a pizza restaurant in the heart of Kramatorsk in the east, killing at least 11 people, including these 14- year-old twin sisters celebrating the end of the school year at war. And while the U.S. government is keeping its distance from the thwarted rebellion in Russia, President Joe Biden says Putin has absolutely been weakened. Correspondent Ben Wedeman is on the ground there, in Eastern Ukraine. And he's joining me now. Ben, the scenes that we saw, and from your reporting, are just horrible and brings it right back home. What is happening there, you know, now? I know you've just left the actual scene. What is going on there?",

Keep in mind, it's a massive concrete slab sort of fell on where the strike took place. So, it's a lot of work. They brought in heavy equipment. But while we were there, we did see rescue workers bringing out a black body bag, loading it into a van. And right there were friends and families sobbing watching this happen. And there are more people simply waiting to find out news of relatives they haven't heard from. We spoke to people who had worked in the restaurant, and they said that there are still people that are unaccounted for. By the looks of it, it looks like the missile actually hit the kitchen, and that's why so many of the restaurant workers were either wounded, killed, or are still missing at the moment. So, it's a huge amount of work. They're doing what they can. But also, the problem is that every once in a while, their work is interrupted by air raid sirens. Last night, when we were on this site, everybody was suddenly rushed away from the scene of this strike because the fear was that there was going to be a so-called double tap, where the Russians will strike a location, and then we wait until first responders come, residents come to look and then strike again. So, it is a very difficult task for this city, Christiane.",

So, I -- when I saw that, I didn't -- I wasn't convinced. And in fact, it turns out it's Iskander missile. That is a hypersonic ballistic missile that -- because it is hypersonic, it's very hard for radar to pick up, it's very hard for air defenses to take down and it has a much bigger payload and it is much more precise, which one has to wonder, was this location specifically targeted? Now, Ukrainian intelligence has arrested a man they say was casing out the restaurant, had taken video and sent it to GRU, Russian intelligence. We don't know what more information they've received from him or gotten out of them. But, yes, this does look like it is perhaps a deliberate choice of target. Christiane.",

Artificial intelligence may open new fronts in cyber warfare, but it could also bring critical social benefits, and like other information companies, Microsoft stands to reap major profits from the fast-growing technology.

I think we have to remember through that the Russians also engage in very sophisticated cyber influence operations, putting out disinformation. They're among the most capable governments, unfortunately, in the world in doing that. And that is not confined to Ukraine.

They may use it to sort of target who they're aiming or directing it at. But we will use A.I. on the defensive side as well. And I think in some ways, A.I. will favor defense over offense because when you think about it, our great strength is data. We see all of this data coming into data centers. The challenge is to find the patterns in the data that show us where a new attack is taking place. A.I. can do that faster than humans can.

And so, in the same way, we need to build safety protocols, safety breaks, if you will, especially if A.I. is going to be used to control critical infrastructure, the water supply, the electrical grid. And so, what we're focused on, inside a company like Microsoft, is how we put in A.I. safety guardrails, the conversation with governments is, in effect, should you, as a company, need to get a license if A.I. is going to be used in a certain way?

As you know, last week he went over there,to the West Coast, to talk to all of you, I guess. I'm not sure what he said to you, but at the same, I was speaking to the former president, Barack Obama, in Greece. And he was speaking about this, because he, you know, works on democracy, and that means equality and, you know, helping all of those jobs and trying to figure out how not to have their jobs taken away. This is what he said about this, I'd love you to respond. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARACK OBAMA, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: This is a powerful technology and it's coming fast. And if it kind of goes into the wild, the way social media did, without us thinking through the consequences, we could have bigger problems with A.I. We will have bigger problems with A.I. National security problems, job displacement problems, misinformation problems that undermine our democracy. And so, yes, we're going to have to regulate it in an intelligent way. If harnessed correctly, you can have A.I. teachers that much more cheaply are delivering a very good education to people in remote areas. That's a powerful thing. And by the way, if you have villages where girls have trouble getting to school, but you can get them a device and they can learn on their own, that can break down barriers as well. So, that's the upside. The danger is that if it is weaponized, it can be a very powerful tool for mischief. But potential for people who are in jobs that can be done remotely to be replaced entirely by machines, I think that is something that's going to happen fairly quickly. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

In August 2008, Russia invaded Georgia, seized control of twoprovinces there and then, illegally recognized their independents. It was Europe's first 21st century war. Critics say a muted reaction by western powers may have egged on Putin's aggressive expansionism, including of course now in Ukraine. Now, Georgia, much like Ukraine, or even Moldova, must navigate very rocky shorelines, seeking entry to western institutions like the E.U. or NATO while also trying not to provoke the Russian bear on their doorstep. Georgian president, Salome Zourabichvili, joins me now from the capital, Tbilisi. Welcome, Madam President, to the program. Can I first start by asking you, just to give us your analysis of what you must have been watching very closely on your border what happened in Russia over the weekend?

In our case, at this stage, I do not think that there is military stress. First of all, because we have a military occupation that is ongoing since 2008, and earlier under a different form since 1991. So, two regions are occupied with military bases of Russia. So, to say that we are fearing with a military occupation would be much. But I think that what is happening, and what could happen even more, is that Russia is testing today the resolve and testing what I call a second in front of soft power, which is propaganda, which is through these Russians that have come to Georgia, that I will repeat, need to be controlled. We cannot just let what -- or amount of Russians come to the territory of Georgia without knowing who they are. Vast majority, as you mentioned, are people that are fleeing today's Russia. So, not really pro Putin population. But when -- at the same time, we know the threats that are used by Russia saying that Russian-speaking people, if they are not protected correctly, that can be a subject and a reason for support and intervention by Russia.

But today, probably, the E.U. pass seems closer because Ukraine has, in fact, accelerated for the sweet trio associates and for others, probably, the Balkans, has accelerated the task towards European integration. In terms of NATO, it's probably more the center will be -- especially at the next summit, it will be Ukraine, we all know that, and it will be security guarantees for Ukraine. Of what type, I don't know. And that's normal. That is what the Ukraine deserves today. So, there is no -- there - - any form of competition in any way. Any advancement of Ukraine will in the end benefits Georgia. But E.U. is a very -- at a turning point. Georgia needs to get candidate status at the end of the year. We have been given the perspective which, for Georgia, was very important because that meant that geography is no longer an argument to be opposed to Georgia, which it was for many years. The next stage is to get the candidate status. And in this soft war that we have with Russia, of soft policies, soft power, I think the E.U. cannot afford any strategic decision to lose Georgia, to have the Georgian population disappointed again and to give, in that sense, an easy place to play to -- for Russia.
