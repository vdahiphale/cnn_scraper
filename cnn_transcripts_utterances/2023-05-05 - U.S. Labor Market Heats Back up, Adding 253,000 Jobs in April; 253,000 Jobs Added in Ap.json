He was seeing a couple of things on the field. And so at some point, the umpire tells the kid, look, really you should tone things down, you're being disruptive.And the two of them, they go back and forth. It's at some point after that, that according to the Sheriff 41-year-old Jorge Gonzalez, as you sees in that piece of surveillance video, walks up to the umpire and hits him, knocks him out cold. Apparently, this is not the first time that Mr. Gonzalez has been disruptive at a baseball game that at least according to the Sheriff he's apparently had issues at other games. The Sheriff also talked about the fact that that console is he apparently showed zero remorse about what happened in the video. You can see him just walking off shortly after that incident.

And you can see that in the kinds of sectors that we've been watching there. There was a Gallup poll, though, that showed almost half of Americans are worried about their money. And I think that's kind of interesting. That's because of the bank, you know, the bank crisis, and that I'm not going to call it a crisis, but banks stress that we've seen. And so people say they're not feeling very, you know, very competent, or things but they keep spending their money and there is still broadly hiring. I mean, I was looking at the 2019 numbers before I came out here. There were maybe it was one or two months in 2019 that saw a month like this, you know, and that was considered a strong economy. So this is still a strong, resilient labor market and wages up 4.4 percent that was stronger. Now, that's bad, right from the Fed point of view, because they would like to see a cooling off of wages.
