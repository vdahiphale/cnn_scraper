CNN has learned that Trump is in panic mode as the bond posting deadline nears and the potential seizure of his assets could be just days away.Also tonight, an appeals court could rule at any time on the fate of a controversial Texas immigration law after putting it back on hold only hours after the U.S. Supreme Court gave it a green light. I'll ask the mayor of El Paso about the on again, off again law and the confusion right now over at the southern border. And CNN is on the trail in deep red Alabama where the fight over reproductive rights is figuring into an unusually competitive special house selection and giving national Democrats hope for the party's chances in November. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. Our top story tonight, the countdown to Donald Trump's Monday deadline to post a bond of at least $464 million dollars in the New York civil fraud case. The state attorney general and Trump's lawyers, they are clashing as time is running out for Trump to prevent his prized properties and other assets from being seized. CNN Senior Justice Correspondent Evan Perez is following all of this for us. Evan, what is the New York Attorney General's Office saying about Trump's claim he can't come up with the money for the bond?",

They say that his claim that 30 underwriting companies, insurance companies have turned down the former president for his efforts to try to post this $464 million bond, they say that that's not believable.They also said that the Trump team has not actually presented any documentary proof that this is the case. They also called into question the expert, the underwriting, the insurance expert that provided some testimony, saying that the Trump team's efforts to do this was practically impossible. They say that, at a minimum, if the Trump team cannot come up with a bond, that they could also turn over the Trump properties to the custody of the court to satisfy this bond. Now, we did get a response from the Trump legal team, and here's part of what they said. They said the attorney general's latest filing demonstrates her continued willingness to misrepresent the facts and misconstrue applicable law in her political crusade against President Trump. Today's missive does not even bother to cite New York case law. Wolf, as you pointed out, this deadline is fast approaching. It's next week. And so now we will see whether the judge was buying the Trump claims that they cannot come up with any way to satisfy this bond. Wolf?",

But they are in a position right now where they have not found anyone to underwrite that bond and to back it up.They contacted all of those insurance giants that Brian was noting there. Trump had been counting on one in particular to come through, that is Chubb, that is the one that underwrote the bond that he had to post to about $90 million in the E. Jean Carroll case not too long ago. That was something that came through at the 11th hour, I should note. And Trump had kind of been under this belief that that was going to come through for this one as well. But the problem here is that, really, the collateral that they had to offer was real estate, and that is not something they say in this, in this, what they filed to the attorney general, what to the court here, that they believe that many of these companies wanted to take them up on. And so, really, the question is right now, what are they going to do? And that is what we're hearing about this sense of panic in Trump's world is because it is a real predicament where he is only days away from a potential financial crisis here and having to confront that, and yet they still do not have a solution here. Now, I will note this is Donald Trump. The E. Jean Carroll thing, he came out at the 11th hour with a solution there. People in his orbit still believe that that could be an option here. But in the sense of what they're doing, Wolf, they're reaching out to wealthy supporters to see if that's an option here. They are looking at properties that they could sell and which ones they could sell quickly. That is something that is proving to be more complicated than they initially believed. And so it's still really an open question of what is going to happen over the next several days before that Monday deadline.",

I mean, that is kind of also what's at the heart of this case, what Tish James and her team had accused Trump of, which was overinflating his asset to get better terms when it came to those loan agreements.And now that's essentially what we're seeing happen here, where in her response today she's saying they don't actually know the true value of these real estate assets that Trump could put up as collateral if that was an option, because as they argued, he overinflated them. And that's something that we saw as multiple witnesses came to the stand to testify about what the actual number is, the square footage of certain Trump properties were. And I think it speaks to the heart of who he is. And so the idea that come Monday, it's an open question of how the attorney general would handle this. She said back in February that she would be prepared to seize those assets. And I should note, we're in a 30-day grace period right now, actually, because she could have started to move as soon as the judge made his ruling here, but instead there was that 30 day grace period. I will say one option here, Wolf, that is still on the table, and we don't know what's going to happen here, is that Trump is trying to get this appealed and say that, essentially, he'd either like to not have to pay this until his appeal makes its way to the courts or he wants it to be $100 million.

There are all sorts of things that have happen before you can technically seize a property. So, nothing really that we can see will be happening on Monday.

If they haven't called to the vote, then that would mean obviously that they haven't proven that, which is why it would continue.But it's never going to happen, Wolf. They know they don't have the votes. They're unfortunately just, you know, giving, red meat to their base on this, and they are not being truthful. They don' t even have to votes. Republicans here, a number of them, don t want to vote for impeachment. And they only have a two-vote majority. And so now they're inviting Joe Biden, more political theater, which is why I wore the mask, because if I'm going to be in theater, I might as well dress up. And, so, you know, it's just a shame that this is what we're wasting taxpayer money on, rather than solving the problems with Ukraine and Israel, rather than trying to help the American people bring down the cost of living. This is the 118th Congress has decided to spend their time on after, of course, they've removed their speaker and impeached the cabinet secretary.

But, yes, look, Congress should look at that on a bipartisan basis, the revolving door, all of that stuff. The American people want to see us do that on passing an ethics package. But that's not the purpose of what Comer is doing. That's not the purpose at all. I don't want anyone to pretend like, oh, now there's going to be some legitimate policy that comes out of this. They're not. They are going do this all the way up into the election. It's trying to affect Joe Biden's poll numbers by prosecuting Hunter Biden in the court of public opinion, but they're never going to impeach Joe. Biden. Don't have the evidence on Joe because Joe did nothing wrong and even Republicans here -- I mean, look, Ken Buck, in his resignation, said the speaker can't convince him to stay and vote for an unconstitutional impeachment.
