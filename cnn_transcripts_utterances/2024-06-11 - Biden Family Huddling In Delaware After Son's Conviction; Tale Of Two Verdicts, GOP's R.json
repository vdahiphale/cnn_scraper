Tonight, President Biden and his family are huddling together in Delaware after a jury convicted his surviving son on all three federal gun charges. It is the first time in American history that an immediate family member of a sitting U.S. president was convicted of a crime. Now, the moment, of course, creates the split screen of conservatives, who, just 12 days ago, were slamming the rule of law, slamming the judge, the jury and the verdict in Donald Trump's Manhattan trial. Some even claim the conviction was the end of the Republicans, as we know it. But tonight, they seem to be singing from a completely different tune. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Do you think that that is going to work in this situation? S.E. CUPP, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: I think everyone can relate to some parts of this. I don't find Hunter Biden to be a terribly sympathetic figure. Not because of his addiction, but because he's messed up a lot. He's broken the law. And I don't think he's been a great family man. But at the end of the day, this is someone's son that someone happens to be the president. And for the president to say, I'm not putting my finger on the scale for this one, I don't even want to talk about it, I can't imagine how you do that.

Let's look for the Republicans. There's at least one. Thomas Massie, I saw him do this in Congress today, say this is ridiculous. We shouldn't be convicting someone and sentencing him to up to 25 years in prison for doing one thing. He lied on an application. There's no victim in this crime. There's no victim in Trump's crime either, right? So, we have a sickness in the criminal justice system in this country. We have so many people in jail. We have so many victimless crimes. You know, Harvey Silverglate, the great civil libertarian writer, has had a book called Three Felonies a Day. That's the average that us very law abiding citizens on this panel commit every day because there's so much in the criminal code, right? So, that puts everything up to the discretion of prosecutors.

The World Bank says that the U.S. economy is growing faster than expected and is helping the entire world. The FBI reporting that violent crime in America has shown historic declines with the murder rate showing the sharpest drop. They also come as a group of House Democrats are now launching a counter to the infamous Project 2025 put forward by conservatives. That's the Heritage Foundation's plan for a second Trump term, which proposes eliminating, for example, the Justice Department, the Homeland Security Department, and the FBI. Now, even though it's only June, if Democrats, for example, are dealt a good hand politically, the question is, are they capable of actually playing it? I mean, this is the big question.

Secondly, you can't talk about Christianity and not be concerned about the poor.The first sermon that Jesus preached, he said, you must preach good news to the poor. And Jesus was crucified for standing with the poor. He was crucified for lifting those who are on the margin. That is not in any way comparison to what Trump is doing. But more importantly, most of those folk that she's talking about are not the poor. Poor and low-wage folk. This is a moment in history that we say we can no longer allow an American crisis to be marginalized or treated like an anomaly. And that's what this book is about. And it's about the stories of folk from Appalachia and folk from East Kentucky that cannot be denied or dismissed.",
