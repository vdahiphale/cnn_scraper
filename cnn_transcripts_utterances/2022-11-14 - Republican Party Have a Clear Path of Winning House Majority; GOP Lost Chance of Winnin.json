However, Republicans are closing in. They picked up another seat Sunday night. They've won 212, compared to the Democrats 204. And they are closed the 218 seats needed for a majority, with 19 races still to be called. Current House Speaker Nancy Pelosi wouldn't speculate on whether she would seek another term as leader. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NANCY PELOSI (D), U.S. SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:  My decision is going to be rooted in what the wishes of my family and the wishes of my caucus. But none of it will be very much considered until we see what the outcome of all of this is. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

What do we stand for? What are we held bent to get done? What, you know, there's no plan to do that. The leadership and the Republican Senate says, no, you cannot have a plan.

      "sentences": "Right. I think he really wants to set some parameters for this relationship. As you said, it has deteriorated rapidly even over the last several months, and President Biden wants to get in the same room with President Xi, look him in the eye, and sort of set some red lines so that this tension, this competition doesn't tip over into conflict, and that's what the president hopes to achieve when he sits down with President Xi today.White House officials have been fairly frank that they don't expect any so-called deliverables to come out of this meeting. For example, there won't be a joint statement afterward that ticks through areas of cooperation, that talks about things that they have accomplished in the meeting. Instead, how the White House describes it as they want to build a floor. Essentially, they want to prevent this meeting from deteriorating any further. They have been working to, to set it up since July. Of course, a month after that, the House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan setting off this furor in Beijing. China cut off most channels of communication with the United States after that, but U.S. and Chinese officials were able to continue talking about setting up this meeting. American officials said earlier today that those talks were serious. They were constructive. They continued through the fall. They even continued until late last night as officials were still going over some of the agenda for this meeting. Items they wanted to emphasize, items they wanted to deemphasize. And so, when President Biden walks into that meeting with Xi later today he really does know what he wants to get out of him. His expectations are limited, but he does have an idea of what he wants to talk about. Of course, that includes the issue of Taiwan. It includes the issue of the economy of what the U.S. calls unfair, trade practices by China. But it also has this whole set of issues that the U.S. wants to cooperate on, and you always about climate change. And of course, North Korea. The president will want to talk to Xi about how to use his influence in Pyongyang to try and convince the leader there, Kim Jong-un, to back away from a nuclear program. Now, I do think it's significant to note that this meeting is taking place in Bali, here in neutral ground on the sidelines of an international summit. It wasn't that long ago that it was fairly common for an American president to go to Beijing for the Chinese president to come to the White House. I've covered several of those meetings now. Now it's almost unimaginable for that to happen now. So, they do have to meet sort of in a neutral, neutral zone. White House officials, Chinese officials long ago identified this particular summit as the best place for that to happen. Now, in addition to this being their first face to face meeting since Biden took office, it's also one of the first times that President Xi has left China since the COVID pandemic and how American officials view that as is he's ready to go back out kind of into the foreign stage really enhance foreign relations in China. And they do think that this is a good opportunity to talk to him at the front end of that as he begins to engage more on the world stage in an interpersonal way over the next, several months.

      "sentences": "Well, Rosemary, I think Xi Jinping wants time. Time for China to achieve self-reliance in key technologies to upgrade its economy, but more crucially to upgrade its military to catch up with the U.S. Obviously Xi can afford to play the long game having just assumed that precedent breaking third term, paving the way for him to rule for life.Now, that is one reason probably we have seen him offering a slightly more conciliatory tone in the past few days. For example, telling a U.S. business lobby group that he's willing to work with the U.S. to find ways to cooperate. There have also been signs of possible tweaks in China's position on Ukraine, for example, with Xi Jinping telling the visiting German chancellor that Beijing opposes the threat or the use of nuclear weapons, which is seen as a subtle rebuke to Mr. Putin given the Russian leaders nuclear posturing. So, all of this is really why, Chinese state media as well as officials echoing American officials saying the meeting itself is a positive sign, stressing the importance of keeping lines of communication open at the highest level, especially when tensions are running high. But the problem here, of course, the relationship is in a free fall, not because of the lack of a rapport between the two leaders who have known each other for years. It is really because how each side views its own strengths and the other side's intentions. Now Washington, of course, has been increasingly vocal about China under Xi Jinping becoming more authoritarian at home and more aggressive abroad. But from China's perspective, the U.S. government under Biden has been really doubling down on its effort to build this empty China coalition to contain its rise on the global stage. Not only has Mr. Biden kept most Trump era tariffs on Chinese imports, he's been ramping upon restrictions in terms of export controls. Not to mention Mr. Biden, saying more than once of the U.S. commitment to defending Taiwan military. So, all of this is really why Xi Jinping has really shifting the country's -- the party's top priority from economic growth to national security. So that's why stakes are so high in this meeting, despite the very low bar of ex -- of expectations set by both sides. Rosemary?",

And so, President Biden actually goes into this meeting stronger than not only most Americans expected, but that the Chinese expected. And that may give him a little bit more credibility in his conversation with Xi Jinping on a range of issues. I think the Chinese have been wondering, you know, can they make a deal not only with this president, but looking ahead whether it's this president or others, what is the credibility of the U.S. government long term? And coming in with a stronger domestic political hand will give the president an ability perhaps, to reach further into the future than otherwise might be the case.

Normally, in midterms, the president's party does poorly, but in this midterm, we saw the Democratic Party have a net gain of gubernatorial seats, not lose any Senate seats, and they may, in fact, gain one, and a net loss looks like right now of less than 10 House seats. The last time that happened in a midterm election, 1934.So, how did Democrats pull this off? Well, despite high inflation, the issue of abortion was also on the minds of voters. In fact, a look at our exit polls show that about as many voters said that abortion was important to their vote as inflation. And those abortion first voters, they voted overwhelmingly democratic. And, of course, Joe Biden's popularity had sunk considerably over the course of his presidency, and indeed, our exit polls showed that only about 41% of voters had a favorable view of Joe Biden. But when you also ask them whether or not they had a favorable view of Donald Trump, Trump's favorable rating was right around the same level. Indeed, there was a solid portion, just a little bit less than 20% of the electorate, that did not have a favorable view of either Donald Trump or Joe Biden. And those voters who you might have expected to go overwhelmingly for the Republicans because Joe Biden is the president of the United States, in fact, basically split their tickets fairly equally, only slightly going for Republican candidates. Of course, it's not just about Biden and Trump. It's also the fact that there were a lot of candidates running for the United States Senate who in the minds of the voters were extreme. Indeed, in pretty much all of the key battleground Senate races, more voters said that the Republican candidate was too extreme than said that the Democratic candidate was too extreme. Lastly, in the governor's races, there are a lot of Republicans running who denied that Joe Biden legitimately won the 2020 election which, of course, he did. All of those candidates who were running in either swing states or in blue states currently with GOP governors are either trailing or lost. The only one who is currently trailing who CNN has not been able to project as a loser yet is Kari Lake in the state of Arizona who right now is trailing. Back to you. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Among them, a six-year-old boy in Mariupol who lost his parents to shelling in the first week of the invasion. Thankfully, the boy eventually found a new home in Kyiv with a loving couple that now plans to adopt in. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz has the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN REPORTER (voice-over):  Like any six-year-old child, Elias's (ph) energy is endless. He wants constant attention and entertainment. He craves affection from the two people who care for him most. Now we have that love, they tell me. That love that makes you a family. We did not have this baby, but our love is real. Maria and Vladimir (ph) are Elias's (ph) legal guardians. They have been a little family for more than six months. The couple planned to formally adopt him and become parents to a child orphaned by this war. The pair was forced to flee their home in the east for Kyiv because of shelling, but refused to give up on their dream of starting a family. (On camera):  This was such a difficult decision, to adopt during a war. Did you hesitate? Did you think maybe this is not the right time? (Voice-over):  We had been planning to adopt for many years, he says. The war pushed us to make it happen sooner. Now, we wonder, why did we ever wait? Elias's (ph) mom was killed in Mariupol, his birthplace. She left home to find food and was struck down by shelling in the first week of war. Unaware of his wife's fate, Elias's father went looking for her the next day, only to lose his life, too. Elias (ph) was left with neighbors, where he sheltered with strangers for weeks in a cold, dark basement. When they ran out of food, Elias (ph) says, he started to eat his toys. The newfound parents are trying to give Elias (ph) sense of security. UNKNOWN (voice-over):  Hello. UNKNOWN (voice-over):  Hi. ABDELAZIZ (voice-over):  When we visit their home in Kyiv, we see why that is a challenge. Blackouts caused by Russia strikes on the power grid leave the family without electricity for hours. Sometimes, he gets scared, she says. He is hysterical and he will tell me it is like being back in Mariupol, in the basement, in the darkness. During the outages, the young family try to make things normal, playing games, watching movies, anything to ease Elias's (ph) worried mind. (On camera):  Do you get afraid in the dark, Elias (ph)? (Voice-over):  Not anymore, he says. I know the lights will come back on. And they do. During our interview, electricity is restored, and Elias (ph) runs to switch on the lights, ready to play again. But first, he wants to put on his Spiderman costume. He says it makes him feel strong and brave. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
