The country's National Electoral Council, which is controlled by the government, says Maduro won more than 51 percent of the vote. However, the leader of Venezuela's main opposition coalition is rejecting the official results. U.S. President Joe Biden will travel to Houston, Texas later today to pay his respects to Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, who died from cancer earlier this month. He will also visit the LBJ Presidential Library in Austin during the trip. And significant rainfall this weekend helped firefighters in Alberta, Canada, make progress on the wildfires burning in the province. Canada's Parks Agency says the fire burning in Jasper National Park is the largest in the area for more than 100 years.",

The question is escalate by how much, meaning in terms of scope, geographical scope, of firepower used or ammunition, and duration. Now, you would think that, and here's where this vicious circle comes into play, you would think that Israel has to respond. By responding, it sort of escalates, but not too much. But then Hezbollah has to respond to Israel's response. That's an escalation too. So before you know it, we're in a spiral of escalation, and I think this is going to happen in the next few days.",

Now, I do not see these Rome talks leading to a ceasefire. Mr. Netanyahu is not interested in a ceasefire because that's a 42-day ceasefire, according to phase one of the plan that everyone knows about, a partial exchange of hostages for Palestinian terrorists, and a realignment, not to say withdrawal of Israeli forces inside Gaza. He is patently not interested in that. And by a virtue of escalation in the north, that will further diminish the chances of a ceasefire. That's exactly what the state of Gaza, that's exactly what the connecting vessels are all about. So I don't -- I'm sorry I'm not too optimistic about that, but I just don't see this being resolved in the next few days.",

On the 13th and 14th of April, just three months ago, three and a half months ago, Israel and Iran exchanged missile salvos after Israel assassinated several Hezbollah officials in the Iranian embassy annex in Damascus, Syria. And everyone was talking, rightly so, about the possibility of an expansion or escalation, a geographical escalation, and it did happen, but it was contained.What may happen now is that you have a war in Gaza that's going on, even though the intensity has decreased, but you still have a war in Gaza. You're going to have a mini-war or some kind of serious exchanges of fire with Hezbollah, but then if Iran gets involved and the Houthis in Gaza, you're going to have a mini-war or some kind of serious exchanges of fire with Hezbollah. But then if Iran gets involved and the Houthis in Yemen get involved by firing at maritime traffic from the Red Sea towards the Suez Canal, as they have done before, then you're right. Then we're talking about a regional war, which brings us back to our original point in our conversation here, and that is the question is how massive the Israeli retaliation is going to be and then what Hezbollah is going to do in response. If Hezbollah says, OK, the rules of the game have not been broken, the so-called invisible implicit red lines have not been crossed, so our response is going to be minor, maybe. But they may do something else, and before you know it, everything is going to spiral out of control and you do have a regional war.",

Specifically, the U.S. forces in Japan will be reconstituted as a joint force headquarters.Now, what this really means is that both countries will be able to better communicate and better coordinate any security threats or any addresses to security threats in the Indo-Pacific region. And we know that the U.S. Secretary of Defense, Lloyd Austin, has described this upgrade as the most significant improvement to military ties in the last 70 years. The U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken also praised the U.S.-Japan alliance and discussed its importance to the U.S.'s foreign policy. Here's what Blinken had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: For over 70 years, the United States-Japan alliance has been the cornerstone for peace, for stability in the Indo-Pacific and now beyond. And it's helping make our own people more free, more secure, more prosperous. (END VIDEO CLIP) MONTGOMERY: Now today, Japan also hosted a meeting for the Quad, which is specifically the foreign ministers from India, Australia, Japan, and the United States. And during this meeting, the Quad described their support for ceasefire proposals in the Middle East and also described their grave concerns over China's growing military assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific region, specifically in the South China Sea. They released a joint statement, in fact, today, where they pledged to bolster their maritime security to address these concerns. But for some Asian countries, this isn't the only issue that they are worried about. They're also very closely watching the outcome of the U.S. presidential election because, as we know, the former U.S. President Donald Trump has previously toyed with the idea of pulling out U.S. troops from Asia. And he's also questioned the cost of some of these Asian alliances. But over this weekend, the U.S. Secretary of State, Blinken, tried to assuage those fears and stated how the U.S. remains steadfast in its commitment to this region and said that no matter the outcome of the U.S. presidential election, would continue to work on and develop the regional relationships between the U.S. and its Asian allies -- Max.",
