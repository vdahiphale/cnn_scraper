The Pentagon says these facilities house the type of weapons, the missiles, the advance components that have been used to target not only US navy warships in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, but also commercial vessels that have repeatedly come under fire including last week when the Houthis hit an American oil tanker with ballistic missiles. The Houthis have also shot down and claimed to have shot down multimillion-dollar US drones that have operated over Yemen. The Pentagon and the US have made clear that if these attacks continue and it certainly looks like they're going to, the US will respond and you see part of that response here with B-2 bombers and other military assets taking part in this strike. It is very clearly a message anytime the US uses a bomber like this and talks about it openly, not just to the Houthis, but in this case, it also seems like it is targeted very much at Iran. In a statement, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said afterwards that this shows \"That the US can reach anything that our adversaries seek to keep out of reach, no matter how deeply buried underground hardened, or fortified.\" Kate, that certainly sounds like a message to Iran whose own nuclear facilities match that exact description of underground fortified facilities.
