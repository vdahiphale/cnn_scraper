So we have some video, I think you played it of Michael walking into the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, just the building over my shoulder, where he's meeting with prosecutors for the first time in more than a year.Now, Cohen said that he could not comment on what the topics that they would be discussing would be but he might have more to say when he is leaving. But this is the first time Cohen has been in since this investigation has been led by the Manhattan District Attorney, Alvin Bragg. He'd previously been in to meet with investigators 13 times over the previous years as this investigation evolved from the hush money payments and became one that was looking at the accuracy of the Trump Organization's financial statements. Now, sources tell me that the investigators have refocused back to the hush money payments. Of course, Michael Cohen was central to that. He helped facilitate those payments. Those are the payments that were made to Stormy Daniels, so she wouldn't go public with an alleged affair with former President Donald Trump just before the 2016 election. Trump has denied that affair. Now, another source tells me that prosecutors have reached out in recent weeks to another attorney, Keith Davidson, who was involved. He represented Stormy Daniels in the hush money payments. So these are two indications that prosecutors are starting to pick up the pace of this investigation and when I spoke with Alvin Bragg, the DA, last Friday after this Trump Organization was sentenced on the tax fraud charges, he said that that closed one chapter and the next chapter was now beginning. And I think we're starting to see the fruits of that with Cohen coming into the DA's office today this afternoon just a few moments ago to sit for another interview. And this, of course, under the investigation led by the DA, Alvin Bragg, who's been in office for about a year. Alisyn? Victor?",

That includes the House Judiciary Committee, which is where impeachment articles would originate.In fact, a GOP source told me that there could be a hearing as early as later this month or early February. So that's something to look out for very soon. Then there's also House Homeland Security Committee, that has jurisdiction over the border and the Chairman there told me he has a five-phased plan to look into these issues at the southern border. And finally, the House Oversight Committee whose Chairman, James Comer told me that he believes Mayorkas is a prime candidate for impeachment. So clearly, this is not just isolated to the fringe wing of the GOP. It is something that is gaining steam more widely in the conference. And even speaker Kevin McCarthy is leaving the door open to potential impeachment proceedings. Take a listen to what he told reporters a little bit ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): We can investigate and then that investigation could lead to an impeachment inquiry. I don't predetermine, because I'll never use impeachment for political purposes. But if the person is a derelict in their duties, and they're harming Americans and Americans are actually dying by the lack of their work, that could rise to that occasion. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And as you may recall, Gosar and Greene were kicked off of their committees in the last Congress, because of incendiary remarks. And both of them, we should point out, spoke at a white nationalist conference last year. But Kevin McCarthy in part of his bid to become speaker promised to restore both of them to committee assignments, and now he's making good on that promise. One other member that he's promised to give committee assignments to is George Santos, the embattled freshman member who admitted to lying about his resume.

I also think it's part of the greater conversation, even though this is certainly being spun with all sorts of disinformation out there, and which is unfortunate.

As you know, he was already in state custody facing charges of misleading police in their investigation. He pleaded not guilty to that during another arraignment last week. Investigators had a number of great deal of circumstantial evidence in this particular case that we saw that they released evidence of a hacksaw that was found at a trash facility in North Boston, in addition to that bloody material found at that trash facility, blood on the basement floor, a knife found as well. In addition to some of the very highly suspicious statements and things that Brian Walshe had done, following the disappearance of his wife, that internet search, where he allegedly searched for information and on how to dispose of a 115-pound body and how to dismember a body. The prosecution has also told us that at this point, the DA's office says that they expect more information about this case to be released during his arraignment whenever that in fact does happen. We were waiting for information about test results on some of the items that were found, for example on that hacksaw. But the big question here is why, what is the motive for this. And, perhaps, during this arraignment, we'll get some sense of why he allegedly did that.

And last week they were - there was a deluge of testimony but mostly from investigators saying, this is what we found in the basement. There was a bloody knife. There was evidence of blood there. We searched where the trash that we believe went from the home to a trash bin near where Brian Walshe's mother lived to transfer station in Peabody, Mass where we found more items with biological evidence and so on.So the grand jury had all that going into this holiday weekend. The last witness they were supposed to hear from was from the State Police Crime Lab. And that was the last witness to testify. So what that witness' job would have been would be to tell the grand jury the biological evidence doesn't match to the victim, that the evidence at the scene match to what was found at the transfer station, and to tie this whole thing together. Which, of course, is a pretty good sign that the circumstantial case led that grand jury to an indictment that allowed this arrest warrant.",
