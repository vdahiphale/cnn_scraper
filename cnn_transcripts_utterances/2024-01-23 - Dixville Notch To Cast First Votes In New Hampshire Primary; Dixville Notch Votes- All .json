So, six residents in this community, four Republicans, two independents, are going to make their way down here. And some of the town officials sitting, they also get up and vote, and then they sit back down. That's how small this community is.They're going to vote behind these American flags here, and then they're going to come out and then they're going to cast their ballots in that box here. And then, when it's all said and done, the votes will be written up on that whiteboard. And we are going to know how the first community in New Hampshire is feeling about these candidates here in the first-in-the-nation primary. So, it's all getting started right now, Laura. The first voter here about to cast his ballot. This is really an exciting process. This all started because the former owner of The Balsams Resort here, he wanted a way for the people in this community to be able to participate in this process, without having to drive nearly an hour away in the snow, in the winter. And so, that is why he made this possible, and he pushed for Dixville Notch to be incorporated so that people in this community could vote.",

He's there in New Hampshire right now campaigning, pounding the ground, meeting with these people, right? Social media hasn't killed that much.

And I think one of the things that we can pull, even though as an academic, we would say, this is statistically irrelevant, this is all coincident, this is the same chase as Groundhog's Day. There is something that we can pull beyond the kind of exercise of democracy, which is that sometimes the voters showcase startling surprises. We were talking during the break about how, one year, Michael Bloomberg won this contest. Bernie Sanders coming out first and surprising everyone.

And I think one of the things that we've seen over the past couple of weeks is that the number of Republican donors, Republican moderate donors and kind of independent donors who've been willing to contribute has actually gone up for Nikki Haley. And that's because they see some sliver, a possibility or pathway for her.Now, do I think it's there? No. But a lot of that rests on Trump being disqualified from certain states, or Trump's legal troubles catching up with him. And so, I think, again, this is part of this completely inconceivable, probably most likely won't happen. But it is, I think, valuable or at least the donors are putting some value in this.

You should maybe vote for me. He never said -- he never made a clear case. He never took on Trump in a meaningful way.And then, two, he was lacking in charm and an ability to connect.

You really do have to campaign like your life depends on it. You have to get out there and push and push and push. And I think one of the things we saw from DeSantis, see, he talks about himself.

And there's this resurgence that happens really over the course of the last 18 months -- 12 months that I think really centers around the indictments, the various indictments that he's facing.But even before that, Ron DeSantis is a cheap imitation of Donald Trump. And so, I think the Republican race that once Donald Trump or at least once Trumpism, they may actually want -- they may not want Donald Trump, but they may want Trumpism. They don't want an imitation. They don't want someone coming in in costume and pretending to be Donald Trump, because the only person that can be Donald Trump is Donald Trump. It looks very, very poor when someone steps in and tries to act as if that's their demeanor. The other thing I think that is deeply problematic is that as DeSantis started slipping in the polls, right, he has all this money. He starts mismanaging it. And there's a real, like, implosion within the campaign about what to do with that money, how to spend it, where to go, what to do. And the fact that there isn't really a vision tells us a lot more, I think, about his fitness, right, irrespective of the policy, but his fitness to actually run a successful presidential campaign.

But she's not in the clear yet, as she herself face the allegations that they had an affair. The Judge saying that he wants to hear Nathan Wade's testimony first, and also announcing that documents related to Wade's divorce will be unsealed.Joining me now, CNN Legal Analyst, Norm Eisen. Norm, I'm so glad you're here, because when you look at this issue, it's not a matter of whether there's been criminal conduct alleged, this is in the umbrella of ethical violations more broadly. You are the White House ethics Czar. What do you say?",

And the fact pattern here, including a consensual relationship between two prosecutors, has never been a basis for disqualification under Georgia law.I know of no case nationally where that has ever led to disqualification because the key test for disqualification is what prejudice is there to a defendant. Now, when you have a prosecutor who has a relationship with a witness, that's different. It goes to the evidence in the case. So I don't think they're going to be disqualified. That doesn't mean it's smart.",

Him and the team he's led under the DA's supervision, he's secured for guilty pleas from hardcore former Trump followers. He's been worth every penny. There's no issue there of quality. Nevertheless, this has become agigantic distraction from what is one of the most important criminal prosecutions alleged wrongdoing in American history.
