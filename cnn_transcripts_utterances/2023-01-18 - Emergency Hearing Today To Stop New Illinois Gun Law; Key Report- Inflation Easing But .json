As you had mentioned, there are members of law enforcement here in Illinois who are saying, point blank, they won't enforce the law. To which Governor Pritzker says there's nothing yet to enforce yet. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. J.B. PRITZKER (D-IL): It's a lot of political grandstanding by elected Republican sheriffs you're hearing from. The truth is there's nothing for them to enforce at this point. The fact is that, right now, we have one year for people to register the serial numbers of their assault weapons that are in existence. And of course, we've outlawed the purchase or sale of any of those types of weapons in Illinois going forward. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That sounds good, right? There's also this report where shows consumers are reining it in and spending less, which could be another sign that a recession is near. CNN's Rahel Solomon joining up now. It's tough because the U.S. economy is built on, of course, consumer spending. So walk us through the numbers and what they tell us.",

      "sentences": "A great point, Erica. Consumer spending is the backbone of the U.S. economy.. So some good news.Let's start with the good. Inflation. Yet another example inflation is easing. So this morning, we got the PPI report, the Producer Price Index report, which is essentially inflation or prices at the wholesale or supplier level. And what it showed is that prices fell on a monthly basis 0.5 percent. Now, on an annual basis, prices are still higher by 6.2 percent so that's also not so good. But directionally, this is a good sign. Now, when we look at some of the categories with the largest declines, it's categories like gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. Vegetables, chicken, chicken eggs, however, not going down. And we saw price increases as well as electric power. A few ways to look at like this. We can look at what it tells us about the most recent history but also what it tells us about where we're coming from and directionally where we may be going. And take a look, 6.2 percent. That's a nice ways down from the peak we saw in March of 2022. That was 11.7 percent. So a nice -- wow, that's supposed to say 11.7. Nice decline there. At the same time, Erica, as you pointed out, we have retail sales fell, which tells us about the health of the consumer. That fell. This was a disappointment. A 1.1 percent fall in retail sales for the month of December. November was also revised down. So, Erica, what this is telling us -- and I should say these are broad-based. What it's telling us, Erica, is that these higher prices, the higher rates are really starting to bite and it's shifting how people spend.",

You heard Rahel mention that the price of eggs not going down and keeps rising. Before you turn your backyard into a chicken coop and -- trust me, my husband has suggested this. Want to put the hen to work for you? You may want to think about it twice. Who better to walk us through than our good friend, Tom Foreman. It could work for you. But there's a lot to take into account, Tom, before you go and get chickens. You have personal experience with this.",

      "sentences": "I grew up in farm country. I was around people with chickens. I have been around chickens. I know chickens. Chickens are my friends.The reason people want to do this is look what happened to prices here. From November to December, 11 percent up, the cost of egg, 60 percent up annually. That's a big, big jump out there. So a lot of people are saying, look, can I invest in my backyard and get my own chickens and raise these chickens. A lot to consider on that. You have to look at the rules of your neighborhood. You have to make sure you have the right amount of space for them. And you have to consider some of the risks that are involved. If you have chickens out there, chickens are very prone to carry salmonella, at least they can carry it, their beaks, feet, even their bodies. So you have to watch that. You have to keep their environment very clean if you're going to do that. That means work. You can't just grab them and let them go there. How big a risk is this? Plenty of people get sick from it. And some, 225 wound up in 2022 would up in the hospital as a result of this, two deaths. Is that enough to stop you? No. But it is enough to caution you. Think about what has to be done if you want to be safe raising your own chickens and your own eggs out there. [13:40:02] Again, they have to have plenty of room. They have to be kept clean. You have to keep the place nice for them. Good for the chickens and you. Children under 5, basically keep them away. Their systems of being able to fight off disease is not developed enough. They shouldn't be around the chickens. Don't kiss or snuggle the chickens. I know it's tempting. But don't do it. Don't eat or drink near the chickens, especially not Popeyes, obvious reasons. And you might want to have coop shoes, shoes that you only wear when you go in to see the chickens. And when you come out, you take them off so you don't bring that into the house. Chickens are wonderful animals. You can be around them but you have to take them seriously for your health and for their health. And ultimately, Erica, here's the thing. If your husband goes ahead with this and start raising chickens at home, you have to treat the eggs in a special way as well. First, collect them immediately. Don't let them sit out there forever. Throw away any with cracks that could allow bacteria to get inside. These are also porous, though they don't look like it. So you wipe off the dirt. You don't wash them off unless you're going to immediately refrigerate them. Even then, use warm water to push the bacteria out, not draw it in. Refrigerate them. Yes, if they're fresh, they can sit on the counter for a while. Some people don't want to refrigerate them. But it's safer. When you use them, look for a firm white and yolk to tell you that that egg is healthy. It's a great experiment. It's a fun thing to do. It's interesting to do and it might save you money. Although, a little warning. If you and your husband get a bunch of little chicks --",
