It's about that tradition. We see Thanksgiving weekend as being a little less the kickoff to the holiday season that it used to be. It's a little bit more of the halfway point.

Of course I'm going to be shopping deals. I'm going to be thoughtful. So going into this holiday season, were expecting to see, you know, encouraging spending from consumers.

Maybe buy something a little fancy but also save a little bit of money at that lower price point. When it comes top toys, you know, it's all about the classics this year.

This all coming on the heels, of course, of a number of Trump appointees and nominees being targeted. This has been an area of bipartisan agreement over the last 48 hours that this uptake in swatting and political violence, there is no place for it. It has been denounced.

Everybody else is the enemy the combined I think, and this is really important is that social networks like X out there that actually promotes sort of anonymous attacks that get the most attention.So you have this anonymous name calling plus the political rhetoric, and they keep -- they become a cauldron where there will be people who hear that, hear all this is a call to do something and take action or disrupt what's going on. And I think that's clearly been happening. It didn't start with Donald Trump coming down the escalator. It was percolating far, you know, before that. But now I think it's hit just an intensity that we all need to be concerned as citizens, to calm down, to start trying to be civil, to stop doing the name calling and start trying to find a way forward together.",

There was a protester who handcuffed himself to my then 6-year-old daughter's chair. I had death threats. I had to travel with a security detail.What the impact of this is it causes good people to not want to serve in government, to not want to serve their country because they're under this kind of pressure. And so I really, really hope that folks on the fringes on both sides will tone down the rhetoric, take down the temperature. Joe is exactly right. We need to be more civil with each other.
