Well now he's the target of a federal investigation into human trafficking. Homeland Security investigators searched two of his homes this week. That investigation reportedly came out of several allegations of sexual assault against him. No charges have been filed.Well, he settled one lawsuit filed last year by a former girlfriend, performer Cassie. And since then, accusers have filed four more suits against him. He's denied all the allegations. And after the searches, Diddy's attorney said, Mr. Combs is innocent and will continue to fight every single day to clear his name. With me now in the studio to get to the center of these cases. You've probably heard about this week, Christopher A. Daniel. He covers black culture for \"The Atlanta Journal-Constitution\". Also, attorney and law professor Mo Ivory. Welcome to you both. Well, let me start with you. All right. So, three lawsuits filed against -- four lawsuits filed against Diddy. One was from a woman who alleged sex trafficking and gang rape when she was 17 in high school. Would there have to have been more than what's in that lawsuit to justify to a judge to get the warrants to search his two homes?",

Well, they weren't with me in Washington when I was advocating in front of Senate appropriation staffers to get that money.

But we haven't heard too, too much from them since then. You know, we didn't get a chance to meet with the pope, but we were actually following the process, which is that there's a casting for the cause of saints, the group that we met with are the ones who vet the lives of the candidates and also vet the miracle that they are expected to perform to be declared saints.",

Akea Brionne found a way to use artificial intelligence to make art. It's art that still requires a human touch. She's using the tech to turn her dreams and thoughts and to tapestries.(BEGIN VDIEO CLIP) AKEA BRIONNE, LENS AND TEXTILE-BASED ARTIST: My name is Akea Brionne. I am based in Detroit, Michigan, and I'm a lens and textile-based artist. So the process for me, it begins with either self-portraits, appropriated images that I'm collecting from the Internet, and also family photos often, I'm recounting my dreams or sort of landscapes that I've created in my mind. And then that A.I. basically creates the image from what I've put into it. I then put it through a digital loam. I adorn it with Jewels and glitter, and doll stuffing I think that there's healthy levels of fear and cynicism. I think historically has been on that side when it came to technology. But I also realized that as a woman of color, it was very, very limited in terms of what it was pulling from. So a lot of it was rooted in a lot of racist archetypes and stereotypes. And so it can only learn from what it's being fed. So my way of sort of combating that is educating myself and educating the software. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
