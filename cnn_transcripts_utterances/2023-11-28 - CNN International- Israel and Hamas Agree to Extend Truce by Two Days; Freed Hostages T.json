And if they continue to release hostages at a minimum of 10 Israelis per day, then the pause will be extended for 24 hours for each of those releases. The Israelis are saying by a government spokesperson that they now have a list. Overnight, they got a list of 10 potential hostage releases. So that shows that things are progressing along the same rhythm that we've seen over the last four days.There was a slight hitch on Monday. Things were delayed a little bit because of the list of people that that originally Israel was given. There was some concern that it included children without their mothers who were also in captivity. That was then apparently resolved. But today, apparently, they're saying they have another list of 10. So, things are progressing. There is still some concern, Max, that going forward whether or not Hamas will have enough women and children, which we understand are still the only people covered under this agreement to continue to fulfill its side of the agreement. Whether some of them might be under the physical custody of other groups within Gaza. But Israel has said -- Mark Regev of the senior adviser to Prime Minister Netanyahu, that that is sort of semantic that because Hamas is the de facto government there because they are the ones they're negotiating with, they should be able -- they should have been able to use this for us to locate enough hostages.",

This is something that the White House certainly hopes will happen. They are still waiting, by the way, for two American women who they had hoped would have already been released to be released after that. If Hamas stops releasing hostages, Israel has made it very clear that they intend to go back in and continue with the job of, they say, eliminating Hamas completely. The defense minister says, with the full force, you know, even more force than before. And they are making it very clear that they don't think that will jeopardize the safety of the hostages. On the contrary, they think it will provide a deterrent for Hamas to continue to release hostages to extend this pause.",

It's very simple for them because they can force them. It's not beginning now. I think all the time Hamas and Islamic Jihad, they are both affiliated to Iran. So, when Hamas wants to force the Islamic Jihad to give back the hostages, they can do it easily.I think Hamas today is under pressure, not only the military pressure, but also, they hear the voices of the civilians in Gaza. I'm covering Gaza over 30 years and the first time in my career I can hear voices of civilians that saying it's enough -- enough is enough. We had enough from the Hamas and the first time I hear voices of uprising, they want to uprise against Hamas, who brought them back 20 or 30 years back. And I think that Hamas is hearing these voices. And what they want now is the humanitarian aid more than the Palestinian prisoners from releasing them from the Israeli prison. And for Hamas it's very important to get now the humanitarian aid and took the hostages from Islamic Jihad and other groups that capture the Israeli hostages.",

Now, here he is in war and the other leadership of Hamas in Gaza Strip would like to get much more -- more time for ceasefire. And for them -- I say it again -- they can get easily the hostages from Rajat and from Islamic Jihad and from this family. The problem now that in this war and all the Hamas group would like to see how Israel stopped the war and withdraw from Gaza. They are playing with the hostages.I think the main group that there will be dealing with will be the soldiers that were kidnapped from Israel in October 7th. They are releasing now point by point, first the children, the old people, the sick people, the injured, the Israelis hostages and the part of the soldiers are more than 30 or 40 soldiers that were kidnapped for Israel. This is will be more difficult for us, for the Israelis to negotiate with Hamas because Hamas to release the soldiers, needs to ask for Israel, request for Israel to empty all the prisons of Palestinians, Palestinian soldiers.",

The White House had said that three American citizens were believed to be among the initial fifty women and children hostages to be released by Hamas during a four-day truce period. Abigail Adan was one of them. She, of course, was released on Sunday and then two additional American women. But day four of the truce coming and going without those two women being released.Now we can't say anything at this point about the condition of those women, their whereabouts, or if and when they may end up being released. But this is a part of the big reason why the White House has been pushing for this truce to be extended beyond those initial four days. The longer the truce obviously means that more hostages can hopefully get out. And what we are told is that senior White House officials on Monday made a whole bunch of phone calls to the Qatari Prime Minister to work on getting this truce extended. CIA Director Bill Burns, we are told, was also intimately involved, and national security adviser Jake Sullivan was keeping the president apprised the entire time. So, we are about to learn probably in the next 48 hours or so, whether these two American women will end up being released as a part of the next group of 20 or so women and children hostages to be released over the course of two days. And then after that, the question of course for this White House very much turns to the seven other unaccounted four Americans. We know that there are men, according to the White House, but we again don't know anything about their condition as well. MJ Lee, CNN, the White House. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
