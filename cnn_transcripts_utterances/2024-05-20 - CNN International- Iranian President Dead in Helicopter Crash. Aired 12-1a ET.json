That's according to Iranian state news media. And we are getting our first look -- you see it there -- at the site in Iran's East Azerbaijan province, where the aircraft went down Sunday afternoon. Now the president and other officials, including Iran's foreign minister, had attended a ceremony for the opening of a new dam near the border with Azerbaijan. Rescuers faced difficult weather conditions overnight, including cold and heavy fog, as they scrambled to locate the crash site. Iranians were urged to pray for the president and those on board the aircraft. Here's the message earlier from Iran's supreme leader. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) AYATOLLAH ALI KHAMENEI, IRAN'S SUPREME LEADER (through translator): Dear people, whether you are sitting here or will hear my speech later, do not worry. There will be no disruption in the country's work. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, Paula, I think there will be vastly conflicting reactions within Iran this morning as they wake up to the news of this helicopter crash. Because we know that the president was a fairly polarizing figure. Weknow he did have support from the more hardline section of society in Iran. But he certainly also was not popular among, for example, the youth-led protests that we have seen since -- since 2020. So we know that there will be a varying degree of -- of reaction when it comes to what has happened here. So what we know at this point is the head of the Iranian Red Crescent say that there is no sign of life at the location of the helicopter crash. There were nine people on board. We know that the president, Ebrahim Raisi, had just been at an inauguration of a dam project, just close to the border with Azerbaijan in the Eastern Azerbaijan province within Iran. He had met there with the president of Azerbaijan, and they were in a three-helicopter convoy, heading back to either Tehran or where they would be able to disembark for another form of transport. It is a very inhospitable terrain, as you could see from some of those images. Helicopter travel really the most practical to be able to get around that area. But we also do know that weather conditions were bad at the time of this crash. Just the fact that it took rescue teams so long to be able to access that location where they believed the helicopter went down. We know that it was extremely foggy. We had heard from rescue teams about the very poor visibility in the area. In fact, rescue teams themselves were unable to put helicopters into the air to try and help the rescue process, because it was simply too dangerous to be able to do so. We know also it's a very mountainous area, very sparsely populated. And we understand that the temperatures overnight would dipping into subzero realms. And rescue teams really did struggle to try and get to the area where this crash took place. So Monday morning, people in Iran will be waking up to this news. There will be shock. There will be, as I say, very varying degrees of -- of reaction when it comes to this figure. But a very significant crash, indeed, the fact the president was on board, the top diplomat, the foreign minister of Iran, was also on board that helicopter. We know that the governor of East Azerbaijan, also one of the region's Friday prayers imams, was onboard. Security pilots and crew. So a very significant event happening in Iran right now -- Paula.",

Obviously, the pilot and crew, and why they made that decision to fly. We know that two other helicopters in that convoy actually landed safely.What more are we learning about the conditions that they undertook this trip, given the fact that you just described, really, some bad weather? We had Colonel Cedric Leighton on earlier, saying that normally that would rest with the pilot in terms of deciding whether or not to fly.",

      "sentences": "I mean, this area itself, really using a helicopter for -- for VIPs is one of the most practical ways to transport them to use the roads in this area, would take hours.They are not good roads. And that, in itself, would be problematic when you're transporting a president and a foreign minister. So certainly, using a helicopter would be the most practical solution. But it is questionable whether or not the decision was obviously not the right one, it appears. But whether or not that was a clear decision at the area where this -- this helicopter took off. Now, we know that it was in an area where there was a dam project. There was an inauguration, a VIP event that the president, the foreign ministers, and also the president of Azerbaijan were in attendance. Now, we don't know whether the -- the weather in that particular area was deceptively good. So it was deemed acceptable to be able to take this -- the president and the foreign minister into the air. But we do know as soon as the first reports came out, that -- that they had lost contact with the helicopter itself; that it was impossible for rescue teams to be able to put their own helicopters into the air to try and pinpoint exactly where this -- this aircraft went down. So that is very telling, if the rescue teams themselves are unable to put aircraft into the air. We know that Turkey, for example, gave a heat drone to be able to help with this search. And that certainly did manage to -- to narrow down the area that -- that the rescue teams were searching for. But just the fact that it took rescue teams so long to get to that area. Every hour we were getting updates of the difficulties that they were encountering. The fact that the -- the visibility was dreadful. You can see from the images and the footage of the rescue teams, just how little visibility there is. And that is on the ground as people are trying to walk. You can imagine what it would have been like in the air. So there will be some serious questions asked as to why this helicopter was in the air in the first place, why the president and the foreign minister were both on the same helicopter, for example. There were three helicopters in this convoy. So certainly, these are questions that I'm sure will be asked internally over the hours and days to come.",

As you can see there, obviously, daybreak. It is morning there. And you can see this is the site of the crash. It looks like a staging area right now where they've been able to get, as you can see, even ambulances there and other vehicles to try and do their first investigation of the site. And obviously try and recover the bodies. Those are our first pictures. In fact, those are live pictures there from Tabriz, Iran, which is still quite a distance away from where this crash occurred. But they are setting up that staging area to begin those recovery operations. I mean, Ivan, you made such good points there in terms of the reaction. I do want to ask you what will be a very complicated reaction inside of Iran, right? Because you will have, certainly, hardliners, those who are very religious, as well, who would have backed President Raisi, and obviously, the supreme leader. But again, those who felt that he was an unsparing repressive president of Iran that its responsible for, in fact, condemning many to death.",

      "sentences": "Very polarized. We heard the Iranian government, the supreme leader of Iran, no less, Ali Khamenei, calling for prayers for Raisi and his entourage.And we saw on Iranian state media scenes of people quite literally praying for him. And now that will transition to prayers of mourning. After all, we were seeing that some of the anchors on Iranian state television are wearing black right now in, I think, a sign of what's to come in Iran, as we are likely to move into a period of official mourning. [00:15:03] On the other side of the political spectrum in Iran, there are those who see Ebrahim Raisi as a villain. And we are seeing signs on social media. We are seeing videos of people whose families suffered under the crackdown, particularly over the last two years in Iran, quite literally celebrating. In one video, two women whose mother died in the crackdown, dancing to a Turkish pop song called \"Helicopter.\" OK, further abroad, we have members of the diaspora who are opponents of the Islamic Republic of Iran, of the regime there, since -- in place since 1979, also celebrating this moment. And it underscores the internal divisions within this country, where you've had, over the past 20 years, recurring uprisings and protest movements that the authorities have crushed using, at times, deadly force. Ebrahim Raisi himself was elected in 2021. It was historically, since the foundation of the Islamic republic of Iran, the lowest voter turnout in any presidential election. I believe it was in the 40th percentile. And the parliamentary elections of just a few months ago also had a low voter turnout. In decades past, Paula, I think you and I have reported on the power struggle between reformist and conservative camps in Iran. Experts will argue that -- that the reformist side of the body politic in Iran has effectively been crushed for years now. And now, if there is any power struggle, it's within different shades -- different shades of black and gray within the hardline and conservative camp. So a big part of Iranian political society is basically blocked out of politics. And that leaves factions, again, within the hardline and conservative side of society, to then kind of duke it out over who might become a candidate and the winner of presidential elections, which according to Iran's constitution, are to take place some 50 days after the death of the elected president.",

And I know you told us earlier that whether or not to fly would have -- ultimately rest with the pilot in this situation, to kind of assess the weather conditions and if it was safe.But it seems odd to me. You had mentioned the airframe on this thing could be nearly a half-century old. You had the foreign minister and the president in the same helicopter, even though there were apparently three that were traveling together. What -- you know, as someone who's obviously used to this military chain of command, we know that there was a security official onboard, as well. Does this strike you as odd?",

      "sentences": "Well, I think there's always the possibility of rank intimidating people who are supposed to actually be the ones that are in charge.So there is certainly the possibility that the rank of the president or an overbearing security official, or a protocol official that said you must get the president here at a certain time may have contributed to this. So, you know, in many ways, the pilot may have felt, against his better judgment, to take -- to take the mission on and the president forward, because that's what was wanted and that's what was demanded of him. So there's -- there's definitely a possibility in, you know, a military hierarchy. And it's certainly true in a society like Iran's. There's a lot of obedience given to that hierarchy. So the pilot may be in charge, nominally. And in the U.S., that advice of the pilot would have certainly been -- have been a key factor in the decision to go or not to go. But there's always the chance that rank would have had a factor in this, and it could have potentially overwhelmed good judgment and made it a situation where, against his better judgment, the pilot decided to fly anyways. So that's a possibility. And Paula Hancocks pointed out something that is actually quite true. The weather at the point of origin may have been OK, have been quite good. And with changing weather, which is a very common occurrence in mountainous regions like this, the original assessment may have actually been faulty. So it may have been perfectly fine to take off from the area on the Azerbaijan border. But it may not have been fine, especially if you're flying at low altitudes, to continue the mission. And by the time that you're in the middle of something like that, it may be too late to get out of it.",

In our breaking news out of Iran, Iranian news agencies have now confirmed the death of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and the country's foreign minister.As you know, the helicopter went down yesterday in inclement weather. A search party was sent, and you are looking at a photo of the crash site right there. The Iranian Red Crescent says there were no survivors. And now, Iran confirming that their president and their foreign minister has died -- have died. I'm joined now by Trita Parsi, who's author of \"Losing An Enemy: Obama, Iran, and The Triumph Of Diplomacy,\" and executive vice president at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft. So much to get to here. I do, though, just right off the bat, want to get your reaction to the president of Iran dying in that helicopter crash. TRITA PARSI, AUTHOR, \"LOSING AN ENEMY\": Obviously, this is going to be something that throws a major wrench into the wheels of the Iranian government and how it has planned to handle the next few years, mindful of the fact that the supreme leader is nearing the end of his life. And one of the biggest challenges they will face is the succession crisis. The succession to the next supreme leader. And Raisi was one of the contenders for that position. Some argue that he had been groomed to take over that position, and he is no longer there. So there will be both that crisis as well as the crisis of holding elections within the next 50 days at -- in a country that is deeply divided, a deeply unpopular regime, and a population that increasingly have stopped casting votes, because they have lost faith in the belief that there can be change through the ballot box.",

Do you suspect that a portion of the population, you know, agreed with President Raisi, understood that, for them, he was the keeper of a very conservative religious, hardline legacy that they wanted to keep in place, post-revolution?",

If the regime ends up in some sort of a gridlock and debilitating crisis, its ability to rein in some of its allies, Syria and Iraqi militias that the Iranians have supported, armed, and trained, who they have used to -- you know, to project power in the region. But who also have their own interests. And part of their interest is actually they tend to be more aggressive towards the United States. There currently is a truce, an uneasy truce, in which they have stopped their attacks on U.S. troops, partly because of pressure from Iran. But if that pressure cannot be sustained, we may end up seeing a situation in which these attacks against U.S. troops may restart. And that would obviously be a very negative development for the United States and the Biden administration.",

We have been talking about the president, but as you said, the foreign minister, he -- there was quite a lot of nuance to the way he conducted foreign policy for Iran. In fact, Axios reported that last week, the U.S. and Iran, in separate rooms with Oman as a mediator, were talking about how to try and de-escalate things in the region.So I want to get your take on if you think anything will change, given that there is a power vacuum there, as well. These are crucial times, obviously, throughout the entire region. And pivotal, perhaps, even at this hour is what Israel's reaction will be to all of this. PLEITGEN (via phone): Well, I think you're absolutely right. And I think that that's -- calling the way that he led his office, and he conducted his affairs nuanced, I think, is very important. I think that Hossein Amir-Abdollahian was a much, much more of a hardliner and within the spheres of the hardliners in Iran that, for instance, Javad Zarif was. Javad Zarif was also quite close to the supreme leader. But as far as the apparatus of the Revolutionary Guard, the military forces, and also a lot of the hardline clergy is concerned, I would say that Hossein Amir-Abdollahian was definitely much more ingrained into all of that. And if you look at some of the foreign policies that he conducted -- and this was quite interesting to see when Ebrahim Raisi was elected president. We had actually spoken to Hossein Amir-Abdollahian just shortly before that. And all the things he had told us became the foreign policies of Iran. So there is a very hard line towards, obviously, the United States, but at the same time, of course, they did have those efforts to try and revive the Iran nuclear agreement, which so far have not really born any fruit and are sort of on standstill right now, but they certainly did attempt to do that. But then also, especially in that time when you look at after that that flare-up now with the Israelis, where it really seemed as though, for a while, Israel and Iran were on the brink of a much more wider, possibly for the region catastrophic war, he was quite instrumental in trying to calm all of that down. He traveled the region. He informed, for instance, a lot of Iran's -- not just allies, but other countries in the region, of Iran's response to -- to the bombing of that embassy compound. And so certainly, he is someone who definitely took the foreign ministry by the reins. And it's going to be -- it's going to be interesting to see what they do next as far as foreign policy is concerned, because on the one hand, of course, there is the direction of the foreign ministry. But at the same time, of course, it also takes someone very strong in charge of the foreign ministry to form those policies, to travel the region, and of course, also to have that clout among other regional leaders, as well, Paula.",

And I think when you talk to officials inside the White House, there's not a great hope that this will change anything, certainly, in the upper echelons of the regime in Tehran. They don't expect sort of a softening of the hardline positions that we've seen adopted over the last several years. But I think what they're looking for mostly is to contain any of the volatility that could be contained in what's going on now. And certainly, when it comes to Israel, President Biden's overarching goal amid this crisis has been to prevent this conflict from spreading into a wider regional war and to prevent the United States from being dragged closer into conflict with Iran. And you saw that just in the last several months in this tit-for-tat back and forth between Israel and Iran. You saw the United States come to Israel's defense. You saw Iran fire drones and missiles towards Israel for the first time. That had been a point of real fear inside the White House that that could sort of spiral out of control. And they do feel like they were able to successfully contain that. And part of that is because there have been these quiet, indirect back-channel conversations between Washington and Tehran, sort of sending the message that they do not want this conflict to escalate any further. Now that there is sort of a vacuum at the very top of the Iranian regime, what the White House will want to do is try and ascertain very, very quickly what Raisi is replacements intentions are. And certainly, the supreme leader sort of has the ultimate say in the U.S., sort of feels like they know where he stands. But when you talk about those underneath him and the foreign minister in particular, they will want to get a better read of how those new people in those positions will adopt their positions going forward. And I think that's going to be an important thing for President Biden to do now, particularly at a very fragile moment in the Gaza war, as the U.S. tries to secure the ceasefire and hostage deal; as the U.S. tries to broker this broader regional agreement with Saudi Arabia, the goal of which had been trying to provide a greater bulwark against Iran.

The U.S. doesn't have diplomatic relations with Iran. They don't have the direct conversations, for example, over Iran's nuclear program that had once sort of been a hallmark of the relationship. And so I think the goal now is to try and keep things stable, to try and prevent the volatility from creating a situation where President Biden can't sort of control the region. And when it comes to the proxies, you know, that had been something that President Biden has been trying to do for months and months and months, is to try and contain the fallout from -- from those proxy groups, including the Houthis in Yemen and also groups in Iraq and Lebanon, who have taken shots at American troops in the region. The U.S. has retaliated against those proxies. But again, the overarching mission that President Biden has had is to prevent this from becoming a direct U.S.-Iran conflict.
