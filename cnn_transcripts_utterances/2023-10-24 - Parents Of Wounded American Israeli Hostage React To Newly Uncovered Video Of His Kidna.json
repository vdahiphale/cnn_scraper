Hersh's dad and mother, John and Rachel told me that Hersh's arm had been partially blown off by Hamas gunman as he fled the Nova Music Festival. Eyewitnesses told me that Hersh was put into a truck by gunmen and driven off.But when we did the interview more than a week ago, they had no video of their son. And during that live interview on television, I realized while talking to them when they showed a picture of Hersh, that I'd actually seen Hersh, and I actually had video of him on my phone. It had been shown to me by soldier at the music festival. And with permission of that soldier, I recorded it off his phone, but I'd never released it publicly. I've been in touch with the family a lot this past week, and they now would like everyone to see this video. It's a video I sent them immediately after I interviewed them. They want you to see it. So they want you to know what happened to their child and the fate of other wounded hostages. We blurred out some parts of it. But we want to warn you, it's disturbing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
