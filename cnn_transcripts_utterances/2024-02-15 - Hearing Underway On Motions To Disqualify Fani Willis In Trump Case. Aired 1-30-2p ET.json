It just says this is the date that is completed. So if you go through the invoice, it's probably around the first five or six, you'll see that that's the billing format. I would bill only after that particular task has been completed. That's why you see a 24-hour period with the one day there. I kind of wish some of the experts who had opined on that had called me and asked me the question. But there was never a billing of 24 hours in one day. Now, probably around the sixth or seventh invoice, you see the format change. I started using a range so that it got less confusing, right?",
