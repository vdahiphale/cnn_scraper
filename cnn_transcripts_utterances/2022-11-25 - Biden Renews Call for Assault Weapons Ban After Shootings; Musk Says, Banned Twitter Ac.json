But now, he has not only lost the House but even in the lame duck session. While he still has a Democratic House, there are still not those 60 votes in the Senate to be able to overcome the filibuster to pass the assault weapons ban. That's why when President Biden was able to get through some bipartisan gun reform legislation through this Congress, it did not include that assault weapons ban for that very same reason. The numbers just aren't there.But the president saying that he is going to try, the White House has previously said that the president is an optimist on this issue and he's going to push forward. But there is no clear pathway. I want us to be very clear about that. Nonetheless, the White House views this as a galvanizing issue for their base. They also that it's useful to continue to talk about this, to put pressure on Republicans because this is something that is broadly supported by the American public.

The university itself saying that they're going ahead and extending remote learning for those who are too afraid to come back to campus. This as police say they're working through more than 1,000 tips. And some of the witness interviews have also led them to believe that there may have been a stalker for one of the murder victims, Kaylee Goncalves. However, they're saying they're not being able to find anyone to confirm this or identify somebody who would fit that category. The family of Goncalves says this is not true, they do not believe, they think it's just rumor mill activity that she may have had a stalker. The other thing that we have learned over the last few days here as we've been looking for any information coming out of the police department is the fact that they've been able to rule out some people and say that they're not at all suspected to have been party to this -- these series of murders here. That would be the two roommates who were in the house who slept through it and then another man that two of the murder victims reached out to shortly before they were killed. They say that all three of these people are innocent.

And by encouraging people to cross the line wherever it is, this platform is necessarily going to become a more hostile place to hang out. And I'm not sure that's great for marginalized groups and high profile individuals who might get harassed, et cetera. I'm also not sure it's great for the bottom line for Twitter.

I mean, obviously, he has been more protective of general free speech than the old regime, and that's been his principle -- as far as I can tell, his argument for having bought this platform in the first place. I mean, it's a little fascinating to watch. I mean, as Catherine said, this is a for-profit company. It would be the four of us buying Coca-Cola and just opening the VATs and pouring stuff in and see what happens. It would be like a little bit high wire act because it's a for-profit company. You have to get people to buy it, the advertisers, as Catherine said.So, from that perspective, it's kind of fascinating. But I think the way he's handled the decision-making is pretty true to the way he presented it when he decided he wanted to buy it in the first place. Look, I'm not sure twitter got the banning right in the first place. Remember, they once banned the oldest newspaper in the United States during a presidential election because they didn't like what they were tweeting out. And so I think there's probably some people that need to be brought back. There's probably some people that probably don't. Ultimately, though, for him, the bottom line is the bottom line.

It would take a great deal more than some kind of artillery strike to damage the reactors.But above all the issue here is that the Russians are systematically attacking the energy grid right across the country. This country relies for 50 percent of its power on nuclear power. And to keep those reactors cool, to stop them melting down, they need external sources of electricity, ironically. So, when that is broken, they have to go to diesel backup generators to keep them cooling. And, of course, they are extremely vulnerable. They are the last line of defense before the nuclear reactor gets into serious trouble. And it is that that the IAEA is drawing attention to. And then the much wider issue from the international community's perspective and, of course, here in Ukraine, is that winter is approaching, the power grid keeps getting knocked out by these mass attack by cruise missiles from Russia, as Russia is losing essentially on the ground incrementally. There is ferocious fighting in the east, but in the south, around Kherson, they have been pushed backing and they've reacted by trying to break the back of the energy structures in the country to undermine both the military effort but also to try to thump the civilians essentially of Ukraine into submission.

Thank you so much for joining us.I want to talk though about Hungary, first off, saying it will ratify Finland and Sweden's NATO membership bids early next year. As you know, Hungary and Turkey are the only members of the alliance who have not yet cleared this. What's the risk in delaying it until early next year?",

But we all have to remember that all allies, including Turkey and Hungary, made a historic decision in June this year to invite Finland and Sweden to become members of the alliance and all NATO allies signed the accession protocols.And so far, 28 out of the 30 members have ratified these protocols in the national parliament. So, this is one of the fastest ever accession processes in NATO's history. And I'm confident that also the two remaining parliaments will ratify so we ensure that Finland and Sweden becomes full members.",

NATO has increased its military presence in the region, in the Baltic region, and several allies, including the United States, have issued security assurances to Finland and Sweden. So, it's absolutely inconceivable that if Finland and Sweden were attacked or were put under some kind of pressure, that NATO would not react.So we have come a long way already and, again, this process has so far gone faster or quicker than most other accession processes of these lines.",

We have more troops on the ground, more air and naval assets and a significant part of that is also different types of air defense systems to make sure that we are there to protect and defend every inch of NATO territory. And by doing so, we're also preventing escalation of the conflict beyond Ukraine. Just this week, I was in Spain. Spain announced they will provide more Hawk batteries. NATO allies have provided NASAMS batteries to advance NATO air defense systems. At the end of it, it will be a national decision on the specific capabilities, but I continue to call on allies to step up and provide even more air defenses also for Ukraine.",
