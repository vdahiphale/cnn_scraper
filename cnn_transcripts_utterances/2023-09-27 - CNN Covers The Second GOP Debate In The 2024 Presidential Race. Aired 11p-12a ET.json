But does it fundamentally change anything? My answer is no. I'd be interested in what the Republicans who do this for a living do at it. There's another one in 40 days, the third debate.

But Tim Scott, who was almost vacant from the last debate, was much more aggressive here. Even Governor Burgum jumped in here with a few good answers. And all of this, it seems to me, helps Donald Trump, because rather than creating clarity, it creates more of a muddle for voters. So -- and -- by the way, you know, for all the random shots at Trump, you know, they went right for the capillary, not the jugular.

Perhaps the only uniting force on that stage was how much everyone seems to loathe Vivek Ramaswamy. But honestly, it did not come off like -- there were some substantive policy issues.

Because right now, what do Republicans believe? They believe Trump is the most electable. For months, we thought, who can make an argument about electability? Well, Trump has already won that question. And at the same time, Biden is having a high speed come apart if you look at these national polls right now. So, Republicans are like, Trump has beaten this guy, we can't lose to this guy, and we're finally going to get vindication. I don't need someone more electable because Trump is going to beat him.

And so, we're not going to be doing media frenzies or anything going forward. I'll talk to everybody. Left wing, right wing media doesn't matter. But I'm going to focus more on what is day one going to look like. And not only just what is day one. What does January 2033 look like? When I leave that office, after two terms hopefully, what do I want to tell the people of this country that we did? From here on out, that's actually my focus.
