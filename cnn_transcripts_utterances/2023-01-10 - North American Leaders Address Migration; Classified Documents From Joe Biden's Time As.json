Well, Brazil is reeling from what the country's highest government powers are calling acts of terrorism after thousands of supporters of former President Jair Bolsonaro stormed the country's three branches of government. President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is criticizing the police conduct before and during Sunday's attacks and is accusing them of negligence and con events.The justice minister says some 1500 people have been arrested since the violence broke out in Brasilia. That's when protesters upset over Bolsonario's election defeat broke into key government buildings leaving behind widespread damage in Congress, the Presidential Palace and the Supreme Court. On Monday, authorities disbanded a camp set up by Bolsonaro supporters in the capital. Buses carrying protesters could be seen headed toward police headquarters. Later that night, a huge pro-democracy crowd turned out on the streets of Sao Paulo, just one day after those attacks in the capital. Meantime, Brazil's former leader is in the United States where he tweeted this picture from a hospital bed in Florida. His wife says he's being treated for abdominal discomfort. Brazil's Justice Minister says Bolsonaro bears political responsibility for the attacks. But right now, there are no legal grounds for an investigation. CNN's Isa Soares is following all the developments and has more now on the unrest in Brasilia. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ISA SOARES, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): A stunning attack on Brazil seat of power. As thousands of supporters of former far-right President Jair Bolsonaro broke through security cordons in Brasilia. Roaming presidential building corridors, vandalizing congress, smashing windows, stealing presidential documents, and destroying in valuable works of art. Simply running riot through Brazil's halls of power. And seems eerily similar to the insurrection in the U.S. Capitol two years ago. One week earlier, the scenes were of democratic triumph, as Bolsonaro's left-wing rival Lula da Silva was inaugurated as the new Brazilian President following a tight election result. Bolsonaro never explicitly conceded a need that that his most ardent followers. This, this is my hero. I match his home, our home, our home, a Bolsonaro supporter says from inside the presidential palace. Protesters dressed in the colors of the Brazilian flag. Now a symbol of Bolsonaro's far-right movement. Unfilled banners from the Congressional building rooftop, demanding the result of Brazil's most fraught election in a generation be overturned. More than thousand arrests were made after security forces use tear gas and stun grenades to regain control of the congressional building. The Supreme Court and presidential palace. But by the time they did the damage had already been done. The President's chief of communication showed destruction inside his own office.",

Clearly, he had some direct influence. Now, obviously, to be extradited there has to request by the Brazilian authorities to do so. But I do think a full investigation has to take place. And I think the United States, if that request is made, has to be willing to demonstrate its objectivity when it comes to defending democratic norms in the world, but especially in the western hemisphere has to be willing to hand over Bolsonaro if indeed, and I think there's a very strong argument here that he indirectly influenced and incited this mob to commit a horrible act of terrorism against the three branches of Brazilian democracy.

President Lula has said that he will make sure that ensure that justice is done, we've rounded up as you mentioned, 1500 insurrectionists, you know, this is -- this is sedition, this is insurrection, it's mob violence. It's obviously vandalism as well, the least of the charges of course.If they should be prosecuted the fullest extent of the law. The problem here, of course, is that Brazil is a deeply divided country. Bolsonaro lost by only 1.8 percent of the vote. And the two sides are deeply distrustful of each other. So, in trying to ensure there's accountability for this horrendous attack, Lula is also going to be have to be careful not to inflame the other side, not just to continue to stoke this animosity. Now, in terms of democracy in the hemisphere, it is in the decline. It's sad, if you look at freedom house's evaluation of democracy every year, it has declined in the hemisphere. But populism from both sides from both the left and the right, what we've learned whether it's in Mexico, whether it's in Venezuela or in Brazil, the demagoguery distrust over democracy is really stoking the decline in trust in democratic institutions and the decline in support for democratic norms. And so, it runs across the ideological spectrum. And indeed, it's very troubling. For now, at least Brazil - in Brazil, democracy is held. The military didn't intervene, despite the calls by the mob for them to overturn the constitution.",

So, it's a -- it's a logistics center. Soledar itself we know according to the head of Wagner, Yevgeny Prigozhin whose own forces we believe are fighting in that city. He says that they are interested in the salt mines in that city. They're cavernous salt mines, some auditorium size which he says like underground cities and can be used to store weapons and equipment. So, it has interest in that regard as well. This is very intense fighting. The Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister reported that Russia tried to take that city then failed, retreated, regrouped and is now trying again. She says that they're even covering some of their own forces with artillery fire from MLRS, rocket launchers and things like that. Incredibly intense.

President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, when he went to the United States, and he went to -- when he went to Washington, he didn't meet with migrants either. I mean, it's kind of this hot potato, where they know that if you sit and talk to at least the leaders of some of the migrant groups, there is going to be a lot of complaints, a lot of concern. And it's kind of this uncomfortable situation, Rosemary, and it's terrible for, you know, these millions of people that live in the United States, have been working in the United States, their children were born in the United States, and, you know, you have leadership that is uncomfortable meeting with them, because, you know, they entered illegally, you know, quote, unquote, illegally into the United States.And from the President's perspective, President of Mexico's perspective, you know, it's a little uncomfortable because, Mexico depends on the remittances coming from the United States into Mexico, but he doesn't meet with them directly. So, that is a very good observation. It would have been an easy win to meet with these migrants, but the criticism he would receive in the United States or from the Republicans and from the more Conservatives, is that he's meeting with people who technically are -- technically are criminals because they entered illegally into the United States. It's a terrible -- it's a -- it's a -- it's a humanitarian crisis what is happening right now.",
