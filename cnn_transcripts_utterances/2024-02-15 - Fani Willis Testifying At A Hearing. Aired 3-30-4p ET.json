And, frankly, she is persuasive this afternoon.This entirety of the proceedings, it was very clear that she was gunning to come in and testify. She is angry at the person who has brought these allegations against her. She is insulted by the notion that she is somehow sexually promiscuous. She is very irritated and leaving the fact that she herself feels as though she is being called to task and on trial. Here is the fundamental flaw of the allegations against her. There is no through line yet that has been established between her financial resources, Nathan Wade's financial resources, and how she may or may not have financially benefited. It is as if they are presuming that she started with a zero balance in her account. And only that which came in through this particular indictment is what she has to sustain her life and Nathan Wade. Why is that important? Because they're trying to suggest that she has financially benefited from hiring Nathan Wade and maybe even sustaining the indictment itself. Well, she has gone to clear strengths and clear lengths, excuse me, as did Nathan Wade to suggest that there are multiple sources of income. She talks about her private practice in the background, the source of cash in her home and beyond, as a way and a means of actually providing for herself. She was very defiant and saying, he never took me anywhere. It had a real feel, frankly, of Diana Ross and Mahogany, if you ask me about the idea of she's been plenty of places. Has she not? She talked about Nathan Wade and his own resources and beyond. But I want to just stress to everyone. Do you know how fundamentally dangerous it is for a prosecutor to tell and expose her personal life? Just think of the people that she is confronting, that she is prosecuting. I remember being nine months pregnant when someone saying to me, congratulations, and me saying, I'm not pregnant. That's how private you want to keep your life, because every single iota, every morsel you convey to the world can be used against you. You could be sitting there in front of a jury, in front of a defendant, and now your personal life is on display. How do you think that will be used against you? How can your family now be vulnerable? She's talking about where she keeps her money in her home. Gee, there is a security detail. This is extraordinarily dangerous. It tells you the very high stakes of where she is in this moment, that she is here in this moment. And let's just be very clear. She's not pulling any pensions. And I tell you, I really don't think that this judge was intending to even force her to testify today. It is very clear that she wanted to testify. She believes she's being lied about. This is all undermining, she believes her credibility. And look, as Nick Valencia said multiple times about the day today, and we all have, we are not talking about the underlying charges against the former president of the United States and 17 other code defendants, several of whom have already pled guilty.",
