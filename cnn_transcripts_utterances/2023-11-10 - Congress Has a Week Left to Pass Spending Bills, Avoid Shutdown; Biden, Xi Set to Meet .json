It is a holiday, but if there's a deadline coming up, I feel like every time this happens, I ask you this question. Where are they?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, I mean, it almost feels like they want to get down to crunch time because that kind of pressure may be the only way for them to get united. Now, Dana, we are getting our eyes all on Mike Johnson, the newly minted House Speaker, and what he's specifically going to do when it comes to the House Republican plan to fund the government. Because we simply do not know the answer to that very basic question right now one week out.We expect that we could see legislative text tomorrow. That is because if lawmakers want to vote on Tuesday, then they need to put that text out publicly so that their members can review it for the 72-hour rule. That is a rule within the Republican conference. But right now there are really two options that Johnson has. One of them is to do this two-step approach where some government agencies run out of money on one date, other government agencies run out of money at a later date. That is something that a lot of even Senate Republicans have said really doesn't make a lot of sense, but it is something that hardliners are pressuring Johnson to get behind. Meanwhile, veteran appropriators have been arguing behind the scenes to the newly minted Speaker that the best path forward is to do a short-term spending bill that is as clean as possible, maybe attach something like Israel aid to it or a debt commission, send it over to the Senate and make the argument that you had some small victory, but saved that broader spending fight until January. Dana? BASH: I mean, talk about a prescription. Like, we're already going into chaos and a prescription for chaos in a very, very sprawling federal government, trying to keep the trains running with that kind of idea. Hard to imagine that that's a workable solution. But I guess that's where we are. Lauren, thank you so much for that great reporting. And amid a cascading conflict in the Middle East and the grinding war in Ukraine, President Biden is looking to prevent another global crisis from exploding on his watch. For only the second time in three years, the President is set to meet with the Chinese President Xi Jinping. That will happen on Wednesday. CNN's Arlette Saenz is live at the White House with details. Arlette, it's a pretty big deal?",

Republican Monica De La Cruz posted photos of her district office in Texas spray-painted with anti-Israel graffiti this week, and she said that the incident is under investigation by local law enforcement. Congressman Greg Landsman of Ohio had to cancel a town hall last week over security concerns, and he joins me now. Thank you so much for being here. I just want to get you to react to the moment we're in. As I mentioned, that you had to cancel your town hall. You saw what happened to your colleague in Texas at her -- at her office, and there's so much more. REP. GREG LANDSMAN, (D) OHIO: Yeah, I mean we're going to reschedule our town hall because it's so important for people to get together and talk and ask questions and be part of a conversation with their, you know, member of Congress but also with folks in the community. And, you know, these town halls have been so incredibly helpful as a new member of Congress to build trust and make sure we're getting, you know, good feedback and building good relationships. The challenge, is the rhetoric is so dangerous and local law enforcement, you know, just called it you know the day before and said hey we -- our recommendation is for you to cancel, otherwise people could get hurt. And we saw, you know, a 70-year-old man beaten at a protest with a bullhorn, you know, a Jewish guy. So it's -- and -- and -- and we're seeing folks across the country in the world dealing with an enormous amount of anti-Semitism and Islamophobia and it gets dangerous and it's violent. And it's so important for us to appreciate that we are in this together.",
