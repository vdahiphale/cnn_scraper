Both the investigation into sensitive government documents found at Mar-a-Lago, as well as Trump's actions surrounding the January 6th attack. Garland explaining the move was necessary now that Trump has announced he's running for president again and Joe Biden stayed in attention to run for president as well.

KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME AND JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Jim, this is a special counsel who is a competitive athlete, and he's going to hit the ground running. I mean, that's the best way to describe it. Right now in these investigations we already know there is a lot happening leading up to this appointment and what's going to happen in the next couple of weeks is they're going to be witnesses coming into the grand jury. We know that several people in these top circles around Donald Trump are being pressed for information right now in the next couple of weeks. There's testimony dates being given out. We know there is a team that Jack Smith already has in place. Both a team investigating the Mar-a-Lago documents case and a separate team looking at the January 6th possible obstruction of Congress. And so those people are going to move into a dedicated office under Smith. Here's what Smith said in a statement last night sent through the Justice Department. He's currently in the Netherlands but coming back here as soon as he can. He said, \"I intend to conduct the assigned investigations and any prosecutions that may result from them, independently and in the best traditions of the Department of Justice. The pace of the investigations will not pause or flag under my watch. I will exercise independent judgment and will move the investigations forward expeditiously and thoroughly to whatever outcome the facts and the law dictates.\" So clearly the pace of this is top of mind both for Smith and for the Justice Department. Attorney General Merrick Garland made mention of that as well, that they don't want things to slow down too much. So we're just going to have to wait and see how quickly things move and what sort of decision Smith is going to be making.",

Joining me now to talk about this, David Frum, staff writer at \"The Atlantic\" and special correspondent for \"Vanity Fair,\" Molly Jong- Fast, she is the host of the podcast \"Fast Politics with Molly Jong- Fast.\" David, let me start with you first. Great to have you both on. David, could this end up -- let me start with you first, Molly, actually just in case David is frozen there. We'll see if we can unfreeze him. But, Molly, this new special counsel, the team there, they seem to be saying, no, no, no. This is not going to slow things down because obviously, you know, there's always the concern that Trump is just going to try to drag this out as he does with everything else. What's your sense of it? MOLLY JONG-FAST, SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT, VANITY FAIR: I mean, the hope is that they've been working this whole time. I think a lot of Americans are kind of sick of special counsels. You'll remember Robert Mueller. But I think the hope is that the DOJ takes this documents case very, very seriously. And remember, there's also, you know, the case in Georgia. And there's a grand jury put together there. And the case in New York. So I do think that there's, like, a lot -- you know, Trump is going to be a legal defendant for the rest of his life. But certainly I think there's a lot of anxiety, especially because we have seen Trump down before. And, you know, 2015 he was polling at 1 percent. So I think there is a lot of anxiety there.",

And that's why their primaries delivered these unelectable candidates, right? So here's the thing. Now they have to find a way to win back their base. They have to offer them something. And the base loves Trump. And they love Kari Lake. Unfortunately for the Republican Party, that's not enough to get elected in a general election except in a very, very red state. So if you want to actually win stuff, you need candidates who don't totally alienate independents. And I don't know how you get the base off Trumpism. They love it. They love the events. They love whatever. I mean, there's so many parts of it that have, you know, that have appealed to them. So I don't know. I mean, unless you can get the base to want to support someone normal, you're stuck. And I think that that calculus -- remember, these people have still never stood up to Trump.

A mass exodus is also under way after Elon Musk's ultimatum to staff to work, quote, \"extremely hardcore or leave.\" But then suddenly yesterday Musk called the company's software engineers to its headquarters for an urgent meeting. With me now is Kara Swisher, \"New York Times\" opinion contributing writer and host of the \"On with Kara Swisher\" podcast. Kara, you know Elon Musk. You covered him for years.

According to the local authorities, the victims were likely asleep when they were attacked. They had multiple stab wounds, including defensive injuries. Their bodies were found on the second and third floors of the house. What are you making of all of these details? MARY ELLEN O'TOOLE, FORMER SENIOR FBI PROFILER: So let me take those point by point. I did hear the report that they were likely asleep in their beds. That may not be accurate. They may have been in their beds but some of them may not have been asleep. And that could account for the defensive injuries. They woke up as the attacks started. And then secondly, the thing that keeps coming back over and over again is that this was a targeted attack. And for me as a behavioral scientist that has significant meaning. And one of the ways that we would determine if a victim was targeted, especially if there was a group that was attacked, is to look at whether or not there was one victim who was singled out. In other words, were their injuries different? Were they more excessive? Was there -- I hate to be that graphic, but were they positioned after the offender left the house? Was there writing on the wall? So if one person has been singled out, that may be where they're coming up with the term targeted. But nonetheless that does not diminish the dangerousness of this individual. And so I think that there was a misunderstanding when that was first said because you're targeting the offender as less dangerous and that's simply not true.",

That tells me that the offender or offenders, they -- someone that is comfortable coming into a house occupied in the middle of the night. It also suggests there was some familiarity with that house. There were several ways to enter and exit that home. There may have been prior entry into the home and the victims were not aware of it. That's number one. But then, number two, with the weapon, that is probably a weapon of choice. And when you see a knife being used in an attack like this, it is not a very efficient weapon. It can kill people, but it's also a weapon that can be taken away from you as the offender. The offender likely cut themselves on the knife because blood can be very slippery. So it's not really an efficient weapon. But, nonetheless, that's what the offender used. So this is a knife, a weapon they are comfortable with and they probably used it in other circumstances. And I'm not suggesting other murders. It's a weapon they're comfortable with, which may be the reason they took it away from the crime scene with them.",

And then there's this video of two of the victims at a food truck just hours before their deaths.As they wait for their meals to come out, they are chatting with people, having a pretty normal night. This is at 1:41 in the morning. They're out late, I guess. But what stands out to you? O'TOOLE: A couple of things. And I think it needs to be clarified what it means targeted. A victim can be targeted days or weeks before an attack. Which means there's more time in there for the offender to learn more about the victim. That is really helpful for investigators. However, I have certainly had cases where the offender targets the victim maybe minutes before the attack occurs. In other words, there's no relationship, no history there. They see them at a public place. They decide that's going to be the person they attack. At that point, the victim is targeted. The time in which the targeting took place is very important. I'm sure investigators are making that distinction between the two. Because this doesn't have to be someone the victims necessarily knew or knew for a long period of time. And the motivation is there. They are ruling out sexual assault. But, again, based on my experience with these kinds of cases, sexual assault in a case may not be as obvious as people may think. And it can be demonstrated at a crime scene in different ways. So, for example, there are people that are very sexually aroused by stabbing other people. So there could be elements of sexual assault there but it's not obvious.",
