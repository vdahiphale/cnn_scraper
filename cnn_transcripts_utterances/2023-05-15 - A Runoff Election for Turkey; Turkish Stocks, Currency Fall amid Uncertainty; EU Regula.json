We're predicting thatthis could go into the second round, or that we were going to see a win for the opposition. It had better ratings for Kemal Kilicdaroglu and you look at what happened. And look, the president really defied all expectations. And why is that? Because you are talking about a really polarized country where people were not going to shift and go to the other side and vote for the opposition. This is a country that is so divided, and you have two different visions for this Turkey. And the vision of President Erdogan is supported by nearly half the electorate, as we saw from these numbers. And, you know, critics would tell you President Erdogan does build on these divisions with divisive rhetoric, with these culture wars in this country and this did seem to work in this case. And at the same time, there are also questions about whether the opposition had the right candidate going into this election. There was a lot of criticism, a lot of people who didn't believe the 74-year-old Kemal Kilicdaroglu was the right candidate for the right time for this moment, when President Erdogan was at his weakest. There was this feeling even amongst his own coalition, at one point that there should have been a different candidate running in this election. So you know, you people would be looking now to the opposition, whether they lost that opportunity, if that promise changed, that they were promising people and if they should be looking back at this and the lessons learned.",

The president has dominated the vote in rural areas. The popularity remains high amongst religious, working class voters living outside the big cities. His opponent performed better in the more secular urban areas. Now, the attention turns to Sinan Ogan as we were just talking about, who came in third place. Becky Anderson now reports that the third place position and share could make him the kingmaker. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BECKY ANDERSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR (voice over): Sinan Ogan's five- plus percent of the vote will be crucial to secure in the run off on May the 28th when the country will head to the polls for a second time in a contest between Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan and the opposition leader, Kemal Kilicdaroglu. Ogan is part of the right-wing Ancestral Alliance, which is staunchly conservative, anti-immigrant and anti-Kurdish. He tells CNN that the alliance has not made a decision on whether to endorse either candidate, but he is making his demands clear. SINAN OGAN, TURKISH ATA ALLIANCE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE (through translator): What we're thinking is all the political parties should exclude terror organizations. We don't have to give our support to either of the parties. There is no such rule. When we first started this race, we thought we need to either win the government or we are going to be the kingmaker and we are at that status. Political parties like HDP, we want those candidates not to rely on parties that have no distance between terrorist groups and we succeeded in that. ANDERSON (voice over): Ogan is a former lawmaker for the ultra-nationalist, National Movement Party, which was allied with Erdogan's AK Parti for this election. But he was expelled from the party back in 2017, when the leader backed Erdogan's referendum to transform Turkey from a parliamentary system to an executive presidency. In the lead up to this election, Kilicdaroglu secured the support of the HDP. That's a leftist, mostly Kurdish party that is currently in court over its suspected ties to the PKK, a group that Turkey, the US, and EU have labeled a terror group. The HDP denies any formal links to the group. If he decides to throw his weight behind one of the candidates, Sinan Ogan expects those who voted for him to follow suit. OGAN (through translator): Our electorate is very bonded with us. And of course, where we lead to, they will come with us. Our base electorate wouldn't vote for those other candidates because Erdogan was the Islamist candidate and Kilicdaroglu was the leftist candidate, but who is voting for us is Kemalists supporting Ataturk, and that's why we got their vote. They consider us a younger leader, and we understand the world better today. ANDERSON (voice over): Becky Anderson, CNN, Istanbul. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

So I would say, for the rest of the world, this is going to be an interesting box that is going to go to textbooks most likely about what happens when you deviate from conventional policy, what are the consequences. And we're going to say that, when you do that, you are not really going to achieve the desired growth rate, but you're going to end up with more inflation, because Turkish growth rate has been losing momentum, despite all of these rate cuts, but from our perspective, it is much more than that.

It had already promised to make some of Activision 's biggest titles like \"Call of Duty\" and \"World of Warcraft\" available on rival platforms. But the US and the UK are saying that's not enough. And so it could come down to making even bigger concessions, like selling off big parts of Activision's business, which the company really doesn't want to do.

A lot of them prisoners or former prisoners and the Russian military itself. The Ukrainian assessment, though, is regardless of the status of Wagner, the Russians more broadly, no longer have the capability to launch a major offensive against Ukraine. They believe that they're well dug in and that they're coherent perhaps, they're likely to be a formidable defensive force. But in the estimation of Ukrainian intelligence recently, they don't believe they've got that offensive capability. Part of that maybe because of the grinding down of Wagner. The counter argument is that Wagner has been very useful in absorbing a lot of Ukrainians.
