This is the search area. Here's New Finland, this is the latest satellite loop.And what's happening now is that cold front has advanced eastward. So, improving conditions about as ideal as one could get for a search and rescue operation of this magnitude and this complex, considering that we're in the North Atlantic where ocean swells can very easily get above 15 feet. But right now, they're running about three to six feet and water temperatures there. This is the sea surface temperatures running about 55 to 57 degrees, according to analysis that we did here internally within the CNN Weather Center. So, we did a bit of deep dive into what conditions would be like on the surface and what they would be like at the bottom. And the search and rescue operations ongoing at the surface are not really impacted too much by the weather because, well, let's talk about that sonar ship, right. The many ships that are searching for this submersive vehicle -- vessel under water. There's just between the surface and 660 feet, really, not much of a difference in the ocean temperature, some of the currents mixing in with the wind and the sunlight, as well. But as -- when you start decreasing in depth, we're talking about 200 meters or 660 feet down to 3,000 feet, that's where we get to the thermocline, and that's where temperature drop dramatically, down from 50s all the way to about 39 degrees at that level. And then you go down even further, you get down closest to where the Titanic, what they were originally searching for around 12,500 feet, and that's where temperatures get extremely cold. Flirting with the freezing mark but just above that. And it's just amazing, Sara, when we dive deep into what really is happening and what they could be experiencing at those depths, if they do ultimately find the submersive vehicle, you know, we know more about the surface of the moon and distant planets than we do the depths of our ocean. That really puts into context. Sara.",
