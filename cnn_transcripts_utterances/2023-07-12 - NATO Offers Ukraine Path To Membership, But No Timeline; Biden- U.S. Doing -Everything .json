Biden's speech here in Vilnius will follow a rather contentious few days. Ukraine has very publicly questioned, why its western allies are waiting to formally admit the countries into NATO.Today, once again, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, struck two very different tones. He says that he is grateful for the great unity, his words great unity, and for new long lasting American security guarantees. But he also used rather stark terms to describe the costs of NATO's decision to keep Ukraine at arm's length. CNN's Arlette Saenz is over at the University of Vilnius where the president is getting ready to speak later this hour. Arlette, you're there at the university. What do we anticipate the president will say in this rather important speech?",

      "sentences": "Well, President Biden is expected to emphasize the unity and support that has come out of this summit for Ukraine, while also talking about the strengthen NATO alliance, which has really been one of his key priorities, as he's traveled here to the NATO summit in Vilnius, Lithuania.Now this summit got off to an incredibly tense start, as Zelenskyy had expressed frustration with the fact that NATO was not outlining a timeline for when his country could join the alliance. But both the president and Zelenskyy sat in a room together side by side and tried to put some of that tension behind them, as the U.S. and as G7 allies tried to share how they were trying to support Ukraine in this very moment and what they could do down the road. The president and G7 leaders were rolling out a series of historic security commitments to offer to Ukraine as it remains outside of the NATO alliance. These leaders will now jumpstart talks with Ukraine to establish some bilateral security commitments that President Biden said will help Ukraine not just in this moment, but also to deter future aggression that his country could face. It's really capping off a moment at this summit, where the president has tried to stress that a strong NATO is needed in this world at this moment. And that includes trying to bolster Ukraine in any way they can, as they are facing that war against Russia. And so much of this summit has also been aimed at sending a direct message to Russia, that the NATO alliance remains united, and that perhaps some of his worst fears have happened, as you're seeing in an expansion in the NATO alliance. And it's this continued support for Ukraine. So, in just a few moments, we're expecting President Biden to speak here at a local university. Once again, say arguing that the U.S. and western allies will be there with Ukraine for the long haul.",

And he said, what Zelenskyy needed to hear in the most direct way possible that the communique did not say, which was, you are going to be NATO members. It is when not if.And I think that, you know, repeating that, certainly the president will do that. But in the speech coming up, what he will try to do is try to raise this up a little bit higher than that and make this much more strategic. You noticed in that press conference with Zelenskyy, he brought in Japan, which seemed a little bit off topic. But I think it gives us a hint that this speech is going to talk about how this summit is bad news for both Russia and China. And we have seen this summit really bring together in the communique, the strongest communique ever calling out China as a threat to NATO interests, values and security.

In fact, Ben Wallace said, we are not an Amazon. We can't just keep producing at every beck and call of the Ukrainians.But at the same time, you know, the Ukrainians understand what they need to succeed on the battlefield. And that is what they have been communicating to the U.S. Of course, they want the long-range missiles from the U.S. They want more ammunition to sustain their counter offensive. But the U.S. now says, look, this is what we can give you, and the U.K. and the other G7 allies saying this is what we can provide you at this moment.

But for Democrats, on the other hand, they've been really focusing a lot of their questioning on Donald Trump. Let's listen to what Hank Johnson had to say regarding his questioning on this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JERRY NADLER, (D-NY): Them this hearing is little more than performance art.

I mean, that's what we're talking about.So, this is a manifestation of the Trump era here. Look, I'm not sure anything was accomplished this morning in terms of advancing the ball at all with the aside from just question after question being asked about this. It's almost a performance a Republican candidate has to do this. They have to question the FBI. But nevermind the people who are actually working in the FBI, there are a couple of them get headlines for, you know, some of their roles in investigating the former president, but the vast majority of them are, you know, hard-working Americans, many Republicans, some Democrats, et cetera, some non-partisan and it's a little depressing.",
