It's 9It comes as an intense diplomatic push is underway to prevent wider conflict in the region. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is in Turkey right now, meeting with his Turkish counterpart. U.S. officials say he will underscore the importance of protecting civilian lives during that meeting. On Sunday, Blinken made an unannounced visit to Iraq and met with the country's Prime Minister to discuss the Israel Hamas conflict. Meanwhile, in Gaza, communications are down again. A local operator says there was a complete interruption on Sunday of its telecom and network services. Aid agencies say they lost contact with their workers as the besieged enclave faced its third communications blackout. It comes as the heads of 18 aid organizations, including UN agencies, issued a rare joint statement earlier calling for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in both Israel and the Palestinian territories. The search continues for survivors of a deadly blast at the Al-Maghazi refugee camp in Gaza. Witnesses and an official at a nearby hospital tell CNN that the blast killed dozens and wounded many others on Saturday -- on Saturday night. He says it was the result of an Israeli air strike. And the IDF says it's looking into the circumstances around the explosion. Residents say the strike took them completely by surprise, leaving many to search for the bodies of their loved ones in the aftermath. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): I saw a red light, then we were shaking on the sofa. I saw all my sisters screaming. Then I saw my father. When I found myself alive, I looked to see who is still alive. We turned on the torch and my siblings were alive, but I did not find my father. I finally found him next to me. I moved him. I moved his hands. I moved his face. He did not respond. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

An entity with a terrorist army, an entity -- a terrorist entity with aerial capabilities and entity with subterranean capabilities.All of their efforts are to put hospitals in in harm's way. All of their efforts are to utilize fuel that could go to hospitals for their subterranean tunnels. All of their efforts are to exert maximum casualties, maximum deaths on Israelis, but also on their own people. And this is the challenge we are facing.

And indeed the head of the World Health Organization chiming in and saying that, you know, this kind of communication blackout needs to be reversed and that communication needs to be restored immediately. Because he says without connectivity, people who need immediate medical attention cannot contact hospitals and ambulances.Now we have in the past seen these blackouts happen and we do know that over the past 24 hours, the IDF saying that it struck more than 450 targets. We've seen it bisecting the Gaza Strip in two over the weekend, reaching the coast, splitting the Gaza Strip in two, saying that now effectively there's a north Gaza and a south Gaza. And it's also encircled Gaza City, which it describes as a fortress of Hamas terrorist activities, in the words of the IDF. So communications now do appear to be returning. That has been the pattern that we've seen on the previous two occasions that it's happened since October the 7th without any apparent need for repairs, which would suggest that this was the IDF's handy work.

New polling has got Trump leading in some states where Biden won the vote in 2020. Our White House reporter, Priscilla Alvarez, has more.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: A newly released poll is painting a grim outlook for the Biden campaign a year before the election. In a New York Times and Siena College poll, the president is trailing former President Donald Trump in a hypothetical match in four key swing states that includes Nevada, Georgia, Arizona, and Michigan. It's notable because President Biden won those states in 2020. And striking because former President Donald Trump faces a series of criminal charges. Now, the Biden campaign is downplaying this poll saying in statement, quote: President Biden's campaign is hard at work reaching and mobilizing our diverse, winning coalition of voters one year out on the choice between our winning popular agenda and MAGA Republicans' unpopular extremism. The campaign goes on to say: We'll win in 2024 by putting our heads down and doing the work, not by fretting about a poll. Now, the campaign also cited the 2022 midterm elections, where Democrats had a grim outlook there and did better than was expected. But there is still a long road ahead, and the president fanning out across the country to sell his economic message to voters who are still dissatisfied with the economy and who still have doubts about the President's age and his ability to steer the country. And the President too, is facing risks within his own party about the handling of the Israel Hamas war. So several headwinds to hail on the domestic and international front, as the president goes into the next year going into November of 2024. Priscilla Alvarez, CNN, traveling with the president.
