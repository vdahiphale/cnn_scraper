Max, you've been talking to sources since this news broke just a short time ago. We understand that the king has already begun treatment. Do we know how he's feeling?",

      "sentences": "Well, I'm told he's in very good spirits. He's pretty frustrated because he is basically confined to his home where he's receiving outpatient care. He could possibly be visiting the hospital, but they don't really expect that to happen.He's got a specialist team that he's working with, and he's carrying out his official duties as usual in terms of that top level constitutional stuff. So I'm told that the prime minister will still be having his weekly audiences with the king, and he'll still be doing the paperwork. We just won't be seeing him in public because the medical team has advised him against that. That isn't because he feels physically unable to do it. It's because they are concerned that being out and about could make him more vulnerable, considering he's had this treatment for his enlarged prostate combined with a separate diagnosis of cancer, not prostate cancer, I'm told, something separate that they discovered off the back of the procedure on his prostate. So I think that what they're looking at here is the queen carrying on with her official public duties, supporting the king. When he was in hospital last, she was in there every day seeing him, so she'll be spending time with him. And Prince William also carrying out some public duties as well, just to show that the public, that the monarchy is still ticking along, the constitution still holds together. Because of course, without the king's ability to sign off on key government moments, the whole system grinds to a halt. But that isn't a concern. I just will just say as well, I've been told that the councilors of state, members of the family who would step in for him if he became incapacitated have not been appointed. We would be told if that were the case. So that's when it would get pretty serious, although it may just indicate that he's going under anesthetic for a procedure that might not be too much of a worry, but they'd have to tell the public.",

Those attacks took place just a day after a joint U.S.-U.K. operation bombed 36 Houthi targets across Yemen. And just two days after the U.S. launched a punishing assault on Iranian-backed militia groups in Iraq and Syria, retaliatory strikes over the deaths of those three U.S. soldiers that were killed in Jordan in the previous month.The State Department says that moments ago -- or rather, the State Department said moments ago that Iraq was not actually given advance notice before those attacks were carried out. Today, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is making his way around the Middle East trying to ease tensions in the region, while the U.N. Security Council is set to meet in the next hour about the escalating situation. Let's discuss with former Defense Secretary under President Trump, Mark Esper. He's also the author of the book, \"A Sacred Oath, Memoirs of a Secretary of Defense During Extraordinary Times.\" Secretary, thank you so much for being with us. Do you think that this response from what you've seen so far achieves the U.S. objective to deter and prevent a widening of the conflict?",

If you want to increase the intensity of attacks, you could attack Iranian vessels or oil platforms.But look, they're not going to be deterred if you attack the proxy groups. This is our strategy. It's been our strategy for 40-plus years. It's why we're having to deal with Hamas in Gaza attacking Israel, Hezbollah attacking Israel from southern Lebanon, the Houthis. This is 40 years. They don't care about the proxy groups. They're only an extension of the axis of resistance. So if you want to deter Iranian behavior and the behavior of its proxy groups, you really have to start attacking things that Iran values. And a lot of those things will be Iranian things.",

This contradicts what we initially heard from National Security Council spokesman John Kirby about this. Do you think this is a miscommunication or perhaps a sign that there's tension between parts of the Iraqi government and the United States that's led to a level of distrust?",

      "sentences": "Oh, well, definitely. Look, I had to deal with this as well. I recall on the strikes we made, I think in late December 2019, early 2020, I called the Iraqi president just minutes before, you know, we were making our attacks to give him a heads up. And clearly he was not happy that it wasn't done far sooner.But we also knew that the Iraqi government was compromised. The Iranians were in there, at least Iraqis who are sympathetic to the Iranian cause. And so we knew that whatever we told the Iraqi government would be passed along to the Iranians. So, look, I don't know who's telling the truth here, but clearly the Iraqi government's been compromised. SANCHEZ: I'm also curious, Secretary, when you say that the U.S. should strike Iranian things to deter Iran, are you calling for a direct strike on Iran?",

Again, I go back to Iranian leaders of the Quds Force, Iranian leaders of the IRGC, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Iranian or Quds Force sites outside of Iran and Iraq and Syria, and I would work my way up that escalation ladder until Iran stopped endorsing, supporting, inciting the proxy behavior or until they messaged privately that they were done, that they didn't want to go further. So that would be my view.Otherwise, we should just accept the fact that these attacks will continue. You know, we're at 168 now over the last four months. We've responded less than 10 times. And otherwise, you've got to accept that's going to continue. We'll be at this whack-a-mole game for the next several months.",

      "sentences": "Well, they're in-depth questions. They really go to the heart of this matter. Now, this jury has been deliberating almost six hours at this point.Here's the first question. You see, the prosecution is proceeding on two theories of involuntary manslaughter, and a juror can select either one beyond a reasonable doubt. They have to believe it, and they don't have to be unanimous in what theory they are looking at. So one is that Jennifer Crumbley acted with gross negligence in causing the deaths of the four students at Oxford High School. In other words, she saw there was a risk that her son could commit bodily harm against others. She didn't do anything. She allowed it to happen, and that's gross negligence. The other one is that legal duty, that under the state laws of Michigan, you as a parent have a legal duty that you must prevent your child from causing harm to others, and that Jennifer Crumbley was aware of an issue with her son. She did nothing. She could have used ordinary care to stop something from happening, and she didn't, and that caused the mass shooting at Oxford High School. So the judge really said, here are the jury instructions. Two theories. Go back and deliberate. Then another question. This one's interesting, too. The jury asked, can we infer some things of evidence that didn't come into the trial about how the shooter -- that would be Ethan Crumbley -- got the gun, meaning got the gun to commit the mass shooting? Well, here are the facts that we know. We know that Jennifer Crumbley left first for work that day. She was gone. Ethan and his father were at the house. Ethan's father took him to school that day. There's surveillance video of the father dropping him off, but we do not know how he got that gun and put it in his backpack. Conceivably, there's only one person who knows that. It is Ethan Crumbley, and he did not testify because he asserted, along with his attorneys, that Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.",
