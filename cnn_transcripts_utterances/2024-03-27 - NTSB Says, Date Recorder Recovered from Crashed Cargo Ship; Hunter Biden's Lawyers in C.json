At the site of that collapsed Francis Scott Key Bridge, the six missing construction workers who were on the bridge when a container ship slammed into one of its support columns are now presumed dead. Dive crews are back in the water this morning and investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board will return to the ship. They went on board the ship briefly late last night and here's what we just heard from the chair of the NTSB. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They are speaking with the crew.And as you just heard the chair of the NTSB say, they have this data recorder, this black box from the ship. It is now at a federal facility. It is being analyzed. And they are hoping by later today, they are going to be able to put together a much clearer timeline of what led up to this catastrophe, what caused that near total blackout. You could see on the video the collapse, the ship, the lights on the ship flickering. We know that the pilot lost steering, that they had lost power on that ultimately led to the crash and the collapse of the bridge. So, we're hoping to get much more information in the hours ahead, though, the NTSB has said they really don't at this point want to speculate. We know that the Coast Guard is also monitoring the potential for more than a million gallons of hazardous waste, hazardous material that has potentially poured out of the ship into the Patapsco River because of the crash. And then, of course, that doesn't even begin to talk about clearing the bridge away so they can reopen the harbor. So, a very busy day here, Alisyn.",

Not to mention because of the currents, the area that they're searching has only gotten wider and wider. And so, as of now, I just spoke with the governor's team. He was heading over to speak with some of those rescue crews. As of now, they haven't found anything and conditions really aren't making it any easier for the divers who are trying to figure out where to look.

COHEN:  Well, we know that there was this mayday call that went out as this total blackout was unfolding, as they were losing power and losing the ability to steer. Fortunately, police were able to get that mayday call quickly enough where they could stop traffic, stop more cars from being on the bridge, Alisyn. Unfortunately, it was a matter of seconds and not minutes. They knew there was a construction crew up there. Radio traffic shows that police wanted to go reach them. They just couldn't get there.

Baltimore is, if not the busiest port in the ports in the U.S., it's certainly one of them. I think it's probably the busiest port, has been, for delivering goods in and out of our country. Also, supply chain issues are going to come into effect here because there are cargo ships that were waiting to leave following the one that crashed into the bridge and brought the bridge down that were ready to leave the port of Baltimore. They haven't been able to do that. You have all of the workers that are employees of the Baltimore Harbor and they're wondering about their near-term future in terms of work. Certainly, the people that have used the bridge for many, many years are not able to use it. So, this is a tremendous, terrible impact on transportation all throughout the Baltimore-Washington region and around the world also.",

You can't replace it, really. We have to -- the team at DOT and others have to get the channel open and get that port working again. In terms of rebuilding the bridge, I have no doubt, when Congress returns, they will step up like they have done in so many other occasions when funds are needed and when corrections need to be taken to really begin to plan for the rebuilding of this bridge. It will cost an enormous amount of money, millions and millions of dollars. Congress is going to have to appropriate that money. And I believe they will handle it in the way they've handled other crises around the country, whether it's fires or tornadoes or hurricanes. When additional money is needed, Congress steps up. And I'm confident, having served in Congress for 14 years and then having served as DOT Secretary, I've seen what Congress can do very quickly, and I believe they will.",

      "sentences": "Hey, Alisyn, it's kind of a big day for the president's son. His attorneys will be in a courtroom in downtown L.A. later today to try to get this case thrown out.He's facing nine criminal counts that were filed by special counsel David Weiss as part of his long-running investigation. A few of these are felonies, including alleged tax evasion and filing a false or fraudulent tax return, and it could carry prison time, very serious stuff. That's why Hunter's team is trying to get the case thrown out. They're attacking this from many different angles, but I'll just break a few them down for you here. They've argued that he was granted immunity, they've argued that the venue is not proper, and they say that's he's being politically targeted. Remember last year when there was that attempted plea deal with the special counsel and Hunter Biden? Part of that arrangement included an immunity provision, and the Hunter's team is arguing that that is still active. They've also made the case that these charges can't be brought in California because he wasn't living in the California at the time. But the most important part here, what I'm looking for today in court later, is the arguments about the political angle. They say that Special Counsel Weiss, who is a Trump appointee, they say he caved to pressure from Republicans, and the only reason why he's bringing this case is because of that political motivation. The special counsel has pushed back on it completely. He has taken flack from both sides. He's kind of been angering Democrats and Republicans along the way, but he is pushing back hard on this, Alisyn. Let me read for you what he wrote in a court filing earlier this month. He says that, quote, to state an obvious fact that the defendant continues to ignore, former President Trump is not the president of the United States. The defendant fails to explain how President Biden or the attorney general or the special counsel are acting at the direction of former President Trump or congressional Republicans. Alisyn, the Special Counsel is saying, we didn't charge this because of Trump. We didn't charge us because the politics. We charge you because we think you're guilty.",

Promptly after that, there were two orders that were entered. The first order was a gag order. It states that Mr. Trump cannot make negative comments or anything of an aggressive or threatening nature with respect to witnesses, jurors, court personnel, court staff. He is allowed to mention Alvin Bragg, but it is otherwise a broad prohibition.It's also interesting to note that shortly around that time also, Judge Merchan entered another order, and it was short and sweet, but it's warned everybody, including the attorneys in the case, that they must abide by all court orders and anyone that does not do that risks criminal contempt. So, clearly, Judge Merchan is sending a message, there's a new sheriff in town and he's going to apply this very strictly.",

And a criminal defendant of a very high level cannot engage in actions that would prejudice the proceedings or interfere with the smooth administration of justice.So, that First Amendment argument was considered by the judge. It was rejected. And this is really also non-appealable. They can try to fight this. But this is set in stone. Judge Merchan is not going to handle this case, as Judge Engoron did also in New York. This is going to be applied very strictly. And he's made a very specific warning that there will be criminal contempt consequences waiting in the wings if someone crosses the line.",

It may be the only trial. He knows that everything is going to be placed under a microscope.I think that he balanced this under the First Amendment in a very careful and appropriate way. This is really more of a common way where the court is very careful to ensure that when the proceeding moves forward that there's nothing that interferes with the administration of justice.

He's facing possible disbarment. And he's one of more than a dozen Trump allies to be charged in the Georgia election interference case.So, he's -- I should say, he's pleaded not guilty.
