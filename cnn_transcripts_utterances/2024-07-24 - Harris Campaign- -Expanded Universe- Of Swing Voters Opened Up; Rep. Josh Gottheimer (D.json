He's joining us now. Donie, what are you seeing? DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, Kate. Yeah, as you said there, just every sort of conspiracy theory imaginable floating around online. It's really, like, a lot of prominent Trump supporters are trying to test out, seeing what will stick and such. And look, some of these folks are hiding their racism better than others. Other people are being very blatant about it. I mean, just to give you a sense of the range of what is being said, there is even a birther conspiracy theory, a throwback to Trump and Obama. Of course, there's no basis at all whatsoever for that. The current vice president is eligible to be president. Also, we're seeing a lot of altered videos and images. Some of them are quite crude. I want to just give you an example of one, which I think we can show a side-by-side here. There is an image of the -- of the vice president there, which as you can see on the right-hand side her husband, the second gentleman. And obviously, been manipulated there on the left to put in a photo of Jeffrey Epstein. So look, stuff like that is pretty simple. It's pretty crude. But when there is so much stuff of it floating around online it can remerge and be used to kind of paint these various different narratives online. And even though you might look at that image side-by-side and say well, clearly, that's a fake, sometimes as people encounter this stuff on social media on their own it's not always as clear and it can kind of play into this idea. And I think one thing that's important to mention here as well, Kate, is we were both at the RNC last week. And one thing that struck me from being there is that we saw so many different -- these new kinds of propaganda outlets. The type of outlets that Steve Bannon is on, that Mike Lindell is posting. And these outlets are growing hugely. They're pushing propaganda and pushing this kind of misinformation at the same time as local newspapers and journalists are being laid off across the country. So really making the waters much murkier as we got into this election.",

      "sentences": "All right. This morning, a brand new memo from the Harris campaign. Campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon writes, \"This expanded universe of winnable voters is highly accessible to Vice President Harris.\" I think we have a graphic of this. \"We have a clear advantage on issues. They have been supportive of Democrats in the past and many are supportive of Democrats down-ballot. It is the job of the Harris campaign to win these voters.\"With me now, former Democratic presidential candidate, Vermont Gov. Howard Dean who was also once chairman of the DNC. Quite a resume there, sir. One of the things this memo lays out -- Jen O'Malley Dillon says that maybe under President Biden, she suggests, they were going to focus on the so-called blue wall -- Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan. But this sort of re-expands the map to the Sunbelt states -- Arizona, Nevada, Georgia, North Carolina. You were the architect of the 50-state strategy in the aughts -- 2000 aughts. Do you think that's realistic now? How does Harris expand the map? HOWARD DEAN, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, FORMER DNC CHAIR (via Webex by Cisco):  It's not only realistic, it's essential -- first, to do it in this presidential election. And we should never give up on a single state because if you do that, then you consign yourself for election after election after election to try and climb up this red wall. So I welcome this. I agree with the findings. I saw some -- a very surprising poll -- I think it was Reuters but I'm not sure -- that showed Harris up by two over Trump nationally. Now, we all know that national numbers don't matter. It's the -- it's the 50 -- the 50 states that matter. But yeah, her strategy -- Jen O'Malley Dillion and the vice president's strategy is exactly right, and they should be doing that. And they can win in North Carolina and Georgia, I think.",

So the shoe is completely flipped upside down here and now I think that Kamala has a great chance of winning this race.Young people are starting to rally. All -- you know, your previous section talked about all the propaganda on the internet. Well, that goes both ways. We -- on our side we generally don't use -- you know, don't use crazy stuff like Epstein. But there's a ton of stuff on Instagram of young people getting excited about Kamala Harris.

But I think we will see some additional discussions from her on policy issues. There won't be a huge amount of daylight between her and Biden, but she will be probably more progressive than Biden.

So the key, and I think what's got to be talked about today -- and I'm hoping the prime minister addresses -- is this is a bipartisan issue.

As I said before, I actually saw this quote from Hezbollah. One of the leaders of Hezbollah said, \"Israel is merely a tool. The main war -- the real war is with America.\" And I think part of what I'm hoping the prime minister talks about today is Iran and what we're doing to stop not just Hamas but how jointly we're doing what we can to stop all of their proxies who continue to attack our service members and continue to attack America. They see this as an -- as a war against America as well -- against democracy. And I think that's a very important theme and that this is bipartisan. There's nothing partisan about this war and making sure we do everything we can to stop it and get the hostages home, and get humanitarian aid in. I think those are all critically important themes and I think we need to focus on every step that's being taken to do that. Again -- and also, an appreciation for all the United States has done to make sure that we stand by our key ally, Israel. It's a bipartisan relationship.

When you have local law enforcement doing micro communication point-to-point around a suspicious person or a threat that's not being broadcast to the entire law enforcement stakeholder group at the site, that right there is a problem. What we heard from testimony yesterday was that officers that were assigned to cover -- basically, an overwatch position to cover this point of vulnerability -- this roof -- they actually left their post to go address the threat or go try to find the threat somewhere else. So what we're seeing here coming out through this investigation are two main themes. It's roles and responsibility were not clearly articulated from the Secret Service to local law enforcement around the criticality of their post and their responsibilities. And two, a breakdown in communication, whether it was communication from law enforcement to the Secret Service or how messages were prioritized between the law enforcement groups centered around specific threats that were identified.",
