That is a dramatic drop from the 10,000 encounters they were seeing days before the policy ended on May 11th.Now, as this is happening, authorities in California are investigating a second plane that arrived in Sacramento bringing migrants. Investigators say they were carrying Florida-based documents. This comes three days after a first group was flown to the city. CNN's Isabel Rosales joins us now. And, Isabel, I say carrying Florida-based documents. That gets to the issue of who paid for this plane, how did these migrants get sent there, correct?",

Good morning to you.That's the big question that the attorney general's office is working to figure out, who exactly paid for these planes and whether these migrants were, frankly, tricked into getting on these flights and being relocated over to Sacramento. I spoke with the attorney general's office about this second flight of 20 migrants dropped off in Sacramento and received quite a few new details. But one thing that was echoed is that these migrants carried paperwork with them pointing to Vertol Systems Company Inc. That is the same aviation company involved with the first flight on Friday that dropped off those migrants in Sacramento. Also these documents that these migrants had showed that Vertol was contracted by the Florida Division of Emergency Management. The attorney general's office says that these individuals approached the migrants speaking in, quote, broken Spanish and told that in order to go to Sacramento they would have to sign these forms. But not all of these migrants understood where they were going or even sign the forms. The attorney general, Rob Bonta, has said that these migrants were not fully informed and that it was not consensual. This relocation was not fully consensual. Notably here, Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida, neither him nor his Florida Division of Emergency Management have commented on these flights. California and Sacramento officials have said that they are not aware of any plans for further additional flights, but the mayor of Sacramento saying that it's a reasonable expectation that these flights will continue, saying his city is prepared. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR DARRELL STEINBERG (D), SACRAMENTO, CALIFORNIA: I'm not a criminal lawyer, but, you know, if you do lure people under false pretenses to -- and fly them to another state across state lines, I don't know what that is, whether it's kidnapping, whether it's some other crime, but it certainly ought to be fully investigated.

It also has the support of the Oklahoma state superintendent of education who called it a monumental decision. But that puts them at odds with the Republican attorney general in the state who goes on to say that approval of any publicly funded religious school is contrary to Oklahoma law and the interest of taxpayers in the state. It is extremely disappointing that the board violated their oath in order to fund religious schools with tax dollars.And an advocacy group called Americans United for Separation of Church and State also called this a sea change for American democracy. So, Kate, this is clearly headed for the courts and probably the fate of this school could very well rest at the U.S. Supreme Court. Kate.",

We now know this will become law in September.Still, people have turned out. We've seen a couple of bursts of tear gas. But for the time being it's been relatively mild mannered. And really these people out here today to show that they remain angry. The idea is that the French will head off for their summer break and by September Emmanuel Macron's even more ambitious reforms will be on the table. Very much the message of the last few weeks has been that even if this particular reform has gone through, it has cost him, Kate, so much political capital. And these scenes that have repeated themselves week after week should, think the protesters, send a strong signal that future reforms for the rest of his four-year term should prove remarkably difficult.
