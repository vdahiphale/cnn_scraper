I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York, sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. In Mexico, democracy and rule of law are under the spotlight. Thousands are protesting against highly controversial judicial reform plans that would require judges and magistrates to be elected by popular vote. Critics say the changes would weaken crucial checks of power and threaten democracy. President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has pushed the proposal along, and it now goes to a final vote in the Senate on Wednesday. In three weeks' time, the president, also known as AMLO, will be stepping down, and giving way to Mexico's first female and first Jewish leader, Claudia Sheinbaum. Although supportive of her predecessor, she could potentially inherit a country in flux. Whatever happens in Mexico could have direct effects on its northern neighbor. And with immigration among the top concerns for American voters as the November presidential election approaches, what will be the fallout? Joining me now is NPR's correspondent, Eyder Peralta, from the Senate in Mexico City. Eyder, welcome to the program. You have been covering this process since the beginning, and obviously, these protests have only been growing. For those around the world that are just reading and learning more about these reforms, explain what they entail exactly.",

It puts in a kind of a committee that will oversee the judiciary, which is appointed by the executive. But the huge change here is that judges here in Mexico will now -- or if this passes, will be elected. And the way it works right now is judges have to work their way up the judiciary and they have to pass exams. They have to first work in the district courts, and then they move their way up to be appointed to judges. That can take decades. This reform lowers the age limits for judges. It also means that, say a judge on the Supreme Court will now just have to run for office, and that is how Mexico will stack its federal judiciary.",

With these new proposed changes, virtually anyone with a simple law degree and a few years of experience in, quote/unquote, \"judicial areas\" can become judges through popular vote. In fact, if too many candidates actually register to run, the final contenders would essentially be chosen by putting their names into a hat and drawing out of that hat. If AMLO is saying that this is necessary to address corruption and other concerns, which are legitimate issues the judiciary is facing, how is this the remedy?

You know, he says that, right now, big businesses and the cartels, the organized crime control this judiciary. And what he says is that this reform would make judges accountable to the Mexican people. I think one thing that's actually very important to note is that this is what the presidential campaign that we just had in Mexico was all about. Claudia Sheinbaum, who is President Lopez Obrador's protege, she went to every sort of rally and she explained, she told to the Mexican people, look, we need to reform the judiciary, and this is the way we're going to do it. She explained this reform bit by bit. And once the elections came, the Mexican people gave Morena Party a super majority. And so, what the president is saying right now is, this is exactly what the Mexican people voted for. The judiciary, on the other hand, says that this will make the judiciary even more corrupt. And what is more -- I think when you talk to constitutional experts what they say is that really, no liberal democracy does this. Bolivia did it and it didn't work. Mexico actually used to do it in 1857. And then when the framers wrote a new constitution in 1915, they said that what electing judges did was that it put the judges in control -- or that it put the executive in control of the judges, and they called it an aberration in 1917. And they started selecting judges much the same way that the United States appoints judges.",

Why? Because a lot of these trade disputes, a lot of these business disputes, are decided by the Mexican federal judiciary. And at the moment, big businesses have -- they actually have trust in the judiciary, and they say that this reform will cause chaos. We should note that if this reform passes, it's going to take a few years for us to see the consequences of it. The members of the Mexican Supreme Court will get elected next year if this reform passes and then it starts -- the judges from the other lower courts will begin to be replaced afterwards.

      "sentences": "Well, for two reasons, Bianna. And thank you for having me. The first is that electing judges is alousy idea. If anybody thought it was a good idea, it would be done in many, many countries. There are some states in the United States that do so, but all federal justices or judges in the United States are appointed and then ratified by one branch or another or one house or another. And of course, the Supreme Court in the United States is appointed by the president and ratified by the Senate. It's a lousy idea. No other country does it except Bolivia, as Eyder was saying. And even that hasn't worked out at all. But most importantly, Bianna, the problem here is that the way the candidates for the Supreme Court will be nominated is through committees made up from both houses of Congress, the executive and the judicial branch, which means the deck will be stacked. The dice will be loaded. Only candidates that are close to the governing party, Morena, which has super majorities, as you said, in both houses and, of course, the executive with the new president and through the existing Supreme Court and other mechanisms, they will be able to basically appoint the new Supreme Court, which then voters will, in fact, ratify instead of really choosing. So, what this means, it's the end of an independent judiciary in Mexico. Now, this judiciary has been corrupt, it is true. It's ineffective. Very few crimes in Mexico are either punished or sentenced. All of that is true. Judicial reform is necessary in Mexico. But this is the worst possible judicial reform mainly because it does away with the dependence of the judiciary branch.",

And I'll follow that up with, is it your view that AMLO is using thisjustification as a ruse to put forward his own protectionist policies or do you think that, in his mind, he actually does think that he's proposing solid reforms?",

      "sentences": "Well, on the first question, the point is that most people believe that what's wrong with the Mexican judiciary system is the publicprosecutors themselves at a -- on federal level and at a state level, what United States are called district attorneys, state attorneys, or the attorney general and the Department of Justice. That's where the problem really begins. So, there are reforms that should be carried out with judges and perhaps even the Supreme Court, although it was already reformed in 1994, and most people, except AMLO, of course, believe it has done a good job. Now, the main point here is that this is part of an authoritarian power grabbed by AMLO himself. This is not the only reform that is up for approval this month in Congress or after October 1st. For example, this is all -- there is already a bill put forward with constitutional changes to eliminate Mexico's independent or autonomous agency, the Federal Competition Commission, the National Transparency Agency, which is freedom of information, the Federal Telecommunications Agency, and several more. He's eliminating all of those. He has also suggested he wants to eliminate the Federal Election Council, which will be then incorporated into the government. Everything that Mexico has done in terms of democratizing the country over the past 30 years, he wants to roll back. And he also wants, for example, to put an end to proportional representation, congressmen, which would lead to his party having not just a super majority, but practically the totality of members of Congress in the lower house. So, this is not just a judicial reform, it's part of a broader package, which clearly indicates an authoritarian drift in Mexico, which is what worries so many people.",

He'shad a very close personal relationship with him. And many people have said, including articles in The New York Times, that he was closer, perhaps, to the Mexican government than to the American government that he represents in Mexico. But secondly, because this is the government of the United States speaking, and it's not the personal opinion of Ambassador Salazar, as respectful as that may be. This is the opinion of the U.S. government, which has a free trade agreement called USMCA with the -- with Mexico and with Canada. And the government of the United States as well as several congressmen and senators in the United States, as many -- as well as many businesses in the United States seem to consider that the elimination of the independence of the judiciary branch in Mexico will be a violation of this treaty, which is up for review in 2026. So, this is not just an idle comment made by the ambassador, this is the official position of the United States government on an issue on which it has something to say because of the existence of this treaty and of course, the fact that Mexico is the United States main trading partner in the world.",

Mexican disagreements are settled in U.S. courts occasionally, Canadian courts and so forth, and many American disputes are settled in Mexican courts. If those Mexican courts are considered not to be reliable, not to be transparent, not to be independent, to be increasingly corrupt and captured by organized crime, by the way, as Ambassador Salazar himself said, that is a problem for trade, it's a problem for finance, it's a problem for all Americans, and it's a problem for the United States government.",

He is trying to ram this through in the last couple of weeks of his presidency before she comes to office. So, that's a problem for her. Secondly, this is already having a discouraging effect on foreign investment in Mexico. The peso has weakened severely over the last couple of months. There is money leaving Mexico as we speak, and this is something that she would not have wanted to begin with her administration with. Now, how much wiggle room does she have? Very little if this is actually approved on Wednesday as they're said and as you have mentioned, Bianna. If it is, this is the law of the land, but it's not just any law, it's the constitution. These are constitutional amendments which will be very difficult to reverse if they are passed on Wednesday.

It's not just the conservative presidents in Latin America who have been very critical of the election. I wish Mexico would. And Mexico carries a great deal of weight in Latin America in general because of its size and its economy, but also, because it has a tradition of foreign policy, of espousing noble causes.

You were raised in an orphanage up until the age of seven, when you were adopted by your mother and brought to the United States, you were born with six toes, webbed fingers, no thumbs and legs that were missing weight bearing bones. Ultimately, you had them amputated in the United States. And it was really sports that really helped you overcome so many of these emotional and physical setbacks to bring you to where you are right now. Talk to us about how you were introduced to sports.",

I mean, sports has been a huge instrumental, like, it's just huge in my life and it's helped me not only get stronger and healthier, buthelped me emotionally heal the wounds that people do not see in the scars that do not see. And then, also, start regaining power and strength within my body after the amputations. I definitely did not think -- I'd ever saw anyone like me being an athlete at all. So, I didn't think it was possible. And I just -- I don't -- like I'm just so lucky that my mom was -- when we moved from Buffalo to Louisville, Kentucky, she introduced me to the world of sports. And in so many ways, she saved my life by adopting me and saving my life there. And then, she also saved my life by opening the door of sports and then sports was that -- I feel like that third thing that really saved my life and gave me that purpose and belonging of an identity of who I am and that I belong in this world. And then that kind of transformed to helping that next generation or that young little girl who also feels lost and doesn't know where her place is in this world based on the things that her disability is visible or not visible. And for me, like, I just can't imagine life without sports. For me, my mom opening up that door. And rowing was that first one where I started processing everything for me and started growing as an athlete and growing as a person. And next thing you know, it transformed into seven Paralympic games.",

And it's just -- I didn't know where I, like I said, belonged in this world.

Explain why this quote, what does he mean, and why is it so significant? JASON STANLEY, AUTHOR, \"ERASING HISTORY\":  So, what our schools do and our textbooks do is they give us a vision of history that allows us to make judgments about policy. In the case of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the textbooks that Russians are brought up on do not represent Ukraine as having an independent history. They do not represent the Ukrainian language as genuinely separate language, and they erase the history of genocide that Russia directed against Ukraine in the 1930s, Holodomor. And so, Russians are brought up thinking that it's just not true that Ukraine is an independent country. And they're brought up thinking that it's offensive to Russia that Ukrainians claim they are an independent country. And so, that for them justifies the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Also, the Russian textbooks represent Russian incursions, invasions, really, into neighboring countries like Georgia and Ukraine as justified by a supporting in pro Russian independence movements. So, all of that justifies the ideology of the full-scale invasion.",

When you erase the history of social movements. For example, as they did with Jim Crow, when they erased the agency of black Americans from the Civil War -- from before the Civil War, like slave rebellions, through to the Civil War and beyond, then you're representing black Americans as lacking the agency to fight for their own freedom and equality. When you erase the history of social movements, you're representing hierarchy as permanent and unchallengeable. And that's what we're seeing in U.S. education. Instead of democratic education, we have patriotic education. We have the glorification of great men. And that idea is that it's not social movements rising as it were from below that make democracy more perfect, but -- that realize democracy, but instead the, great deeds of individual men. And then, you're removing the agency from people that's required for democracy. So, that's the first element that worries me. You're representing history as the deeds of great men. And so, why would people join social movements? Secondly, you're erasing the history of the dominant groups' oppression of non-dominant groups. So, you're -- in order to realize the democratic ideals of freedom and equality, we need to know who has been denied equality and why. When you erase that history and instead promulgate a myth of national innocence and national greatness, well, then you can't repair the inequalities of the past.",
