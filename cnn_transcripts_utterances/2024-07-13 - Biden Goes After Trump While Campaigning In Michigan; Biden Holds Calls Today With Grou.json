      "sentences": "Well, what you heard there, Jessica, from the president is the core of his argument that he is best suited to beat former president Donald Trump this election year and so he has been on the attack. Of course, he has been refining those attacks over the last several months as well as introducing new criticisms of the former president including, for example, that he is a convicted criminal, given what happened in the foreign president's criminal cases.But the president is also having to do two things at once. Go after his Republican rival, while also easing the anxiety among those within his own party and on that front, he has been engaged in an outreach campaign over the course of the week with his allies, including donors, Democratic lawmakers who all still harbor some concern about whether he is the best candidate to go up against Trump and whether he can serve a second term. So the president, when he's hitting the campaign trail now, the stakes are much higher. It's not just about what he says. I've been to multiple of his rallies where he does sort of gave a forceful defense of his record while going after his Republican rival. But it's also being judged in his performance and whether he does enough of this to engage with voters and along the way alleviate those concerns among his supporters. Now the question remains to be seen, but the president will also be going to Texas and Nevada next week where he's going to do more of the same and serve as counter-programming for the Republican National Convention, which will also be underway. So ultimately, while the president is trying to make the case about him being the best candidate to go against Donald Trump for his record, to be judged on the last three years, not the last 90 minutes, an argument we've heard repeatedly from him and the campaign, he's also behind the scenes having to work the phones to keep the Democratic Party in line. So it is certainly a challenging time for his campaign and one that he hopes he can make more of an inroads in over the next few days on the campaign trail.",

There he will officially become the party's presidential nominee for the third time in eight years. He's also expected to announce his running mate. It's a highly anticipated decision that's been overshadowed by all the debate fallouts surrounding the Biden campaign.

They really, for the past two weeks now, have been uncharacteristically quiet. Donald Trump himself really choosing to keep Joe Biden and the story and the criticism surrounding him and whether Democrats themselves believed that he is fit to serve for another four years in the center, and keep that to be the story.And so as we look ahead to next week, Donald Trump's team is very much gearing up for them to change the narrative and put the attention back on Donald Trump. And you mentioned the long anticipated decision of him announcing who his vice presidential nominee is. There's a lot of questions about when that will come. When I talk to Donald Trump's most senior advisers, they say, look, we really see Monday evening, that is when Donald Trump will be nominated for the vice presidential -- presidential nomination. That is really the deadline that they view when they have to announce. And so Donald Trump actually addressed this yesterday during a radio interview. I want you to listen to what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I have some really, really candidates and, you know, maybe leaning one way and that changes sometimes, you know, all of a sudden you see something that you like or you don't like, and you lean a little bit differently.

That includes several members of Donald Trump's family, including his sons, Eric Trump and Donald Trump, Junior, as well as Lara Trump, his daughter-in-law and the co-chair of the Republican National Committee, and Kimberly Guilfoyle, she's Donald Trump Junior's girlfriend, as well as an adviser to the Trump campaign. One person who as of now is not speaking, but I am told will be appearing with Donald Trump is the former first lady Melania Trump. That is very notable, Jessica, because really she has been very absent from the campaign trail ever since Donald Trump actually launched his third presidential bid. We've only seen her publicly twice. And so it's a really big deal that she's going to be appearing next week. However, as now we're told no plans for her to be speaking -- Jessica.",

He knows that there are concerns, but he's also going to communicate that this election is still about a choice, a choice on the issues.The issues debate has not changed and for as much as we have all obsessed about how Joe Biden did that night of the debate, Donald Trump had a horrible debate as well. And what you're seeing, Jessica, is what so many grassroots voters that are supporting President Biden are saying to him, in the rope lines, in the rallies that he has had since then, he has been fiery, he has been rigorous. He's been vigorous, he's been energetic. He has focused on going after Donald Trump. He has focused on going after the existential threat that he represents, especially to so many of those communities of voters that are represented by the grassroots, not necessarily by the Democratic elite, who are coming out against Joe Biden. So my hope is, is that all of those Democratic lawmakers and the donors who are still concerned, that they voice their concerns to him privately because I got to tell you at this point, Jessica, the more that those Democrats come out publicly with their concerns about Joe Biden after he has unequivocally said that he is the nominee and he is the nominee because he has the votes, he has the delegates, those lawmakers and those Democrats, when they do that publicly now, they are helping one person and that person's name is Donald Trump.",

The debate was catastrophic, not just in the national polls, but in this state polls and so I think the best thing that Joe Biden could do if he wants to beat Donald Trump, is to drop out.And I don't think there's any way that Biden can convince donors by -- he can't work harder, he can't call them up and persuade them because it's not like he had a bad night. He just doesn't have it anymore. So I think Maria was on to something, though. The one thing Joe Biden can say is I am not leaving. I don't care what you say. I am not leaving. And if you attack me then you are going to elect Donald Trump. And so I don't think there's any way that Joe Biden can convince us that he's perfect or great, or even fit at this point to be president.

And then you've got the progressive caucus that is rallying around him.I can only speculate on a couple of reasons why. So one argument would be that it's the moderates who actually are in danger of losing down- ballot in, you know, in November. So they have a vested interest in having a better, stronger candidate at the top of the ticket. So it's self-preservation more than anything. The other argument is maybe these progressives are pretty tough. You know, they're used to being kind of eccentric outcasts and not necessarily going with the mainstream.

And I think this is something the Israelis learned only after theywent into Gaza, after October 7th, because for years Deif survived several assassination attempts and the Israelis thought that he was just a figurehead, that he didn't really command the Hamas forces.

He said we are not going to let Netanyahu drag us to where he wants us to be.So at least for now Hamas is not saying that they're going to suspend the talks, but at least three Israeli officials I spoke to said that even if the talks are suspended for a few days after, you know, the initial shock from this assassination, they believe that this will increase the pressure on Hamas and as a result will help getting to the hostage and ceasefire deal.",

They would be considered present. So it would have to then go to a second round of ballots if he didn't get to the majority on that first round of voting. So he is he is correct that they can vote for whoever they want. The technical language in the Democratic bylaws, which if you really want a headache, try to read bylaws. It's called the Call for Convention. It is the most confusing document. But the technical language for them is that they should, in good conscience, support the winner of the primary in their state. But what does \"in good conscience\" mean? It's never been tested. Does it mean they don't think he can win and so they can no longer in good conscience support him? Does it mean that they don't think he's fit for the job? So that's a completely untested bit of language. But it's not, I think everybody agrees, legally binding on them. If somebody were to rise up and try to challenge him, they would have to get support before they did that.
