      "sentences": "Tonight, straight from THE SOURCE.It's the $48 million question that's about to be answered, for Rudy Giuliani, as a jury now deliberates the cost of his election lies. Plus, CNN getting rare access, inside of Gaza, tonight, as Clarissa Ward will take us to the frontlines, of the humanitarian catastrophe, the horrors that she saw on the ground. Also, Vladimir Putin taking questions, in his first extended news conference, since invading Ukraine, and evidently trying to put any rumors, about his body double to bed, using a deepfake to do so. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. A verdict is expected very soon, in the defamation trial, against Rudy Giuliani. And his, own lawyer says that it could be quote, the \"Civil equivalent of the death penalty.\" The jury, made up of eight people of his peers, will resume deliberations, tomorrow morning, in Washington. And they will be the ones, to determine just how much Giuliani owes the two former Georgia election workers, for nearly destroying their lives, with conspiracies and flat-out lies. Giuliani did not testify, today, after insisting that he would do so, backing out just at the last minute, with no real explanation about why. He also apparently didn't pay very close attention to the closing arguments that were made, by the lawyer, representing Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, the mother and daughter that a judge has already said he defamed. Instead, for more than an hour, Giuliani sat intently reading news stories, on his laptop, which was propped up, on the defense table. The former election workers are each asking, for at least $24 million, in reputational damages, after they were falsely accused, of committing election fraud. Their lawyer said he'll leave it to the jury, to consider just how much Giuliani should be ordered to pay, for those damages. That same jury heard gut-wrenching testimony, from both Freeman and Moss, and also these disturbing voicemails, from people, who threatened their lives. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I take it by that he means probably continuing to defame the women, outside of the court. And he also said, talked about his age, and said that he's having a hard time, accepting the facts about this case. ANDREW KIRTZMAN, AUTHOR, \"GIULIANI: THE RISE AND TRAGIC FALL OF AMERICA'S MAYOR\": I don't think he's having a hard time, accepting the facts. I think that one of the things, maybe the, reason, I'm most fascinated by Giuliani, and spent three decades, covering him, is this sense of moral certitude that he's right, and you're wrong. And he's, you know, this is the reason. He almost became a priest. And he's always felt that he has kind of the corner on morality, right, even when he does terribly immoral things. So, he's on the brink -- the brink of bankruptcy. He's been indicted. He's got 10 civil suits, against him. He's effectively been disbarred. He's been on a downward spiral. And he's almost hit rock-bottom, right now. And there he was, the other night, outside, saying that he was right, and Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, actually were fixing the election. I mean, he's a remarkably arrogant person, who will go to his grave, believing \"He was right. The election was stolen. Donald Trump was a victim.\"",

When the jury returns its verdict, there's going to be compensatory damages, meaning you have to repay these people, for the actual out- of-pocket damages they suffered, or economic opportunities they lost. Then, there's what we call punitive damage, which is this case is why we have punitive damages, because it allows the jury, to send a message, to tell him, \"What you did was so grotesque, so over-the-top that we need to punish you, deter you, and deter others.\" I think we're going to see heavy numbers on both of those.",

I think the way Putin answered it gave me the sense that he kind of enjoys, at least on this issue, being able to needle the United States. The United States wants something from him. They want Evan to be set free, as he should be. And Putin seems to be in no hurry to release him.
