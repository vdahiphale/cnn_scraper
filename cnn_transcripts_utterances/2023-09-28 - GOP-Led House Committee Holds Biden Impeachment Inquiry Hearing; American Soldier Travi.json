According to U.S. officials briefed after Private Travis King entered U.S. military custody after leaving North Korea, he was in good spirits, and spoke with his family.Since then, since landing at Joint Base San Antonio much earlier this morning, he was taken to Brooke Army Medical Center, where he will get a medical evaluation and begin the recovery. That's where Americans are taken after they have left detention so they can reacclimate to life back in the United States. What happens next, though? That is a question for which there doesn't appear to be an answer right now. We've asked the Army on this point. Because officials here had said he could face further disciplinary actions. He was absent without leave, and willfully and intentionally ran into North Korea, ran into an adversary state. That would certainly, you would expect, bring with it administrative action of some sort of discipline. The question, if and when the Army will bring that forward or his commanders will. And that' a question we don't have an answer to yet. We've asked the Army and they say that's down the road. Right now, we're focused on his recovery. But, Brianna, either way, it's a difficult choice to make here. He certainly went AWOL, and the military doesn't want to set a precedent by not bringing forward some sort of administrative action. But at the same time, he just spent some 70 days in North Korean detention.",

They have been making the trek for about 18 days.They're originally from Venezuela. A couple of families and some other stragglers who have come together, and they have gotten to know each other along the way. The reason we're walking right now with them, and some are trying to hurry up, is they're trying to go around a migration checkpoint. They were picked up on the riverbank on the Mexico side, taken in a van. Of course, they had to pay. And brought to just before the checkpoint. That's when they were all unloaded. That's where you can see these folks are walking behind high grass. They're finding their way to catch up with the same van, but on the other side of the checkpoint. We should point out we're able to go around it because we can choose any route because we're here legally. They are not in Mexico legally. In fact, they have not entered any of the countries since leaving Venezuela legally. Their hope, of course, like every else, is to get to the U.S. But this shows you a since of how what normally would be an hour's drive turns out to be a whole day for them turns out to be.

And that was even after they set basically a low bar for themselves.We were told that Republicans were not going to be breaking any new ground, that they were not going to be presenting new evidence. That really, they just trying to justify why they thought the impeachment inquiry was warranted. So to help build that case, they brought in several witnesses, including a conservative lawyer, someone was against both Trump impeachments and also some financial experts. But during the testimony today, several of them testified that while they believe there are some things worth investigating, so far, they have not seen any evidence of crimes or misdemeanors or impeachable offenses. Democrats, of course, seizing on that. And that is why there is some frustration in the GOP. One of those senior aides texted me and said, \"This is an unmitigated disaster,\" this was something that was \"completely unavoidable.\" Another lawmaker told my colleague that they admitted they were a little bit disappointed with the forum today and that they wished that there were more outbursts and memorable moments coming from the Republican side. Of course, overshadowing it all is the looming government shutdown. Democrats made that point repeatedly. They even had a shutdown clock on the dais. And the White House has been blasting out statements every hour, ticking down on that clock and saying, instead of trying to focus on what matters to the American people, Republicans are trying to waste their time with a baseless and evidence-free inquiry -- Brianna?",
