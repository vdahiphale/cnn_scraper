You weren't the only one who said that though. Gerard Baker, who is the conservative former top editor of \"The Journal\" said, they don't tell us anything new.

People were blaming Silicon Valley. So, they all tried to get their act together in 2018, 2019 and 2020. Whether they did it that successfully or not is up for debate. But part of that was having these conversations regularly with the FBI, with DHS, with DNI. And, you know, one thing that is a bit frustrating about these files is that it presents this as a huge revelation. We never knew that Twitter was talking to the FBI. They were putting out -- Silicon Valley were putting up press releases about the meetings they were having with them. That being said, I do think, you know, we shouldn't totally dismiss what's in this already. I mean part of the job we've been doing the past few years is holding these tech companies accountable.",

As an actor, you're aware of what people are doing and how they'reusing language. And language is an incredibly important tool that we discount to our peril. When cryptocurrencies call themselves currencies, they are not currencies by any reasonable economic definition. They are instead securities, meaning investments. But they're unregistered, unlicensed securities. We've actually tried this. In the 1920s, the roaring '20s, before the great crash of 1929 and the depression, we didn't have securities laws, federal securities laws. And so it's pretty ironic about 100 years later we're actually revisiting that era. And, unfortunately, what happens is that a lot of people get sucked in and then a lot of people lose money.",

And I say, no, no, no, you got it.It's not really that complicated. Blockchain, this, you know, supposedly innovative technology, it's a ledger. It's a way of storing information. It's really not revolutionary. It's been around for 30 years. It goes back to at least 1991 when Stuart Haber and Scott Stornetta, working at Bell Labs, created the first blockchain. But a Blockchain is just a - it's just a way of - it's a ledger, right. What they're doing is they're using it to sell you on a story that it's the future of money and amidst (ph) other lie. Ironically enough, it's actually the past of money. It's the attempt at private money, which is something we tried in the 19th century, and it failed. And in part it failed because of fraud.
