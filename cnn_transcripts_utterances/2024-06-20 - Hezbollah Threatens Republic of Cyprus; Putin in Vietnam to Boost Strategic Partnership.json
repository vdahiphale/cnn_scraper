An unexpected warning:  Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah puts the tiny island nation of Cyprus on notice. And a number that will shock you.

Hassan Nasrallah, saying -- excuse me -- no place in Israel would be safe in the event of all-out war. His televised speech focused on what he says is the group's expanded military and intelligence capabilities. That's followed Hezbollah's release of that purported drone video, showing Israeli military and civilian sites in northern Israel. Israel responding that Hezbollah will be destroyed in all-out war. Ben Wedeman joining us from Beirut. Nasrallah also had a pointed warning for the republic of Cyprus, Ben, saying it will be targeted if it allows Israeli forces to use its military bases or airports. Of course, Cyprus has held joint military drills with Israel several times over the past decade. What's going on here? BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, this reference to Cyprus really came out of the blue. We monitor Hezbollah media channels very closely. And there was no hint that this was coming. But clearly they're concerned, given the growing military ties between Israel and Cyprus, that somehow Israel will use Cyprus' Airports or bases, as he said, to launch attacks on Lebanon and particularly Hezbollah. So he issued this rather surprising warning against Cyprus. Now the response of the Cypriots was that, for instance, the president yesterday came out and said this was not a pleasant remark coming from Nasrallah. And that he insisted that Cyprus wants no part in any war or conflict, as he said. We heard also from a spokesman for the Cypriot government this morning, saying that no -- that Cypriot territory would not be used in any military activity if it comes to a war. But clearly, Hezbollah is concerned not only about what could come from the south but also clearly what might come from the West as well.",

And that does continue. The Rafah crossing between Israel and Egypt has been a vital point for aid into Gaza. Of course, now new video and satellite images reviewed by CNN show the passenger terminal on the Gaza side has been burned and severely damaged. The Israeli military conducted significant bulldozing and clearing at the terminal earlier this month, causing more destruction to a main building already damaged by fire in late May. Well, Russian president Vladimir Putin has been in Vietnam today to strengthen ties with the Southeast Asian country. It comes after a whirlwind visit to North Korea. Mr. Putin's Asian tour, as you might describe it, is aimed in part at showing the West that Russia does have friends all over the world. Despite international sanctions on Moscow by the West over its war on Ukraine, the U.S., a key partner of Vietnam, has criticized Hanoi's decision to host the Russian president. CNN's Mike Valerio back with us. This hour. Putin now making, now in Vietnam, making a tour of allied or seemingly allied countries or certainly countries who have remained at least neutral when it comes to the war on Ukraine. And that is, let's be quite frank, many countries in the global south; Vietnam, one of them. But it's an important stop. And one that has a lot of messaging in it, not least this show of force, Mike, and power. Well certainly, that is how Vladimir Putin would like this to be seen. Of course.",

This is, this police presence here, I have covered a lot of protests in Nairobi. I have never seen it quite like this. I've been covering protests since 2007. And this is one of the most extraordinary police presence that I've seen. You see using tear gas canisters, pushing them to the protesters, who, in most instances, are sending them right back to the police. The police throw a tear gas canister; they push it right back to them. But that's just -- those that you see directly, perhaps here, here's, here's one that's about to just -- that is the sound of Nairobi today, not just on this street but lots of many other streets where police are trying to push back largely peaceful protesters. They keep saying again and again that we are peaceful, do not disperse us in this way. But police keep doing this; if they're not using tear gas, they're using water cannons to push back these protesters, who are just trying to tell the government that life has become too expensive for them. These protests are about overtaxation. It began with a finance bill so unpopular that eventually, after public outcry, some proposals were dropped but still so many of them that are on the table. And these protests, as many of them young people, Gen Zs, I've met people as young as 18 on the streets of Nairobi today, who said that, here, because their parents could not, because their grandparents could not but they're here to make sure that the government of President Ruto listens to them. That's what is here from every contingent. There's horseback cops on horseback back there. I think there's probably about 200 policemen in just this street alone, Becky.

Colombia, that hosts 2.5 million Venezuelans, has an integration program basically. So there are countries that are taking the courageous decision.
