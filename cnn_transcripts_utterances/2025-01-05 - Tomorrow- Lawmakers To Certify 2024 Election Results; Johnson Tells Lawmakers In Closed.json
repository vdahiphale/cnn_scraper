(END VIDEOTAPE) RAJU (on camera):  Good morning. Welcome to INSIDE POLITICS SUNDAY. I'm Manu Raju. We're just 15 days from the presidential inauguration. And tomorrow is January 6th, the anniversary of the Capitol attack just four years ago, the day that Congress will vote to certify Donald Trump as the winner of the 2024 election. His allies in the House have been behind closed doors all weekend to build their strategy to advance Trump's agenda. And I'm told by sources inside the room this weekend that Speaker Johnson told GOP lawmakers that Trump wants one sweeping package combining everything from taxes to energy policy to immigration restrictions into one high stakes do or die vote. Now, the strategy will take months to unfold and will put Trump at odds with the new Senate Republican leader, John Thune, who has been preparing a narrower approach. And it risks pushing the slimmest of majorities to its breaking point. Now, the limits of that majority were just tested in that dramatic vote on Friday, which further revealing deep divisions and tensions within the GOP as it prepares to govern. Yet in the end, it was Trump who got on the phone with Speaker Johnson's GOP detractors, flex his power and helped get Johnson reelected as speaker on just one ballot. But his hardliners tried to derail Johnson's speakers bid. The anger within the GOP was intensifying, giving us a preview of Trump's return to single party rule. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. DAN MEUSER (R-PA):  I think they are somehow or another, asking for attention as well as negotiating for themselves rather than for their constituents or their country. REP. DALE STRONG (R-AL):  Some people right now are putting their personal self in front of this country. REP. STEVE WOMACK (R-AR):  There will be many an opportunity over the course of the next several months as we prosecute our agenda to stumble and to shoot ourselves in the foot. We can't rely on help from the left, so we got to carry this on our own. REP. DERRICK VAN ORDEN (R-WI): This is not show friends, it's show business. We're given a mandate by the American people. REP. LAUREN BOEBERT (R-CO):  If there's enough compromise that is damaging to the agenda, then there -- there very well could be a motion to vacate. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But what concessions did they gain?They basically got commitments that that Mike Johnson will work with them and not lean too hard with Democrats.

Just look at the people who held out in the first reading of the speaker vote. There were nine Republicans.Ultimately, that's now the magic number to actually initiate a motion to vacate the speaker of the House. Under the new rules that were just adopted. It used to be one. And that's what led to the ouster of Kevin McCarthy back in the last Congress. And then there was just the warnings that were that were by those similar members of the on the far right, the House Freedom Caucus, saying, we voted for Mike Johnson for speaker because of our steadfast support of President Trump and to ensure the timely certification of his electors. We did this despite our sincere reservations regarding the speaker's track record over the past 15 months. And then they went out to lay out a number of demands that are, you know, well see if they're able to accomplish that, but they will be very difficult. Everything from deep spending cuts to what they consider a fully secure border.

The party puts all of its emphasis over the first piece of legislation and then other issues start to take shape, like the midterm elections. And it becomes much harder to legislate. And what they decided yesterday is for Trump to say, Trump told the Republican leadership that he's willing to go and lump everything in into one big bill. That includes energy policy, that includes border restrictions, that includes tax policy that is different than what many Senate Republicans wanted, including the leader, the new majority leader, John Thune, who wanted just a quick win on border and energy policy because he thought it could happen quickly, tax policy.

I think that there was a feeling like every Republican was being unfairly blamed for what happened that day among the House GOP. And so they started pushing away. I think what the important lesson of that day was, and tried to kind of put it in the corner. But then you saw Biden using it again and again on the campaign trail, talking about January 6th, talking about the important need to protect democracy. And that made some of the Republicans, especially sort of the far right corner, push even further away. But that's why I also think it was really important to have people like you and me there, because we saw how horrendous that day was. It was chaotic, and I don't -- I still don't even have like a very y good idea of the chain of events. But I do remember how terrified people were and that we were holding pens, and in order to prepare ourselves of being attacked, if we went into the Capitol hallway.

You saw those numbers. Only a third think that the January 6th protesters should be pardoned, or the ones who committed crimes. Almost 4 in 10 Americans think that Trump himself did something illegal. So the history around this among American voters still really is divided. But our psychology as human beings and as voters is really interesting. Even just four years back, the things you remember and the things you don't, I think the period of intense inflation and the rising price of goods and people's just desire to shut off COVID and make all of those memories go away. All of this has also contributed to the things that we remember as voters and the things that we don't, and the things that people want to get back to. And a lot of voters we saw in the polling made that judgment. I would take the chaos around Trump term one, if it means more money in my pocket. We're going to see how long that memory lasts. We're about to find out. But right now, those the post-Trump years and the inflationary pressures that came with it erased a lot of the psychology that existed right after.",

President Biden is headed to New Orleans with the families of the victims.Trump, meanwhile, has been faulting Biden's border policies as the culprit, even though that suspect behind the attack was a U.S. citizen. But Biden himself has also made his own points as he plans to leave the public scene. Just yesterday, awarding the Medal of Freedom to Hillary Clinton, among others. And then earlier in the week, handing out the Presidential Citizen's Medal to Liz Cheney, a clear rebuke of the incoming president, who had suggested that Cheney should be jailed for her lead role in investigating the January 6th attack. And then there is Trump's criminal sentencing in his hush money conviction on 34 counts of financial crimes. That will happen this Friday, a decision that infuriated Trump even though he is not expected to face any jail time. My panel is back. Let's start with the Liz Cheney aspect of it all, giving her the award last week along with Bennie Thompson. Both of them leaders of the January 6th Select Committee. Trump, while the Speaker's vote was playing out on the House floor, posted on social media what was really on his mind was Liz Cheney. And he went after the decision by Biden to give her that medal, among other things. In this long post, he says Biden rewarded her only because she hated, quote, \"TRUMP\" in all caps. What was Biden's -- was Biden doing this to send a message to Trump? MAEVE RESTON, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER, \"WASHINGTON POST\": Absolutely, you know, and I think that that there's a -- you know, Trump in recent interviews has said that members of the committee, including Liz Cheney, should be in jail. And you know, Biden in a not at all subtle way by awarding her this Presidential Citizen's Medal, which is, you know, one of the highest honors, spoke of her courage and really made it clear that she played a pivotal role in American history by sort of standing up against her party. And the room there at the White House. There's just -- there was so much sort of adulation for her. And, you know, at one point when John Kerry was recognized, he like tapped his heart and, and pointed to her to sort of emphasize the importance of her role. But at the same time, as we were just talking about, you know, the work of the January 6th committee really didn't ultimately change many minds. And a lot of Democrats had hoped that that would, you know, help tip the election in their favor. But it is I think that President Biden does feel that some of these final acts need to recognize the people who did stand up to Trump. OLIVIA BEAVERS, INCOMING CONGRESS REPORTER, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\": It's not just that, though. I think Biden -- there's no love lost between Biden and Trump. And I think Biden in his final days is using some opportunities to take shots. He seemed to be making comments when he was eulogizing Jimmy Carter and saying different things about how, in ways that seemed like they were digs at Donald Trump's character and leadership. But the other is also how Donald Trump handled the New Orleans attack, saying we're not going to jump to assumptions. And so I think that this is also just a few last shots that he gets to take as president for the incoming president.",

So everyone needs to kind of do their homework and know what the facts are about things. I think when it comes to Biden, it's probably not the way he wanted his presidency to end. We can all agree on that. But he has a couple of weeks left, and he is going to make as many trips as he can, put as many medals on as many people and as many in as many rooms. And it's not just to troll Donald Trump. It's, I think, to try to cement his legacy. We saw him largely withdraw from kind of the here and now, the things that are happening in the final days and spend much more focus on whether it's judgeships, people who could have jobs for life or whether it is designating the establishmentarians, the institutionalists, the figures who he thinks are important for Americans to remember and respect. That is his focus now is those final acts in a presidency.

And hearing the bell toll 39 times for the 39th president of the United States, was so remarkable. That now is a National Park Service site. And then seeing the long motorcade go from Plains, Georgia to here in Atlanta, over more than a 2.5-hour drive, people lining the roads at overpasses and then stopping at the state capitol. That of course, is where he had his first elected rise at the state level, as state senator and then, of course, ran for governor. He lost the first time, and then he won, of course. And that was the really turning point. And we learned so much yesterday just about the importance that civil rights and the legacy of the South played in his governorship here and then indeed in his presidency. And seeing who he chose to participate in the service, was also so instructive. Morehouse College, the glee club there, of course, the historically black university here in Atlanta, sent him off with a stirring Battle Hymn of the Republic. That was by design as a nod to the civil rights legacy. So Jimmy Carter clearly was a modern governor in the South. There's no question.
