We began this hour with a big day on the presidential campaign trail. All the presidential hopefuls are out in full force today campaigning across the country. Former President Trump is in Las Vegas where he is set to hold a rally and just a few hours. It will be the first-time hearing from Trump since a jury ordered him to pay more than a $83 million to E. Jean Carroll. Trump's remaining GOP rival, Nikki Haley is in her home state of South Carolina, as their rivalry grows more bitter ahead of that critical primary. It will also be a busy day in the Palmetto State for President Joe Biden, he was campaigning there as well. It comes as the president is now endorsing a bipartisan Senate deal that could lead to the U.S. shutting down the border with Mexico. The border, a huge campaign issue. We have a team of correspondents out on the trail. Alayna Treene is in Las Vegas with Donald Trump. Eva McKend is in South Carolina with Nikki Haley. But let's begin with Priscilla Alvarez, who is also in South Carolina. Priscilla, what more can you tell us about Biden sudden embrace of a tough new crackdown at the southern border?",

      "sentences": "Well, Fredricka this marks a stark shift from where the White House was in the early days of the administration and appears intended to fend off any attacks on immigration policy from former President Donald Trump.Now, this was a rare statement that President Biden put out last night as these talks are still ongoing. And only hours after House Speaker Mike Johnson said that any deal reached in the Senate would be dead on arrival. President Biden calling this compromise tough and fair. But it was one line in particular that struck current and former administration officials I spoke with as well as immigrant advocates, and it was this one: \"It would give me, as president, a new emergency authority to shut down the border when it becomes overwhelmed and if given that authority, I would use it the day I signed the bill into law. Now, according to our colleague Manu Raju, there is language in this compromise that would allow the Department of Homeland Security to shut down the border if there are daily crossings of over 4,000 across a one-week span. Now, this is reminiscent of what happened under former President Donald Trump. When a COVID-era restriction allowed authorities to turn migrants away, and immigrant advocates have long said that the U.S. should not take this policy. This would be a decade's long, -- or at least a departure from decades long protocol and could bar asylum seekers from seeking asylum along the U.S. Mexico border. But it does underscore the realities for President Biden, despite having campaigned in 2020 on restoring the border and asylum. They have these harsh realities with a record migration across the Western Hemisphere. And the statement on Friday night, trying to get ahead of former President Donald Trump, who's already trying to tank a Senate compromise. Fred.",

So, she is holding 13 fundraisers in five states, just in the next 3-1/2 weeks. She is hoping that she can have a little bit of Hometown Glory here in South Carolina, and win here with the voters that know her in a way that she was not able to capture Iowa or New Hampshire. Her campaign telling us that she has raised upwards of $2 million since New Hampshire. And she is telling those voters that not only can she sway conservatives, but she can also win the moderates and independents that the former president cannot win in a general election.

That's a long time. And remember, there is been a lot of different border crises, issues regarding immigration, since then. We had the Gang of Eight, we've had, you know, Trump, separating families at the border. So, to see Biden so low on this, means that he really needs to focus on it. Now, if Trump is to tank this deal in Washington, that also runs a risk for him. Anytime there's a consternation about how Washington is behaving, people immediately look to the leaders. And former president Trump is basically running as an incumbent right now. So, it would be really interesting to see if this deal goes down, exactly who voters blame.",

Somewhat historically unpopular, there is a lot of people will be casting votes against candidates instead of for them. And I was in New Hampshire for the past 10 days. I heard this from voters for Haley, for Trump for Dean Phillips, and for Biden. So, many people were casting their vote against someone. And so, that has a real problem in terms of driving out turnout, and what that might do to voters over what will be an incredibly long campaign. My colleague, Adam Nagourney, just wrote a story about this, about how rare this is in modern American politics and elections. To have such a long election. So, it could drive down turnout, it could turn off voters. But at the same time, this is not a political system that embraces third party candidates that really gives them even an opportunity to mount a realistic campaign in terms of ballot access, money, creations, all of that.

And then, internal polling from some of our allies that showed when it was a head-to-head matchup, she was statistically tied.Now, when that polling was coming out, she was still deflecting, just using her normal line, that chaos follows him, rightly or wrongly, trying to kind of step back by saying, I'm not saying this is bad.",

And New Hampshire showed us that former President Trump has a stranglehold on the Republican base. He won 75 percent of Republicans who turned out. Haley was able to win 58 percent of independence, and that's how she closed that gap. Those voters are the ones who want to hear attacks on former President Trump. So, she's going to make this up. That's where she needs to focus. And at the same time, the reason Trump has been trying to pivot towards a general election, aside from obviously, wanting to be immediately crowned the nominee. The longer Haley makes these attacks, the clearer it is that he has some pretty significant vulnerabilities with independents and middle of the road voters. You know, her winning a significant number 58 percent in New Hampshire, according to exit polls, is a weakness for him in a general election matchup against Trump. And as more states that have either open or semi-open primaries cast their votes, that can become an increasingly problematic issue for him as he tries to position himself the more winnable candidate in a general election.",

You know, he likes to think of himself as a strong leader, no weaknesses. He's smarter than everyone else in the room. So, here is his former ambassador, someone who was in his administration saying, he wasn't necessarily the smartest person in the room. That's going to really get under his skin. Now, whether it appeals to voters or not. We'll see. But I think when you look at some of the more vitriolic responses the former president has put on Truth Social is often come after attacks, such as those from the Halley campaign.",

Mr. Blinken, Mr. Biden, Biden administration, what should I tell my daughter? What should we teach our children that are growed up? For my son -- my older son is 21 years old. What should I tell him, where is his brother? He's a full-born -- from Florida. He was born in Florida, 21 years old. What should I tell him? That our government that -- that we prompted the Americans, we proud, deeply proud. And we -- I came there in '96 to live the dream. And I'm living it until this moment. Until my government supported a government like such as in Israel since 1948. But my heritage, I can go back to 1870 with my heritage. My great grandfather, the same house I was born in, in 1982. But I have to tell my son, 21 years old, I'm sorry, he was shot by our government that is hungry to kill children. And we are supporting it.",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WHITNEY WILD, CNN LAW ENFORCEMENT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): More than two weeks after 38-year-old Ricky Johnson, 37-year-old David Harrington, and 36-year-old Clayton McGeeney were found dead in the back of a Kansas City home, there are few details and frustration is growing. Adrianna Juarez, who shares a child with Ricky Johnson, says she feels too many questions remain about how long it took to find the three friends.",

According to police, when there was no answer at the door, she broke into the basement of the residence and found a dead body on the back porch.

I wonder, how will the examination of the bodies help determine the cause of death? CASEY JORDAN, CRIMINOLOGIST &amp; ATTORNEY: Well, the police are on the record of saying they don't believe there was any foul play, which would mean that they suffered some kind of traumatic harm probably because of somebody's specific intent. What's taking so long, of course, is that we have three dead victims, and they need the toxicology reports. What they're waiting for right now at the medical examiner's office is those reports. And the trick is that because they're all found in the same location, the backyard of the friend where they'd been watching the football game, you want to figure out if all of them kind of matched, to triangulate those results. Right now, the biggest theory, the one that makes the no sense, is that these three men probably died of some combination of drugs and alcohol. The big question is, did they know what they were consuming? Did they consume unknowingly a very strong opioid that could have killed them, perhaps at different times, but slowly? And if the cause of death is hypothermia, the question is, why weren't they able to get up and go back into the house?",

One on the porch and two in the backyard.And the question is, the young man who's renting the house, who says he was unaware that people were trying to get in touch with him for two days -- he didn't look at his phone, he was basically sleeping for 48 hours -- how come he didn't actually get up and notice that their cars were still outside of his house? I mean, this is why the families are really upset and demanding questions from the occupant of that house, who's being portrayed as a brilliant scientist, somebody who clearly should know better. And his lawyer said he sleeps with headphones, with a big fan. But that really doesn't explain how those three men ended up behind his house on the back porch, in the backyard. And the toxicology exams, the results are really going to bring the answers home. I think that's why the families are really upset. Tomorrow marks three weeks since they were last seen.",
