Whether it's with writers and their employers or it's a, you know, level of the Congress and the president.Life has changed, the world has changed. Whoever anticipated that there would be a war in the Ukraine? I certainly didn't. And it's impacted, you know, the rest of the world and it is continuing, the world is ever changing. So, we just need to embrace change, compromise, and move forward for everyone's benefit. KATE BOLDUAN, CNN NEWS CENTRAL CO-ANCHOR:  Compromise, hard to come by. Much -- as needed now as ever. Alan Suna of Silvercup, it's great to see you. Thanks for coming in. Thank you.",

      "sentences": "This morning, a historic deal has been reached to protect the Colorado River. Three states, California, Arizona, and Nevada have agreed to conserve at least 3 million acres feet of water supply over the next four years, that's around 10 percent of the water that those states receive from the river for drinking water, irrigation and power generations. In exchange, the states will be compensated with about a billion dollars in federal funding.CNN's Lucy Kafanov has been covering this and has the details for us. This is a deal that really had to be made, Lucy?",

      "sentences": "Yes. I mean, look, it's not final yet. It still needs a federal environmental review. The upper basin states still have to sign off on it. But it is a significant breakthrough, John, and one that comes after months of very difficult negotiations, stalemate in fact, several missed deadlines. Last time we were on air talking about this, the federal government had actually threatened to basically make these unilateral cuts across the board if states could not reach some sort of agreement. And this deal, announced yesterday, it should, at least theoretically, prevent that.Now, under this new agreement, most of the reductions would be made by water districts, they'd also be made by farmers, cities, as well as native American tribes in California, Nevada and Arizona, which would essentially take less water from the river in exchange for about $1.2 billion in federal grants. And as you pointed out, it would save about 3 million acres feet of water from now through 2026. That is a lot. That is enough to supply 6 to 9 million households per year. But this deal doesn't necessarily go far enough. The proposed cuts amount to about half of the reductions that were initially called for by the federal government. That said, it would still slash a significant amount of the total water use in the lower Colorado basement -- basin which is a historic reduction that will likely trigger significant water restrictions on the region's residence as well as farmland. This is a very important farming area that's being affected here. And of course, we have to keep in mind, the Colorado River is the lifeblood of the region. It supplies water to more than 40 million people across seven states. But the amount of water flows has shrunk significantly in recent years by one-third from its historical average. This is because of drought, population growth, climate change. And because of that mega drought, the river's reservoirs, we're talking about Lake Powell, Lake Mead have declined dramatically. The water there -- water levels at those reservoirs have gotten so low that there was concerned that the dams would actually stop generating power. And so, this deal would also allow for the federal government to make additional cuts if the reservoir levels dropped further. But it doesn't necessarily solve the problem of climate change and water overuse. And so, experts say if anything this is a positive step in the right direction that buys a bit more time while we scramble for a more sustainable solution. John.",

      "sentences": "Well, Kate, what we can learn from this new data is that the synthetic opioid fentanyl is definitely still playing a role in this rise in drug overdose deaths. But also, we're seeing a rise in meth-related deaths as well.So, when you look at the five most frequent opioids and stimulant drugs involved in drug overdose deaths in the year 2021, that's the most recent year for which data are available, you see on this chart, fentanyl is right up there with 21.6 deaths per 100,000 people. But it is followed by meth which surpassed cocaine as the second most common drug involved in these deaths. Then cocaine, then heroin, then oxycodone. So, that's where we are when it comes to the types of drugs driving this rise in overdose deaths. And with fentanyl, we know it's a deadly synthetic opioid. It's about 100 times more potent than morphine, about 50 times more potent than heroin. But also, we have to remember, it's not the only factor driving this trend. There's also the rise in meth-related deaths. And we're also seeing an impact on social factor, like stress, job loss, unstable housing. So, all of those factors play a role in this complex situation. Kate.",
