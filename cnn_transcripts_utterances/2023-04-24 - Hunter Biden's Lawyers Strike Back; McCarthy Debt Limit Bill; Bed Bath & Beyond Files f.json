They allege that this is, quote, an illegal conspiracy pointing to comments that Ziegler made on Steve Bannon's podcast late last year where he alleged to have an insider inside one of the banks helping him to get this information. Now, we've been told by a source familiar with the legal strategy that Ziegler is a primary focus for the legal team right now. They have also filed a lawsuit accusing him of harassing lawyers on Hunter Biden's team. We've reached out to Ziegler's attorney for comment. Now they also sent a letter to the ethics office seeking an investigation into Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene for her comments which they allege have been derogatory about Hunter Biden, as well as her, quote, promotion of conspiracy theories and publication of personal photos and data. Now, the Treasury Office of Inspector General did get back to us. They said they have received this letter and they are reviewing it, but we have not heard back from the congresswoman's office.",

We've learned that it was Hunter Biden's legal team that actually requested this meeting, seeking an update on this long-running investigation into their client. We've learned that in attendance is expected to be at least one career Justice Department attorney, as well as the Trump- appointed U.S. attorney, who has stayed on after former President Trump left office and has been overseeing the investigation into Hunter Biden.Of course, that raises the question, what exactly is going on with that criminal probe? We've learned from our reporting that prosecutors have narrowed possible charges down to a few possible tax crimes and possibly one charge related to a false statement in connection with a gun purchase. But, of course, no charges have been filed up until now and there really haven't been any public events. This is the first thing that's actually happened publicly in this investigation in a long time, but I am told, Kate, we are not likely to get a final disposition on the case from this meeting this week.",

Others, meanwhile, are hopeful with these new laws, saying that the police force needs some help here. That this could save the capital city after a spike in crime. Specifically, they point to the homicide rate, which has doubled in the past decade in Jackson, at 12 times the national average, peaking in 2021, making Jackson one of the deadliest cities in the United States. So, let's talk a little bit about what these new laws do and what will happen in Jackson. It will allow the state of Mississippi to expand state-controlled police to the entire city of Jackson. This is a force that has not -- has primarily focused on protecting the capital and the surrounding areas, has not been involved with law enforcement in the city. This is a force that does not answer to local officials but rather state-appointed leadership. The other side of this is the judicial system. Major changes coming to that, including new court -- a new court with a judge appointed by the Republican state chief justice, and also prosecuting attorneys appointed, again, by the Republican state attorney general. One of the supporters of these new laws is the man who signed them into law. That's the governor, Tate Reeves. Here's what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. TATE REEVES (R-MS): Jackson has so much potential. I've lived in Jackson for almost a third of my life and I want what's best for Jackson. But for us to continue to see young kids getting killed in the streets, for us to continue to see property crimes that are happening here that are causing businesses to leave, we've got to make sure that we have law and order.

Meanwhile, the city of Jackson is over 80 percent black and primarily Democratic.The NAACP did electronically file a lawsuit on Friday when these bills were signed into law, and here's what they had to say. Lawmakers and Jackson residents have opposed both bills throughout the legislative session citing outside attempts to increase policing without adequate training, silence dissent from Jackson residents and strip residents of their voting powers to elect judges and district attorneys who serve their interests.

The skier belongs to a highly skilled French mountain sports team. You can see him right there falling hundreds of feet initially. He tried to slow himself down by digging his hands and skis into the sides, which I guess seems like a pretty smart thing to do. The fall happened last year, but the team just posted the video to remind people even expert skiers, to not fall into deep crevasses and take proper safety precautions.So, with the help of teammates, a rope, some pick axes, the skier was able to climb out in just five minutes.
