Despite that dangerous and very bipartisan experience, the reaction to Trump's third indictment has been very partisan. Very different coming from those on Capitol Hill.CNN's Manu Raju is tracking the reaction and what this all means from there. He's joining us now. Manu, what are you hearing from lawmakers this morning?",

      "sentences": "Well, Kate, as you know, it is recess right now on Capitol Hill. So, the members who want to speak out are the ones who are generally rushing to Donald Trump's defense on the Republican side of the aisle. Donald Trump had strategized with his top allies on Capitol Hill to come out in his defense. You're not hearing much defense of the former president's conduct in the run-up to January 6.But you're hearing attacks against the Justice Department and the accusations from leading Republicans and Speaker McCarthy of bias by not pursuing the Hunter Biden allegations and instead pursuing an indictment against former President Donald Trump. But I did put the question to several top senators last week, right as we were expecting a third Donald Trump indictment. Some of them indicated that they believe it will ultimately help Trump politically. And others said that Donald Trump was not responsible for any of the violence that occurred on January six. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. JOHN THUNE (R-SD): What's happened so far certainly hasn't seemed to affect his support. You know, like I said, I think that you've got to make sure you're supporting -- allowing the justice system to work. Flaws are broken. SEN. CYNTHIA LUMMIS (R-WY): And so, the strategies to dig back as far as you can and Trump up some charges against him, is just backfiring. SEN. TOMMY TUBERVILLE (R-AL): People came into the Capitol that shouldn't have. But the more and more we find out about it, a lot of it was instigated through the FBI, and some other people.",

Mitch McConnell, the Senate GOP leader, has been silenced so far, unlike Speaker McCarthy, who has defended Donald Trump. And of course, that has been similar to the past two indictments but it also underscores how different these two leaders view Donald Trump, his role in the party, and how to respond to these charges, Kate.",

Will Hurd too, is a reluctance to go after Donald Trump on anything. And as he goes through this process where we not only have to see the government prove what Donald Trump did but also what his intent was, we know that Donald Trump is going to use a George Costanza defense of it's not a lie, if you believe it.

They hope that somebody else will knock off Donald Trump. They hope that Donald Trump will go away on his own.

So, John and Kate, we just got noticed about 15 minutes ago that the jury has reached a verdict after only 10 hours of deliberation on this question of life or death for 50-year-old Robert Bowers, who, as you said, committed that atrocity back in 2018, at the Pittsburgh synagogue, here in the city.So, here's what we're expecting at this point. At this point, the jury still is not -- I stand corrected. We're just getting information from the courtroom. The jury is walking in now, John, as we speak. And we're expecting a few different things. This is a long process to actually get to the point of making this decision, whether it is death or life in prison. There are -- right here on -- I have the jury form right in front of me. There are more than a hundred mitigating factors that the defense has put up, basically to spare Mr. Bower's life. They've said these are the factors that the jury should consider when they're thinking about whether or not to kill him. The prosecution, though, they have a number of aggravating factors as well that they've presented to the jury over the course of several weeks to say that these are the reasons why Bowers should be sentenced to death. Now, I bring this up because the judge in a matter of moments is going to read off all of the aggravating factors. And all of those mitigating factors, like I said, over a hundred, and the judge is going to read out how the jury basically weighs those two elements. So, if the jury is unanimous in the aggravating factors but only a few of them think that some of the mitigating factors are important, that is what we're going to hear in the next couple of minutes. And, John, this is important because the death penalty here, the decision to give Bowers the death penalty or not, is actually very mathematical, or at least it's presented this way. The judge says to the jury. You have to take all of these aggravating factors and take all of these mitigating factors and weigh them. Basically, on the same scale and see which one comes out as more important in this jury's mind. And then -- and only then can you make a determination if you are going to be sentenced to death or life in prison. And just to give you an example. Some of the aggravating factors, the prosecution said include the shooter showed no remorse and the shooter targeted Jewish people. Some of the mitigating factors the defense is brought up is that Robert Bowers has suffered from mental illness or that he had a hard childhood. So that's what we're going to be waiting for. Again, Bowers is rising right now to face the jury. The jury is in. We should be getting some this decision on life or death momentarily. John. Kate.",
