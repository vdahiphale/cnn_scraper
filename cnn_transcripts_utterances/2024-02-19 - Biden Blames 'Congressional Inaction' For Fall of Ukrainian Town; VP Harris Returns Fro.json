Ukrainian troops were forced to withdraw from Avdiivka in the Donetsk region with Congress unable to pass a new aid package. President Biden blaming that pullout on a dwindling supply of ammunition that has been forcing Ukraine's military to ration supplies. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Kim, good morning to you.Can you help us understand the significance of the fall of this town, and help us also underscore why it is that the lack of American money has contributed to it? KIM DOZIER, CNN GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST (via Webex by Cisco):  Sure. Avdiivka isn't a huge town. It isn't that strategic though taking it does free up roots into parts of Ukraine that Russia wants to take. But it is Russia's biggest territorial win in about nine months and it marks a change in momentum after we've had largely static lines after Ukraine's largely failed counteroffensive. So one of the reasons that the Ukrainians had to pull out of this town is they're conserving their artillery ammunition. This is the kind of stuff that they lob that keeps the troops on the opposing side further away. It's a standoff weapon in the military term of art. Being the major manufacture of it or the country that can manufacture it fastest and supply Ukraine is the United States. There are European countries that have signed deals with Ukraine to supply them more but it takes them minimum, a year -- up to 20 months to get an order off of the assembly line. The U.S. has most of the stocks that Ukraine needs right now. And basically, European -- Europe's defense industry -- they talked at the Munich Security Conference of needing five years to be able to stand alone without U.S. support and supply Ukraine and anyplace else that gets attacked.",

But clearly, he would have felt as though he could do this without the repercussions being such that it would be damaging to him.

One of the things that Russia is able to do is throw a lot of different versions of something that happened into the information space and confuse people. But one of the other things they do is make themselves look strong against the United States. Make the U.S. look like a bully. And the strange thing is to watch U.S. politicians eating that up and then parodying the same sort of slogans that you're hearing in part of Europe that are starting to go pro-Russia as well.",

This week, Vice President Kamala Harris is going to be back in the crucial swing state of Michigan. She is focused on reproductive rights. The visit is the second to the state in just a month. And it comes after her high-profile trip to Munich. She spent the past weekend trying to reassure European allies and embracing the sudden opportunity to be the most prominent American voice on the world stage as news broke of Alexey Navalny's death. This as Harris tells reporters she is, quote, \"ready to serve\" and has been taking on more responsibility for some of the Biden campaign's most central political issues.

Also, political and financial leaders among Black men. But she's also been talking, for example, last week -- last Saturday, at the Naval Observatory, she had a meeting with six Democratic governors from around the country and there was a lot of talk about the way abortion rights have been talked about by the Biden administration -- the Biden campaign.

So it seems like the RNC is juggling there.But Kasie, one other thing that I thought was very interesting about what Sen. Scott said there is that he's absolutely right the American people want to be talking about economic issues and those kitchen table issues. But the problem for the Trump campaign in his reelected bid is that if he's continuing to have to make these courtroom appearances -- to have to -- you know, continuing to vent and complain about the decisions that are made in these courtrooms, that's already distracting from those economic issues.
