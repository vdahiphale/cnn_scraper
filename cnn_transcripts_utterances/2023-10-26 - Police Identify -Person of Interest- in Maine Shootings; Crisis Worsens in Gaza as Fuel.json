We'll have that in a moment.But first, an update on our breaking news from Lewiston, Maine. Local police have now identified Robert Card as a person of interest in the shooting deaths late Wednesday of at least 22 people at two different locations. Card is described as a certified firearms instructor with the U.S. Army Reserve and is considered armed and dangerous. His whereabouts are currently unknown. Local residents have been urged to stay indoors with those doors locked. Thousands of people have also reported - being injured in these shootings and has left these small communities stunned and in disbelief. As soon as we get new developments, we'll bring them to you. To your primetime national address, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has made his first explicit reference to a ground invasion of Gaza. He gave no details about timing but added the decision of when to begin the offensive would be made by him, his war cabinet and the Israel Defense Forces. Netanyahu promised a crushing victory over Hamas, declaring all Hamas fighters to be dead men walking above ground, below ground, and outside Gaza. And already he says, thousands of terrorists have been eliminated. He made no mention of growing international concern over the civilian death toll in Gaza but says Israel is recruiting the support of world leaders because Hamas is ISIS, and ISIS is Hamas. And for the first time since the deadly Hamas attack on October 7th, Prime Minister Netanyahu spoke about his own role in the security breakdown which failed to prevent the worst terror tack in Israeli history. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, PRIME MINISTER OF ISRAEL (through translator): Citizens of Israel, the 7th of October is a dark day in our history. We will fully clarify what happened on the southern border and in the area adjacent to the Gaza Strip. This failure will be investigated thoroughly. Everyone will need to provide answers, myself included, but all of this will happen only after the war. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Limited humanitarian assistance has been arriving in Gaza since the weekend.

But without fuel for trucks, the U.N. says, there is no way to distribute supplies of food, water, as well as medicine.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TAMARA ALRIFAI, SPOKESPERSON, U.N. RELIEF AND WORKS AGENCY: We are talking about over 600,000 people in our shelters and our school, that who expect to receive clean drinking water from our water desalination plant, who expect to receive bread that is baked in bakeries, all of these need fuel to be able to operate.

If the hospital is not provided with the necessary fuel for the generators, we are issuing a death sentence, this doctor says. The execution is in the hands of the free world. Everyone is guilty. Water pumps will soon stop working, too, making it even more difficult to get clean drinking water. Bakeries are closing, aid deliveries are more difficult, and more than 2 million people, half of them children, already under bombardment and under siege could face starvation. The clock is ticking.

Israel often accusing the U.N. of bias. The claim made by Guterres is not the first time that's been made. It's been made by other officials as well, but it just seems to have provoked this reaction among the Israelis which has now escalated way beyond calling for Guterres to resign. SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN CORRESPONDENTYou obviously have the U.N. in Gaza desperately calling for Israel to allow fuel into -- into Gaza so far with no luck. Despite that saying that it's going to run out of fuel within a number of hours for -- for its operation. You also have the U.N. Security Council unable to reach any kind of a resolution, calling for a humanitarian pause or a cease- fire or anything like that in Gaza right now. And that's where Antonio Guterres had made these comments at the U.N. Security Council meeting. He said that it was plain that there were -- violations of international law taking place in Gaza. He was critical of Israel for forcing people to evacuate the northern part of Gaza to the south where they continue to bomb by the way.

Also to report any suspicious activity.Joining us now from Dallas is Chris Grollnek, an active shooter expert. Chris, thank you for being with us. So Chris, there are a million possibilities right now of what could actually happen next. But from what you know of active shooters, what you sort of know of their profile. Any idea what he could be thinking, what he may be doing or planning to do to avoid being caught? What are the possibilities here? How dangerous is this guy? CHRIS GROLLNECK, ACTIVE SHOOTER EXPERT: Great question and thank you very much. Number one, I think that it would be disingenuous to say there's a profile. There still is -- after 25 years of having these, we still don't have a profile of what a traditional active shooter is or who they are. They range from age from 7 to 9 (ph) to all the way to 83 years old. And their weapons of choice change, or locations. It's usually somebody that share common traits of being misunderstood, bullied, tired of society, of grievance, workplace, family violence -- all sorts of things that can grow into these things. What makes this one unique is traditionally, active shooters end in three ways. The person commits suicide, the person is captured or shot at the scene, or they run out of bullets and give up or you know, the third way obviously being shot by the police and another bystander. There are ways at the end. These do not go on like this and traditionally they don't go from one location to another. This is a unique active shooter by all stretch of the imagination where they have wherewithal and physical capability to where if you and I are driving down the street and we almost get in a collision, that adrenaline rush that was going through our body, would make our muscles almost freeze and our bodies freeze. That's when we won't be able to do anything. This person not only took the lives of all the people at the bowling alley but had the wherewithal to get in the vehicle and drive to another location, repeat it. We know he drove to another location, we don't know if he shot there, that's just in dispute there (ph). And then he drove about what 50 miles away where they found the car abandoned. So everything that we know of commonalities between active shooters is not demonstrated in this other than the lethality. And we're seeing it get worse because of that.",
