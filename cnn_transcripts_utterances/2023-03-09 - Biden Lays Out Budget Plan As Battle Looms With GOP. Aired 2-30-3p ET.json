What are they going to do if one of them gets really sick?Well, thanks to the American Rescue Plan, which not one single Republican voted for, that I signed into law as soon as I got into office, millions of Americans, millions more enrolled in the Affordable Care Act, saving an additional $800 a year for better coverage, better prices. My budget is going to make those savings permanent. They were up to now, but they'll expire if they don't get it done again. The MAGA Republicans all voted to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. They voted to get rid of it over 50 times to get it done, since Barack passed it, 50 times. (CROSSTALK)",

So, we've seen more land - for example, I've been in more helicopter rides these last two years, particularly from Arizona all the way up to Idaho, all the way to the west coast. More forests have burnt to the ground than the entire state of Maryland, the entire size of the state of Maryland. Look what's happening. The Colorado River has become a creek. You have all of these environmental problems that are so profound, they're hard to deny. And people are seeing them now. Along with extreme super storms and droughts. That's why took the most aggressive action ever, in all of history, in any country, to take on the climate crisis by lowering your home energy bills, which MAGA Republicans voted against. We've gotten to the point where it's cheaper to generate electricity from wind and solar than it is from coal and/or fossil fuels. And I'm from Scranton. I'm not against coal, per se. A lot of people made a living on that way. But we're providing incentives for folks to make the transition. So here's what we're doing. We're providing you with a tax credit - (APPLAUSE)",

No, I'm serious, not a joke.Well, if you need a heater, you need to buy one of the heat pumps, you get a tax credit for doing it. And water heaters. Tax credit to weatherize your home with better windows and doors. I gathered together leaders from American Autoworkers on in the South Lawn of the White House, all of the American manufacturers, two summers ago. And guess what? They all agreed. Within the next month, they came to me and said, we're going to go all electric. We're going to go all electric. And that's going to save billions of gallons of gasoline burning into the air. It's not only going to save the environment, it's going to help create really good paying jobs. Providing a tax credit for folks who buy electric vehicles. Encouraging them to do it. We're still going to need combustible engines. We're still going to need oil for 10 or 15 years. All of a sudden, it's not all going away. All of this is going to lower energy costs for families on the average of $1000 a year and create good-paying union jobs. (CHEERING) (APPLAUSE)",

Literally, more corporations are incorporated in the state of Delaware than any other state in the United States combined. It used to be, when I was in high school, when I first got started, those corporations had some greater social responsibility. They paid higher taxes. They actually saw to it that people - they trained their employees. They don't train them anymore. I met with - when I was vice president, I met with the secretary of commerce. We met with - don't hold me to the exact number - 346 CEOs. Said, what do you need most? You know what the most overwhelming request was? Better educated public. Well, guess what? Back then, they used to educate their workers. The Dupont company by a new industry, they would educate them how to do it. They're not doing it anymore. One other thing started happening three or four decades ago. American companies started to ship jobs overseas. Why? Cheaper labor.

Because we didn't make - we invented it in America. We miniaturized them. We made them better. And guess what? They went all over overseas, in Southeast Asia, other places. So when the pandemic hit them and they had to close down, we had no access to computer chips. You can't make an American automobile without those chips. You can't make a refrigerator without those chips. You can't make a cell phone without those chips and so on. So - and I've spoken with my European friends, heads of state, made clear to them, we're not trying to deny them of anything. But here's what we're going to do.

In addition to that, we can get back to leading the world in inventing and innovation. Now, we used to support - we used to spend, we used to spend, 2 percent of our entire gross domestic product on innovation and science. We now do 0.7 percent. I propose - what I proposed was the thing called the Chips and Science Act, to make sure America leads the world in innovation, especially in manufacturing those semiconductors. Those are those small computer chips the size of the tip of my finger that power everyday lives, cell phones, automobiles, refrigerators, artificial intelligence, so on. America invented these chips and made them faster, smaller and more powerful. We used to provide 40 percent of the world. Now we're down to 10 percent. Today's automobiles need 3,000 of those chips. American automakers couldn't make cars because there weren't enough chips available. That's why, remember, the price of cars skyrocketed and they shut down assembly lines. So we did everything from refrigerators to cell phones. We can never let that happen again. Since I've been president, we've already seen companies commit from around the world from South Korea to in the United States, companies committed $300 billion to build chip factories all across America, $300 billion.

Today, it's now less than what we were getting - closer to 1 percent, but less than 1 percent.We used to rank number one in the world in research and development. You know where we rank now? Number nine. Nine. China was number eight. They're now number two. Number two. This new law in my budget will deliver funding to help us lead the world again. My budget also will invest in critical issues that matter to families. Increasing the supply of affordable housing, all of which will generate economic growth and prosperity. I said to my introducer, he said I bought a small home and I worked on it. I said, guess what? That's how every middleclass family came to be. Why? Because you build equity in that home. After two years, five years, 10 years, you may have $10,000, $20,000, $30,000 in equity. You can borrow against it to send a kid to school and to do a lot of things. So folks, look, MAGA Republicans are calling for defunding the police Department and defunding the FBI now. That's a good one. I like that one. Well, guess what? They refuse to provide funding that's going to keep communities safe and secure. You talk about crime. My budget invests in public safety. It includes funding for more training, more support for law enforcement at a time when they expect to play many roles. We expect our cops to be social workers, psychologists and mental health counselors. You know, more cops are killed responding to domestic violence calls than anything else. Did you know that? Folks, I don't want to defund them. They need more help. We don't expect a cop to be everything from a psychologist to a counselor. Today's departments need more investment in this kind of help. We're going to fund proven strategies for accountable community policing so cops know the communities they serve. And communities know them. We've got to get cops back on the street. Back on the street in the communities they know, where they know the people, where they stopped in and they know the guy who owns the liquor store. They know the preacher that runs the local ministry. They know the person who runs the local grocery store. When we did that in the Biden crime bill, crime just plummeted because they know folks. I remember I was in Wilmington, my son used to be the attorney general of the state of Delaware. He would have his folks go out and knock on the doors. There was a lady who called who lived on 4th Street, an area that's kind of tough. She rented one of these old Victorian homes, the kind that had the outcropping on the corner of it. And she could hear the gangs below getting ready to do what they're going to do. She was scared to death to call anybody. She knows, if they found out it was her, they would be back. So my son made sure the cops gave their phone numbers to people in the neighborhood with a commitment they would never say where they got the information. Guess what? A lot of crime dropped. They would pick up the phone and say, they outside, I can hear them. They're talking about what they're going to do. Cops need help. There are some bad cops, by the way. What we did, my Justice Department just did in Louisville, Kentucky, was long overdue to put those suckers in jail. (APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)",
