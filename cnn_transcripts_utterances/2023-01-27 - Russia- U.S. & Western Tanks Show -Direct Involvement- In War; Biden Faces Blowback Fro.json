ADAM SCHIFF (D), CALIFORNIA: Well, I met with Senator Feinstein a couple of days ago and have talked with her periodically actually talked by phone a couple days ago and met earlier. She has been very gracious, expressed the same sentiments you just played. That was, you know, welcoming of my running for the office. She hasn't made a decision about her own plans. But, you know, I explained that I think our democracy is deeply at risk. It remains threatened by these extreme elements of the Republican Party, including the former president, and I think a big challenge. And part of the reason why it's so vulnerable is that for too many millions of Americans, the economy just isn't working.

I've never backed down from these kinds of difficult fights. And, you know, sadly, as long as Donald Trump is the leader of that party, then our values, our country, our democracy are going to be at risk. But I do want to underscore where I think this is all coming from. And again, I think it's the fact that over the last two or three decades, our economy has become structured in a way that people can be working full time and still not make enough to get by. They see their quality of life as less than their parents and their children's future and it leads them to consider a demagogue who comes along and says that they alone can fix it.
