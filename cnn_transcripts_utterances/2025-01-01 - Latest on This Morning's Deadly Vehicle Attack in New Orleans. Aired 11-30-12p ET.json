Law enforcement officials tell CNN the FBI is looking into possible associates of the suspect, including connections that they may have had to the State of Texas.But last check, according to officials, they believe that the suspect acted alone. But again, very early in the investigation, and that could change. With us now is former NYPD detective Tom Verni and CNN Senior Law Enforcement Analyst Charles Ramsey. Tom, from your experience as a former NYPD detective, what stands out to you right now?",

I don't know what else he said because we couldn't decipher it. But, Tom, I want to go back to you. And welcome, Chief Ramsey. I'd love to get your thoughts as well.I want to talk about the security around this. You had said that this was considered a soft target. If it's considered a soft target, would you have expected more security around there? From what we know, there were just these flimsy barriers at the entrance there that anyone could just drive through. I believe we have some video of that. And an eyewitness said that that's all he saw as well, and he thought that was peculiar. And of course, this was before this mass casualty event. Let's put up that video, guys, showing our audience what I'm talking about here so that they know. Go ahead, Tom.",

It would be almost impossible, I won't say completely impossible, but almost impossible to have driven a truck down any of those streets to get to Times Square to cause this sort of carnage and damage because there are multiple layers of security apparatus put in place to prevent that from happening.And, you know, with all the best laid plans in place, your attempt is to try to prevent or deter an incident like this from occurring by putting in place different things that will make it difficult for whether it be a group of people or a lone wolf actor to do something like this. Now, it's my understanding that there was some construction in the area that was being done, which indicate why they have these bollards that were lowered into the street that would normally prevent the vehicle from entering that street. And they were lowered, I assume for that reason, but it's still unclear.",

Bollards for our audience not knowing what they are, they're these tall steel barriers that a truck wouldn't be able to just drive through. And so, it does raise all kinds of questions why that wasn't there. Unfortunately, I don't believe we've showed the video yet of what the actual barriers were that were there.So, I want to go to you on this. You know, there is this question raised, Chief Ramsey, on the timing of this at 3:00 in the morning rather than at midnight when the crowd was really out. What do you make of that? And the suspect who was driving this truck with Texas license plates, we don't know if it was rented or not, and these explosive devices as well.",

We're hoping to find out from officials soon. They're going to have a press conference here in about 20 minutes. That's what we're expecting.I'm wondering what your perspective is, Tom, from the NYPD perspective, to what Charles Ramsey said about, you know, sometimes with these cities, they don't have the resources to keep the same amount of manpower and the overnight hours. Was that something you all ran into at NYPD? What do you make of that?",

      "sentences": "Yes. Well, I mean, NYPD has got a -- you know, a series of problems going on right now there. But even with NYPD, prior to 9/11, you know, we had an upwards of 41,000 police officers. And now, their manpower is down to around 30,000. So, you've lost, you know, 10,000 to 12,000 bodies, which makes it extremely difficult for -- to police a city like New York with, you know, eight and a half to 12 million people there on any given day.So, you know, to sort of offset that. You have to use other methods of trying to either oversee or protect certain areas, critical areas like that. Like the chief had mentioned, you know, using vehicles. So, what would happen is in New York City, if you were going to have a secured area, and you would need to open and close that street periodically, you would -- you potentially would use police vehicles to do that. You'd have them, you know, operated by police officers, and they would either block off the street. And then move the vehicle back when you need to get apparatus from personnel in there and then re block it off again as sort of a temporary measure, if need that someone with a vehicle like this wanted to take a drive down the street and cause chaos.",

You would think that that would have been top of mind for security officials there as they try to prepare the area for these New Year's revelers. Now, 10 dead, more than 30 injured.

You have a vehicle. You probably have at least one residence, maybe one in New Orleans, one in Texas somewhere. You've got social media. They're going to be seizing any kind of electronic devices going through. And even though he's dead you still want to get all the information you possibly can because, you know, from an intelligence standpoint, you need to know as much about this individual as possible. And you always have to keep in mind and make sure this was a lone wolf. This was a lone actor, nobody else involved. You got the Sugar Bowl tonight, you got the Super Bowl coming up. And let me just say, the Sugar Bowl isn't the only big football game today. There are a lot of football games taking place. And I'm sure that any city that's hosting this right now is taking a look at their security and maybe pushing out the perimeter a little more to make it a little harder and cut traffic maybe a little further back than you normally would, just to make sure you don't have a copycat that would do something that hopefully doesn't happen. But you know, we have a lot of idiots around that just do stuff like this that you can't explain why, but they do it and you have to be prepared for the very worst possibility.",

So, we're no stranger to policing major events.But this is something that -- I mean, there were 300 offices in proximity to where this madman, this evil person perpetrated this violent incident. So, how do you police that? How do you stop that? You know, but there's always a lesson to learn. What more can we do and can we do? I mean, look, you're talking about an iconic, legendary street, Bourbon Street, in an international city. I mean, you know, we punch above our weight every year with millions of visitors that rival any large city in the world. So, we're not strangers to how we deal with our crowds, but the world is different today. Evil is different today.
