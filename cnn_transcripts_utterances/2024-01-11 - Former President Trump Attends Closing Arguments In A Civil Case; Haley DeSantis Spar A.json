Hello everyone, live from New York, I'm Bianna Golodryga, alongside Zain Asher. We are going to take you to lower Manhattan now, where Donald Trump, the former president, is speaking outside of the courtroom. Let's listen in. (LIVE COVERAGE BEGINS) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT:  -- very happy in Texas. Other companies, because of what's happening here, are going to be moving out of New York also. This is out of control. The Attorney General -- she's totally out of control. These ones were all good. The banks were extremely happy with me. They still are. We built a great company. We have a company that's very liquid, very strong, great assets. And she sued me because she wanted the publicity to run for office, but they find nothing wrong. And I think if anybody was being fair about it, and I'm not sure you can even hear me because they don't allow microphones over here, which is pretty ridiculous, but if anybody's fair about it, you see this is a case that should have never been brought, and I think we should be entitled to damages.

He is also the host ofthe popular podcast, \"It's Complicated\". And it seems just judging by what we've heard from the judge thus far, not much complicated here in this decision. Despite that, though, we did hear from the defense for the former president, as we heard Brynn lay out, say that, listen, there were no witnesses testifying to fraud, to any material misstatements, or that the loan terms and pricing would have been any different. In his view, he sees the attorney general trying to strip them of everything. What do you make of these closing arguments and do they have any merit for the former president's case?",

But actually, as I believe your reporter pointed out just a moment ago, Trump has already been liable, found liable for fraud. And really the issue here is regarding some of the other counts, regarding some of the other potential false statements and misrepresentations, you know, are those also going to be added to that finding of liability? And then what are the remedies? In other words, you know, the attorney general is asking for over 300 million dollars. And she's asking for his businesses to not be able to do business in New York and for receivers to be appointed and so on. That's really what this trial is about. And a lawyer who's trying to influence this judge would be focusing -- would be essentially putting the issue of liability to the side and really focusing on the remedies and trying to convince the judge that he didn't need to do as much as the attorney general is asking for. Instead, this is more or less a campaign speech. I view it as more of a P.R. or press or political strategy, not a legal strategy.",

      "sentences": "I mean, as you were speaking, Renato, we just actually saw images of the Attorney General, Letitia James. One of Donald Trump's key pointshere is that this is actually about politics. He says that Attorney General James campaigned many, many times on taking down Trump. If you vote for me, if I win, I will go after Donald Trump. And, of course, he is doing just that. Trump has staked his whole sort of defense here on the fact that this is a political witch hunt. But based on what he's saying about attorney general Letitia James, there are some key facts that he's right about here. I think it's a valid criticism to criticize the Attorney General, Leticia James, for her bias. You know, in the United States, state prosecutors, state attorney general are elected, and you know, they make election promises, and they try to influence voters, and I think it's a very fair game to criticize their motives and to attack them as bias. Unfortunately, for the former president, that's not going to help them very much in the courtroom, because regardless of the bias of the attorney general or any motives on her part, the evidence, according to the judge, has established that Donald Trump has committed fraud. And so, as I said, you know, from a legal perspective, that's why his lawyers, instead of being focused on that issue, earlier focused on a lot of the political and, you know, press strategies in terms of attacking the Attorney General.",

Genocide in and of itself is a very high threshold to meet. Obviously, we have seen, we know that thousands of Palestinians have been killed in this war. But the question then goes to intent. And Israel will argue tomorrow, we're going to hear from them, that it is acting in self-defense and that it's targeting Hamas members, not Palestinians, and that any civilians that are killed are collateral damage and they even warned them with leaflets.

There are a lot of people who become a little too proud, a little too big headed, too full of themselves. And so it's tough to keep egos in check as a leader. And I think that Bill Belichick is one of the greatest leaders in that regard of all time to allow his team to maintain that mindset and that attitude, that championship mentality, that always humble and hungry mentality. That's a special gift. You know, I knew that every time I played against a Bill Belichick coach team when I played in the NFL was every season, twice a season for six years in the NFL, you knew that you were going up against a team of machines. He had those guys locked in. They had their responsibilities and their mission in the forefront of their lives. They were not allowed -- they were not cut any slack. No matter how successful they got, I remember a teammate of mine, Lori Malloy, who had come to us from the New England Patriots, he said, Coy, it didn't matter if I went to Pro Bowls, it didn't matter if we had already won a Super Bowl. When I came back that next season for off-season training, if I was one tenth slower in my 40th time but when I came out of college, he'd make me run it again and again. And I wasn't allowed to practice with the team until I got my time down. So, he was so cutthroat with his accountability, holding players and coaches accountable. That's what allowed them to be that machine that we saw for so many years, nine Super Bowl appearances, six Super Bowl wins. It'll be interesting to see where he goes now and if he can take that discipline and that attitude, that mindset, mentality of a champion to another organization and maybe go out on a Super Bowl win.",
