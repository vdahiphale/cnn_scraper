The Red Cross spoke to the ship's four survivors saying it sank within an hour of departing Tunisia after it was hit by a big wave several days ago. The survivors were rescued by a private vessel. This incident marks the latest in a string of tragedies near Lampedusa, a major destination for migrants seeking to enter E.U. countries. For more on this let's bring in CNN's Ben Wedeman, who is today in Rome. Ben, what do we know about those who have lost their lives? What else are authorities saying about what happened? BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  We don't know exactly how many people are missing and presumed dead. That is because these four survivors saying they believe there were 45 people on board the ship when it left, this boat, actually, when it left the Tunisian port late last week. There have not been any reports of any bodies being fished out of the sea. So this is an approximate number at this point. Keep in mind, also, that the four survivors, reportedly three man and one woman, are probably fairly traumatized after this experience. They are now on the Italian island of Lampedusa, a major gathering point for migrants and refugees rescued at sea. Keep in mind, of course, that this Italian island, Lampedusa, is actually closer to Tunisia than it is to the Italian mainland. The authorities -- obviously, this is an ongoing situation, particularly in the summer when the waters are somewhat calmer in the Mediterranean. This is when people tend to try to make this very dangerous crossing. At this point, the numbers would indicate we are headed for a record number of migrants and refugees arriving in Italy. So far this year, as of today, the 9th of August, nearly 94,000 people have reached the shores of Italy. That is twice the number from last year at this point of the year and three times that number from the year before, Becky.",

At least nine people died in a fire at a lodging where a group of adults with learning disabilities was on holiday. A number escaped the flames but authorities say those on the upper floors were trapped. Two are still unaccounted for. CNN senior international correspondent Jim Bittermann on the story. Jim, what more do we know at this point? JIM BITTERMANN, CNN SR. INTL. CORRESPONDENT:  Becky, we have just seen a visit by the prime minister of France, who went there in person to try to see what could be done to help out the situation. Really virtually nothing at this stage. There are 11 people who were originally reported missing. But the fire authorities say there is no doubt that they are all lost. There were 28 people in the building at about 6:30 this morning when the fire broke out. Fire officials said that in fact it may have been smoldering for some time before it was discovered. It took about 15 minutes. This is in a rural area, took about 15 minutes for fire companies to get there. By the time they did get there, the building was fully engulfed in flames. It's a half timber construction. So it is believed that the timbers, probably old, were in fact what fed the fire, making it an intense inferno. None of those who were still inside the building when the fire authorities arrived survived. About 17 people did manage to get out. They set up a crisis center to welcome friends and families of the victims. We will see what happens. We just heard from the prosecutor, who will be looking into this. She said that, in fact, the owner of the building is so shaken up that they cannot interview her at this point. But there are questions to be asked about the situation itself, whether or not this building was meant to house that many people. It is a renovated barn. As a consequence, whether it was up to norms and all that stuff, which all of that will be investigated over the next few days to see exactly what happened here -- Becky.",

Russian media report that the blast came from a pyrotechnics warehouse. The fire was a result of a violation of what they describe as technological processes. Meantime, Russia says two Ukrainian drones were shot down near Moscow overnight. There is conflicting information today on what could be a Ukrainian raid in the Kherson region. Russian media and bloggers say Ukrainian troops crossed the Dnipro River on Tuesday, encountering Russian forces near a Russian occupied village. Ukraine is not confirming that. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is now acknowledging that the counteroffensive is going slower than many had hoped. We will take a deep dive into what that means for the war's future and Western aid next hour on CONNECT THE WORLD. Israel's far-right finance minister is being criticized once again, this time for freezing funds earmarked for Arab municipalities in Israel and Palestinians in East Jerusalem. Bezalel Smotrich announced on Facebook that he will suspend about $53 million previously allocated, saying that the money could end up in the hands of criminal organizations. You may recall earlier this year Smotrich called for the Palestinian town Huwara to be wiped out. Elliott Gotkine is joining us from Jerusalem to break this down for us. Let's start with the money. We know how much it was. What is it being used for? And what is his justification for stopping it?",

This is one aspect that Smotrich is saying is unwarranted. He is saying it is unfair basically that Arab  municipalities should be getting extra funding whereas poorer Jewish municipalities are not. The other aspect is part of a five-year plan worth hundreds of millions of shekels for East Jerusalemites. It is a part of that program that Smotrich says he is freezing. This part of the program is designed to help people learn and improve their Hebrew to a level that would then enable them to study at Hebrew university. Smotrich says that that is the other part that he wants to freeze. One aspect is he said it's not fair. The other aspects, he said the previous government only did this because of Mansour Abbas, the leader of the Islamist run party, who is part of the previous coalition government. This was effectively done to placate him. Smotrich claims that if this money does go to these Arab municipalities, then it could end up in the hands of criminal and terrorist organizations. Something that even his fellow members of parliament and the lawmakers who are in the governing coalition and said, look, if you are making these claims, show us evidence for it -- Becky.",

The other aspect that I should add is this is not necessarily a done deal yet. He wrote on the Facebook page yesterday that the government could overturn it. There could be challenges in court. As for Smotrich himself, he is, as we have been seeing since the formation of this government, part of this most right-wing and religiously conservative governing coalition Israel has seen. He's a champion of the settlers and he has also been very supportive of the judicial overhaul, which has caused so much controversy and led to hundreds of thousands of Israelis coming out onto the street on a weekly basis. So quite a controversial character. He doesn't seem to burnish his religious credentials as much as the nationalist credentials, as much as the others in the coalition, Itamar Ben-Gvir. But certainly, they are an overall part of this national religious movement. In addition to the reasons that he stated for freezing these funds, I'm sure it will probably play quite well with his base -- Becky.",

The law in Uganda bans gay marriage and punishes same-sex acts with life imprisonment. It calls for the death penalty for what is described as aggravated homosexuality. It criminalizes other same-sex conduct, too. In response, Reuters reports that Uganda dismissed the move as unjust and hypocritical.

As we have previously reported, Port-au-Prince and surrounding areas have been gripped by a years-long kidnapping for profit epidemic, with hundreds of Haitians targeted by gangs seeking ransom payments each year. A late July advisory by the U.S. State Department said, given the recent armed clashes between gangs and the police and the high threat of violent crime and kidnapping throughout Port-au-Prince, the Department of State urges U.S. citizens to make plans to depart Haiti as soon as possible via commercial means.

Voters in Ohio have just rejected a ballot measure that would've made it harder to enshrine abortion rights into the state's constitution. This is being seen as a blow to the Republican-led anti-abortion movement. With turnout surprisingly high for a summer election, it shows that this is an issue that is very important to voters. Jeff Zeleny is joining us from Columbus, Ohio. This was a highly unusual time of the year to have a vote on a single issue. Certainly, the result tells us something about voters in Ohio.

You think back to last summer, when the Supreme CT overturned Roe v. Wade, Kansas became the first American state to really shock the nation and put abortion rights in their state's constitution to protect abortion rights. We have seen a series of states go after that, from Kentucky, Montana, Michigan; so red states and battleground states. Ohio being the latest, showing an indication yesterday. Abortion wasn't actually on the ballot but as you said, yesterday was a special election that Republican leaders here called to make it more difficult to pass the abortion measure in November. So it's a bit arcane here but if yesterday's issue won, it would've required a 60 percent vote to put abortion rights in the state constitution to protect it in November. But it failed. Now it only requires a simple majority of 50 percent. So will be abortion on the ballot in Ohio in November, the only place in the U.S. where that will occur. And other states across the country, from Arizona to Florida, also looking at Ohio. So this could be a central issue, once again, in next year's presidential race.",

It is likely to be key part of the case for prosecutors. It is a six-page memo that lays out that even the man outlining this fake electors plot, Kenneth Chesebro, he knew it was farfetched, knew it was likely illegal. The courts probably wouldn't approve it. But he kept pushing it. It is clear that Chesebro really wanted to create confusion about this in the hopes that the fake electors, those who were for Donald Trump and submitted the fake certificates, he wanted to make sure that they could be substituted for the real electors placed for Biden on January 6th. The plan was to execute this all through the vice president Mike Pence in his role as president of the Senate. That way Trump's team could steal the election. Part of the memo here says, \"Letting matters play out this way would guarantee the public attention would be riveted. It would buy the Trump campaign more time to win here.\" This is a crucial part of the prosecution. Prosecutors do have their hands on it. It is mentioned in the indictment as well. This will show that Kenneth Chesebro knew that it was likely an illegal plot they were executing but they went forward anyway. All of this is happening at the same time that this 2020 election case is moving rapidly through the court system here in Washington, D.C. We have a hearing set for 10 o'clock on Friday morning. The judge here is really keeping things very tight on the schedule, moving things along. And Becky, that is when this hearing really could get fiery. This is when prosecutors are going to argue there should be broad protective order over any of the evidence they hand over to Donald Trump. They do not want him to disclose any of this. So there is a lot happening very quickly. It remains to be seen when the trial will actually happen in this case.
