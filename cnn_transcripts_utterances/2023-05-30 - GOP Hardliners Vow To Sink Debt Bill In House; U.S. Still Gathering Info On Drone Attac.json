GREG CASAR (D-TX): So, the -- this is not both sides kind of an argument. Right now, as you were just saying in the last segment, you see extreme right-wing Republicans trying to push the American economy into default. In all parts of the Democratic caucus, all of our members, whether you're progressive or moderate, are united against preventing a default. And I think that's what you're going to see happen as this deal go through and a default be prevented. Now, your question is how will I and other progressives be voting on this issue? Because we know some Democrats will vote yes to get the deal done and they are going to do exactly that. But many progressives, including myself, we know because we continue to hold the line against kicking people out of their homes. Folks losing the meager food assistance that they're given.

And the hostage takers are the right-wing Republicans that are controlling the House of Representatives right now. So, we did very hard work in this lose-lose situation to reduce the ransom payment.But the question we should be asking ourselves is, why is there a hostage situation where the American economy has been taken for hostage in the first place? Why is the president having to make any sort of ransom payment and so on principle? I think it's important for a significant number of progressives to say, we don't stand for that and we're never going to stand for that in the future. We don't want any future president to be put in a bind like this, like President Biden because the threat that we're hearing from extreme right-wing Republicans, for example in the Rules Committee today, is that they could take the entire American economy. Millions of people losing their jobs, folks watching at home losing all of their savings, and that's unacceptable. So, progressives and moderates stand united against default. And progressives will also be standing against this kind of hostage-taking. We think we should abolish the debt ceiling in the first place.

No one was killed. That's something we should note here. Russia says several people were hurt, several buildings were damaged. Ukrainian officials are denying it needs direct involvement with these drones.

And there is one of the residencies that is officially a residency of the Russian President -- of Vladimir Putin.So, fairly close to the area, apparently, where these drones were downed. And in general, as you can imagine, a lot of people in Russia are up in arms a lot of people in the Russian government, certainly also a lot of Russians on the ground as well. And I think some of the things were pretty interesting about that alleged attack that unfolded. First of all, some of the videos that came out, they're quite remarkable because those drones that we saw there, they were pretty substantial in size. The Russians making a big point at the very beginning when all this happened -- when it first started to say these were fixed-wing aircraft, right? These weren't little copter drones. These were fairly large drones that came flying towards the area in Moscow. And the Russians say that in total, they down eight of these unmanned aerial vehicles. And they say that they needed both electronic jamming to do that, but they also needed to activate their missile air defenses as well taking down five of those drones using their missiles. Vladimir Putin came out later today and he then condemned all this and accused Kyiv of being behind it, saying that they had chosen the path of intimidation called terrorism. The Ukrainians, as you noted, Brianna, continue to say that they had nothing to do with this, that they were not directly involved in all of this, as they put it. Nevertheless, of course, Ukrainian officials rejoicing at this and saying they predict that more and similar attacks of this kind are going to happen. At the same time, of course, the Ukrainians are saying, look, drone attacks are something that they face pretty much every day. And one of the things that we witnessed last night overnight was that massive barrage of drones that came here to the capital city of Kyiv. And overnight, you could hear for several hours, Brianna, as these drones were hovering overhead. They have propeller engines, they have a very distinct noise, and the Ukrainians trying to take them down, Brianna.",
