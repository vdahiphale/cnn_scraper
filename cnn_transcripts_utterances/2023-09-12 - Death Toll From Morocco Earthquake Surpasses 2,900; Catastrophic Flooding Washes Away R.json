The rest of the property around it washed away in catastrophic flooding overnight.Nearly a foot of rain fell overnight in a town just 40 miles north of Boston. The town's mayor said there were so many rescues they have lost count of how many. Right now, evacuations have been ordered for some people living in low-lying areas. Emergency management officials say a dam that had been scheduled to be replaced is now prompting further concerns. CNN's meteorologist, Chad Myers, is tracking the story from the CNN Weather Center. Chad, goodness, another day where we describe unusual amounts of rainfall leading to flooding. One 200-year event? I feel like we're seeing these every couple of weeks.

Hard to imagine where that rain has to go so quickly.And then even though it stopped raining there briefly, you talk about that, almost 10 inches of rainfall came down. There was heavy rainfall there in parts of Rhode Island as well and on up towards the Berkshires north of Worcester. And still running off, still seeing flooding right now. Now in the rivers. The rivers are swelling, not so much in the towns and streets, but some of the streets don't even exist anymore because they were washed away. No rainfall right now. Nothing really for today, but I do think we will see more rainfall tomorrow. There are still watches up. Obviously, now, there's no place for the rain to go. Level two for flood risk for this area.

Hasn't really got to the cold water yet.So the precursor to this event will be the rainfall that comes down, two inches of rain, not according to Lee, not associated with Lee just yet. But 115 miles per hour. It will move to the north. And it will begin to slow down in intensity. That's the good news. There still will be widespread consequences with gigantic waves up and down the east coast and certainly the potential for more rainfall in those places in eastern New England that do not need any more rain whatsoever. We'll still watch the track. Right now, trending to the east a little bit, but it's still something certainly worth watching. The good news is it likely will be a cat 1 when it gets close.",
