And a young Ukrainian boy orphaned by a Russian strike that killed his mother and father has one last question he wishes he could ask his parents. What should I do now? How do I live?",

Though that explanation has not been confirmed.The Israeli military says it's investigating the strike which it claims killed two senior Hamas officials. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had this reaction.

They would have had to signal the fact that they're interested and committed to some more practical pathway based on two states. And with the current Israeli government that Mr. Netanyahu has to extremist ministers, anything that even remotely signals that commitment to a Palestinian state or embracing the Palestinian authority, could easily bring down the -- bring down the Israeli government.

The search and recovery operation, that's what is now Rosemary, to be quite frank, I mean the hope of finding anybody alive is incredible remote. Six bodies have been recovered, two people were miraculously pulled alive but that was days ago.  This is now very much a recovery operations. Funeral processions have begun and some of the images, the pictures that we are seeing coming out of this village, people are mourning, they are suffering. Almost 2,000 people if not more than 2,000 people have perished. And look, that number could be even higher. This was a densely populated village, yes it was remote, and isolated but there were homes, there were shops, there was a gas station, a lodge, a church, a school.

And then the diagnosis usually involves trying to rule out that there's not another explanation. So sometimes there are problems such as anxiety disorders or other kind of mental health conditions.But basically, if the person has had persistent withdrawal for more six months without contact outside of the home and no other role functioning such as engagement, employment, or work, or training, then that usually would lead to the conclusion that the person is showing that hikikomori pattern.",
