Let's take a look at today's top stories now.The Trump campaign says its first rally since the attempted assassination of the former president will be held indoors. Trump and his new running mate, J.D. Vance, will appear together this Saturday in Grand Rapids, Michigan. It comes one week after a 20-year-old fired at Trump, grazing his right ear. J.D. Vance's 2016 memoir, \"Hillbilly Elegy,\" is the new number one book on Amazon. And the 2020 movie adaptation is in the top ten on Netflix. The senator from Ohio getting a boost after Donald Trump picked him as his vice presidential running mate on Monday. A man was fatally shot by police about one mile away from the Republican National Convention on Tuesday. Police say he had knives in both hands and was trying to attack another man. No one else was injured. CNN's Kristen Holmes has more now on day two of the RNC from Milwaukee in Wisconsin. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: The second night of the Republican Convention could have been called Donald Trump's rival night. We saw a number of Donald Trump's previous rivals in various elections, including Senator Marco Rubio, who now, of course, this cycle, was a VP contender as well. Senator Ted Cruz, who Donald Trump faced down in 2016. But perhaps the most critical rivals that spoke tonight in support of Donald Trump were those he faced in the primary this cycle. Former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who backed the former president emphatically. NIKKI HALEY, FORMER U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I'll start by making one thing perfectly clear. Donald Trump has my strong endorsement, period. (APPLAUSE) RON DESANTIS, (R) FLORIDA GOVERNOR: Let's send Donald Trump back to the White House.",

One of them, talking about Nikki Haley specifically, said, I stopped listening after I heard the word endorse.Now, Haley's endorsement was critical for a number of reasons. Despite the fact that Haley only won two primaries during the cycle, she continued to win tens of thousands of voters in critical battleground states like Pennsylvania and Arizona, even after she had dropped out of the presidential race. Those are voters who purposely did not vote for the former president. Tonight, Haley reached out to them, specifically called on them to back the former president in this election in November, to not sit on the sidelines and to not vote for President Joe Biden. Something the Trump campaign was not only hoping she would do but was thrilled that she did on that Tuesday night. Kristen Holmes, CNN, Milwaukee, Wisconsin. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

At the top of the list is a push for term limits for the nine justices who currently serve lifetime appointments. Also, under consideration is a new ethics code that would contain an enforcement mechanism and a constitutional amendment to reverse the court's ruling earlier this month that gave presidents broad immunity for some actions they take while in office.The court has been under intense scrutiny following a series of controversies surrounding some of the justices, including conservatives Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito. That along with several highly charged rulings have led to dismal public approval ratings. President Biden has this warning about the future of the Supreme Court if Donald Trump is reelected.

So one has to believe that there was a greater security focus on Donald Trump even at his rally.And yet the breach and the assassination attempt still occurred. Now, it is true, as you said, that the suspect, that the that the assassin has no known ties to any foreign intelligence agency. There'll be lots of speculation from all accounts coming out of the FBI and state authorities. This was a sort of loner, isolated 20 year old with lots of -- with access to lots of guns. We don't quite know his motive. But even though these are two different stories, they sort of converge on the Secret Service in terms of knowing what they knew.

They couldn't have drones surveying each of these.You don't have to necessarily put a physical body on it. You just want to make sure that someone else doesn't have access to it. And the sort of openness of the building that he could get access either on the inside or outside and then remain on the rooftop. And it was only members of Donald Trump's, you know, sort of the people who went to his rally.

Was he carrying any weapons? So then he leaves and then finds another position. The oddity of this is that it shows you that good security actually can work to deter a threat.He could not get through the metal detector. He knew he was armed. He could not get through it or closer. So then he recedes. The problem here is that no one is taking into account, well, he's not going away. He's just trying to find another place to shoot from. On the terms -- in terms of communication, the gap that we need to answer is that both people at the rally and law enforcement noticed him, noticed him as suspicious, as well as then on the roof. That should have immediately triggered some sort of conduct by the Secret Service to protect the protectee better. Donald Trump was left exposed for some period of time, a couple of minutes, in fact, after the first notification. And then that time you really could have protected him much better.",
