One aide telling CNN there is a growing sense the game is over. And the Houthi militant group has now claimed responsibility for a drone strike in Tel Aviv. At least one person was killed. All right. We start with breaking news amid an enormous IT outage, which is hitting hard across the world. Banks, grocery stores, TV news networks, and even emergency services are just some of the victims alongside hundreds of thousands of passengers as flights are canceled in droves globally. Cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike says it's not a cyberattack. Here's what the CEO told NBC a short time ago. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

CrowdStrike also provides cyberattack investigations. And as we heard from the CEO just a moment ago, the outage appears to be primarily caused by what they say is a bad software update to a widely used cybersecurity product. Now program in question is Falcon, the faculty update, the faulty update, rather, is crashing computers running Microsoft Windows causing an error message to be displayed on a blue screen. Now the company stressed that the issue was not due to a cyberattack and that Mac and Linux computers are unaffected. A CrowdStrike advisory seen by CNN urged customers to reboot their machines and confirmed that the issue is specific to Falcon. I want to stay on this. We've got a team of experts with us. We've got some reporters on the ground. We also have Stavros Shiaeles, who's an associate professor in cybersecurity at the University of Portsmouth, as well as CNN's Marc Stewart in Beijing for us, and we'll be joined by Anna Stewart shortly.

However, as I understand what happened with the Falcon software, Falcon is the flagship of CrowdStrike and that software uses a client that is installed on Window systems, and I suspect the issue is there. There is some faulty (INAUDIBLE) with the client that is causing the Microsoft Window systems to crash. So this is not I believe so simple to be corrected, except if there is a backup or before installing the client. There is a system restore point, which you can restore the system in a previous working condition. However, as this involves some drivers in the system this could be more tricky to revert back because all the systems they have what we call a failsafe put, which the operating system is starting only the necessary services. So in this case, I believe in order to remove the buggy software in order not to cash because the system crash as they start you need to remove it from the system and the drivers, reboot the system normally and then install the new client. So I don't know how much time it will actually take or if they have the resources for that. I mean, to do it all in very quickly.",

I mean, the bigquestion about its reputation, its credibility, when a mistake in an era of this scale occurs. We see colossal impact globally. One questions what kind of governance and, you know, testing abilities they have before they click- send on an updates. M. STEWART: Right. Look, the entire strength and credibility of this company is certainly under the microscope. And the fact that its stock price in early trading has declined by about 12 percent shows that there are tremendous reservations by traders and shareholders in that company. This is not the kind of failure that, especially a company focused on cybersecurity, should be having. It is interesting to note, though. We saw the CEO very early on in this crisis take to Twitter and offer an explanation. We saw him appear on NBC in the United States doing an interview explaining what happened. I mean, that is kind of what you do in a crisis is try to get in front of it and try to try to address the issues as much as possible. Whether or not that will help improve the company's reputation remains to be seen. I mean, the losses are not just inconveniences. We're not just talking about missed flights and delayed luggage. This is impacting banks. This is impacting financial trading. Even the impact on grocery stores. We talked earlier how some of the grocery stores in Australia were having a hard time.

And they just don't see that right now in President Joe Biden despite getting some sort of reassurances from campaign officials that there's the next campaign stop or the next solo news conference to try to assuage the concerns that those donors have. But none of that has really made a dent. Oftentimes putting people in the difficult position of trying to sell a candidate that is grappling with his own intraparty revolt. And so the other side of this, though, is the grassroots donations. And that has been a bright spot for the Biden campaign. They often point to those small-dollar funds that are given over to the campaign and so while they're seeing some success still in that space, those big dollar donors are starting to defect and that is certainly a concern, if perhaps not one that would essentially guide the president in his decision-making, one that the campaign is having to wrestle with.",

But in the meantime, you know, I wonder if airlines are ready for these kind of vulnerabilities and what other system they can revert to that could avoid the things that we're seeing right now playing out at a global scale. We can't just be vulnerable and we're just so reliant on IT and not having sort of a backup system. O'BRIEN: Yes. I think you've hit the nail on the head here, Eleni, that this system is built, you know, the airline industry is built on redundancy. That's why it's so safe. 99.999 percent of the time everything is going to be great. And that's because there's layer upon layer. These systems which are designed to help you book and check in and runs the monitors in the airport, all the backend operations of airline probably should have an equal amount of redundancy built into them. They should not go down just because Windows goes down. Backup systems are a really good idea on all sides of this and the airlines' dependency on a system that can fail so horribly with a single point failure I think will hopefully make them think about having a better backup system in the future.",

In the meantime, you've got this backlog of passengers that you need to try and get back on planes. So tell me the ultimate impact financially that this could have on airlines as well as passengers and what I guess this means for insurance companies. This is going to have a spillover effect. O'BRIEN: Yes. It's got a lot of knock-on effects to say the least, and the longer it goes on the more that it becomes exacerbated. Somebody is going to have to pay a lot for this. This company which instituted this patch I suspect is going to be paying a lot for all of the consequences of this.

Certainly it has left people in Tel Aviv on edge about the possibility of this happening again. The Israeli military says that this was an Iranian made Samad-3 drone that they say was upgraded, modified in order to have a longer range, to be able to make it all the way from Yemen, where Houthi rebels launched this drone, all the way here to central Tel Aviv -- Eleni.",

A growing sense that it's game over for the president's candidacy. CNN's Jeff Zeleny joins us now from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, for an update. Jeff, good to see you. Just a short time ago, we saw a group of Democrats launch a campaign ad calling on President Biden to step down. And I just want to play a clip for our audience. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I mean,an assassination attempt for the former president, the current president testing positive for COVID, his party calling for him to get out. The former president's party is rallying behind him, but here at the end of this week President Biden is increasingly isolated we are told. There are so many Democrats who indeed are calling for him to step aside because they fear that he cannot beat Donald Trump. Now the Biden campaign is pushing back very forcefully to that and using the speech from Thursday night, that acceptance speech that Donald Trump gave here in Milwaukee, as evidenced why. They said that they, you know, did not live up to his pledge of a unity type theme. And, you know, a few people thought that Trump is going to change stripes obviously. A 78-year-old former president, he's been on the public scene for so long. But the question is, is Joe Biden going to reassess or not? And that is his decision to make. So going into this weekend, there is no doubt all Democrats are keeping a close eye on what he intends to do, even as they look forward and quietly discuss contingency plans. One month from today, Democrats gather in Chicago for their own convention and the big question hanging over all this, will he be the nominee? Will it be Vice President Kamala Harris or someone else? Truly an unprecedented state of play here in the U.S. -- Lynda.",
