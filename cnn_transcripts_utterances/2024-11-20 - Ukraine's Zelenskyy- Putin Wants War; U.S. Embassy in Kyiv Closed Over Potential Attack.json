It's Wednesday, November the 20th, 9 a.m. here in London, 11 a.m. in Kyiv in Ukraine, where the U.S. Embassy is closed for the day after receiving information about a potential air attack. The embassy has told employees to shelter in place and U.S. citizens elsewhere in the capital to be ready if an air alert is announced.Meanwhile, U.S. officials say the Biden administration is sending anti-personnel mines to Kyiv to deploy for defensive purposes only in eastern Ukraine, though. That decision comes days after the White House approved the use of longer-range weapons by Ukraine to strike inside Russian territory. Moscow says Kyiv fired U.S.-supplied ATACMS at a weapons arsenal in the Bryansk region on Tuesday. In apparent response, Vladimir Putin updated Russia's nuclear doctrine, saying Moscow now has the right to use nuclear weapons in response to attacks using conventional weapons. That brought a defiant response from the Ukrainian president. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And that may not be precisely what the U.S. embassy here is directly concerned about.But you know, there are multiple different targets across this city where Westerners, where those from the European and NATO allies backing Ukraine reside or known to frequent. So I think it's a broad capital city on edge here. But I should stress, I don't think at this point, regardless of the escalation we've seen over the last 48 hours that Moscow necessarily wants to take any stride and steps that force into a direct conflict with the United States. Yes, much of the sales pitch to Putin's domestic audience is that they are already at war with NATO as a whole. That's their way of explaining how badly, frankly, the war has gone from over a thousand days is only supposed to last a matter of weeks. So many advocates of the Kremlin said when they began the invasion. But I don't feel at this point necessarily that Russia has the desire, the capability to start something larger with the NATO alliance -- Max.",

He's chosen Dr. Mehmet Oz, a surgeon and TV personality to head the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Trump also named Linda McMahon to be the next Secretary of Education. She's been the co-chair of his transition team and formerly led the Small Business Administration in Trump's first term. McMahon also is a former TV personality from her time with World Wrestling Entertainment. And Howard Lutnick is Trump's pick for Secretary of Commerce. He's the other co-chair of Trump's transition team and is CEO of the financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald. Well, Trump is also set to announce his pick for Treasury Secretary. It's a big one. CNN's Kristen Holmes looks at who's in the running. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Donald Trump's transition team could announce a nominee for Treasury Secretary as early as Wednesday. I'm told by two sources who say they are meeting tomorrow on Wednesday to discuss the slate of candidates. This has been held up. This is probably the biggest position that is left to announce. It's been held up because co-chair of the transition, Howard Lutnick, had essentially inserted himself into the race against hedge fund manager Scott Besant, which really upended the entire thing. Now, on Tuesday, Howard Lutnick was named Secretary of Commerce, taking him effectively out of the running. However, there are still several candidates, as Donald Trump had expanded the field in recent days. All of them have met with Donald Trump and the transition team. And I am told no decisions have been made. However, again, they are hoping to get this out as quickly as possible, specifically given that so many of Donald Trump's policies on day one that he has said are related to the economy. So we'll see if they're able to make that goal of Wednesday night. They are obviously trying to tick through a number of these cabinet positions as we inch through this transition process.

This is not made up. We've been using the term in literature since 1980 and likely just in talk since World War II. It is a storm that rapidly intensifies. We talk about rapid intensification in hurricanes as well. This is not a hurricane. It is equivalent, the pressure equivalent to a category three major hurricane in the Atlantic. But the good news is the low itself is not going to come on shore. What will come on shore is wind gusts, probably around hurricane gusts. Other than that, an awful lot of rainfall. In fact, an atmospheric river event that's level four out of five. So an awful lot of rain. Some of the forecasters going for 10 to 15. I've even heard numbers up to 20 inches of rainfall because this is a long-term event. It's still going to be raining tomorrow and even some showers still on Friday. So yes, we are going to see significant numbers here when it comes to rainfall accumulations. But the good news is at least this part of northern California has not been wet. So a lot of this can soak in. It may rain too hard for all that to happen everywhere, but there will be some soaking rainfall here coming in. And even with the high risk here of some flooding, that's a possibility for your Thursday from Eureka all the way down to Ukiah. That's the thought process for where the floods are possibly going to be the worst. There will be floods. How bad will they be? We don't know yet. The good news is the land is not completely saturated. So right now just flood watches in effect. Of course, we still have those snowstorm events here coming in with blizzard warnings just to the east of Seattle in the higher elevations. But you get the idea. In fact, some spots here with the wind could still pick up 60 inches of snow and that snow getting blown around, especially on the top of those peaks. I guess that's some good news for skiing.
