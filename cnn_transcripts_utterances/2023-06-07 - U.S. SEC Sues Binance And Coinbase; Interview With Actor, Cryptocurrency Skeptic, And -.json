I'm Bianca Nobilo in London, in for Max Foster today.Just ahead, hundreds flee Ukraine's Kherson region after a dam collapsed, raises fears of an environmental catastrophe. We'll bring you the view from the ground. Then, a stunning partnership in the golf world has left many U.S. players blindsided. We'll take a closer look at Saudi Arabia's increasing influence in sports and what critics are calling a sportswashing. And Pope Francis is admitted to the hospital for abdominal surgery. Details on his health in a moment. Questions are mounting over what caused the collapse of a critical dam in Russian occupied southern Ukraine as the scope of the disaster mounts. Both Moscow and Kyiv are blaming each other for Tuesday's collapse. We're getting a closer look at the widespread devastation in the Kherson region. Flooding in towns and cities downstream has forced more than 1,500 people to evacuate, according to Ukrainian officials. More than 1,900 homes are flooded. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says, hundreds of thousands of people have been left without drinking water. A Russian appointed mayor told Russian state media at least seven people are missing. Ukrainian police say they have received reports of three people missing in the Kherson region. CNN has not been able to establish what caused the dam to collapse and whether it was sabotaged or the result of some, sort of, structural failure. Either side is providing hard evidence to back-up their claims at this point. Let's turn now to CNN's Frederik Pleitgen. He's in the Kherson region with a closer look at some of the widespread flooding and damage. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)",

And one of the things that we've been really surprised about is how fast that water has been rising. In fact, just yesterday when we were here, we were, I'd say about 100, maybe 150 yards in that direction, but now that entire area is inundated. You can't go there anymore.At the same time, the rescue efforts are ongoing to free people from their houses. People where the water rose so quickly, they couldn't get out. As you can see, police here, the army is here, they have some boats here and they've been trying to get the people out. Now, this is an operation that was ongoing throughout the entire night, that's what the authorities were telling us, that they would not rest. But it's also one that was ongoing under nearly constant shelling. We were hearing that throughout the entire, we've been hearing it throughout the entire course of the day. Is that the shelling seems to be coming from multiple rocket launching systems but also from artillery as well. And as you can see if you go over here, it's not only the people that are being saved from the buildings here but also a lot of animals as well. There's a lot of cats here in these cages. And one of the things that we're also seeing is the rescuers coming here and then they'll have a cat or two -- that they picked up from maybe a fence or maybe a rooftop. Obviously, a lot of those animals also very much in danger as are the people who are still caught in that area. Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Kherson Ukraine. (END VIDEO TAPE)",

If you look at it from Russia's perspective, yes, it would complicate the Ukrainian effort to cross the Dnipro River, head towards Crimea, head towards the Azovstal Steel. Do what many suspect they might have been planning to do in this counteroffensive and try to cut Russia's, sort of, land bridge in half. It would certainly make that more complicated.It also, sort of, fits a pattern that we've seen from Russia of attrition, of trying to inflict maximum suffering on the Ukrainian population and weaken their resolve. Case in point, is the fact that we continue our team in the ground. Fred and his producer continue to report incoming and outgoing water and rocket fire in Kherson even as this catastrophe unfolded on the Ukrainian side. It's probably a little more complicated, and especially as we see start to see the impact on agriculture, a huge part of their economy. Zelenskyy saying, hundreds and thousands now without drinking water. But we do know that Russia had significant military positions on the eastern bank of the Dnipro River, possibly in those flood zone. CNN Sam Kiley spoke to a Ukrainian commander who said he saw Russian troops, essentially, being washed away by this flood. The Russians out there is expected to suffer more because the ground is lower, then there's the issue of the Crimean water supply. So, look, there are potential motives on both sides. But as you have said, there is no hard evidence as of yet to point to either side.",

He attended his weekly Wednesday audience this morning with a full capacity crowd.Yesterday, he came to this hospital, for what we were told, were checks and maybe those checks were what led to the surgery today. But the surgery is nigh (ph). He didn't arrive in an ambulance, he arrived on his own free will. So, we know that this is not being seen as an emergency. It's being seen as something to put him in a bit more comfort. This is a man who has suffered a barrage of health issues in the last couple of years. He had colon surgery, two years ago. He is mostly confined to a wheelchair. And he yet keeps a very, very busy travel schedule. He is expected to go in a -- first week of August to Portugal to attend the World Youth Day. So, this very much could be seen as something preventative to get him into a more comfortable position. This is what the Vatican says to address recurrent painful and worsening symptoms related to this hernia, relayed to his colon surgery a couple of years ago. But of course, an 86-year-old man going under surgery, if anyone has someone that old in our family, we have worried about it. So, a lot of people are concerned, the Catholics are praying, the Vatican is telling us though, they expect a full recovery. Pope Francis has a lot of energy and everyone's expecting him to maintain his positive attitude. Bianca.",

Almost looks apocalyptic and very eerie in kind of a sense, right? But this is all thanks to the Canadian wildfires that are burning throughout Quebec. Ottawa has some of the worst air quality in the world right now with hazardous conditions being reported. Also, we have very unhealthy to hazardous conditions blanketing many of the most populated areas within the eastern seaboard of the United States, the nation's capital, Baltimore, Philadelphia all the way to New York City, and you can see it from space. We were monitoring this yesterday, very closely, this is visible satellite imagery. You see that smoky, kind of brown hue moving across Lake Ontario, that is a wall of smoke from the fires to the north. You can clearly see the wind direction coming from the north moving to the south, pushing the smoke along with it, eventually impacting the eastern seaboard. And guess what? There is more to come. We have code orange and code red for many locations along the eastern seaboard, over 15 million Americans under air quality alerts.

The relationship was worse than anticipated. But there are ground realities now and we see that in U.S. Secretary of State, Antony Blinken's quite lengthy visit to Saudi Arabia right now. That people, even the leader of the most powerful nation in the world is having to change course and direction a little, and it's because of the image that Saudi Arabia is projecting. And the reality that it's projecting, making diplomatic deals with China, for example. In relation to Iran. So, what it's saying is that absent - the United States' keen interest in the region -- in the gulf region, Saudi Arabia is going to look elsewhere for its partnerships, be it in sports, be it in business, be it in diplomacy.

Now, a new report is out that says it's happening even faster than we originally anticipated. Just in 2021 the IPCC's state of the climate science report are predicting an ice-free Arctic by the middle of the century, in the 2050's.Now, this newer paper, a peer reviewed papers out of South Korea looks at the latest data and says, the climate models were way too conservative. It's probably going to happen a decade sooner, in the 2030's, or so. That is a startling news but it is just the latest in startling news coming out of the top of the world. In 2021, it rained at the highest peak in Greenland, icy place, for the first time ever. And then last year, a hurricane, actually, pushed a blob of warm air so far north it thawed out parts of Greenland in September which had never been seen before. Now, this is playing out. Ocean's surface temperatures are on the rise, on a rocket rise, at the same time. And what's most troubling about losing that ice at the top is the albedo effect, the reflecting power of white ice compared to dark water when it comes to absorbing heat. The less ice there is, the faster the heating comes right now. Yet another reminder that every 10th of a degree counts at maximum speed is needed to stop the root of this and it fuels the burn.
