If you're just joining us, here are some of today's top stories.Protesters in Israel are demanding Benjamin Netanyahu agree to a ceasefire with Hamas after nearly 11 months of war. Many are accusing the Prime Minister of stalling and are calling for his resignation. Two stranded sailors are now safe after a daring rescue in a choppy seas nearly 200 miles from Australia's coast. Their yacht was adrift after a mechanical issue, and waves nearly 20 feet high delayed their rescue for several hours. Australia's Navy and Air Force managed to safely grab them when the conditions improved. And U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is vowing to tackle surge pricing after complaints about ticket prices for the first batch of Oasis shows went on sale this past weekend. British regulators received hundreds of complaints about Ticketmaster saying advertisements for ticket prices and availability were misleading. Now the next two weeks will be a busy one for Pope Francis, who has just begun a marathon 12-day tour of Southeast Asia. He touched down in Jakarta, Indonesia earlier today. His visit comes as the Catholic Church seeks to grow and strengthen its presence across Asia. The Pope is set to meet with Indonesia's president and other officials on Wednesday before continuing his trip to three other countries. Let's go live to Jakarta where CNN's Christopher Lamb has been traveling with the Pope. And I believe, Christopher, you're actually on that long flight to Indonesia with him, and you had a chance to meet him on board.",

He's had some respiratory difficulties, but they are really the signs of old age rather than anything underlying or more serious.He has insisted that his health is good. He does have mobility problems. He makes use of a wheelchair most of the time. But broadly speaking, his health is fine for someone at the age of 87. But obviously, the length of air travel, the grueling schedule, the meeting, the open air masses, all those things are going to take a toll. So we're watching very closely to see how he manages with all that. But it is remarkable an 87-year-old pontiff is willing to embark on such an ambitious journey.",

Thanks very much.Now, a Chinese state media report, 11 people, five students and six parents have been killed in a school bus crash. A warning, you may find some of the images we're about to show disturbing. The crash happened in Tai'an City in Shandong Province, which is in eastern China. Authorities say the bus lost control when it drove into an intersection and then crashed into the crowd waiting to walk through the gate of a middle school. 13 people were injured. The driver is being held by local police and the cause of the accident is under investigation. Now, there's a renewed sense of hope in Bangladesh after the ouster of long-time Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. She resigned and fled the country last month following weeks of deadly anti-government protests. Critics say her 15 years in power were marked by a stifling of civil freedoms and using harsh measures to crush dissent. And now political prisoners are sharing stories of abuse and torture at the hands of Hasina's government. CNN's Anna Coren spoke with some of them. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANNA COREN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The fresh faces of the future against that of the past. Shoes hanging in the face of Bangladesh's ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, the ultimate insult and show of defiance in a country where people on the streets achieved the unthinkable. What began as a student-led protest against government quotas in early July morphed into a mass uprising. After Hasina, who'd been in power for more than 15 years, ordered police to open fire on the crowds. Over the following weeks, hundreds of people were killed while thousands were arrested. They came to my house. They broke three doors. They took me with them and oh my God, the physical torture, that was miserable. COREN (voice-over): Nusrat Tabassum, a 23-year-old political science student, says she was beaten for hours on end. Her face repeatedly hit, some of her teeth now loose, her right eardrum burst.",

The only female in the group of prominent student leaders forced to make an apology. For fellow student Iftekhar Alam, his detainment was even more sinister. Snatched from his home before dawn, he was blindfolded, handcuffed, and believes he was taken to a notorious military intelligence facility in Dhaka, where over the years, hundreds of Bangladeshi considered anti-state have been disappeared.",

TABASSUM; My country is sick, but our people, we stand together. I believe there will be sunshine in future. COREN (voice-over): A future this generation will continue to fight for. (END VIDEOTAPE) COREN (on camera): Yes, such brave and resilient students. It was just so amazing to be in their presence, Christina. Look, as well as this U.N. fact-finding mission into the atrocities that occurred, Bangladesh's interim government, headed by Muhammad Yunus, has set up a commission to investigate the hundreds of suspected enforced disappearances. Now, human rights groups believe that more than 700 Bangladeshi were disappeared under Hasina's 15-year reign, and we know that at least three of them have since been released in recent weeks. Some have spoken about the horrors that they endured. Now, the families of the missing, they welcome this commission of inquiry. It's to be headed by a retired high court judge and will submit its findings in the next few months. And, Christina, there are calls that are growing that for India, which is providing Sheikh Hasina refuge, to send her back to Bangladesh. They want her to face trial for the abuses during her reign, and particularly the families. They want her to face justice. Christina, back to you.",

CNN's Richard Quest takes us back to MoMA's beginnings. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RICHARD QUEST, CNN BUSINESS ANCHOR (voice-over): MoMA, the Museum of Modern Art.
