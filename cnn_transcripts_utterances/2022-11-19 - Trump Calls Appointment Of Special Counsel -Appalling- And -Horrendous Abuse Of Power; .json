Evan, what do we know about this special counsel? EVAN PEREZ, CNN SENIOR JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Well, Fred, you know, ever since we broke the story that the department was looking at appointing a special counsel, we know, we spent a lot of time looking at former judges, former -- top DOJ officials. We never thought to look at The Hague, which is where Jack Smith has been working the last few years. He's been running prosecutions in the in the Kosovo war tribunal there in The Hague. And he comes with a -- with a -- with a very respected background from the Justice Department. He started out as a -- as a -- as assistant D.A. in Manhattan. But his work as you pointed out, running public corruption cases out of the Washington -- out of here in Washington at the Justice Department. And as a former assistant U.S. Attorney in Tennessee. Now, from the perspective of the department, they view him as somebody who can survive the scrutiny -- the scrutiny that you expect, the former president and his team and Republicans are going to have for him as he tries to run these twin investigations, politically sensitive investigations into the former president.

He's coming in with nothing else on his plate, except to get up to speed, to make decisions and to move forward if the evidence supports it. So, I do think he also understands the timing issues here, has very brief statement indicated that he wouldn't slow anything down.

And remember, at least with respect to January 6, they are just now getting people into the grand jury who had asserted privileges that had to be litigated before they were forced to testify. So, there were some things that were not in anyone's control to move along more quickly. So, in the end, I'm not sure that appointing Jack Smith any earlier would have made a difference.

And I think it's key here to really just tell our viewers that yes, it's snowing in Buffalo, but this amount of snow is either approaching records or, in some cases, as we take in a loyal Buffalo Bills fan. Haven't shattering records or breaking records like what we saw at Buffalo's airport, which by the way, authority said today is open again. Yes, it will be flight cancelations still. But what is being seen as perhaps one of the most important flights today will be that plane carrying the New York Buffalo Bills to Detroit for their game tomorrow. That takes off later this afternoon. But what we do know is that authorities are stressing right now that there is a travel ban in place for Buffalo. Meaning, only essential travel. That way they can try to keep those vehicles off the roads, so they can get as much of the snow off the highways. That way authorities can actually move around.

The visiting a food truck afterwards, with there's some video for that as well, that they've seen. And then, at some point, they returned back to their dorms.

I think there's a sort of split the difference problem, the Saudis were angry with President Biden when he visited for lecturing them about human rights. But of course, back in Washington, President Biden's allies believed that he didn't do enough to emphasize the human rights problems and the terrible, you know, bone zine of an American columnist for the Washington Post.",

You know, there are international tribunals after all, that exists as far as wrongdoing by world leaders.And, you know, it just -- it seems like, the timing is just designed to frustrate President Biden's allies here in Washington who think, you know, what are you getting out of this?

What he described as the double standards of the West, the profoundly unjust criticism defending Qatar's human rights record. The treatment of the migrant workers and then the LGBTQ plus community and in fact Qataris as a whole themselves, so let's just have another listen to a little bit more of what he had to say.
