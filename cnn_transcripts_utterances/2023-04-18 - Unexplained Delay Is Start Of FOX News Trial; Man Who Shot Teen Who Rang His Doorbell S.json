We're following these major developing stories many more all coming in right here to CNN NEWS CENTRAL.All right. Any moment now, opening statements are set to begin in the historic trial of Dominion Voting Systems versus FOX News. In this sketch, the FOX defense lawyer is on the right, Dominion's attorney on the left. The defamation case could set legal precedent for journalists for generations to come. Dominion, we should remind you, is seeking $1.6 billion for FOX News' repeating false claims that Dominion machines rigged, somehow, the 2020 Presidential Election against Donald Trump, flipping votes they claimed, paying off politicians. The jury is now in place. The two sides were getting contentious even before the opening statements, but now we have some sort of delay. CNN's Danny Freeman, he is in Wilmington, Delaware, just outside the courthouse. So we had some progress, the jury was set. We had the judge officially naming a special mount master to go through evidence to see if FOX News had somehow withheld evidence they should have given to discovery. But we still haven't heard opening statements. Do we know why? Those were scheduled to take a little more than - take place a little more than an hour ago?",

But again, I think the odds of us necessarily getting both opening statements potentially from both Dominion and FOX seem to be getting smaller as court usually adjourns here around 4:30. Now, I just want to actually bring you back to the earlier news from today. That was about the makeup of the jury. The jury was seated and sworn in earlier at about 11 am. There are 12 jurors and then 12 alternates as well. That's more alternates than normal for this kind of court because it's expected to be a six week trial, and the judge said he wanted to have a lot of alternates ready. The 12 core jurors, though, made up of six men, six women and our court reporters that are inside say that about nine of them appear to be people of color. So that's what's happening today. And, of course, we're still working to see and understand why this delay right now in court.",

Remember, Lester is facing two felony counts, first degree assault and armed criminal action. Police say that Lester's shot 16-year-old Ralph Yarl twice after the teen rang Lester's doorbell by mistake. Yarl was trying to pick up his younger brothers, but he went to the wrong house. Fortunately, he's now out of the hospital. This morning, his high school classmates actually held a unity walk showing their support. And we're also getting a first look at this, President Biden just moments ago, sharing this photo of his phone call with the injured team. And in a Twitter message, the President is vowing to keep up the fight against gun violence.

And he was supposed to stay outside and his brothers was supposed to run outside, get in the car and they come home. And that was what was supposed to happen.

That section of the freeway has been shut down indefinitely. But as you mentioned, there is a person of interest who has been detained and authorities say there is no threat to the public at this time. But there's a mystery here as to what was going on here, what led to the deaths of these four people found in the home in Bowdoin and then several others being shot at while driving their vehicles. The victims of the shooting on the freeway were transported to a local hospital, one of those people is now in critical condition.
