This attack happened about a block or so away from where I'm standing, maybe a little bit further. But what we saw over the course of the day, obviously investigators going in and out, but also coroner vans going in and out, as we now learn from the coroner that the death toll has jumped to 15 as opposed to 10, which is where it stood for most of the day.All of this, of course, as investigators are trying to piece together how exactly this unfolded. A big part of it, the motivation. Well, the FBI said that an ISIS flag was found inside this vehicle, along with a potential IED as well, along with other potential IEDs in the surrounding French Quarter area as well. As you were just talking about a little bit earlier and reporting from our John Miller that law enforcement officials, law enforcement are reviewing videos, according to multiple officials briefed on the investigation, where this individual said that he joined ISIS. So, no doubt part of this investigation moving forward. But then, of course, there are questions as to why barriers that were installed years ago here to prevent this type of attack from happening didn't stop it from happening in this case. And we actually saw how these initial moments played out from some surveillance video from a nearby business next to us here, which actually shows a white pickup truck coming up Canal Street behind us here, and then goes around a police officer that is stationed in front of Bourbon Street. And then, of course, speeds towards the people that were standing not too far away. Well, police officials told us today that those metal barricades, those -- those barriers were actually under repair ahead of the Super Bowl next month. And so as a substitute, they put police officers in front of those roadways and other types of barriers. And they say that this -- this person went around them on the sidewalk, and that is how they actually gained access to all of the people that were celebrating again, in just the early morning hours of the New Year. And we are learning about some of the people that were killed in this attack, at least 15, as we have mentioned, one of them, in particular, 37 year old Reggie Hunter from Baton Rouge. As we understand from one of his cousins, he had sent a happy New Year text to his family and just earlier in the morning, but also that he was someone who liked to laugh and tell jokes, who loved his family and his kids. He leaves behind an 11-year-old and a 1-year-old. Again, in just the opening moments of 2025, Pamela.",

And he talked about the fact that because it was a Cybertruck and it had such a solid exterior that that helped contain the blast. So there are seven people injured. They're in the hospital. But of course, this could have been much worse. And it is important to note here, officials have not been able to rule out whether there is any connection between what happened in Vegas and what happened in New Orleans. Evan Perez is OUTFRONT in Washington. You've been covering this. He -- he called it a coincidence, Evan, at the very least, that both cars used in these events, these attacks were from Turo.

Again, there's a lot of coincidence here, including the fact that both of these vehicles were rented from this app, Turo, which allows people to take their private cars and rent them out to, to other people. And so that's obviously one of the big coincidences, obviously, that both events happening on the same day. Again, that's one of the reasons why you heard from President Biden that the FBI is going to investigate both incidents, to see whether there's any possible connections.Now, we don't know that at this point, they appear to be just complete coincidences. But in the case of New Orleans, look, we know from talking to law enforcement sources, some of the reporting that you've done as well today, Pamela, that, you know, this -- this person who carried out this attack had certainly been planning their attack for some time. They were able to leave behind recordings. They were able to leave behind writings that suggested they had some affiliation or some at least some allegiance to ISIS. None of that has been found yet in this, in the Las Vegas incident. But in the case of New Orleans, it appears very quickly that, you know, to the FBI that this was an incident that was related to international terrorism. And so that's the reason why you see the way that is being approached, which is the FBI leading that investigation. At this point, we know that the suspect there in Las Vegas was a former U.S. Army enlisted person. He served in the military in the U.S. Army from 2007 to 220 -- 2020. For about eight years of those, he was active duty. And we also know that he was actually deployed to Afghanistan back in 2009 to early 2010. So all of this now is focused on whether there are any potential accomplices in the case of New Orleans, because obviously, the FBI and law enforcement wants to make sure that any possible accomplices would be also brought to justice -- Pamela.",

The FBI did when I say we.And so putting that photo out, that's going to get the tip that could break the case open and figure out who these people are is going to be really important. And so they're -- they're doing that and concentrating on that. You also have ERT, the evidence response teams coming in from probably surrounding field offices there. You have Jackson, you have Mobile. So they're coming in to help the New Orleans field office probably process this crime scene. The FBI lab certainly coming in to kind of to take every kind of detail that you could get and divulge any kind of lead that they may be able to get from that, put that together, figure out what's going on there, and in Las Vegas as well. You heard the sheriff say at the press conference there, they were 98 percent sure who or 99 percent sure that they knew who the person was. They're going to probably wait for DNA to make sure exactly who he is, and then they'll be able to try to connect the dots with that, too.

When you look at the New Orleans attack and what we know now, you point out that the U.S. has killed at least three ISIS senior leaders in the last five years. One of them just killed less than two weeks ago. And you think this is no coincidence? JAMIL JAFFER, FOUNDER &amp; EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, NATIONAL SECURITY INSTITUTE: Well, look, you know, Pamela, its certainly possible that even if this was just an ISIS inspired attack and not an ISIS directed attack, that somebody may have decided to take matters into their own hands, seeing the effective way in which the U.S. government has prosecuted the ISIS terrorist group and say, look, now's the time for me to strike. That might have been one of the things that pushed our individual, Shamsud-Din over the edge in New Orleans. We don't know, really what's pushing him over the edge. We don't know what's caused him to do this. And we don't know if other people were involved. We've heard from the FBI suggesting others may have been involved. There's some reporting coming out of this intelligence report that there may have been other individuals involved, although I'm now hearing from law enforcement sources that that might have just been a little bit of noise in the system, that he may be a solo attacker. So more to come on that, but we do want to know what caused him to do this. And it may be that some of these successes that we've had against ISIS may be the cause of spell out here.",

How does someone like that become so radicalized and do something like this? ROB D'AMICO, FORMER FBI SUPERVISORY SPECIAL AGENT: Well, I think part of it is these groups are very good at getting to people that want to blame someone. It goes across the board. He was having tough times. I think there's probably some mental illness, that's going to come across the radar with him, but he's going down a slope. He wants to blame someone. And these groups are great for placing the blame on others and then getting them to act on it. It's -- we've seen it in the white supremacist movement. We've seen it in the terrorist groups. They're very good at that. And that's how they recruit them and then that's how they get them to take action. So I think you're going to see probably when it started to the spiraling effects that we saw from him finally taking action. Obviously, if he's planning to kill his family, the mental health issue is there, too. And I think it's a combination.",

How do we begin to have hard -- hard protection points, right? What do we use? Do we use buses? Do we use I like to use in New York garbage trucks and others to funnel people vote pedestrians -- pedestrians and vehicular traffic. How do we get them to the dome safely? What are the access -- access points and what are the points of transportation that we use?

But one of the most touching events, especially from the young man who was family comes from the neighborhood I grew up in. There was an officer that he was in the academy with, a young woman who found her way to the emergency room to see if her comrade was all right, and that was a tearful moment. But we haven't talked about that side of it, about how they feel about each other when they're in danger, and as well as the people at the hospital who reminded them that had they not gone to the perpetrator to nullify his threat and put them -- their life -- their selves in the line of fire and to potentially be killed or hurt like they were, then thousands more and hundreds more could have been hurt or even killed.",

He circles around the police car and there he goes. The question is, why didn't they have more in place?

The Super Bowl is coming up in just a little over a month. Millions of people will be here.
