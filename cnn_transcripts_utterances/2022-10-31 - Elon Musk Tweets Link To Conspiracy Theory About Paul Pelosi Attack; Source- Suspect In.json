It took Musk about six hours to finally delete the tweet, but it is raising questions about what the social media network will be like under its new leader.With us now is CNN media analyst and Axios media reporter, Sara Fischer. I've got to say, this was something that Elon Musk chose this in the first days that he owns Twitter to lay down his marker by retweeting this fringe conspiracy theory. Talk to us about the source that he chose to lean into. SARA FISCHER, CNN MEDIA ANALYST, MEDIA REPORTER, AXIOS (via Webex by Cisco):  Yes, it was a pretty dicey decision, John. The source is the Santa Monica Observer, and it's a site that's known for publishing misinformation around things like COVID, politics, vaccines -- you name it. This site, I think is about six years old and it was made by a lawyer and a former councilman who is conservative in California. But what really is the big deal here John is that Elon Musk is trying to court advertisers right now and convince them that this is a great platform for them to put their messages on. And at the same time, he is helping to spread misinformation by tweeting out these links. It's not a really good look if you're trying to pay off some of the debt from your massive deal.",

I'm told that he's brought in his own squad of former Tesla engineers, former PayPal executives, and even former Twitter executives to figure out who is going to get cut and who is going to stay.And from a product perspective, he's testing out new ideas suggesting, in part, that he might actually force people who are verified to pay to stay verified. Now, the price that's been thrown out there is $20.00 a month. You know in a newsroom, John, $20.00 a month for 12 months -- that's a crazy amount of money. I don't know that he's going to get away with charging users that much. But it's a big deal if he wants to force verified accounts to pay to stay verified because there are so many verified accounts of politicians at the local level all around the world that might not be able to afford it. And if they're not verified, it's one of the fastest ways misinformation can actually spread because you don't have a valid account to figure out who is saying that message.",

She is the Washington Bureau chief at USA Today. She is also the author of the book \"Madam Speaker: Nancy Pelosi  and the Lessons of Power.\" We were just speaking in the commercial break and you pointed out that statement that the speaker put out -- the language that she and her family are heartbroken and traumatized -- that's the kind of thing you don't hear from Speaker Pelosi. SUSAN PAGE, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, USA TODAY, AUTHOR, \"MADAM SPEAKER: NANCY PELOSI AND THE LESSONS OF POWER\":  That's right. She's made a brand of being defiant to the attacks that she's had -- the political attacks -- the increasingly violent rhetoric for 20 years. And for her to put out a statement that said she and her children and her grandchildren are heartbroken and traumatized is a vulnerable side of Nancy Pelosi that she does not often reveal. Of course, how could she not be? Her husband of 59 years, an 82-year- old man, asleep in his bed to awaken to an assailant -- an attempted assassin of his -- of his wife attacking him -- threatening him with a hammer, carrying duct tape and ties -- zip ties.

      "sentences": "Halloween is all about fear and fun, trick or treat. But if you're really looking to get a fright, Election Day seems like the main event.Fearmongering is a prime driver of our politics these days and evidence suggests it's making us bitter and paranoid, undermining civic trust, and occasionally erupting into violence. Now, the hammer attack on Nancy Pelosi's 82-year-old husband Paul, by an individual who police say was hunting the Speaker of the House, is just the latest ugly example. Since the January 6 attack on our Capitol, we've seen armed men arrested near conservative Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's house. Another armed man arrested outside the Seattle home of progressive Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, as well as an attack on an FBI office in Cincinnati after the agency searched for classified documents being held at Mar-a-Lago. Now, federal officials are warning that domestic violent extremists pose a heightened threat around the midterm elections just eight days away. We cannot get numbed into thinking this is normal, but let's be real. We are reaping what we have sown. American politics today is full of hate-fueled rhetorical attacks and the proliferation of misinformation via social media. There's even a phrase for it -- 'Devil Terms' -- coined by Professor Jennifer Mercieca from Texas A&amp;M. Now, 'Devil Terms' are designed to demonize and even dehumanize political opponents, leaving little room for reasoning together. The New York Times ran an analysis of devil terms in 3.7 million posts, fundraising emails, and speeches going back to 2010 and found that current members of Congress who fought certifying the election on January 6 used polarizing language on Twitter about 55 percent more than other Republicans, and nearly triple the rate of Democrats. In other words, embracing Trump's election lies seem to be a slippery slope towards other forms of extremism. And here's another way to gauge it. GOP election objectors referred to their opponents as socialists, in more than 1,800 tweets, more than twice as often as other Republicans, while Democrats called the other side fascist around 80 times. So while there is a feedback loop between perceptions of extremes on the left and right, they are not equivalent within the two parties right now. If anything, the problem is getting worse because more than half of all GOP nominees are running on election denial this year. And if folks only accept the results of an election they win -- well, that's not democracy at all. Now, on a smaller scale, Democrats are not immune from trying to profit from polarization. Remember during the primaries when Democrats were warning about Trump's threat to democracy and some of them actually targeted the few Republicans in the primary who had the guts to stand up to Trump? They believed if an election denier won that primary they'd be easy to beat in the general election. Well, now we're seeing a Democratic activist group running ads attacking one of the sole remaining Republicans who voted for Trump's impeachment, California Congressman David Valadao, and trying to make it look like they're hitting him from the right -- yes. A political action committee called Voter Protection Project is running ads calling Valadao a, quote, \"traitor who turned his back on Trump\" -- presumably, to erode right-wing turnout. Look, I get that politics can feel like a zero-sum game but this is dishonest and dishonorable. We need to recognize courage and character across the aisle if we want Congress to work because democracy depends on an assumption of goodwill among fellow citizens. And these devil terms take direct aim at that goodwill. We can already see this fearmongering online has real-world effects. And there are folks who say that calling out these election lies is self-divisive, but I'm not buying it. Insisting on a fact-based debate is absolutely necessary for a self-governing society. We need to confront fear with facts and steer towards solutions that decrease polarization and misinformation, armed with the understanding that the vast majority of Americans are not hard partisans who hate the other side. America's been playing a dangerous game by enabling these extremes to profit from polarization while flooding the zone with hate -- not least because it pushes good people away from participating in civics and politics. Defending our democracy will require fewer of these devil terms and more appeals to the better angels of our nature. And that's your reality check.",
