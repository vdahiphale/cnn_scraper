No people by dint of birth or passport, religion, nationality, or the color of their skin have a get out of jail free card, have a free pass to say, well, the law doesn't apply to us. At the end of the day, I go back to this basic premise, a child in Myanmar that's persecuted, or a child in Israel that is an orphan or that has been taken and killed, or one in Ukraine, for their family, there's no difference. Their universe has been torn to shreds. And this is the need for the court, an independent judges to scrutinize, not look at the politics, not look at a dysfunctional security council, not look at the difficulties it may cause regional organizations or different groupings, but simply say, is the evidence reliable? And if so, we go back to King John, that the king is under no man but God on the law. We all must be subject to that. Otherwise, what is this international rules-based system? What is the principles of public international law that so many men and women have given their lives for since the Second World War particularly? And I think it's a dishonor for them. It's a dishonor for the victims of the gas chambers if we airbrush out inconvenient truths. And we have to try our best to achieve justice for the victims of the 7th of October. We also must try our best to do justice for so many innocent people that are suffering as we speak in Israel and also in Gaza, as well as in other parts of Palestine. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We know also that there will be Tehran ceremonies that will be the largest as far as we can tell, this will be for all of the nine victims on board that helicopter, and there will be funeral prayers said in the Grand Mosalla Mosque. This is expected to attract many of the government supporters in Tehran. It has also been declared as a day off for -- a national holiday for all the officers around the country, actually, so that they can participate in these processions and these ceremonies.

And then on Thursday, just the body of the late president will be taken to the city of Birjand and then Mashhad where he will be in the historic Imam Reza shrine. And this is where the supreme leader will be conducting prayers over the late president's body. He will then be laid to rest later on Thursday in Mashhad. So, it is a multi-day event.

Interestingly, very, very quickly in the hours after the bodies were found of the president, the foreign minister and seven others, the promotions started. There is now an acting president. There is an acting foreign minister, and everybody in an official capacity is saying that there will be no disruption to the running of Iran. So at the same time as we are seeing this very public morning, we are also hearing a very public statement that there is stability in the country. This clearly will rattle the country domestically, having to have elections within 50 days. June the 28th, we know, is going to be the election day now and there will be jostling for positions. And certainly, it is going to cause some uncertainty domestically. But internationally, what Iran is trying to do at the moment is show a sign of mourning and stability. Paula?",
