A second black box has been recovered from the ill-fated Azerbaijan Airlines flight in Kazakhstan. We'll have the latest on the investigation into the crash and possible evidence of Russian involvement.Israel launches its first ever attack on Yemen's main airport as concerns grow yet again over escalating tensions in the Middle East. Plus, new CNN reporting on U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's threat to take back control of the Panama Canal. An investigation is underway after a commercial passenger plane crashed in Kazakhstan on Christmas Day, killing at least 38 people on board. The discovery of a second black box from the Azerbaijan Airlines jet could help authorities figure out what went wrong, that's according to the Kazakh State News Agency. Officials say more experts are expected to arrive on the scene in the coming hours, including representatives from the plane manufacturer and airline. A U.S. official is now telling CNN early indications suggest Russian anti-aircraft defenses may have shot down the plane. The official pointed out that it may be a case of mistaken identity as poorly trained Russian soldiers have been firing at Ukrainian drones. Aviation security expert Matt Borie explains why he believes Russia could be behind the crash. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)",

There is video from while the aircraft was still in flight showing shrapnel damages inside the aircraft. And then the video of the wreckage shows shrapnel damage to the tail vertical stabilizer and horizontal stabilizer sections of the aircraft as well. So combining the fact that there was a drone attack being repelled by air defenses in the vicinity of where this aircraft was attempting to land and the damage that was sustained in flight and visible after the crash points to a Russian surface-to-air missile being launched at this aircraft.(END AUDIO CLIP)",

But immediately upon doing so, the U.S. admitted, hey, this was a horrible accident in a very complicated situation. And we've just seen the Russians will lie about anything that occurs, and they're still lying about the MH-17 flight. They still haven't owned up to shooting that down with a Buk missile system.

The president and the first lady arrived in St. Croix the day after Christmas. This has become a holiday tradition for them over the years, and I can see why.You've got beautiful beaches behind me, the temperatures have been between the 70's and 80's since our team arrived. Now, this time last year, his trip was quite different. He was preparing for the election and seeking another four years in the White House. Obviously, a lot has happened since then. There were questions about his ability to serve another term. He stepped out of the race, endorsed his vice president Kamala Harris, who then lost the election to now-president- elect Donald Trump. Trump is now the one preparing to serve another four years in office, while Biden is focusing on preserving his legacy. Over the next few weeks, we do expect Biden to give several speeches about causes and specific policies that he considers some of his best accomplishments, talking about issues like climate, the economy, and foreign policy. After he leaves St. Croix, he will spend New Year's Eve in Delaware, and then in early January, in the early part of the new year, he will have a foreign trip to Rome and the Vatican, where he'll speak with Pope Francis about global peace efforts. And we don't expect a lot of policy advancement in these next few weeks. White House officials believe that most of what they would get done in this final sprint toward January 20th could be overturned by the incoming administration. So again, the focus on protecting his key accomplishments and preserving his legacy over these next 20-some days. Traveling with the president in St. Croix, Julia Benbrook, CNN.",

Thumper is one of 20 cats from the sanctuary who died in recent weeks from bird flu. MARK MATTHEWS, DIRECTOR &amp; CO-FOUNDER, WILD FELID ADVOCACY CENTER OF WASHINGTON:  We thought we were doing everything we could to avoid anything like this from happening. The cats are pretty well split up into 30-by-40-foot habitats. KAYE (voice-over):  The sanctuary's director and co-founder, Mark Matthews, says the cats' enclosures are spread out among five acres. He told me their first cat got sick on November 22nd. The 17-year-old cougar named Hannah Wyoming stopped eating and died the next day.
