Great to have all of you with me here tonight.Okay, so let's start wit this suspected leaker of a trove of classified Pentagon documents who is now in custody. Tonight, the FBI arrested 21-year-old national guardsman Jack Teixeira outside this Massachusetts home. Teixeira was reportedly the leader of a tightknit online community of gamers, many of them teenagers, with whom he shared these military secrets. Shimon Prokupecz has been covering this story for us. So, Shimon, this 21-year-old is now in FBI custody for disseminating top secret national, you know, security documents. So, what's going to happen tomorrow here?",

Not only did he win, but he won twice.But he also, especially right before the second time he won, he promised everyone, listen, I tell you now, if you vote for me, I'm going to do pension reform. I'm just letting you know, by voting for me, you cannot say that you're surprised when I raised the retirement age. So, I think there are some people who say, look, everyone saw this coming.
