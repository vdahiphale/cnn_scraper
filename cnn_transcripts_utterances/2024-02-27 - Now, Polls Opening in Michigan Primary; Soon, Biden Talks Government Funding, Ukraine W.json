So, really they got to get past that to really make an impact. We're watching that very, very carefully. Clearly, we know that President Biden and former President Trump are going to win Michigan tonight. I mean, there's next to no chance of that not happening. The other side of that, as you say, does Nikki Haley overperform, as she has done in New Hampshire? Obviously, in South Carolina, she did well relative to other states.

I don't think it's -- I think he's been working towards some sort of pause in fighting in Gaza for some time. But I don't think it's any accident that he goes on Seth Meyers last night and says, you know, we are hoping for a temporary ceasefire in the very near future with Ramadan approaching ahead of a Michigan primary.

This campaign has been going on for a while.So, it really is up in the air whether or not that's going to have been, in fact. And, quite frankly, Governor Whitmer, who's co-chair of President Biden's campaign nationally, has said and is right, we don't know what uncommitted is going to -- how those numbers are going to look in Michigan after tonight. We just -- it might be a lot, it might be a little, and we're really just waiting like everybody else to see what that number is and what sort of impact it has on the president and his and his political future in Michigan.",

You remember two weeks ago when Terrence Bradley was on the stand and there were some questions that he declined to comment citing attorney- client privilege.But there was some sort of a stunning moment, an earthquake moment at the end of day two of the hearing when Judge Scott McAfee, you know, he turned to Bradley and he said, I wonder if you've been misinterpreting privilege the entire time. And as a result, he met with Judge Scott McAfee yesterday behind closed doors and it was determined from that hearing that some of the questions that Bradley was asked were not covered by this attorney- client privilege. So, now he has to come back to be questioned again by defense attorneys and the state. And that will resume sometime later this afternoon. And to remind our viewers, Mike Roman, the former Trump campaign official and his attorney, Ashley Merchant, were the first to surface these allegations of what they called an improper relationship between Nathan Wade and District Attorney Fani Willis here. And they alleged that the relationship started well before Nathan Wade was hired. In fact, Nathan Wade responded in a sworn affidavit that the relationship didn't begin until 2022. But they say that Bradley can impeach that testimony. And this is really important because if the court finds that Nathan Wade was not fully truthful while he was under oath, that could mean big problems for the district attorney's office. So, that hearing, an emergency hearing, we didn't expect or get news until late last night that this would be underway today. So, we're expecting that to happen just a few hours from now. Sara?",
