      "sentences": "Well, Sara, this might be the easiest Fed decision for the next several months because the Fed had long been signaling plans to cut interest rates today and Wall Street is expecting the Fed will do just that. The market is pricing it at about a 99 percent chance, 98 percent chance of a quarter of a point cut today. That would come after the Fed cut rates in September by half a point -- that supersized interest rate cut.Interest rates are still high. They're still close to two-decade highs, but as you can see on that chart they are starting to come down which, yes, it is good news for people who are struggling to pay credit card debt, for people who are -- have a home equity line of credit or they're thinking about getting one, or financing the purchase of a car. But the big question really looming over the Fed right now is how does this Trump victory change things going forward. Does the Fed maybe dial back its plans to cut interest rates in the coming months because they're concerned about inflation? How do they think about the fact that Trump has proposed all of these tariffs and how inflationary that could be? And another big question is how is Fed chair Jerome Powell going to work with this next Trump White House? Because remember, Trump and Powell -- they have a controversial, testy kind of relationship, right? I mean, Trump nominate Powell, but Trump's also been very critical of Powell and some of his moves. Trump has argued that the president should have a greater voice in interest rate policy. So we should expect a lot of questions today to Powell along all of these fronts and exactly what changes for the Fed now that Trump is going to be the next president -- Sara.",

How long does it take us to get there? And finally, do we avoid sending actual troops to a conflict over there or potentially if China decides to invade Taiwan, what does that look like?

Make it very clear that their proposals are about the whitening of America rather than the strengthening of America. Second, when we talk about the economy, we actually laid out policies that would help people create jobs. If you focus on what has to happen in terms of startup businesses, you actually focus on a minority business development agency. That is how you can actually create jobs on the ground. And so very practically, when you see what happened on Tuesday it was, in particular, white men and white women who unfortunately decided to not vote for the vice president -- yet they elected Black women on the Supreme Court in Michigan. Yet, we had victories and Ruben Gallego is going to win Arizona. Yet, we had victories in North Carolina. It was the fear of a Black and South Asian woman that we have to speak about.

He was talking about immigration at the time and how an influx of illegal immigration creates competition for lower-skilled Americans. And I thought that was fascinating. So if that's the premise of the argument from the Trump administration -- or the incoming administration, I certainly understand it. And so the question for me becomes if you're going to remove criminals, I think most Americans would say yeah, that makes perfect sense. In terms of people who are actively working in the country, what is the approach for them to become legalized citizens? What does that look like? How much time does it take? Is there a fee or a fine associated with them coming into the country illegally and having stayed for so much time? I think most Americans will say well, that's an approach that seems logical. I can understand it. It's systematic. It makes a lot of sense. You're not harming people or ripping people across -- or families apart. So that's how I would personally want to approach this, John.

Of course, it was a tremendously expedited process that we saw there under the Trump administration -- one of its great achievements, a lot of people in the public health world said.But this typically happens over many, many years. We see animal studies, then clinical trials that take many years to go through. Once these vaccines have shown their safety and efficacy in large clinical trials they go to the FDA for review. The FDA reviews it and often brings in outside advisers. We saw this during COVID, too. Those are public hearings. Anybody can tune in and listen to these things. They last all day and usually they're very boring, but they put all the data out there. The companies themselves publish pages and pages -- hundreds of pages of data. The FDA publishes its own review of that in case it disagrees with the way the company is presenting the information. All of that is out there for the public to review itself as well. The advisers often take a vote or make a recommendation. The FDA decides whether or not to approve a vaccine. If it approves the vaccines, then it goes to a panel of outside advisers to the CDC. We saw this during COVID as well. They have a public hearing, and we get to watch all of that and see all of their slides and all of their data. They make a recommendation about whether a vaccine should be added to vaccine schedules. How often people should get them. Who should get these vaccines.

And we've already been seeing declining rates. They're still very high for things like the MMR vaccine (Measles, Mumps, and Rubella).

Now, in a new op-ed, he says \"Principled people must serve in the second.\" Miles Taylor is joining us now. Why are you calling for Republicans to join Trump when you quit, really, in disgust with what you had seen? MILES TAYLOR, FORMER TRUMP DHS SENIOR OFFICIAL (via Webex by Cisco): Well, Sara, look, I think there's a very, very clear reality that we saw on election night, which is that the Never Trump movement failed, and it failed catastrophically to try to swing the party back to the sort of Bush-Reagan era. The Trump era is in full effect and it's evident that the party is not going to go back to where it was before. So those of us that were pushing for a return to how the GOP was we need to acknowledge that if we want to shape a conservative agenda then it's going to be having to shape the MAGA movement. It's going to be having to shape Trump's orbit and making sure that there are people who actually adhere to conservative values going to work with him. Now, you know, people like me, Sara, have been progenitors of the notion that there was a resistance in the last Trump administration.

Trump's coming in also as a different and much more seasoned and experienced operative. He knows a little bit more about how government works. The good news, I think, is there are quite a few people that did serve in the first term, especially in national security positions, who could be steady hands on the wheel. Who don't want the president to do unlawful things but do align with traditional Republican values. And that's what I'm hoping happens in this second Trump administration is that those people go in.

I mean, honestly, a lot of us were concerned that it would be campaign operatives that would come into senior positions in a second Trump administration -- people who had no experience in government.Just take an example. Two people being considered for Secretary of Defense, Tom Cotton, as you mentioned, and Mike Pompeo. Both have served for a long time in government. But have been Trump loyalists, yes, but they also know the national security community extremely well and they're not the type that you would consider to be unexperienced political operatives. So I do think there is some cause for optimism there. And you mentioned Elon Musk. And while a lot of folks may not like Elon Musk's politics, beyond Elon, a lot of people in the technology sector that previously weren't politically active are considering coming into the administration. Folks that do have a lot of experience in emerging tech, competition in emerging tech. And I think that's giving folks another silver lining of optimism of the types of folks that are more qualified than you'd expect coming into serve in a second go-around.",

The judge, you'll remember last month, ordered Giuliani to turn over alot of things, like his Manhattan apartment and other valuable items, to Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss because he was found liable for defamation and falsely accusing the two of ballot fraud during the 2020 election. That never happened. And Giuliani was ordered to pay them nearly $150 million. But where is all of that? Lawyers for the -- lawyers for the two women say Giuliani has emptied out most of his apartment. Giuliani's attorney says that the things were -- that the things that were in there are now in a storage facility in Long Island. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And finally, someone trapping it.Spirit Airlines put out a statement they probably never thought they'd have to, talking about after they did locate it -- locate and release the animal and are now addressing the matter with a professional wildlife control company.
