Both Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are in full sprint to reach in particular out to undecided voters. One piece of analysis, officials with both campaigns seem to agree on this race is extremely close. T oday will begin in one of the places where it's close, the battleground state of Wisconsin, where in-person voting is already underway. We are moments away from former U.S. President Barack Obama taking the stage alongside Harris running mate Tim Walz. Harris, not on the trail today, but she is unveiling a series of economic plans targeting Latino men. The vice president also ramping up her media appearances, sitting down for interviews with NBC News as well as the Spanish language network Telemundo. On Wednesday, Harris will join CNN for a town hall just outside Philadelphia. Anderson Cooper will moderate. Of course, you can watch it right here at 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time. As we wait for former President Obama to speak, let's bring in CNN's Stephen Collinson, who is live here with me in Washington, D.C. So, Stephen, we've seen Barack Obama more active, more present on the campaign trail in recent days and weeks. How is he making a pitch to voters with two weeks to go? And what should we expect to hear today?",

He is in Wisconsin, as you said, where early voting starts today, that is an absolutely critical step on Kamala Harris's path to the White House. Bear in mind that four years ago, Joe Biden only won it by about 10 percent when he became -- 10,000 votes, when he became president, it's a massive college town. Democrats need to drive up the margins there, if they're going to win the state.So it's all about enthusiasm. Obama, of course, is making the sharpest comparisons between Harris and Trump and he's arguing as only a former president should -- can that Trump is no longer fit for a return to the Oval Office, so expect to see that. He's later going to move on to Detroit appearing, with Eminem. I think you'll see him there, appeal to black male voters, a crucial part of the Democratic coalition, where Harris is struggling to pull up the kind of number she needs to win Michigan, another key swing state.",

And what he is doing, everything is strategic.Now, as you said, apart from the personal insults which we know he has been really escalating in recent weeks. He talked a lot about the economy. He talked a lot about, you know, faith, which they actually think does help really bring some Hispanic voters and Latino voters over to Donald Trump's side. They think a lot of Hispanic men in particular our Catholic. We actually saw him yesterday, give a pitch to faith leaders as well. I just got off the phone with a Trump advisor who said that pitch is also in part going after Hispanic voters. But look, I think the bigger picture here is how, why they see this to be such an important coalition and demographic for them. And it really is everything that Steven laid out, where it is a vulnerability for Kamala Harris. It is an area where Donald Trump's campaign believes they can siphon away support an election that is expected to be so incredibly close, really, anywhere that they can gain more support, they think could make a huge difference. They really do believe that this could be won on the margins. And so that's why you're seeing him go so hard after these groups. It's not just Hispanic and Latino men and, you know, Hispanic and Latino people in general, but also Black men in particular, women voters. That's part of why he's been spending so much time in North Carolina. Now I know when Donald Trump, later this weeks goes to places like Arizona and Las Vegas, he's also going to be making that exact same pitch to Hispanic men in particular, in those places. Now, one issue we did hear him talk a lot about today was actually the border and I had some people reach out to me asking, does his language, does his rhetoric when it comes to immigration, particularly arguing that undocumented immigrants were coming over from the southern border being criminals. Does that resonate with Hispanic voters? It's interesting because I asked the Trump campaign this all the time and they actually think it does. They think it does resonate with them. And I will say, when I talk to voters on the trail as well in all of these different Trump rallies that I go to, many of them are immigrants. Now, many of them are immigrants who came here legally. And that's why they actually argue that this is one of their top issues. And we actually heard someone today at that roundtable in Miami tell Donald Trump that, you know, it's a misnomer just because, you know, I may be an immigrant doesn't mean that I don't care about the border. So that's something we heard Donald Trump lean very heavily into as well and I know he's going to make that same pitch later this week when he's on the west coast -- Jim.",

But also make up for losses in other groups that have typically been part of the coalition of successful Democratic candidates, including Latino men, Black men, et cetera.When you speak to the campaigns -- I mean, is that essentially the math here, right, for Democrats -- drive up women in particular, whereas Trump is trying to go into areas of the vote that Republicans typically haven't won before, such as, for instance, Latino men? BARRON-LOPEZ:  I think it's definitely a part of the calculus here, Jim. I was just talking to, you know, the 26-year-old state party chair of North Carolina, Anderson Clayton in North Carolina. And she specifically cited young women as a place where Democrats can drive out, drive-up turnout and potentially offset where they're losing with young men because we're seeing in polling that Gen Z men, in particular those 18 to 27, 28-year-olds, are moving in Trump's direction. And I was also talking to some young Republicans on college campuses in North Carolina recently, and they said that they feel as though Donald Trump is in their spaces more, he goes on the podcast or is that they listened to and they feel as though he pays attention to and speaks to them a bit more directly than Harris does. Now we've seen that Harris's campaign has tried to counteract that more recently, going on Charlamagne Tha God, issuing these proposals specifically on economy towards Black and Brown men, and trying to be in these spaces in a way that Joe Biden wasn't when he was the candidate.",

You could see them there. The trip is part of a U.S. effort which will take the secretary around the region to secure a ceasefire hostage deal in Gaza. It's been a long time coming. Progress on that deal has stalled for months, as the prime minister of Israel has pressed ahead, with the wars not only in Gaza, in Lebanon, but even from criticism -- in the face of criticism from many at home, including of course, hostage families. They're fed up. They protested outside Blinken's hotel in Tel Aviv demanding their loved ones come home. Blinken's trip coincides with another deadly day in Lebanon. Israeli strikes flattened this building in the Beirut suburbs. More than a dozen deaths were reported from an Israeli attack near Beirut hospital the day before. Lebanon is reporting its highest death toll from Israeli attacks in three weeks, 63 people killed on Monday alone. Joining me now, CNN Jerusalem correspondent Jeremy Diamond, he's in Tel Aviv. Also with me is Alex Marquardt here in Washington, chief national security correspondent Jeremy, I want to begin with you because I wonder, you, of course, covered the Gaza war extensively and watching the Israeli military operations in Lebanon closely. Are you seeing now similarities to the standards that the Israeli military follows in terms of these strikes when it comes to civilian casualties, because, of course, the criticism, including from this the administration, from the Biden administration is not enough tension, attention to civilian casualties and the kind of a general explanation that if you are close to a Hezbollah target, it's Hezbollah's fault if you're killed or injured.",

But it's -- the message to Israel and its prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, was clear that they see this as an opportunity. In fact, just moments ago, Blinken called it a unique opportunity in his meeting with President Isaac Hertzog to get those Israeli hostages home and to end the war in Gaza.That was the message that Blinken has been carrying throughout the day to Prime Minister Netanyahu, to the Defense Minister Yoav Golan to then finally, with the president. But when you hear what the Israeli government is saying for its part, it is very different, Jim. So it is not clear that Blinken is going to leave with any kind of deliverable that you're actually discussed -- that you mentioned. Prime Minister Netanyahu following that meeting with Blinken, putting out his own statement, talking about the continued threat from Iran, the need to continue fighting against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. No mention of the humanitarian aid that the United States has been emphasizing needs to go into not just northern Gaza, but all of the Gaza strip. So, Jim, it does appear that yet again, the Biden administration and the Netanyahu government are talking past each other, and that despite the fact that for -- in the days since the leader of Hamas, Yahya Sinwar, was killed, we -- we've heard this repeated refrain from the Biden administration that this is a moment, an inflection point in this war, at least could be that Israel does not for now agree with that message -- Jim.",

Elie, you know, the law. You're a lawyer, but I'm going to read it for our viewers. This is federal election law against vote-buying, 52 U.S. Code. Whoever knowingly or willfully pays or offers to pay or accepts payment either for registration to vote or vote can face up to five years in prison. Is what Musk is doing here -- does it violate that law?",

You're right, we need to always start with the statute, with the law itself, from the law, but I'm glad your team pulled that.So what we know for sure is if a person pays or offers to pay somebody for their vote or to register, definitely a federal crime definitely violates what you just showed us. But what makes this scenario a little different, the wrinkle is it's really a contingency. It's almost like offering a lottery ticket. What Musk is saying is you are eligible among many, many people to win this daily prize, only if you are registered. And so that's what takes it I think from a slam dunk to a closer case for prosecutors to try to figure out.",

You never want to be the first prosecutor ever to charge something. That said, sometimes you have to take the leap.In terms of timing, you're exactly right. There's no way DOJ is going to take some action on this and the two weeks between now and Election Day. There's a long-standing DOJ policy that essentially says, we don't do things that might influence an election if we control them as they would with a charge too close to the election. And if you look at this, Jim, I mean, imagine if DOJ were to indict Elon Musk, I don't think it's particularly likely, but I don't even know. I don't think they would have any way to know who that would help or hurt as between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris and may well antagonize and motivate Donald Trump's supporters more than Kamala Harris supporters could go the other way.

Is there a possibility of civil litigation either before or potentially after the election because we've certainly seen a whole host of cases being brought by Republicans on a whole host of issues, the presumption being those are means to challenge results after Election Day.",

And again, this would not be criminal, but saying I would like an injunction, meaning an official court order at Elon Musk has to stop doing this in civil court.But you would need to show a couple of things as a person bringing that type of lawsuit. First of all, you'd have to show what we call a cause of action, meaning you have to point to a law and you can't point to the criminal law as we open this segment with some law that says people get to sue for this in court. The other thing you'd have to show is what we call standing, meaning you'd have to show as the plaintiff in a case like this, that you are harmed in some sort of legally cognize boy.
