Trump will campaign with Republican Senator Marco Rubio, but not with Governor Ron DeSantis. Both Rubio and DeSantis are up for re-election. But the relationship between Trump and DeSantis, who were once allies, has grown distant ahead of a possible presidential showdown in 2024.With us now, CNN political analyst and White House correspondent for PBS \"Newshour,\" Laura Barron-Lopez, and CNN's senior political analyst and chief Washington correspondent for \"Politico,\" Ryan Lizza. There are some fascinating dynamics at play here, Laura. What do you think? LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, Senator Rubio is up by about, on average, 6 points. You know, this isn't, right now, a very close Senate race. So, the former president is going there, you know, on this tour ahead of final - the final - ahead of Election Day. And really it seems like it could very much be more of a snub towards Ron DeSantis than maybe boosting Rubio because everyone knows - I mean, look, Ron DeSantis has not made it, you know, a secret that he's interested in a run in 2024. That he wants to try to win the presidential nomination. And this clearly is former -- the former president trying to say, look, I'm still the head of this party, and I'm the one that a lot of Republicans are potentially going to get behind. And it's not going to necessarily help DeSantis in this final stretch as that takes a lot of attention away from him.",

So, there's going to be a split no matter what.So, Trump world is obsessed with DeSantis. A lot of Trump advisers telling me this week that they were all watching the DeSantis debate very, very carefully. Different opinions of people around Trump on the outcome of that debate. Some people said, you know, we would mop the - Trump -- Donald Trump would mop the floor with this guy. He didn't really stand up that well to Charlie Crist. Others saying, oh, he's formidable, you know, better than we expected. Trump himself, of course, likes to claim credit for DeSantis, that he, you know, quote/unquote, made DeSantis by endorsing him last time around. So - and, look, no other Republican in the party has gained on Donald Trump the way that DeSantis has. Certainly Rubio hasn't. I'm sure Rubio still has presidential aspirations. You know, he's not a major player going into 2024. DeSantis, according to polling, has. He has a national profile. He has tapped into conservative media people around the country. Republicans know who DeSantis is. He's famous in Republican circles in a way that other potential Trump opponents are not.",

And so now you have two allegations of this.Do either one of you, though, think that this impacts the race at all at this point in time? BARRON-LOPEZ: I think that the first one potentially, given the distance from that to election day, this one is very close to Election Day. And I was texting with a Democratic strategist just last night who said that really they think that the sentiments are baked in, in Georgia, you know, and a lot of people have already made their decisions. And, ultimately, if you were going to vote for Herschel Walker before this, even knowing the other allegation, I would be surprised if this one ultimately changes their mind. I will say, though, that I think abortion is going to be a key aspect of what -- influencing what ultimately happens in Georgia and a lot of other swing states.",

I was talking to some of my contacts yesterday who have a lot of experience in these corporate ownership changes, these corporate overhauls. And the first thing you want to do is meet people at an organization. And that's exactly what he says he has been doing. In fact, shortly after that kitchen sink tweet, he put out a tweet saying, I'm meeting lots of cool people at Twitter today. There has been some reporting that perhaps he wants to lay off some of the staff, which is very much a possibility. But even if that were the case, you still need people to keep the operation going. You need people who have some institutional knowledge. So, maybe perhaps that's what he is doing. We'll just have to see because with Musk, who knows.",
