But also, he specifically referenced Chinese ships in the South China Sea. So connecting this moment 80 years ago, when the US stood up against Nazi Germany, to US and US allies challenge not just to Russia and Ukraine, but China in Asia, South China Sea, but also of course, Taiwan.It's notable that they are globalizing this fight in effect, connecting it to history, and making it clear that that fight extends from Europe to Asia today. It was -- they were quite pointed, fiery words, I would even say, for the head of the Battlefield Monuments Commission, which I believe we will hear echoed by President Biden when he speaks. We should note that when he was speaking to ABC earlier today, Biden had quite strong words for Vladimir Putin as well, saying no, he was not a decent man. He is a dictator. Again, drawing lines between what the US stood up to those 80 years ago today to what President Biden and Macron believe it is standing up to the US and its allies, I should say, standing up to today.",

Again, I do believe there is likely some symbolism there.This is not a political trip. This is a trip that obviously President Biden mine is taken as head of state to commemorate the US involvement in the allied invasion of Normandy in 1944. But there are obvious political implications here in the United States. And there is very much a domestic audience to everything you're seeing today, and we'll see over the next few days. Let's get to our senior White House correspondent Kayla Tausche, who is also in Normandy watching all of this, as we wait President Biden's address.

And it is one of I think the significant events that the President is doing during this trip. President Biden was responding to some criticism of the US now allowing Ukraine to use American made weapons to strike into Russia. And President Biden said, I've known Putin for over 40 years. He's concerned me for 40 years, Biden told David Muir of ABC News.He's not a decent man, he's a dictator. And he's struggling to make sure he holds his country together. While he keeps this assault going. We're not talking about giving Ukraine weapons to strike Moscow, to strike the Kremlin, is to strike just across the border.

      "sentences": "Absolutely. And this is something that undoubtedly, you could expect President Zelenskyy to push him, to push President Macron and any other leader who's supplying weapons. And President Biden has made it clear, it appears at least, for these weapons can be used to strike inside Russia -- Russian positions that are striking, for example, recently in Kharkiv. Right up in the northeast of Ukraine, right close to the border there.Zelenskyy would dearly like to be able to use all the weapons he gets from the West, including the fighter jets when they come, the F-16, to be able to reach deeper into Russia. But these are significant because they, if you will, prevent Russia having the ability to stand just a few miles back in the case of Kharkiv, 20 or 30 miles back from the target, and love these massive S-300 surface to air missiles that they repurpose for firing civilian targets in the cities there that they've been doing with impunity. So it makes a big difference for Zelenskyy. Putin has said that there will be consequences for the United States for this unspecified consequences, but consequences nonetheless. This is something of a threat from President Putin, has made plenty of threats in the past. They're not to be taken lightly, of course. But this is where Zelenskyy feels he needs that additional edge that he wants to be able to target the missile launchers, the rocket launchers, the ammunition dumps, the things that is using their own indigenously made attack drones for oil refineries deeper and deeper inside Russia, but to weaken Russia's ability to take on and target the Ukrainian population. I think, you know, when you look more broadly, at what is happening today, as we are here. For these veterans, this veteran getting a medal bestowed upon him by the French president there. What they knew and know, and understood about fighting nationalism. There's a sense that across the generations since it is being lost, that the outcome of not fighting nationalism, of not taking on that threat is being lost as we see it resurge in Europe and other places.",

And it is the highest civilian award that they bestow. President Biden also then goes to meet with each and every one of them.In part of his French speech, at the beginning, President Macron said one of the most beautiful sights in all of France, and all of French monuments, is right here. These graves, Colleville-sur-Mer, which is the American Cemetery where we are, and the other allied cemeteries, the cemeteries that contain French and many others. These are the most beautiful spots in France, he says, because it reminds us of what you all did to help us and to liberate us. And we saw also some of the guests taking part here, Tom Hanks, actor Tom Hanks, who with his production company, has done so much to tell the history of World War II to an enormous and wide not only American lay public but around the world. But importantly, also his partner, and standing right there as I speak, in film, Steven Spielberg, who has done so much to tell and remember, and gather the story of the Shoah. His work on preserving the memory of the Holocaust. His interviews is monumental and landmark. And remember, on the morning of D-Day, what President Eisenhower said to people when he broadcast. He said, although the initial assault may not have been made in your own country, he said to Europe, the hour of your liberation is approaching. And many of these people, plus many other veterans, British and others, liberated, eventually, the concentration camps, 6 million Jews had been slaughtered. And the world frankly did not intervene to help them. And it was only at the end of the war when Europe was liberated, that the full horror of what Hitler did became fully apparent to everybody. And this is the aftermath and the echo of what we experienced today that anti-Semitism rises, these terrible wars continue, the war in Gaza continues, the war in Ukraine continues. These are the kinds of battles that it had been hoped there's kind of values that have been fought for. It had been hoped that they would at least put paid to those kinds of wars, and yet they continue. And the memory today of all these heroes who stood up and gave their lives, and these who survived that massive monumental battle, the biggest, amphibious landing in history is just remarkable to witness.",

They saw them fall, they knew their names, they may have held them when they die. And they come back in part to remember them.But here they are, all these years later, being honored in this incredible way. The presidents of two great nations, hugging them, kissing them, bestowing this lesion donor, this Legion d'honneur, this Knighthood of France upon them. They've waited -- I don't think they've waited all their lives for this. It's not what they've waited for but what an honor, what a tribute. They were willing to sacrifice themselves. They saw their friends sacrifice, have come back to honor their friends, and to hope that they did a good job. And that it was worth it. And that we will cherish the values which they held so high. That, of course, is going to be the President's message as well. But it really sends tingles down your spine, I have to say, watching these men struggle up from wheelchairs in some cases. And the look in their eyes, clear-eyed, looking at these great men that stand in front of them. And these great men, these presidents, look at them and see great men in front of them.

Every year, the number of those veterans standing there dwindles.And there will come a time not too far away when there won't be any, who were on those beaches who remember personally will remember, will know the history, will have the videos, will have their stories. But moments like this, they're becoming fewer and further between over time. So it's truly remarkable to see them there.
