We have the very latest developments on the stalled what has been the stalled defense bill in the House of Representatives. I'm Kate Bolduan with Sara Sidner. This is CNN NEWS CENTRAL.All right, let's start with the breaking news. The House has just voted and final passage of that big defense policy bill and the bill has passed with those changes, those controversial changes from hard right far right Republican members of the House. Let's get over to CNN's Manu Raju for this breaking news. Manu, what's the final vote count? What are you hearing? What happens now?",

We're getting the vote count right now that just came down. The vote is -- was 219 to 210, 218 votes is what is necessary to get a majority of the House. So 219 to 210 was the final vote the gaveled just came down. Four Democrats voted for it, that includes Congressman Jared Golden, he's from Maine. He represents a swing district for Maine, as well as some of the other ones one Washington State member as well as voted for it as well. There were four Republicans who voted against it. That included Ken Buck of Colorado, Thomas Massie of Kentucky, Andy Biggs of Arizona, and Eli Crane, also of Arizona. But that was even with the -- because of the Democratic defections that essentially helped get this bill over the finish line because most Democrats had initially planned to vote for this bill. But they ultimately decided not too because of some significant changes that were made dealing with social policy issues that were added to this bill through the amendment process, one of which would mix the Pentagon's policy to providing reimbursements for abortion services for military service members or their family who go out of state in a state where the procedure is banned. Also other issues such as targeting transgender rights, namely transgender health care for veterans that will be eliminated as part of this bill. Also, it would eliminate diversity and equity training programs as part of the Pentagon and also no longer allow the Pentagon to have a deal Defense Department schools to have so called gender ideology books. Those are all pushed by members of the far right. That cost Democratic support. But in just speaking to some members about this, one member of Congressman Tim Burchett just spoke to defended these changes, including the ones going after transgender rights. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. TIM BURCHETT (R-TN): When you have a man in a dress that's recruiting or promoting the military, that doesn't fly in East Tennessee. He doesn't fly anywhere most, most places in America. When we get away from what traditional America believes, traditional America will not -- it's not going to play ball. REP. PAT RYAN (D-NY): I am a proud combat veteran. This is an insult to all who serve particularly women in uniform, nearly 20 percent of our active duty force, risking their life right now.

Remember, they have the power to vote -- a single vote to essentially call for his ouster.He agreed to that concession after winning the speakership after 15 ballots. And what he has done time and again, is trying to get something through his chamber that gets all those members, including the far right going people who are not happy with him to get them to support this. He did that with the debt limit. But they also had to come back and compromise with the Senate and with the White House. And folks on the far right, we're not happy. He's going to have to do that, again, with spending legislation to keep the government open past September 30th. And essentially try to get his conference in line then cut a deal that could also anger the folks on the right. And then here with the defense bill, you also have to cut another deal that could also anger those folks, how he navigates those compromises will be a big question that will go a long way to determine his power in the house and how long he can keep the gavel.

This is some of the world's biggest movie and T.V. stars trade production sets for picket lines. Overnight, Hollywood's largest union comprised of roughly 600,000 actors went on strike after their talks with major studios and streaming services failed. They now join the 11,000 members of the Writers Union that have been on strike since May and the industry halted. Upcoming film releases and T.V. show premieres are no longer coming out soon. They will be delayed. This also means union actors will no longer do any promotional work. The stars of the new movie, Oppenheimer, which includes Matt Damon and Emily Blunt, it's supposed to air on the 21st of July, they actually walked off and left the red carpet at the U.K. premiere of their film last night.

Essentially, your viewing options are about to become much slimmer. September usually brings a brand new season of so many shows. But now you really can't count on it this fall with the strike. In place of the scripted shows, you can expect more reality shows to be popping up, more game shows even.When the writers' strike was looming services -- streaming services like Netflix, they started preparing. The CEO saying back in April this, that we had time, we had to make plans for the worst, we do have a pretty robust slate of releases to take us into a long time. Here's another caveat with all of this. Network productions for daytime soap operas, they can still continue, soap writers are typically not members of the Union and the actors have a different cont -- have a different contract than the one that has expired. As for movies, any remaining production as we've been discussing, it really has come to a stop. The release of next year's expected blockbusters like the sequels of \"Gladiator\" and \"Mortal Kombat,\" they could very likely be pushed back in a very big way. The only exception to moviemaking right now could be independent films, if they're not tied to or connected to any major production studio. Live theater also will continue.

The president of SAG-AFTRA, Fran Drescher said, look, things look good, and they were going to reach an agreement. What happened?ELIZABETH WAGMEISTER, HOST, PBS \"ACTORS ON ACTORS\": What happened is that both sides were just not coming to terms whatsoever. We saw Fran Drescher yesterday at a press conference for SAG saying that the actors are the victims saying that they were offended by the deal that was presented to them. Clearly, both of these sides are not on the same page whatsoever. Then if you look at the studio side, they're saying we have given a historic deal. And obviously, that is not what the actors believe. Now a big component of this, Sara, is AI. Of course, a strike always comes down to money and to fair pay. But in this changing era of the streaming business, where there's really no precedent. This is also about protections from technology. So it's not just about getting a fair share of the streaming success, it's also about protecting your likeness.

We all know that they get big paychecks, and they never have to work again. This strike is really for the working actors known as extras, background actors. While allegedly one of the proposals that is in there from the studio side that pertains to AI is that a background actor could show up onto set, their face is scanned, they're paid a day rate, and then they never show up to work again.Now the day rate under the union is around $200. So if this is what's in the proposal, this means that a background actor can be paid $200, their faces scanned, they never show up to work again. These sets in Hollywood are full and full of extras. Anytime you watch a movie or a T.V. show and you see people on the sidewalk you see people sitting in a restaurant, AI can essentially take that over. And that's very scary and a very scary possible reality for all of these actors, many of them who can make their entire living annually just off of being a background actor.",

It happened five days after the failed mutiny.There were some three dozen of these Wagner commanders sitting there in the Kremlin, talking to Putin. And Putin said, essentially, you guys can keep fighting, we'd like you to keep fighting and you can keep fighting under your own direct commander. It's a guy named Sedoy, which is his call sign. It means gray hair. And apparently, according to this account by Putin to this Russian newspaper, the commanders nodded along.

This is July. A lot of them are out in training right now. The sailors are deployed, Marines with them as well, Army soldiers and foxhole is doing a lot of different training. That happens right now in the summertime. So when they get this news, when it finally gets to them, they're going to be pretty happy. They saw a big pay raise and all the things that will go with it.
