They're heavily utilized in a way that perhaps they're not as used in other states because of that heavy emphasis on vote by mail. So this is very concerning for potentially a lot of voters there.",

There is consensus on the Republican side. They just cannot have a repeat of what happened in 2020, where they lost 61 out of 62 cases. They had lawyers who had been sanctioned, even criminally charge. So a source familiar with their strategy told me the number-one priority was hiring good lawyers. And I'm told the former president came to realize that he needed to spend money on lawyers and also litigate questions before the election and not after. Now, Democrats, on their part, they have put together a powerhouse team, former White House counsel, Dana Remus, also two former solicitor generals, election expert, Marc Elias, and Biden personal -- president, Biden's personal attorney, Bob Bauer. And Dana Remus told me that their whole mantra is just prepare, prepare, prepare. They know the Republicans started earlier. They've started earlier too. Now as part of these preparations, they have engaged in network of state-level attorneys. So if they see an issue in any state, they're prepared to reach out to that lawyer with expertise to do whatever they need to do. Now, both sides have also engaged in wargaming. They've worked through different scenarios. For example, on the Republican side, they even war gamed natural disasters. And when they saw hurricanes obviously hit Florida and North Carolina, they said, ah, this is what we trained for. And lastly, the Democrats have also drafted thousands of pages of pleadings. So if there is an issue, they're going to be ready the courthouse -- go to the courthouse, be ready to go.",

This is one that has drawn a lot of scrutiny about whether they are actually seeking to change the rules or if they're just trying to sow confusion.Because they have targeted overseas ballots, which historically have been the majority members of the military. But in recent years, it's actually turning out that it's the majority of these voters are ex- pats who are ex-pat civilian expats. Ex-pats are expected to favor Harris. So Republicans, in recent weeks, they've started targeting these with legal challenges. And they have lost in Michigan, in North Carolina. Now, in Pennsylvania. And the judge here that he's seen similar to other challenges, which is it's too late to do this, right? Courts are very reluctant to change the rules of the game so close to an election. And were don't know about ballots that have already been sent out. So if you cannot prove that there is some sort of clear fraud, it's unlikely you're going to change the game. So there have been questions from Democrats about why Republicans are targeting these now. Is it an attempt to actually change the rules of the game? That's what they tell you. They said we need to know the rules before the games begins. But mail- in ballots, they're already being mailed in. And some Democrats suggest this is all part of an effort to cause confusion if they lose.",

And something that you noted, her introducing herself in a new light to these persuadable voters.

And I believe, actually looking at the polling, we see that Americans really do care about strengthening our democracy. They recognize what's at stake in this election. The backdrop of today's speech being on the Ellipse, where Donald Trump staged his January 6th coup, his insurrection, I think will do a lot of the talking for itself, allowing the vice president to really paint that vision for the next four years.",

Joe Biden's favorables are underwater. I wonder if you think there might be some blowback or perhaps some missed opportunities, some miscommunication with having her stand in front of the White House and having folks associate her with an administration that has we're seeing on the screen isn't the most popular.",

Between President Biden and Vice President Harris, we've made incredible progress in solving those issues. Right now. President -- former President Trump is going up there having hate-filled rallies in which he continues to demonstrate that he's completely unserious to solve these problems facing the American people.

But that's the thing he's built his campaign around hate and division. But the thing is, if you look under the hood of a lot of the polls that we've been seeing, what are we seeing? We're seeing Vice President Harris make strong gains among Independents, moderates and even Republicans. These are folks who should be voting for former President Trump, but who recognize that we cannot have four more years of him. They like, I believe, a vast majority of Americans are ready to turn to page and to start a new chapter. And I think this speech tonight will really underscore that for those folks at home.",
