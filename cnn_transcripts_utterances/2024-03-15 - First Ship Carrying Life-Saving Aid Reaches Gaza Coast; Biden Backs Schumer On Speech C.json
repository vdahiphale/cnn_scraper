Also ahead, a judge rules that the prosecutor on Donald Trump's Georgia election case can stay on the trial, but only if a former lover is removed. Details on that decision and voting is underway in Russian election that is sure to see Vladimir Putin win yet again. But first tonight, it is a welcome sight for people on the brink of famine after five months of war. The first ship to bring life-saving aid to Gaza has now arrived. Workers are unpacking the 200 tons of food on board, transferring it to smaller boats that will take it ashore. The charity, World Central Kitchen, says several crates have already been delivered. In some parts of Gaza, Palestinian civilians have been risking their lives to pick up aid, yet another deadly attack has been reported in Gaza City, on crowds desperate as we have shown you for food. And we warn you, the next video is disturbing. The health ministry says, at least 20 people were killed and more than 150 wounded by Israeli shelling. Israel denies that. It says its preliminary review found armed Palestinians open fire instead. While Israel's war cabinet meantime has approved long threatened action, their words in Rafah, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office says the IDF is preparing to evacuate the population there without giving really any further details. Our Jeremy Diamond is following all of these developments for us from Jerusalem, joins me now. And, Jeremy, finally some good news that first aid ship has arrived. The first pallet of aid has been offloaded. What more can you tell us about the distribution and the promises key here of more aid?",

Well, those pallets were offloaded today in Gaza after a multi-day journey bythis ship that was carrying, what will eventually amount to more than 500,000 meals for desperate Palestinians in northern Gaza. We understand, according to the Israeli military, that 130 pallets of humanitarian aid were offloaded from those ships, transferred into World Central Kitchen trucks. The Israeli military saying that they helped coordinate this. But now, there are questions about exactly how this aid will be distributed and the safety of that, because we've seen so many instances, of course, in which these aid trucks have been swarmed by desperate people in part of northern Gaza where we have seen cases of malnutrition just rapidly, rapidly rising at this time. And, of course, beyond that, we are also seeing deadlier incidents involving the collection of humanitarian aid. Last night, the Gaza Ministry of Health says that 20 people were killed, 155 wounded by what they say was Israeli shelling of a -- a food distribution point, the Kuwaiti roundabout in Gaza City. The Israeli military, for its part, denies that it carried out that attack. It says that it's -- it carried out a review that there was no tank fire, airstrikes or gunfire. They've also released a video now that shows at least one gunman firing into the crowd. But this doesn't explain the devastation that we saw in videos of the aftermath of this, the rubble, the dust, people wounded and injured, covered in dust from what appears to be a much more significant explosion than simply gunfire. And eyewitnesses on the ground say that they heard what sounded like tank or artillery fire. Many questions still remaining about that incident on the ground.",

But in terms of details of this plan that was approved by the Israeli Prime Minister, we really don't have many. All we have is the Israeli military this week, telling us that civilians would be moved to what they've described as humanitarian enclaves in central Gaza, where there would be food, shelter, and field hospital setup in partnership with other countries. But this is an enormous operation to carry out. Just the evacuation alone, I'm told, would take at least two weeks. And there are major questions still, as the Secretary of State was pointing out there, about the feasibility of moving so many people, one and a half million Palestinians, many of them already displaced from other parts of Gaza, to move them out of that city before a military offensive. And we have seen in the past, as Israeli plans to evacuate other cities in Gaza, have simply not gone according to plan. So there is a legitimate reason why there are so many questions about how the Israeli military will actually carry this out. And so far they have yet to actually answer many of those publicly.",

He has repeatedly called on the House Speaker Mike Johnson to bring up Ukraine aid on the House floor. We've seen no signs that the House Speaker is interested in doing that. And, you know, that is a part of why a few days ago here in the U.S., we saw the administration announcing an additional $300 million in U.S. assistance.

Nor is any disqualification of a constitutional office necessary when a less drastic and sufficiently remedial option is available.\" So, again, she gets to stay as long as he steps down. Now, of course, Donald Trump's attorney, Steven Sadow, really hit back pretty fast and pretty hard. He actually says in a statement, \"While respecting the court's decision, we believe that the court did not afford appropriate significance to the prosecutorial misconduct of Willis and Wade, including the financial benefits, testifying untruthfully about when their personal relationship began, as well as Willis' MLK church speech.\" And I want to bring that up because that's where race got infused into this. Fani Willis went to a church and started talking from the pulpit, just about the fact that she felt like a lot of this has been turned around because that Nathan Wade was black.

But the Biden administration has been saying for a long time that the ball is essentially in Hamas' court. It is on them to respond, that Israel had basically agreed to this framework. And, Isa, now we have a counterproposal from Hamas, which I should note Israel is essentially dismissing out of hand, calling it ridiculous and absurd. But this is what we've learned, that in an initial stage of a multi-phase deal, that Hamas would agree to release the elderly, the sick, the wounded, and female hostages. There are believed to be around 40 of those. And in exchange, Hamas is demanding that some 700 to 1,000 Palestinian prisoners be released from Israeli prisons. That is a huge number that Israel may end up balking at. And then in later phases, and I think this is where it gets really complicated, Isa, Hamas is saying that Israel must agree to a permanent ceasefire and a withdrawal of IDF forces from Gaza. That is something that Israel has so far refused to agree to, saying they want to continue their fight against Hamas. They're saying they want to go until complete victory. And, of course, there's all this talk about Israel wanting to undertake an offensive in the southern Gaza city of Rafah. Isa.",

Judge gave Willis a choice, either she leaves the Donald Trump election interference case, or the special prosecutor, Nathan Wade, resigns. The judge is keeping the case alive by refusing to remove the DA, but his ruling comes with some very harsh words, saying an odor of mendacity remains over the circumstances of Willis' romantic relationship with the special prosecutor. We have a lot to break down from this important ruling. Joining us now with her reaction, the Wall Street Journal's Senior Political Responder, Molly Ball. She joins us from Arlington, Virginia. Molly, welcome to the show. I mean, the top line seems to be here, that Willis can continue prosecuting the case, a former president and his co- defendants, and it's clearly a legal win. At least it looks like a legal win for her. But has her relationship with the special prosecutor, Nathan Wade, has that changed the integrity of the case? Has that wounded the case at all politically?",

I mean, as you say, we stillhave not heard Fani Willis respond to this ruling by the judge and say whether she will dismiss the special prosecutor, Nathan Wade, from the case, which the judge said was the condition on which she could stay on the case. So, it's not a complete victory for her. It muddies the waters politically, substantially. As you say, the judge in his ruling called her judgment into question with some very harsh words, saying he couldn't be sure she was telling the truth when she testified and when Nathan Wade testified, and also rebuking her for a lot of the public statements that she's made about the case. She's gone out there in public multiple times and accused her -- you know, the defendants in this case of racism, and the judge smacked her down for that, said that that was inappropriate, and even seemed to suggest that if the defendants were to seek a gag order, that he would welcome that. So that would then limit the statements that she and others could make about the case, which I think would also limit the political relevance of it. And then lastly, we don't know if this will cause further delays in the case. We've seen all of Trump's criminal cases have been dragged out in part as a deliberate tactic by his lawyers, so if this case gets further delayed, that could also have political implications.",

And I think the larger context is, again, that in all of these cases, they have been filing motion after motion, in some cases seemingly sort of long shot, or tendentious or far-fetched legal action, that in some cases have been successful, either in actually winning or in just creating delays. We saw just yesterday, the judge in the Florida-based federal case about Trump's handling of classified documents denied one of the lawyer's motions, but she's taking her sweet time ruling on this flurry of other motions that they have filed, challenging everything from the wording to the statutes themselves. So it's created this cloud of mistrust. And I think, as you say, the way that he has taken all of these cases as a talking point in his campaign, used them to argue to his supporters that the whole system is corrupt and that he's being victimized, that has really undermined a lot of Americans' faith in the entire justice system.",

But, you know, with Willis, Willis is saying with the Georgia election interference, Willis was saying that she's pushing for a trial in August. But if we look at the timing of those cases and we just looked at some of those, I mean, the reality may be, and explain this for our international audience here, Molly, that the majority of Americans won't even get to hear or see any of the evidence until after the election.

Now there's no way it goes forward for at least another month after that. And so, you know, if Americans were hoping to have the information from these trials to see potentially verdicts in these trials in determining their vote, we've seen in many polls many Americans say that they would be less likely to vote for Trump if he were convicted of a felony.

It was in the other direction as well. The French were pretty angry after Olaf Schultz when he said he is denying the Ukrainians German cruise missiles called the Taurus because he doesn't want to make the Germans party to the war. And he said that the Germans simply can't do things that, for instance, the French are doing and hinted that the French have ground troops already on the ground inside Ukraine to handle those cruise missiles that the French have given to the Ukrainians. So, there was a bit of an issue between Mr. Macron and Mr. Scholz. But today, you're absolutely right, Isa, the two trying to show some unity and also trying to move things forward really as far as arming Ukraine. There was a lot of talk about ammunition, about getting ammunition not just from within the European Union but getting it from outside the European Union if the production can't be scaled up quick enough. That seems something that the parties are all on the same page about. And then also using windfall profits from frozen Russian assets to pay for all that is also something that both Macron and Olaf Scholz said their agreement about. Of course, Donald Tusk as well. I want to listen in to some of what both Mr. Scholz and Mr. Macron had to say today. Let's listen in. (BEGIN VIDEO) OLAF SCHOLZ, GERMAN CHANCELLOR (through translator): A crystal clear signal goes to Moscow. The Russian president must know that our support for Ukraine will not ebb.
