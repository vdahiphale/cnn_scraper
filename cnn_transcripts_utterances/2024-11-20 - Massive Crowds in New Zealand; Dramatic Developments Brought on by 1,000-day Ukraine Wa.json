Answer is 40 to 80 million tons of waste each year. That`s an estimated 30 to 40% of the entire U.S. food supply. Many of us may feel somewhat contrite to know that works out to about 219 pounds of food waste per person. I got a quick bonus pop quiz for you. What percentage of clothes are recycled into new clothes? 1%, 10%, 20%, or 30%? Answer is only about 1% of used clothes are recycled into new ones. Well, two brothers who grew up on the Isle of Wight off the southern coast of England are trying to change that through their t-shirt printing business called Teemill. The company only makes a clothing item once it`s ordered, and once that item is worn out, it can be sent back to be reused for something new, creating less waste and saving money. Check out how these creative entrepreneurs are making it work. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MART DRAKE-KNIGHT, CO-FOUNDER, TEEMILL: Us growing up on our island, everything is finite, including resources, and you`re very conscientious of what that means both for you and also the natural environment that you`re surrounded by. I think that`s a very helpful frame of mind to approach sustainable business. If you just expand that out, just think about the fact that the entire planet is basically just an island. The clothing industry is a massive industry. Everybody on earth has lots of these products, but everything`s produced speculatively, and everything`s produced en masse. But something like half of all of the clothes that are made are actually fully utilized. That`s like a fancy way of saying that they`re made but never worn. Being from the Isle of Wight, we have naivete as a superpower, because you sort of say, well, why would you do that? Why don`t you just make what people need when you need it? And we`re like, yeah, we`re going to redesign the clothing industry. And you can actually do that just with technology, like making new types of machines and new software that runs those machines so that you make things on demand. You can come through, dude. You`re doing work. I`m just talking. In the sky, in the cloud, are all the orders that have just been placed in the last couple of seconds. There`s factories like this all around the world. And so the first step is that orders are sent across borders as data. Massively cuts out travel carbon. And Max just scanned the barcode, and the computer said, you should go get this large T from 7WB11 and chuck it on C1. So let`s go do that. And we put it on the track. That`s it. But from order to shipping, you`re looking at a couple minutes. Really simple, but it`s meant to be simple, because that means it can scale. Crazy thing about the traditional model is they would have produced tens of thousands of those products, speculatively, in the hope that someone would have ordered it. Here, it`s already been sold. We did it in our mom and dad`s shed to start with. We had 200 quid. That forced us to be very efficient and not waste anything. We couldn`t afford to. That unlocks really big opportunities, because you just save money. You save loads of waste. You save loads of money. We invest that here over in organic cotton. And then the second thing that we do is we use that money to fund our circular program. Now we have something like, I think, 10,000 brands and businesses that produce their products in this way. And now, increasingly, what we`re doing is we`re sharing with the industry. Because it`s cheaper and because it`s more efficient, you can actually get people over the line who previously perhaps wouldn`t be your typical sustainable pioneers. And so that`s what`s exciting.
