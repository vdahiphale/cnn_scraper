Chinese President Xi Jinping is among them arrived in Johannesburg on Monday greeted on the tarmac by South African President Cyril Ramaphosa.The Summit is a chance for Mr. Xi to try to extend China's influence in the global south as a response to Beijing's increasing rivalry with the United States and it seems many countries are eager to join BRICS. But one leader who is conspicuously absent Russian President Vladimir Putin, he's attending virtually out of concern. He could be arrested in South Africa on a warrant from the International Criminal Court. CNN Beijing bureau chief Steven Jiang joins us now with more on what President Xi hopes to accomplish at the summit. Steven, with the President put in a no show.

      "sentences": "You know, Laila, this is only Xi Jinping second international trip after the pandemic. And the first one is actually back in March to Moscow to see his quote unquote, deal -- dear friend, Putin. So this kind of dynamic in a way really illustrates the importance these leaders attached to this grouping, despite their country's vastly different economic and political models. And because they are really a share -- they're really bonded by this shared, genuinely shared grievances or some would say desire to change the current global order, let and dominated by the U.S. and its Western allies at a time when BRICS economies are growing in importance, and with the population accounting for some 40 percent of the world's total.That's why as you mentioned, one of the items on their agenda is to discussing the potential expansion of this grouping that of course, would further increase its impact and by extension, the leaders role occupied by the Chinese leader Xi Jinping, but they are also trying to discuss ways to deepening their economic and financial cooperation to reduce the reliance on the U.S. dollar. So ahead of the summit, you have seen a lot of Chinese officials and state media really drumming up this narrative of the global south banding together to counter what they describe as the U.S. policy of unilateral sanctions and long arm jurisdictions. But as you mentioned, this trip comes at a time when China is facing a lot of strong winds domestically, on the economic front the post-COVID economic rebound, not doingly (ph) --not doing nearly as well as officials had hoped, so that means Xi Jinping may be facing more constraints when it comes to the kind of projects he is able to finance and invest across the global South, especially in Africa. So experts and analysts say the Beijing leadership may be now adopting a so called low cost high impact strategy of, for example, improving party to party relations to tout the superiority of China's political system by having more African military officers being trained here in China. And not to mention, expanding Beijing soft power. CCTV, the state media outlets here, for example, just debuting a second season of a show called classics quoted by Xi Jinping across Africa, I'm sure officials here hope that's going to be a huge hit.

Of course, the Chinese growth has been really phenomenal. We haven't seen anything like it. But it's been slowing for some time. And China has been faced with a lot of issues for some time, including, of course, the end of population growth, so a declining labor force an aging society, particularly worrisome is a lack of dynamism in the economy, a failure of firm productivity to grow.All things that would be needed to create a country that may not be growing so fast in terms of absolute size, but would be growing in terms of GDP per capita, which is what's really important to the Chinese people. And it's important to President Xi as well, who seeks to escape the so called middle income trap that China may now find itself in if it's unable to increase output per worker. So it's at a very delicate point. It has a lot of problems. Of course, the property sector overhang, China is overbuilt. Many Chinese households have invested their whole nest egg into real estate. And so trying to get this sector to shrink, without causing the economy to really move into a recession or a funk for years, is something that I think is going to be a very difficult tightrope for the Chinese economy officials to walk yet it's something that they're trying to do right now.",

We're following developments in Thailand where controversial ex-Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra has returned home after 15 years in exile. Well, soon after his arrival, Thaksin was arrested and taken to the Supreme Court, which has now sentenced him to eight years in prison for corruption. Thaksin has long denied the charges ever since he was ousted in a 2006 military coup. Meanwhile, Thaksin's older Pheu Thai Party which finished second in May's elections, as taking the reins to form a new government. While the Move Forward party which actually won the election has been pushed aside by Thailand's conservative establishment. CNN's Paula Hancocks is following all this for you from Seoul. Paula.

In fact, the candidate that they will be putting up for prime minister is actually just tweeting about the return for Thaksin, saying to return to the motherland is a incomparable happiness and congratulates the family and the former Prime Minister for returning to Thailand.So this is the man who potentially will be the next prime minister if it does go ahead and if he manages to secure the vote this afternoon. Now, as you mentioned, Laila, the latest information we do have is that Thaksin has now been sentenced. He was at the Supreme Court, and the judge there sentenced him to eight years in prison on corruption charges. Now these were charges that were brought against him in absentia while he was in self-exile, and he was potentially going to face up to 10 years in prison, but eight years is what the judge has decided. So we will have to see where exactly Thaksin is taken next, and where he is held. What we are expecting, though, in the coming hours is that there will be this vote to decide who the next prime minister in Thailand is. As I say there is only one candidate and it is the candidate for Pheu Thai. Now just on Monday, there was a fairly dramatic about turn from this party. They didn't win the most votes in the election that was the Progressive Party Move Forward who was unable to form a government as they were blocked by the conservative and military backed parties. So Pheu Thai has now said they will form an 11-party alliance that will not include Move Forward but will include the military back parties. Laila.",

And of course, the answer, as we know from 11 months ago, that there are allegations of serious concerns about coaching techniques, training, health, and welfare of the athletes. And this just, I think, points out to everyone that those stories are real and those allegations are a big concern, because here you see this in front of the world, shocking, it's awful.
