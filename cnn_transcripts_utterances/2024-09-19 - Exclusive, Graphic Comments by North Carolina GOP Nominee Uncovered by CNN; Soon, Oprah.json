Stand by for details on the exclusive reporting by CNN's KFILE.Also this hour, Oprah Winfrey is using her star power to help Kamala Harris in the key battleground state of Michigan, hoping to appeal to a broad range of voters and mobilize black women whose support is considered crucial to the Harris campaign. Plus, a new round of presidential polls shows that Harris-Trump race remains neck-and-neck with 47 days to go. I'll ask the former Democrat turned independent, Senator Joe Manchin, about the state of the campaign. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. We begin with CNN's exclusive breaking story about North Carolina Republican Mark Robinson, the socially conservative candidate for governor and current lieutenant governor known for controversy, and now at the center of these very disturbing new revelations. We want to warn you that some of the report you are about to hear includes graphic comments. We're joined by Andrew Kaczynski, the senior editor of CNN's KFILE. Andrew, tell us what you and your team have uncovered.",

We did interview Robinson today and he categorically denies making those posts. I'll get to that in one moment.But, first, I want to walk people through just a few of them. Take a look at one right here. In this post, Robinson called himself a, quote, black Nazi. And when discussing then President Barack Obama in 2012, writing, quote, I'd take Hitler over any of the shit that's in Washington right now. It even goes beyond that, Wolf. Another disturbing post from Robinson defended slavery, writing, quote, slavery is not bad, and I wish they would bring slavery back. I would certainly buy a few. All of these comments and many others that you can read on cnn.com were made on the message board of a porn website called Nude Africa. And, Wolf, in addition to those posts, he also expressed views on Nude Africa that sharply contradict policies he has as a socially conservative candidate for governor. For example, he has been vocally anti-transgender, but look at what Robinson wrote on the porn message board a decade ago, writing that he liked, quote, watching transgender porn, adding, quote, that's effing hot, while calling himself a, quote, perv. In another thread that was discussing the story of a woman who said she was raped by her taxi driver while drunk, Robinson wrote, quote, and the moral of this story, don't eff a drunk white bitch.",

I mean, if you know anything about Mark Robinson he has said inflammatory things. I was talking to a source a couple of weeks ago, and they mentioned porn. And this was even before this story was out. So, he is somebody who has had a bit of a checkered past, even though Donald Trump has called him Martin Luther King on steroids. We understand now that Mark Robinson himself isn't a fan of Martin Luther King, is not a fan of the civil rights movement, is a fan of slavery, would buy slaves, I guess, if slavery were still legal. He is going to lose this race. But that's been obvious for months and months. I think the only question now is do Republicans start to cut him loose? Trump is there on Saturday. I understand he hasn't really wanted to appear with Mark Robinson. You know, there is a fear now that he's going to drag Trump down just through association and we know that the Harris campaign is focused like a laser on North Carolina and its 16 electoral votes.",

There's nothing wrong with being a part of the trans community or loving someone that is trans, but he is so anti-trans that -- just the hypocrisy that is there. And then to make a joke about rape in this climate is just disgusting. And I hear Shermichael, that there was a better alternative, but that's not what the Republicans in North Carolina decided. They decided they wanted Mark Robinson knowing that he says these type of things. And so, yet again, we have to ask ourselves, what type of Republican Party are we dealing with?

But here's the problem they have, I don't know how you tell this guy to step aside because he's a freak and a perv, as he himself rightly calls himself, when your nominee for president has been found liable of sexual abuse and is a convicted felon. And so, where do you draw the line? Is it not okay for somebody running for governor, but is it okay to have moral problems when you are running for president? And then, as Ashley mentioned, there's the hypocrisy of Mark Robinson himself, right, who tries to portray himself as this moral guy. He's an evangelical Christian. He preaches at Christian churches.

They raised $1.5 million dollars in just about three hours. So, the campaign through that group looking to really harness that energy. But it's not only black women. It is various coalitions across the country that they are trying to inspire and galvanize as those groups do the hard work of door-knocking and registering voters in the critical weeks ahead. In all, they're expecting about 200,000 people to tune into this live stream. This is a strategic choice of the campaign to ensure as many people watch and tune into this event as possible. It's just going to be a small live audience that will include Governor Gretchen Whitmer among others. And, Wolf today, we also learned that the White House has pulled over the liaison working with celebrities, that staff member, over to the campaign side.

But, listen, Oprah is a superstar to everyone, right, particularly women, suburban women. And if you were Kamala Harris, you really need to maximize the turnout among suburban women, black, white, Asian, Latino, and that's what they'll be doing tonight, connecting specifically, I think, with a group that works with black women. But you're going to have folks on there who want to donate, who want to figure out how they can organize in their own communities, because that's what it's going to take to elect the first black woman president.

And Donald Trump is around 12 percent, that's the same number he received in 2020.I think a part of the reason, to Nia's point, that you're seeing the vice president double down on her support and outreach to women is because I assume the calculation from the campaign's perspective is, if they can't make up room with men, specifically black men, can they sort of provide a buffer or a cushion, if you will, in some of those critical battleground states by continuously targeting and penetrating women voters around certain issues that are of importance to them? Whether or not that will be enough, I'm not exactly sure. I mean, polling data suggests, when you look beneath the top line numbers, that a lot of Trump's voters are typically underestimated, they typically aren't polled very well. And so his strengths may not necessarily reveal themselves in the data that we have access to, which is why you see that this race is a whole lot closer than I think many would have suspected it would have been.",
