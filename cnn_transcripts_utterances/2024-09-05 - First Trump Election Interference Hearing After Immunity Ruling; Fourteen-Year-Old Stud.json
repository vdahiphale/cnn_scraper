So it's also unclear here just how the U.S. government found out about this service member's detention.Bu at a moment of extreme tensions between the U.S. and Venezuela, this is obviously not a welcome development given that Venezuela has detained Americans in the past. The Biden administration has been able to get roughly 19 Americans out of Venezuelan detention over the last several years. But this being a U.S. service member, he's obviously going to be a higher value target for the Venezuelan government at this time, particularly after the U.S. government took that very dramatic step of seizing Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro's plane earlier this week, John.",

Those two teachers identified as Christina Irimie, who is 53 years old, a math teacher here at Apalachee High School, and another teacher here, coach Richard Aspinwal, 39-years- old, a beloved football coach here, defensive coordinator for the Wildcat football team. They had actually a game scheduled on Friday. We don't know the status of that. But in addition to those that were killed, there was also nine that were injured, eight students and one adult. And it was yesterday afternoon that we were reporting about that one adult who was shot in the stomach and in surgery. We're still waiting on getting an update on that condition, but the atmosphere here around Barrow County here in Winder is very heavy.

Trump is not here today. He is not required it to be, but I'll tell you what's going to happen. The judge is going to have a plan. Judge, Tanya Chutkan, she is no nonsense. She will have read everything they've submitted and she will have a roadmap of questions that she will ask a both sides. And I think there we may get some indication of how this case will proceed because that's really the big issue today. What is the next step? What does the schedule look like? I'm told from a source, familiar with the Trump legal strategy that they believe a win today is just getting any significant hearings pushed off until after November.

So, even when they get closer to the trial, there is possibly some way that they could try to introduce those comments, but they're not contemporaneous to the alleged conduct. And really, the bigger argument is over what he was told at the time, right? The Trump team is going to try to exclude what Bill Barr was telling him, saying, that's an official act, got to toss it out to the Supreme Court. Same thing with conversations he had with Mike Pence, they're going to try to toss those. That's really the key evidence around his frame of mind at the time. It's going to make or break this case.
