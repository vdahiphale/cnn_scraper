As I've said before, the U.S. is the only nation that I'm aware of where legislators approve spending and then have to approve paying for that spending when the bills come due.It is nonsense and it points to America's fiscal irresponsibility which is exactly what I want to talk to Catherine Rampell about. She's an opinion columnist at \"The Washington Post,\" a commentator here at CNN, and brilliant. So one thing I want to start with is, why are the MAGA Republicans, you know, dying on this sword, which is spending cuts? I thought that was the Tea Party Republicans. I thought that was the Paul Ryan wing of the Republican Party. Trump came in saying I don't want to cut Medicare, I don't want to cut Social, I don't want to cut spending. I want to increase spending which he did. So what's going on.",

This performative desire to get fiscal deficits under control is really at odds with the policies on the table. They have ruled out spending cuts to all of the places where spending is actually a major problem, long- term trajectories of that spending anyway.I'm talking about entitlements, Social Security, Medicare, as well as other parts of the Annual Discretionary Budget Defense. They're not super interested in touching those either. So when you rule out all of the major categories of spending as well as revenue increases, which they've already done, you end up fighting over a very, very tiny share of the budget, each category of which would be very unpopular to cut. So, yes, I don't think they really mean it.",

So we already had, in the backlog, these unsustainable deficits coming and then we made them worse essentially because neither party has put forward any realistic approach to undoing those problems and in fact, their exacerbating them.

That starts to get a lot more painful in the years ahead because the amount of money we will be forced to spend on just servicing the debt alone will increasingly crowd out other kinds of priorities.I mean, to be clear, there are categories of spending that I think we should be devoting more resources to. Things that will pay off. You know, making sure there's no lead in the pipes so that kids can grow up to be productive healthy adults and workers. Universal pre-K, things like that that would pay off. All of those kinds of priorities are getting crowded out by the fact that we have shown so much cowardice in making tough choices about the things that are on auto pilot as well as the other kinds of policy measures that seem popular.

But as we continue to see more political dysfunction, including in this shutdown threat, including in the threat to, in fact, needlessly default on our debt when we could have paid it off, I wonder how sustainable that will be.

It was a very different reception than the one that he had last time he was in Washington. I'm not sure how dangerous it is right now. I'm particularly worried about the U.S. I think in the U.S., going into an election year, you know, it is going to be difficult to sustain support. In Europe, there are countries which are tiring. We have a tough winter with high energy prices, too. But I think in Europe there is much more recognition of the stakes in this. And there are existential stakes for Ukraine and frankly existential stakes for Europe. And I think the challenge now, and I think I know you and I spoke about this while we were in Ukraine, I came away from a week there and I saw him, I saw his wife, I saw a bunch of people, most the key players in the government. I think for me the real realization was that this war is not going to be over any time soon. This is a long haul. It is a war of attrition. The front has barely moved. And so the focus needs to shift to how to ensure that Ukraine can, as a country, as an economy, survive, indeed thrive whilst it is still at war in its eastern front, and that means much more focus on air defense. It means much more focus on Ukrainian capability. So the fact that they're building up their drone capability I think is really important and it means a different kind of approach to assistance to Ukraine and that's the question for me, whether the West can do that.",

In foreign policy, you always run into difficulty when there is a gap between your ends and your means.And I would say it's increasingly apparent there's a gap between Ukraine's ends. We've got to get every square inch of territory back, economic reparations, war crimes accountability, and what their means are, what their military means are. At some point, they, the United States, the Europeans, are going to have to recon with that gap and decide what they do. Do they change the ends? Do they change the means? We're going to get to that point. Yes, maybe we were premature, but this process has to begin. There has -- and I think it actually has begun privately in Ukraine and at some point it's going to have to begin between the United States and Ukraine because it's going to be unsustainable to maximalize the ends if increasingly people come to the conclusion, however desirable it is, it's not feasible.",

I believe it becomes less difficult to sustain support for Ukraine if we can put some -- they can put something on the table, the Russians balk at it and then it's easier for the president and for others to say, hey, we put something on the table and by the way, you don't have to compromise your long-term goals.

And if we want to reach our climate targets, we should even use much less than what we have today.Even at the peak, the use of oil, gas and coal, the temperature increase will still be in line with 2.4 degrees Celsius, which is significantly higher than what scientists tell us that it should be 1.5 degrees Celsius.

Canadian Security Forces he said are investigating a credible allegation linking agents of the Indian government to the murder of a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil. 45-year-old Hardeep Singh Nijjar was a Sikh activist and head of a Sikh temple in British Columbia who was gunned down by unidentified assailants in the temple's parking lot in June. Perhaps Trudeau thought that by publicly raising these allegations he might shame the Indian government into cooperating with Canada's investigation. In the West, the news that India may have ordered a hit on Canadian soil is shocking. Analysts note gravely that such an act could only hurt India's ambitions on the foreign stage. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has publicly asked India to cooperate in Canada's investigation. Editorials and outlets like \"The Financial Times\" and \"The Economist\" call for consequences should the allegations be proven. But in India, the reaction is very different. And reveals that, in fact, Justin Trudeau blew it. Just look at the Indian press. The story has released a spasm of (INAUDIBLE), in which television anchors cast Canada not as the multicultural haven and stable democracy you or I may know, but as a rogue state bent on protecting terrorists.
