These trucks will provide only a fraction of what's required.For Gazans, the pause in fighting as a brief respite, after weeks of relentless Israeli bombardment. As of Tuesday, more than 12,700 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, based on numbers from the Hamas-controlled ministry of health, which have not been officially updated, because of a breakdown in communications. On Thursday, Israel detained Dr. Mohammad Abu Salmiya, the director of Al-Shifa hospital. The IDF says he was questioned about alleged Hamas activity in the hospital. The IDF released footage of additional tunnels they see that were uncovered below Gaza's largest medical facility. Health officials in Gaza have consistently denied Hamas use the hospital for military purposes.

We can't go home, we cannot go back to our kibbutz, it no longer exists following the massacre of the looting and the burning of our kibbutz by Hamas, and civilian looters on October 7th.

I think the Israeli government has a harder time, deciding what to do, and how to do it, given its parallel goals of returning the hostages, and these civilians that were taken from their homes, as a result of a monumental intelligence and military failure on the side of Israel. They, of course, want that, and they also, our government very much wants to destroy Hamas as a military and governing organization.
