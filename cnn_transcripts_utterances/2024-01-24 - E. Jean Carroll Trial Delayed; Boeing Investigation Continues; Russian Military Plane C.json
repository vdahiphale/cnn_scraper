Of course, Nikki Haley twice elected governor here in the state of South Carolina. But in speaking with Republicans here, they tell me firmly that they believe that this is still Trump country. Still, last night, after coming in second in New Hampshire, Haley said that she was heading back to her sweet state of South Carolina, where voters were not interested in a coronation. And, instead, she says they want an election, and her campaign plans to give it to them. You mentioned those commercials, the Haley campaign up with ads today in South Carolina highlighting her record as governor here, but also a refrain that we have heard frequently from Nikki Haley on the campaign trail that no one really wants a rematch of Joe Biden and Donald Trump.

And they say that there is really not much that can deter them from that. Now, I did speak with some Haley supporters, but, unlike what we may have seen with voters in New Hampshire, so far, I haven't heard anybody say that they are -- quote -- \"never Trump,\" that if Trump is the nominee, they do plan to vote for him. And several of them tell me what gave them that confidence to cast that ballot if, in fact, Nikki Haley is not the nominee, is their South Carolina Senator, Tim Scott, endorsing Donald Trump and the hope that Scott may have some role in a potential Trump Cabinet if he is elected president again.

She finished second in New Hampshire, and it wasn't necessarily as close as perhaps some of the polls were predicting. And that is something that voters did talk to me about this morning, saying that they are afraid that this is just perhaps prolonging the inevitable. I had several Haley fans tell me they were concerned about what staying in the race might mean for her political future if in fact it is a Trump landslide one month from. Now, look, many of them telling me they hope that's not the case. They do still plan to vote for their former governor. But I talked to the chair of the Dorchester County Republican Party this morning, and while he can't tell me who he's voting for because he wants to remain neutral, he did tell me that it does look increasingly like the writing is on the wall, even here in South Carolina, despite her history in this state.",

That's a primary, as you know, as well. It's sort of a two- sided thing. He will win that very, very easily. The question is, what happens to money? That's my question. It looks like AFP and the Koch-backed PAC that has funded Nikki Haley so far stays in. She's got money. She's got a fair amount of cash on hand. They have started the campaign in South Carolina. I think that's where they stay. They may be raising money in other places, but there's a lot of time between now and the end of the time in South Carolina. And that's one of the reasons, John, we saw such an apoplectic Donald Trump last night. He wants this thing done and over. And as long as she's in, she's in. So there's a lot of mischief that can be made, particularly given those numbers you just pointed out at the beginning of the piece.",

How do you expand voters in even a race against somebody as inept as Joe Biden, at least from the Republican standpoint? The fact of the matter is, these races are about addition and multiplication, not subtraction and division. I don't know that Donald Trump can allow himself to be successful in this race without drawing in more independent voters. You and I both know a handful of swing states, very similar to New Hampshire, as a matter of fact, in their behavior are going to decide this race. And without those independents, this is looking like a very close, nail-biting contest. Nikki Haley will continue to say, I think, this is not so close a race. It's a stronger annuity for Republicans if I'm the nominee than he is. But this remains to be one of those races we have seen before, high drama probably right to the end. I don't know how many Republicans can take that heartburn again.",

I'm not sure they're going for those voters yet. I think they feel, in a binary choice between Trump and Biden, they can make that choice and that Trump is more tolerable than an inept Biden. But you make a very good point. Nikki Haley did purposely, I think, poke the bear last night, and, boy, did she poke him. Some of that stuff is not what I would be doing at this point. If you think she's going to be out at some point, why not sort of extend the hand a little bit? It looks like Donald Trump is on his way to this nomination, but it doesn't make sense, even if he gets poked, to poke her back, because he's going to need those voters and he's ultimately going to need Nikki Haley.",

If that's the case, it would obviously have been a very high-profile target for Ukrainian air defenses to try and take out. And, recently, there have been lots of incidents or several incidents where Ukrainian forces have pushed forward close to the board with Russia to try and deny Russian aircraft the kind of freedom in their own airspace that they have enjoyed up until now. So that's been a quite successful strategy. There was a takedown of a Russian plane just a couple of weeks ago which had a big impact inside Russia on their ability to control the battlefield. But, of course, the other version of events is the one that the Russians are talking about, which is in fact this plane was carrying 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war on the way to a prisoner exchange. They were on their way back home and they were taken out by two Ukrainian missiles before they landed in that city of Belgorod, or close to it anyway. Now, if so, that would obviously be a tragic miscalculation on the part of the Ukrainians. But, again, at the moment we don't know which version of events is true.",

The comments from Alaska's CEO are just further confirmation of possible quality control issues at Boeing when it comes to the MAX 9. And the head of the FAA just told me that quality control is where that investigation is now focused. Remember, the FAA grounded the MAX 9 in the U.S. as it figures out exactly how airlines should inspect these plans for problems. FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker told me in this one-on-one interview that the MAX 9 door plug is a good design, but only when it's properly executed. That's the big caveat. The bolts that hold the door plug on the plane are key. There are four of them. And if they are not installed, then the door can essentially shimmy out of its retaining grooves and shoot off with explosive force like we saw back on January 5 on Alaska 1282.
