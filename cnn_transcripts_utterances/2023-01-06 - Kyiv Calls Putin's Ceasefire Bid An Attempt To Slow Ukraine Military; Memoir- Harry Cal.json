And that is to be expected because the Ukrainians gave no indication that they would treat today as any differently. And the Russians made very clear that they wouldn't allow this ceasefire to be an opportunity for the Ukrainians to improve their positioning at all on the front line. And they made clear that they would be returning fire as well. The Ukrainians are so worried that this is some kind of a trap that even the governor of the Luhansk region where much of the fighting is taking place is warning people there not to go to Orthodox church services today, warning that this could be a trap and perhaps some of those churches could even be attacked. I spoke to one woman here attending this service who told me that she read the wording of the Kremlin's statement very quick -- very carefully. And she says that look, they mentioned a ceasefire along the front lines. She didn't say anything about the rest of the country. So she's expecting that perhaps there could be missile strikes today. The former president of Russia, Dmitry Medvedev, said that the Ukrainians had rejected the Christian hand of mercy. One military major that I spoke with said there is nothing Christian about this war, Christine.",

The content is so dramatic, involving revelations and allegations from Harry's birth right up until the present day.He talks about when he found out about his mother's death. About how he and his brother, Prince William, wanted to reopen the investigation into Princess Diana's death as well because they didn't think the conclusions were entirely plausible. Then it discusses how this relationship became more tense when Prince Harry married Meghan Markle, escalating into this physical fight where Prince William allegedly hit Harry, pushing him to the floor, injuring him. And then, we hear more about Prince Harry trying to connect with his mother, as well as salacious details from his early years, including how he lost his virginity, and rather personal details about his body. It's quite shocking to hear from anyone this level of intimate personal divulgence on a global scale, let alone a member of the British royal family whose motto is \"never complain, never explain.\" It runs completely counter to the way that the palace usually conducts itself by not addressing anything. Not saying anything. Certainly not being this personal. And Christine, there's just more to come. The book is released next week but we have these hour-long, and more than that, sit-downs with Harry and broadcasters on the weekend and late-night shows we expect next week, too.

That means the Bills and Bengals will have one less game in the standings, which matters for home field in the playoffs. Seeding will now be based on win percentage.If the Chiefs win this weekend, they are going to be the one seed and get the bye in the AFC. But the NFL Competition Committee has outlined a number of scenarios to help fix potential competitive inequities. The AFC title game is going to be held at a neutral site if the Chiefs and Bills both win this weekend. If they both lose and the Ravens win, or if they both lose and the Bengals win, then the Bengals end up in the AFC title game. So all because they are playing one less game now, the Bengals are already AFC North champions based on that win percentage. But if the Ravens beat the Bengals Sunday and the two teams end up playing in the wild card round, they're actually going to have a coin toss to decide if that game is going to be in Cincinnati or Baltimore.

It follows the Federal Reserve's succession of harsh interest rate hikes to tame soaring inflation.Looking at markets around the world right now, European markets are mixed. Consumer prices in the EU fell sharply in December. That's a sign inflation is easing across the region. On Wall Street, stock index futures at this hour are mixed.

So the Federal Reserve wants to raise interest rates to try to curb the demand for workers and, hopefully, bring down wages, which, in fact, will then ultimately bring down inflation.It's a challenging balancing act, of course, because they don't want to drive the economy into a recession.
