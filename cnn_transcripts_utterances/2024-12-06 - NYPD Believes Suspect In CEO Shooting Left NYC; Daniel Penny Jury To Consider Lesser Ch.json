Do you know this person?

You know, once you start to piece together all these different pieces of the puzzle and you get a good look at this guys face, I mean, how many people could there be that, that, that sort of fit this match, right?

There are other versions of that where that luck doesn't come through, and then its just painstaking detail work and it can be three days, three months, just you know, it can go on.So here is the X factor -- today, the NYPD delivered the evidence from the people you're looking at the screen right now. The NYPD crime scene unit, they took the swabs of DNA from the bottle that they believe he drank out of which would be a really good chance at getting a DNA sample from that from the phone, which he handled, including where a print was left and they delivered those samples to the office of the medical examiner. The medical examiner will extract those, and they will get the DNA down to basically a chart which they can put into CODIS, the national database. If his DNA is in there, that will help put a name and a story to this person if its in there with an identity or if the DNA is in there because it was found at another crime it may not come with a name, but it's going to be a step forward whether -- whether that rings a bell down there. So this could speed up or it could be more of what they've been doing which is keep pushing that picture out, keep developing that video canvas, and keep developing the evidence in this case, until you get that break.",

You know, to disappear into the streets of New York or into Central Park and then jump into the subway could be in any, anywhere in the five boroughs within a matter of minutes.So it's very difficult unless there are officers literally around the corner and they could, you know, and they saw what happened or gave immediate chase. You know, once this guy fled and was able to make it into the park and subsequently to wherever else he went, that that made it very difficult. However, you know because this is New York City, and they are in the midst of retrieving and reviewing tons of video footage. That's how were able, again, to connect these dots, right, to just go and work our way. Even backwards to see where he came from. And that's where they wound up at the hostel and then got this, this photo of him. So, it's -- you know and just a quick point that I know there's a rush to, to want to catch this guy, right and, and I and I totally get that and there's a sense of urgency and there should be. This -- this individual is armed, potentially armed and dangerous. We already know he's dangerous. So but these things don't get settled in 43 minutes without commercials, like on TV. You know, these investigations as John had mentioned are painstaking in trying to piece together all these different pieces of -- pieces of evidence to figure out who were looking for and where they are.

And what -- what it was clear to me then in examining both what the police have told us and in our reporting, is, is both before, during and after. The killer was keenly aware of -- of how he might be surveyed and adapted to it accordingly. It's not only how we got to New York City or the masking -- the silencer, for example, wasn't done because he wanted to hide the murder. He -- it's happening in on the street.It was so that passersby did not recognize that there was a shooting going by. And we've seen that in the videos where -- where bystanders just seem to stand there. In the money shot as, as Commissioner Tisch noticed, a number of senior law enforcement agents told \"The New York Times\" that even in that instance, it looks like he's camera savvy in the sense that the way that he is even sort of hiding his face, that they cannot seem to get a match.

He said he didn't want to lose his job at Fox News if this all came to light, and that's why he paid it off. I'm not sure I would take that and then say, well, therefore he's vulnerable to blackmail.But look, I will say that the fact that they are threatening defamation claims against the accuser in my opinion, is not well- taken. Lawyers love to threaten defamation suits. They are not as enamored of actually filing them. And that's because the number one defense to a defamation claim is truth. And so regardless, you are going to have these allegations litigated in a courtroom as to what happened in that hotel in California, I cant imagine that something that Hegseth or his supporters would want to see happen. So I do think this defamation threat at the end of the day is an empty one.",
