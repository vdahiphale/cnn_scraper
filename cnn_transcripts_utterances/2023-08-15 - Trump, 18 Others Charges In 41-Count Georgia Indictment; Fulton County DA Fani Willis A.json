This is for him being on that phone call and participating in it with the Secretary of State of Georgia, Brad Raffensperger.When Trump asked him to find all these votes, he did not answer questions. We know from one of the original jurors on this grand jury that he took the Fifth over and over again when he was asked questions before them. But he's not indicted federally in Jack Smith's cases, but he is in this. What does that tell you?",

So I suppose it raises the possibility that is Mark Meadows. But if Mark Meadows is cooperating in the federal case, but not cooperating in the state case, that creates a host of problems for both sets of prosecutors. He can't take the stand in a federal case and admit things that will then be held against him in a state case. So he's either going to be lying-in one or lying in the other. So they've got to figure out what's going on here in order to get their two indictments aligned so that Mark Meadows doesn't actually hurt them in both.",

Remember, the first Republican primary debate is next Wednesday.Joining us now, Republican Strategist and former RNC Communications Director Doug Heye. CNN Political Analyst, White House Correspondent for PBS NewsHour, Laura Barron-Lopez and former adviser to President Clinton, Paul Begala. Well, good morning, guys. Next week is going to be a big week, Doug. There's a Republican debate that Trump may or may not participate in, and then he and 18 other folks indicted in Georgia have to turn themselves in on these charges. But Trump is running on this.

One, every time that Donald Trump has been invited and -- indicted and I'll say this is a bizarre statement, it bolsters Donald Trump because it reinforces his core argument.Typically, in politics, when you're indicted, you get in any legal trouble, your campaign is over. For Donald Trump, it reinforces his core message that the system is rigged, that it's -- rigged against you, it's rigged against me, it's rigged against everybody. And bizarrely, this shores up his message. Two, when he's been indicted each time, most of his opponents have not only not gone after Donald Trump, which in any other campaign you would do, they back up Donald Trump. They say this is a two-tiered system of justice. So when your own opponents, the people running against you, fail to criticize you, that bolsters you as well. The debate, therefore, is going to be interesting, because this case is different. And we'll see if it makes Republican candidates who are running against Donald Trump run against him -- move from running against him in theory to in practice, and use this to do what they would do against any other opponent in any other race, and that's criticize him.",

Keep in mind, over the course of four months, Trump has been indicted four different times in four different places.But our mutual pal Peter Baker, the New York Times, has a great piece this morning where he really kind of captures it and says, quote, \"The nation once recoiled of presidential candidates caught driving under the influence or swiping lines in a speech without credit. Now one of the two major parties has not ruled out a front-runner charged with conspiring to subvert democracy, endangering national security, obstructing justice and falsifying records of hush money to a pornographic film star\". Is it because it's just so much that everybody has tuned out and/or is numb, or is it which I think Doug's point is very smart on this, that this just kind of dovetails perfectly into what has been Trump's message from the beginning and has served as teflon to some point? LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: I think when we're looking at the primary, Doug's point totally stands, which is that the GOP base is behind the former president. I would argue a majority of the Republican establishment is behind the former president, or at least will not say anything and confront him directly. They will do it privately to us many times, but not publicly and directly to make a break from the former president. But when we look at the general election, I think it is having an impact because I was just talking to a Republican -- registered Republican voter in Arizona, a swing state, another state that is actually looking into a fake elector scheme carried out by Trump in 2020. And that Republican voter had voted Republican their entire life, told me -- they voted for Joe Biden in 2020. One of those independent leaning, you know, moderate Republicans who broke for Biden in that swing state last go around. And I checked in to see if they had soured on President Biden and were leaning back the Republican way, given the cast of these candidates that this voter has to choose from, and they said no. And it was because of what Doug is saying, which is that none of the other Republicans that potentially have a shot of taking out the former president are actually confronting him on the democracy issue and on all of the indictments.
