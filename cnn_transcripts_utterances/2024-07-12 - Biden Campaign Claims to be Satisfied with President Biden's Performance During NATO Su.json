Here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  And I think I'm the most qualified person to run for president. I beat him once, and I will beat him again.

Well, it is still a private conversation, but one thing that's clear, many Democrats on Capitol Hill and really across the party sort of looking to some party elders and leaders for guidance, or a way out of this crisis that's been really consuming the party for more than two weeks now. So naturally, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and former President Barack Obama come to mind as many Democrats are looking for sort of a way out, if you will.And we are learning that they've had a conversation this week trying to allay those concerns from some Democrats, not necessarily tipping their hands on the scale just yet. But we do know that Speaker Pelosi, of course, said earlier this week that the president still has time to make a decision. Of course, he said again last night, his decision is clear. So we do believe there will be more conversations with Pelosi and President Biden, perhaps as early as sometimes this afternoon or over the weekend. And this could give us more of a sense of their conversations. But their private conversations, all their aides say they remain private. They do not read those out. But what we do know is that they both have expressed concern to a variety of Democrats about President Biden's ability to win in November. So this is the moment of the party where time is running out. There is no doubt the Democrats are expecting more defections, as Kayla was just reporting. But again, will these party elders, as well as Senator Schumer, perhaps Jim Clyburn and others, have a conversation with President Biden, or that's fraught as well. This is his decision to make, of course. But there are still these conversations going on behind the scenes, Kate.",

Essentially he was asked, should the conversation about the president getting out of this race, should that conversation continue? Jim Clyburn says no, it shouldn't. And it's up to -- saying he's earned the right, and I am going to give him that respect. If he decides to change his mind later on, we will respond to that. We have until the 19th of August to open our convention.Jim Clyburn basically says the conversation should be over, whereas other people continue to say the dam could still be breaking.

That's for the European Union, for the United States, for different member allies, but the fact that we saw clearly state what we do, because we know that China is propping up the Russian war economy, delivering the equipment they need to build the weapons that in itself is a very strong warning to China.",

It is not two percent, that is a crime of ceiling we should strive towards, which was the language 10 years ago. Now, we have a good at two percent is the minimum and more and more allies exceeds the two percent quite significantly.  Several allies are now spending a larger proportion of their GDP on defense than the United States -- Poland, the Baltic countries, and others and therefore, we welcome the increase beyond two percent.

Europe is 25 percent of the world economy, but togetherwith NATO allies, we are 50 percent, twice as much of the world economy and 50 percent of the military might. So it is good for NATO -- for the United States to have a strong NATO. Second, there is strong bipartisan support for NATO in the US Congress, in the US public. We have just seen new opinion polls confirming that. And thirdly, the main criticism from former President Trump has been about -- has actually not been against NATO. It has been against NATO allies not spending enough on NATO, and that has changed. The criticism has been valid and European allies have reacted by significantly investing more in defense.
