This has changed how a lot of Republicans view whether or not the United States should have a more robust presence in the world whether it should pull back from its support of foreign wars.This debate between the so called National Security hawks and the isolations wings of the Republican Party had played out for months and months and months and really stymied action on all of this. Now, one person who has been in the forefront on pushing this aid has been Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, he of course shepherded through a $95 billion aid package along with Democratic leaders, a couple of months ago, two months ago. In fact, that plan included aid to Ukraine, Taiwan and to Israel, then it essentially went nowhere in the Republican led house for more than two months, until speaker Mike Johnson decided to make a move and try to move on a similar plan what some modifications with some changes and send that back to the Senate on Saturday, ultimately leading to senators final action on early this week. Now, McConnell as he was discussing all of this, pin the blame on the former Fox News hosts, Tucker Carlson for stoking that anti-Ukraine sentiment within the GOP.",

So most of the $60 billion or so is allocated to rebuilding depleted U.S. weapons stockpiles. But what is notable is that Ukrainian officials have been asking the U.S. both in private and in public for the attack of long range missiles to target deeper behind Russian lines. American officials have resisted citing both supplies and further provoking Moscow as excuses. But the House made it a requirement to include those long range missiles in this package, also on its way to Ukraine, what's known as specialized precision aerial ordinance.

Now, TikTok is the very popular social media platform. It's based in Los Angeles and Singapore. It is a unit of Bytedance, the privately- owned tech, John, that's based in Beijing. And that is what's been fueling all the bipartisan fears and concerns over in the United States that Beijing could use it to spy or shape public opinion. TikTok and its CEO, they've denied that saying it's an entertainment app and it doesn't allow the Chinese government or any government to influence its recommendation model. But the question is this, what's next? And can TikTok sold to someone else? Well, the Chinese government is on the record opposing a sale. Beijing does not want Bytedance to give up the algorithm. In fact the Chinese government may allow TikTok to be sold without the algorithm, but that's unlikely because it would strip TikTok of its secret sauce, of its core technology and the secret of its success. And analysts have been saying that the ramifications of this are just profound and that the world could be further split into two tech spheres -- one aligned with the United States and the other aligned with China. This is what we heard from Alex Capri. He's a research fellow at the Heinrich Foundation. He's also a lecturer at the National University of Singapore. Let's bring it up for you. He told CNN this, quote, \"A ban is a loss of soft power for Beijing. What little it has in the West. But a ban in the U.S. will spark renewed efforts to spread China's digital footprint in Southeast Asia and other mostly developing markets worldwide,\" unquote. Now, we are awaiting any comment from Bytedance, any fresh comment from Beijing. TikTok has said it plans to challenge this legislation in court. Back to you.",

And that's going to be a real hindrance from them getting to that level of growth. Especially here in the U.S. consumers are looking at hybrids. In my opinion, if I were Elon Musk, I'd do something totally wild. I'd create a hybrid plug-in car that he could use on his infrastructure. That would blow the minds of the domestic car manufacturers. They would never see it coming. And the fact is it could probably come in at $25,000 with it. It would probably just destroy some of these car industries. But I don't think he's going to go that route. It would be an interesting angle.

When you look at what Volkswagen's coming up with and all the German manufacturers as well, Hyundai and Kia, really great products that consumers like and they like the dealer network? So if there's a problem, they can get it fixed. And that's going to really hurt him because there are no Tesla repair stores unless they take the vehicle away.
