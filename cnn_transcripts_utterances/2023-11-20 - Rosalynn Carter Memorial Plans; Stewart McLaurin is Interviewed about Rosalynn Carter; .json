Funeral and memorial services will take place next week after she died at the Carters' home in Plains, Georgia, yesterday, surrounded by family. She was 96 years old.Rosalynn Carter was a champion for mental health causes and a beloved partner and adviser to her husband, former President Jimmy Carter. They celebrated their 77th wedding anniversary in July. CNN's Rafael Romo joins us now from outside the Carter Center in Atlanta this morning. Rafael, obviously she made such an impact over the course of her life. Tributes are pouring in. What are you seeing there at the Carter Center?",

      "sentences": "Hi, Omar. Well, we were here at the Carter Center less than three days ago, on Friday evening, when they had announced originally that the former first lady had been put in hospice care at her home in Plains, Georgia. And Sunday afternoon the Carter Center confirmed that Rosalynn Carter had died at the age of 96. They said that she died peacefully at home surrounded by her family.Almost immediately there was a statement released by the 39th president of the United States, Jimmy Carter, talking about his wife. He said that, \"Rosalynn was my equal partner in everything I ever accomplished. She gave me wise guidance and encouragement when I needed it. As long as Rosalynn was in the world, I always knew somebody loved and supported me.\" And, Omar, as you would expect, there has been condolences and tributes from different parts of the country and the world. Some of the first to react to the passing of Rosalynn Carter were former presidents and first ladies. For example, I can tell you about former President Bill Clinton, who gave the Presidential Medal of Freedom to both Carters in 1999, he said the following about Rosalynn Carter. He said, \"Rosalynn will be forever remembered as the embodiment of a life lived with a purpose.\" And just a few moments ago, Omar, I had an opportunity to talk to the CEO of the President Carter Library here, and this is what she had to say about the emotions expressed by the former president. Let's take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And it's a shame that in their lives they can't hear these wonderful things that are being said about them, but last evening I was looking back at some of her media interviews and the reports on her from when she was first lady and the soft voice, the poignancy with which she spoke, but the strength that you knew that she had, referred to as the steel magnolia, no doubt that she was his closest and most trusted adviser in the presidency and in the years since. And I can only imagine the loss that he and the family are feeling this morning and the loss for our nation.We have wonderful first ladies that support each of our presidents. We often speculate would they be president without having that woman with them as first lady, as their first supporter. And I think in this case that's a really good question because she was a strength and an inspiration to him certainly before, absolutely during, and certainly after the presidency.",

Senator Bernie Sanders coming out now to say Benjamin Netanyahu and his government must understand, quote, \"not a penny will be coming to Israel from the U.S. unless there is a fundamental change in their military and political positions.\"The U.S. sends billions of dollars, you know, to Israel every year, and Congress is currently struggling over sending an additional $14 billion requested by President Biden. And here is what Sanders wants in terms of conditions before more money is sent. A pause in military operations and an end to what he calls indiscriminate bombing in Gaza. He's also called for protecting the rights of Gazans to return home and also that Israel commit to no long-term Israeli reoccupation of Gaza. One Democrat that that is not sitting well with, New Jersey Democrat Congressman Josh Gottheimer, who said that those conditions and conditions like that \"would help Hamas in their goal of completely annihilating Israel and the Jewish people. It would weaken America's national security and our fight against terror.\" It comes as a new poll shows that while a majority of voters, all voters, 55 percent, say they support U.S. aid to Israel. Almost half of Democrats in a new poll by NBC News says that they are opposed to it. Joining me right now Democratic Congressman Josh Gottheimer for more on this. Thanks for coming in. REP. JOSH GOTTHEIMER (D-NJ): Thanks, Kate.",

We know that they are using Palestinians -- innocent Palestinians as shields when I believe we must continue to do everything we can to get humanitarian aid in there, which Hamas is blocking. Why would we do anything to support a terrorist organization that's Iranian backed.We see the Houthis literally capturing - which is Iranian backed - capturing a ship, holding people hostage, right, and firing rockets, as others are in Iraq and Syria are doing, at Americans, right, and Israelis, right? So, they're all attacking us. They're Iranian backed. They're - and so - so China, Russia, Hamas, they're all working - Iran, all working together against America and against our key ally, the democracy in the region.

This new NBC News poll shows that there is some trouble among Democratic voters for President Biden when it comes to this. According to this poll, among Democrats, 51 percent think Israel has gone too far in its military action, 27 percent Israel's actions are justified, 49 percent are opposed to the U.S. sending any -- sending more aid to Israel.Those -- when you see polling like that, how much does that worry you?",

I thought the most interesting finding in the poll, which actually everyone should look at, is that 77 percent of democratic primary voters support the president in that poll. That's the -- his highest number yet since he's in office. And if you look at the poll as well about favorability, Hamas is at 1 percent, the lowest, and Israel, when you ask favorability in a set of choices, is at the highest. So, I actually think those are the key numbers in that poll.",

If you look at that poll, what's clear is that President Biden is actually quite strong and will - and that they will continue to stand behind the president, Democratic primary voters. That's the key number I believe in that poll.Listen, nobody wants to see this conflict happening, right, and nobody wants them -- but the bottom line is I saw footage last week from GoPros and from Hamas's GoPros and from their phone footage that was screened, as you know, in private for many members of Congress. What happened, the atrocities that happened that day on October 7th, the lengths and depths they went to, including raping women, young women and girls before they killed them, and - and we saw imagery that I'll never be able to unsee, including, you know, take -- decapitating people and burning people. Like the stuff that you saw, the lengths that Hamas, a terrorist organization, went to, you have to kill and crush them or they will keep coming back, as they admit to, right? Hamas's leadership admits there will be a second, third and fourth October 7th. So, they will keep coming. You have to stop them now. Listen, and they are the ones -- Hamas is the ones putting Palestinian -- innocent Palestinians in harm's way. They're the ones doing it. And our goals are very clear, we have to the hostages out. We've got to get them home, especially Americans, got to get them home. We've got to make sure we get humanitarian aid into the region, which I strongly support, and we've got to get an aid package passed to do that. And we've got to get that done. And, of course, we've got to kill and crush the terrorists. BOLDUAN: Yes, and getting that aid, I mean, that's going to - that's where the work lies ahead for Congress because right now it's not going anywhere really fast.",
