The Israeli cabinet is scheduled to meet at this hour, one day after the Israeli military says it recovered the bodies of six hostages from an underground tunnel in the Rafah area. The IDF has now identified all six, saying their families have been notified. They are Ori Danino, Carmel Gat, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Eden Yerushalmi, Almog Sarusi, and Alex Lobanov. Israel's defense minister says the six were killed just before troops could reach them. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) READ ADMIRAL DANIEL HAGARI, IDF SPOKESPERSON (through translator): According to the initial assessment at our disposal, they were brutally murdered by Hamas terrorists a short while before we reached them. They were abducted alive on the morning of October 7th by the Hamas terror organization. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We're hearing it from opposition leaders Yair Lapid, Yair Golan, and others saying that it's time for people to come out on the streets and demonstrate.So, there's a real sense of the hurt here that this was avoidable, that the prime minister could have saved these hostages by doing a deal with Hamas. However, unsavory that deal might have been to get a ceasefire and get them released. And you get that and you hear that and you understand that when the prime minister's defense minister himself, who had disagreements with him on Thursday last week over a vote about how Israel should -- or what Israel should do with its troops along the border with Egypt, the so-called Philadelphi Corridor, calling for the cabinet now to go back and make a different decision on that so they can get a deal to bring the other hostages home. You understand that there is division across the political spectrum in the country, but there is division right here within the government, within the cabinet. It's not clear if there were a vote, if that would change it. Benny Gantz another leading politician here, one of the principal opposition politicians who was in the war cabinet until he pulled out a few months ago, has called on the prime minister, and again, this gives you the sense of the division and the anger and the politics that is happening now in the wake of this terrible, terrible news, that he is calling on the prime minister saying, look, when the hostage was released, the Bedouin hostage was released just last week, freed by the IDF, you called him, you went to visit Noa Argamani, who was another hostage who was freed. But why don't you now, he says, call these families? [04:05:00] Call the families of these six hostages who were murdered in cold blood. Brutally murdered, according to the defense minister. Why don't you call them and just listen to what they have to say? So, this is a moment of absolute pain, of the horrific feeling that this could have been prevented. And perhaps a moment, certainly exacerbating political divisions, but perhaps a moment of reckoning for the prime minister, although he is able to survive all things politically. But I think, look, just strip away the politics, strip away what the what people are feeling. This is six families now. There will be six funerals in this country. But -- and the six families grieving, but this grieving is going to rip right into this country. You cannot underestimate how painful this will be. These were six young people. These were six people who survived already the horrific conditions in the tunnels. These were six young people, or five of them at least, who were at the Nova Music Festival. And Carmel Gat was just in a kibbutz nearby visiting her family. And I should just read you a little here of what a letter her cousin wrote, because I think this just captures the spirit and the mood at the moment. It says, sorry, Carmel. Sorry we didn't stop when it was possible. Sorry. Sorry. We let them kill you. I wish you saw and heard us. I wish that even through -- even though you saw us with your eyes, the terrible murder of your mother, you discovered that your father and your brothers and sister-in-law and your niece survived. I wish you saw your friends fought to bring you back alive. I wish you hadn't heard the prime minister say that the Philadelphi Corridor is more important than your life and the lives of the other hostages. I can only imagine with how much rage that must have filled you. That was a message from her cousin. She was 40 years old. She was an occupational therapist. I think that just gives you a sense of the utter pain, the devastation and the division and the anger at the political decisions that have been taken here.",

It's the first day of school in Israel, and that means that first-graders are going for the first time. And you saw parents taking their kids to school literally crying.

The defense minister put out a written statement. The prime minister did a taped statement, not facing journalists or people. The prime minister canceled his scheduled visit on the first day of school to go to a first-grade class. It just goes to show that this is throwing everybody off. All of us are feeling horrible. And the cabinet, most definitely, made statements that are very challenging. And I think in that sense that what we're looking at is Israelis right now, will the security cabinet that made the decision last week that they're going to stay on Philadelphi Corridor, will they change that decision?

I mean, the situation is obviously already horrendous enough that it should have spurred the Biden administration to do more to exercise its leverage with Prime Minister Netanyahu to end this terrible war. This is really American who's now been killed, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, we know that over at least -- I want to say at least 40,000 Palestinians have been killed since October 7th and 94,000 wounded, and that's a minimum. And so, as terrible as it is that now we know that an American citizen has been killed, I don't know that in itself is enough to spur some kind of a change that it -- by the Biden administration if the numbers that we've just talked about have not been enough already. That said, though, there are a hundred more hostages left in Israel. There are children in Gaza who need polio vaccinations. There are dozens and dozens of reasons that we could list right now to accelerate the pressure on both sides. I mean, there are certainly plenty of blame to go around here on Hamas and on the Netanyahu government to get these ceasefire negotiations done and to end this horrific war that is resulting in so much senseless death and murder and killing. But the time is now, Kim, if there hasn't been a willingness on the American side to exert enough pressure on the Israeli government to sign the deal and for Prime Minister Netanyahu to sign the deal, and as you mentioned earlier, the hostage families, members of his own cabinet, have been blaming Prime Minister Netanyahu for not doing enough to get this deal signed.
