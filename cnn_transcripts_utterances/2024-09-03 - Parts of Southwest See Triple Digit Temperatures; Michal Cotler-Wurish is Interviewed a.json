And the heat that's going to build across the southwest will be dangerous heat.So, let's talk about Los Angeles first, because they could reach their first 100-degree day since September of 2022. There are going to be cooling centers open this week. And this is just oppressive heat. In fact, excessive heat warnings starting Wednesday for Los Angeles and, of course, the Coachella Valley, some of the hotter areas of southern California. The central valley of California under advisories. We have many locations, including Las Vegas and Phoenix, also within these heat warnings as we speak because this will be excessive. And we're talking about 15 to 20 degrees above average for Los Angeles as we approach the end of the work week. So, this heat risk map from NOAA shows a lot of purple and red in here. That is indicating the locations where we anticipate this extreme heat that could impact the more vulnerable communities out there. The eastern half of the country, a completely different scenario unfolding for the first week of September. Below average, very fall- like temperatures for many locations. We'll take it while we can because we know that summer isn't quite done just yet. Cooler air for the time being, but things will change as we start to get into next week as well. Pamela.",

How important is it for Biden and Netanyahu to get on the same page right now? MICHAL COTLER-WURISH, ISRAEL'S SPECIAL ENVOY FOR COMBATTING ANTISEMITISM: I think it's actually critically important for both of our democracies, in fact, for civilization as we know it. I want to remind us that on 10/7, just like on 9/11, the attack of barbarism on civilization raped and pillaged and burned alive and murdered and abducted hundreds of Israelis. Twelve hundred were murdered on that day in all kinds of terrible ways. And hundreds, 251 actually, were taken hostage on 10/7. We are now 11 months on in what is a continued multi-front war on our shared civilization, and we have to be very clear that what happened yesterday with the execution of six Israelis that have been held hostage for 11 months is bad news for democracies everywhere if we do not understand that just like with ISIS, we did not ask to be made concessions. We asked there to be consequences for the genocidal terror that intends to commit, in our case 10/7 again and again, but in civilizations case is openly intent to build on the rubble of our civilization an alternate reality in which none of us want to live. So, yes, its critically important that the greatest leader of the free world, President Biden, and the president of the state of Israel, just the front lines of this attack on our shared civilization are on the same page.",

Abortion is an issue that motivates some Democrats, it motivates the base, but it's not, you know, a mass issue. There are many people who find it - who are not motivated by it and, in fact, don't like it. And what you did see in North Carolina, Kamala Harris was in North Carolina recently.

So, this Florida play here is still not there for Democrats.Donald Trump needs to be consistent and needs to point where he wants to be. He's always been against the six-week measure in Florida. He was against it in the primary and hit DeSantis on it over and over again. Where are you? And this is a huge issue for Republicans.
