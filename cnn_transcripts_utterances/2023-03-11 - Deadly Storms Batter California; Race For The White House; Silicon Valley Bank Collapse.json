The downfall of Silicon Valley Bank was swift.Just two days earlier, the bank tried to raise over $2 billion in capital after suffering a loss in asset sales. Shares of its parent company, SVB Financial Group, fell 60 percent on Thursday and sparked a sell-off in banking stocks worldwide. It was then halted on Friday after following another 60 percent in pre market trade. SVB may not be a household name but it is a bank that was heavily relied on by the tech and venture capital sector. As the funding dries up, these high-risk companies have been burning through cash and drawing down deposits. That put the squeeze on SVB's balance sheet. And its plight has really spooked the entire financial sector. Also on Friday, the U.S. data is stronger than expected, 311,000 jobs in February. But the devil is in the details.

We have seen efforts in the past by members of the international community, namely Iraq and Oman, to reconcile the two parties but this is the first time we have seen this level of success when it comes to reconciliation. This is going to be on a variety of fronts, not only the reopening of their embassies but they both agree to take steps to reactivate a security cooperation agreement signed in 2001, with a framework for cooperation on areas such as counterterrorism, drug smuggling and money laundering. They will also be working to cooperate when it comes to trade and technology. This is a significant shift for two countries that have been at odds for the last seven years. The ramifications of this rift have been huge, to say the least, across the region. We have seen mounting tensions in the Gulf. We have seen oil facilities in Saudi Arabia and even the UAE coming under attack by groups and actors backed by Iran. And when it comes to Yemen, we have seen a deepening of those conflicts. This comes amid efforts to try to prolong peace, which seems to be holding in Yemen at the moment. So this is a significant shift. We have heard from officials, Iran's foreign minister saying this is not only a big step for the region but he hopes this will mark the beginning of the regime's efforts to strengthen diplomatic relations with its other Middle Eastern neighbors. Take a listen to what a member of Iran's national security council also had to say on this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REAR ADM. ALI SHAMKHAN, IRANIAN SECRETARY OF THE SUPREME NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL (through translator): At the end of the talks, we reached a conclusion to start a new chapter after seven years of breaking off relations between Islamic Republic of Iran and Saudi Arabia while considering the matters of the two countries and the security and the future of the region to prevent meddling from extraregional and Western states and consistent meddling of the Zionist regime in the region.

Iran finding itself increasingly isolated as a result of human rights abuses in Iran against protesters. We have seen antiregime protesters being detained and killed en masse since the death of Mahsa Amini in September. And then its nuclear activity, we have seen the international responseon that front. Iran failing to commit to its international commitment when it comes to the Iran nuclear deal. Those efforts to revive the 2015 deal have essentially stalled. Then we are seeing a shift internationally when it comes to China's involvement in the region. China now appearing to seek to expand its diplomatic and economic ties to the Middle East in a sphere that's long been under the influence of the U.S. government. So this is a significant shift. U.S. White House spokesperson John Kirby said the U.S. welcomes all efforts to bring peace and stability in the region. And also saying U.S. government was kept abreast of all updates over the course of the five days of talks by the Saudi government.",

On Wednesday night, over 90 missiles and 8 tracking drones were detected.Of those, more than 30 missiles and 4 Shaheds were intercepted, says the Ukrainian military. Here in the front line town of Kupyansk, you can see what more than a year of heavy artillery and mortar fire have done. It was again the case on Wednesday night. There's not much air defense can do about that. On the whole, what the Ukrainian military says is that with western help, its air defense systems have actually been remarkably efficient and from the very start of the invasion.
