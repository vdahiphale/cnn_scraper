The former president scoring an overwhelming victory in the republican primary in New Hampshire tonight, defeating his last major Republican opponent, former South Carolina governor, Nikki Haley.Let's take a look at the vote now. We have 60% of the estimated vote is in. Donald Trump still maintaining his healthy lead with 54.4% of the vote, 107,873 votes. He is about 21,500 votes ahead of Nikki Haley, who is in second place with 43.5% of the vote. Trump addressed supporters after his victory was declared, and he slammed Governor Haley, insisting she has no chance of winning the nomination. He also turned his fire on the man he's expecting to face off against in November, President Joe Biden. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

As we had mentioned, he was expected to be in court tomorrow in New York, but court was canceled.Now, I do want to talk about that speech a little bit because it was so different from what we had seen from Donald Trump in Iowa when he called for uniting the Republican Party, uniting the country, saying that all his opponents should get out of the way so that he could do that for America. This was just angry and just aimed at Nikki Haley. It was clear he had watched her speech, and he spent most of the time attacking her. At one point, he even brought up Vivek Ramaswamy to attack her, then he said to South Carolina senator, Tim Scott, you must really hate her if you endorsed me in kind of an awkward moment. If anyone knows Senator Tim Scott, that is not his brand of politics. He quickly went to the mic and said, no, I just love you. This is him aiming at Nikki Haley. He is angry that she did not drop out of the race even though he led by double digits. And the thing to point out here is his team was managing his expectations. They had seen those polls two weeks ago that showed a single digit lead. And there was some concern there. They actually poured millions of dollars into the state to make sure that he won by a hefty margin, and they were very pleased to see the margin that he won by, in fact, but you wouldn't have been able to tell by Donald Trump's speech. But there was one part of that speech, I think, we kind of glossed over in some of our coverage, and it was when Donald Trump recognized how important his messaging on immigration was. That was a key part of their strategy here in New Hampshire. They believe that is the number one issue for Republicans in the state of New Hampshire and a very important issue across the country. That's why he continues to hammer at home. If you remember the ads that they ran, they spent millions of dollars, both the Super PAC and campaign on ads, hitting Nikki Haley over and over again on immigration. [23:05:02] And Trump essentially acknowledged at one point, I guess that messaging on immigration really works, and that's something that we should all expect to see him not just when he runs the remainder of the primary but if he is a nominee in a general election as well. They believe that is a key talking point.",

Now, of course, they're still watching to see what the final margin is here in New Hampshire, but it's South Carolina and beyond, at least, from the official standpoint of the campaign. I was talking to some folks who are already talking about Super Tuesday statesBut also, this evening, you had some top campaign officials who were gathered in this building just behind me after Nikki Haley gave that speech this evening. They're talking to younger campaign officials, some volunteers, and really working to boost confidence, to raise spirits. Betsy Ankeny, who's the campaign manager, she put out that memo earlier today saying we're not going anywhere, that Nikki Haley, you know, isn't backing down. And I'm told that in her casual conversations with lower level staffers and supporters in that room tonight, she echoed that same message. So, that's what they're saying publicly. That's what they're telling their team internally. Obviously, there will be conversations among the top tier of campaign officials as they look at those margins and what it actually ends up being here in New Hampshire. One campaign official is telling me that they really do hope that they get within single digits of former President Trump. Right now, they're teetering on the edge. You know, it's like 11 points or maybe nine points, and that'll be quite a differentiating factor for them. The other conversations that are happening in the year have to do with what the next few events, what the next few weeks look like. We know Nikki Haley has that event in Charleston tomorrow night, but there's also a \"Women for Haley\" event happening in Texas later this week. There are also fundraisers that are on the calendar. So, they're talking about those events. As of now, they're not going anywhere. They're doubling down on Haley's leadership, saying that they're, you know, in this for the long haul. And so, what will be interesting to see is if their tone shifts at all overnight once we see what the actual margin is here, if she was able to come, you know, within a close distance of former President Trump.",

Number one, remember a lot of the small ones -- Nikki Haley, if you look at it at the checkerboard, she's filling in, winning some of these smaller rural counties more than -- more than you would have thought at the beginning of the night or certainly more if you look back at a 2016 Trump map of the state.",

That's better.John Kasich won all four of those towns, right? I'm calling them counties, they're towns in New Hampshire. John Kasich won all four of those, conceivable that Nikki Haley wins all four of those. There's not a ton of votes there, but it's a way to get back. So, that's one way to look at it. Where are the possibilities? I'm going through the possibilities here. Again, Donald Trump is going to fill in. You see a lot of red in there. So, he's going to get his share, too. Where else is it possible? Well, this is one of the places that was on, when we went through the list earlier, Exeter. We have no votes in from Exeter yet. This is a place the Haley campaign expected to perform well in 260 towns in New Hampshire. This is in the top 20, number 19 in terms of population. So, it's not a huge pool of votes, but there are some possible votes there, and if you stay in that neighborhood, again, the map shrinks down pretty small, so I'm going to bring it up and stretch it out again, if you stay in that neighborhood, that's where you do see some other possibilities.

Twenty-five percent say no.Independence, though, it's a different story. Fifty-nine percent, 6 in 10, say no, Donald Trump is not fit for the presidency if he's convicted of a crime. Only 38% say yes. Same kind of results when we asked, is Joe Biden the legitimate winner of the 2020 election which, of course, he was the legitimate winner. Among Republicans, two-thirds of them, 67% in the primary tonight, said no, 32% say yes. For independents, it is the reverse. Among independents, 60% rightfully acknowledged that Joe Biden won in 2020, 37% of independents say no.

That's a place where you might be able to pick up some votes.

Let's start with a case that just wrapped up.This was a civil fraud case here in New York where a judge found that Trump engaged in fraud, lying to banks and insurance companies to try to get better terms on his taxes and his loans, and there was a weeks- long trial to talk about possible penalties. Trump testified in that trial and a few other charges. We're waiting for the judge's decision there. But, Jake, he is facing potentially hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties. In addition, to his ability to do business in the state of New York, also on the line. And next up, over the past few days, Trump has been in court here in New York, at least last week, facing a defamation lawsuit from E. Jean Carroll. Now, last spring, a jury found that he sexually abused E. Jean Carroll and defamed her, awarded her $5 million. Now, this case is back in court for a different statement that he made denying those allegations. Now, court has not been in session so far this week because of an ill juror, but it's unclear if court is going to be back in session. Trump is expected to testify in that case. Now next up, in a little over a month, in March, he could face his first criminal trial. Now, this is the Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's hush money case. It's a little surprising this is the first one to go, Jake, because this is not considered to be the strongest case, and it was expected that the first criminal case he would face would be the federal election subversion case brought by the special counsel, Jack Smith. Well, right now, there are pending appeals. So, Trump is arguing that he has immunity in that case, and the case is on hold until that is resolved. Now, the Mar-a-Lago documents case, the accusations of mishandling classified information, that is currently scheduled for May. Unclear if that's actually going to go on time. And then there's also the Georgia state level election subversion case, long considered by Trump's legal team to be one of the most significant threats because that case, if there's a conviction, would be outside any possible presidential pardon power. But right now, the prosecutors are facing some accusations that could result in disqualification. Jake, that would not make that case go away, but it could change hands and delay it further.",

And also, the biggest event on his calendar right now coming up is the February 8th arguments before the Supreme Court on whether he can appear on the ballots. We've seen a split across the states.

Voters are going to have to confront the conduct in short order once this becomes not just a conversation among Republicans but among the rest of the country.",

The fact that the leading Republican presidential candidate had been found liable for sexual abuse and had not been paying attention to it, it really shows you how Republicans have steered clear of this. The question will be, to some extent, to what extent will the Biden team begin to talk about any of this? The White House has really tried to stay away from this because they don't want to look like any -- appear that they're trying to paint the proceedings or that they were involved in this, want to make clear the special counsel is separate from the DOJ.But there are so many elements that would traditionally come out in a campaign. What's been remarkable is that both sides, both Trump's rival on the Republican side and his Democratic rival, aren't even talking about some very serious criminal charges facing the candidate here, which probably is reflective in why voters are split on this issue.",

But in reality, can you imagine by the very next time we see January 6th on the calendar, it will be the vice president who will now be the new Mike Pence with a choice of whether to certify an election and people who don't believe it's a free and fair election possibly in the past? And you think about the context. There is a trial that will happen, they hope to have happened before that date, but if it doesn't, then that would be unresolved by the time January 6th turns around if, in fact, Trump is the nominee ultimately, and as to whether or not somebody who engages in behavior he is alleged to have engaged in should or should not be on the ballot.

But I did think it was just like an important reminder. You know, the war and the handling of the war, the president's continued support for Israel, this has been a very tough political issue for him. And advisors have said, they have acknowledged that it has been a distraction, it has been something that has taken away from his ability to travel and focus at times on the domestic issues that he wants to focus on. This was another reminder of that that we saw today and clearly is going to continue being an issue, that the campaign has to continue balancing and has to continue figuring out, sort of how to deal with those things as there are important domestic issues that he does want to focus on.

And so, I think they've got to put that front and center a little bit more so that people can see and get a sense of how his policy and the way he's approaching this is infused with concern for human rights and what's happening in Gaza. The other thing I would say, though is, you know, if you look at polling on the issue and you dig in, there's absolutely a vocal, particularly cohort of young people who are upset. But across the country, broadly speaking, Americans are actually quite supportive of the way that Joe Biden is handling this. They're supportive of his support for Israel. Again, I'm not discounting what we're seeing. I don't think that the Biden White House is discounting it either. I do think they need to do more to address it proactively. But I also think presidents have hard choices in front of them. I think Joe Biden is making decision that he thinks is best to contain the conflict in the Middle East and not let it spiral out of control.",

And, you know, I don't want to belabor what I said before, but this whole line of questioning underscores something that is -- that is really material for this election.It is hard to run for reelection as a president of the United States in this day and age. Everybody talks about the advantages of incumbency. Incumbency can be a real burden because when you're running, you can sort of choose what issues you want to talk about. When you're a president, you can't. When you're a president, a war erupts somewhere, you're expected to react. A disaster happens, you're expected to react.
