      "sentences": "Hello, and a very warm welcome to our viewers joining us from all around the world. I'm Paula Newton. Ahead right here on CNN Newsroom.A criminal probe is now underway in Bolivia against taught military general after he allegedly led an attempted coup. The president of Kenya backs down after controversial talks will send protesters storming into the streets and into the halls of Parliament and WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is back in Australia and a free man after agreeing to a plea deal with the United States. So an attempt to overthrow Bolivia's democratically elected government has been stopped and the former army chief behind the failed coup d'etat is now in state custody. That was after a dramatic confrontation with the Bolivian President inside a government palace. President Luis Arce reportedly told Juan Jose Zuniga, I am your captain and I will not allow this insubordination. Zuniga was later shown handcuffed on national TV before being forced into a police vehicle. You see him there. This all comes a day after he was relieved of his duties. Now, earlier armored vehicles were seen ramming the doors of the palace as armed troops surrounded government buildings and a main square and La Paz but the soldiers withdrew after the newly appointed army chief ordered them back to their units. President Arce had called on the public to mobilize in defense of their democracy. The Attorney General's Office is now vowing to impose the maximum punishment on the perpetrators of this attempted coup. CNN's Julia Vargas Jones is standing by for us in Los Angeles. But we go first a journalist Stefano Pozzebon, who's with us from Bogota, and has been following all the developments. And Stefano, can you just take us through what happened during this attempted coup, especially as it unfolded over just a few tents? And I have to say, very confusing hours.",

It's Evo Morales, this is really not so much about Zuniga and Arce as it is about whether Evo Morales can or not run for next year's presidential elections. Right?I mean, look, yes, it is about a mentor and his mentee facing off, there's been a rift that's been playing out since 2023 when Morales initially said that he wanted to run for presidency. He was barred from a high court, Paula, from doing so. The court saying simply that, you know, in Bolivia, a president can serve two terms. He's already served three because one of his terms was ruled to have, you know, started after that legislation was into place, but that's neither here nor there. The rift comes from a sentiment that Evo Morales is now challenging the authority of the presidency of the person that he hand picked to be in power. So obviously, at the same time, Bolivia is going through some turmoil, economic turmoil, we have reduced energy production, inflation devaluing of the local currency shortages of basic goods. But this accusation from one side and the other is not necessarily helping the party mass is split into two those who are siding with Arce, and those who are siding with Evo Morales. And now they're accusing each other of making things more difficult one and the other. Of course, the Bolivian population stuck in the middle. You have to remember Paula, everyone was a towering figure in Latin America politics. He served for 14 years and a lot of his policies brought a lot of people lifted people out of poverty. So he is regarded mostly in a positive light, but still in 2016. He asked the people of Bolivia if he could run via a referendum for a third time, and they said very resounding no.",

So it's quite a different scenario we see today because Kenyans also are expected to go to the streets today demanding that the President and these entire government, you know, stepped down because of when they talk about the protests that were many protesters were killed. So it's quite a scenario where we expect to see what unfolds today, now that the President agreed to, you know, return the bill to Parliament for reconsideration, where a majority of the members of Parliament could end up rejecting the bill in totality, as what Kenyans demand at this moment.",

And that is what has caused anger in most of the Kenyans.And as you can see, what they have been doing is now trying to come into terms without the President has not done and trying to make sure that the President understands that these people today know that he did not fulfill what exactly he said during the election period. So it's quite a moment for Kenyans to express the democratic wide standing, not a large number, because this protest, unlike the previous protests, now it's fully pushed by the Kenyan young people. And they are not relenting in any way. Because you see, this pressure they're pushing on the President is that you are going to listen to us and you're not going to do what you want. And that is the tone of unity of the young people here. So besides protesting about the finance bill to instrument for that has been a contentious marching.
