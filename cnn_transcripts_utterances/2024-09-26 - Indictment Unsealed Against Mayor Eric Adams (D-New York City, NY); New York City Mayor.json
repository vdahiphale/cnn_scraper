      "sentences": "Yes. So, Jim, sometimes when you have a pending investigation like this, it will be open lines of communication and more or less open lines of trust between prosecution and defense lawyers, and sometimes you don't have that. And this seems to be the latter scenario.Prosecutors always have to sort of find that sweet spot between on the one hand, you don't want to be heavy-handed, you don't want to take unnecessary measures that may trample on someone's rights or just be basically disrespectful to a person. On the other hand, as a prosecutor, sometimes you have to do what you have to do. And it's unpleasant and sometimes you have to execute a search warrant or not give somebody an opportunity to delay or take more time. So, I think that has yet to play out, but it is clear, Jim, as you said, there is some bad blood here between the respective sides and there's a P.R. battle going on. I mean, Eric Adams made statements last night. Apparently, he's going to speak again. He is going to try to get in before the U.S. attorney speaks at 11:30. Eric Adams we know is not shy about what he says on camera. It's worth noting the U.S. attorney, who again we'll speak in about a half hour, he is constrained as to what he can say. I think when we see his press conference, we've seen them recently. We saw one, two weeks ago on the Sean Combs, the Diddy case. The U.S. attorney can only say essentially what's already in this indictment. Now, it's a 50-some page indictment. It's very detailed. So, he will have some material to work with here. But, yes, Eric Adams -- I believe Eric Adams will continue to make his case in the press and to declare his innocence. And he is presumed innocent.",

The fact that you have the New York Mayor, New York City Mayor charged with five federal public corruption charges, very significant, Jim. Thank you for that. Let's continue our breaking news coverage of this indictment against New York City Mayor Eric Adams with Shimon, Gloria, and Elie. And just reading through this indictment, Elie, I mean, this is not a barebones indictment. I mean, there is a lot of detail in here. I'm still reading through it. But these charges are very significant against the mayor.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Pam. Sometimes when you see a federal indictment, it will just basically track the language of the statute from the law book. It doesn't give you any detail. This indictment is not that. This indictment has 50 some pages of detail.If I can try to boil it down to its essence, it's that Eric Adams received benefits free and sometimes discounted luxury travel from Turkish interests, and in exchange for that, he took steps as mayor to benefit those interests. So, that's the gist of it. And you mentioned before that this is a five-count indictment. So, let me just break that down. Count one charges Eric Adams with a conspiracy, meaning just he agreed with at least one other person in order to commit various crimes. Those underlying crimes are wire fraud for federal program bribery and then receiving illegal campaign contributions from foreign nationals. So, just to break those down. Count two is then the actual crime of wire fraud, meaning they used the wires, the internet, the phones to commit some sort of fraud. Counts three and four then are different, essentially bribery counts, charging that, again, in exchange for these benefits, he took action. And then count five relates to him taking action on behalf of these Turkish foreign nationals. Now, to be clear, you are not allowed as an American candidate for office to take campaign contributions from a foreign national or foreign interest. So, that's charged in this indictment as well. So, again, it's a conspiracy charge. And then that breaks down into mail, into wire fraud, bribery and taking illegal donations from foreign sources.",

The feds were there at Gracie Mansion for hours today. Certainly, the mayor's lawyer was not too happy about this and said he would have happily turned over whatever they were looking for.",

And then they allege that in turn for these alleged, you know, benefits that they received that Mayor Adams in certain favors for the Turkish officials.To bring you in, Gloria, I mean, as we await for Mayor Adams to speak, and as the Shimon laid out, he is saying he is innocent. He is finding this very defiant. What are the political implications here?",

And I want to thank the supporters of all, the groups that I hear, particularly the men and women of the clergy that's here that have joined me here today. And we are not surprised. We expected this. This is not surprising to us at all. The actions that have unfolded over the last ten months, the leaks, the commentary, the demonizing, this did not surprise us that we reached this day. And I asked New Yorkers to wait to hear our defense before making any judgments. In about 30 minutes, you're going to hear a story of the case that is in front of us. This story will come from the federal prosecutors. And I asked to wait in here outside to this narrative. From here, my attorneys would take care of the case so I can take care of the city. My day-to-day will not change. I will continue to do the job for 8.3 million New Yorkers that I was elected to do. And the 300,000-plus employees of our city government will continue to do their jobs because this is what we do as New Yorkers. It's an assault to the hard work and pity people of the city that anyone would say that they won't do their jobs while this case proceeds in the background. They are dedicated public servant and I have been one of them for many years, and they're going to continue to do their job moving the city forward every day. It's an unfortunate day and it's a painful day. But inside of all of that, it's a day where we will finally reveal why for ten months I have gone through this. And I look forward to defending myself and defending the people of this city, as I've done throughout my entire professional career. I want to now turn it over to the person who started me on this journey, Reverend Herbert Daughtry.",

And he knows that Damian Williams, in 18 minutes, the U.S. attorney will be standing up and laying out the case. And so I think this was Eric Adams trying to undercut it.He didn't get into any of the substantive allegations, but he is forcefully declaring that he believes in his innocence.",

I mean, prosecutors are definitely going to have to prove that Eric Adams, the defendant, knew what was happening here. If he was receiving illegal contributions and had no idea, did not know about it, had no way to know about it, that's not a crime.And so, that's going to get to the core issue that I think will be disputed here, which is, what did Eric Adams know, what was his state of mind?",

The government was able to obtain text messages from various people that were involved in this. As they allege, they've been able to, it seems, talk to some people. So, it's hard to tell who exactly may be cooperating. Look, the Adams administration has said that they were cooperating in this investigation. There have been a lot of search warrants and subpoenas issued. So, it seems like they obviously actually have a lot to work with. I mean, remember, this goes back a decade. So, there was a lot of information.And I think one of the key things in all of this also is the allegations about the role of the fire department here in New York and the expediting of the Turkish consulate. That's a very big deal, right? I mean, the fact that they're alleging that the mayor here, because of the influence that these Turkish officials had on him, they basically were able to get him to put pressure or to ask the fire department to do this, to expedite this. The mayor will say, and he has said this previously, and people close to him have certainly said this, that perhaps this is just the normal course of doing business in this city. As someone who works for the people of New York City, as someone who is a politician in the city, this is all part of the course of doing business. Of course, the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's Office do not see this. They see this really, what's important, you know, just having covered these kinds of cases before going back to really, you know, the Mueller days when you and I both covered that, you know, this is a big concern for the government. Any time a foreign national can exert what they say is this kind of pressure and this kind of influence on a politician is very significant and very concerning. And it's also Turkey, and there's a lot of concern over that, certainly, for the government. But when you read this indictment also, what's really interesting is that it's the years of influence, the years of working Eric Adams. And then when they need a favor, basically, what the government says is Adams does that favor for them. And that is certainly something that is extremely concerning for the government, for the FBI. And you can understand why they would do this investigation and why they would bring this case. But for the Eric Adams team, they're going to certainly raise a lot of issues, Pam, with why all these years, this goes back a decade, what took so long? What finally caused them to go ahead and act on this? And perhaps they learned some information. To your point, maybe they got cooperators. There's a lot of questions here that I think we want answered. And at some point, hopefully, we'll get those answers.",

Because what the FBI is saying here is that when they went to get his phone on November 6, remember this was about a year ago now, he was leaving an event and they approached him with a search warrant and told him that he had to turn his phones over.They alleged that he didn't have his personal phone on him that day and that he agreed to give the phone to them the next day, that his phone was not on him. He provided it to investigators the next day, pursuant to a subpoena, and that it was locked and required a password. They say that Adams had changed the password a day earlier to, quote, prevent members of his staff from inadvertently or intentionally deleting the contents of his phone. And then he claimed he had forgotten the password, the indictment states. So, essentially alleging, right, some kind of a cover up here. I mean, let's call it what this is. The FBI says they go to him on November 6. They say we want your phones. He says, I don't have my personal phone on him. The next day they arranged for him to give them his personal phone. And then he says, oh, I changed the password. It's locked. I don't know the password. So, that's really interesting, certainly, isn't it, Pam?",
