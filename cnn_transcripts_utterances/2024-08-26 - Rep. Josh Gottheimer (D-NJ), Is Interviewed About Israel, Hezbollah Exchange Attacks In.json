      "sentences": "Good morning. You're live in the CNN Newsroom. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington. We begin this hour with a new explosion of violence along Israel's border with Lebanon.In a major escalation, Israel and Hezbollah exchanged heavy fire this past weekend, Israel struck across the border into southern Lebanon, in what it calls preemptive strikes targeting Hezbollah's rocket launchers. The Iran-backed terror group says it still fired 320 rockets toward Israel. And CNN's Nic Robertson joins us now from Tel Aviv. Nic, both Israel and Hezbollah are claiming victory. What can you tell us? What's the latest?",

      "sentences": "Yes, both are saying that this may not be the end of it. Prime Minister Netanyahu said what you've seen may not be an end of it. And Hassan Nasrallah, the head of Hezbollah, over the weekend, said, you know, there could be more. So both are implying they could do it again.But from Israel's perspective, it -- it looks very much like that attack back in April, earlier in the year, when Iran had that massive attack against Israel, and Israel fended off pretty much every single missile, and that's what Israel is saying at the moment, only this time, it fended off Hezbollah because it had advanced intelligence, because it was able to target them while they still had missile systems on the ground, preemptive strike, and then able to intercept the majority of the missiles that were fired at Israel. Hezbollah has said that it targeted infrastructures, military infrastructures, the north of Israel and in the center of Israel. There's no evidence to support that -- that -- that actually happened. So the perception is here in Israel at least, Israel has defended itself. Hezbollah really came up short. And at the moment, there's still the small strikes across the border, but nothing on the scale that we saw Sunday. And I think at the moment, indications are we're not going to see Hezbollah tried that again soon. Jim? ACOSTA: And Nic, let's pivot to the ceasefire talks. Is this escalation that we saw over the weekend going to have an impact to those talks get threatened by this somewhat, what do you think?",

And actually, the Israeli delegation and the Hamas delegation turned up in Cairo for those talks on Sunday. Hamas left late in the day, their spokesman, so I think you've got to read into this when their spokesman speaks, this may not be what's actually going on inside the negotiating room, basically rejecting the bridging proposals as this put forward, wanting to accept President Biden's proposal in May, that they accepted early in July, that says no Israeli troops, that there would be a freedom of movement of -- of -- of Palestinians back to north of Gaza, no controls on prisoner exchange, all the things that they've said before.What's actually happened behind closed doors, we don't know. But what we do know, and what people are seeing positivity and -- is that the technical level talks, lower level delegations during the technical bridge work here, if you will. In the proposal, they are still working this week in Cairo and in Doha, so this progress of sorts. That said, publicly at least, is very hard to read. We have no indication that any substantial movement forward, has -- has happened, that this is aspirational at the moment.",

JOSH GOTTHEIMER (D-NJ): Well, I think, as was just reported, there were literally thousands of rockets on the ready from the north, from Hezbollah in Lebanon and Israel was -- obviously had intelligence and preemptively stopped it. But the intention, of course, was Hezbollah, which is an Iranian proxy, to fire, as they have been now since October 8th, fire missiles and drones into Israel. They -- they put hundreds in that were knocked down and -- of missiles and dozens of drones, this is just more of what they've been doing Hezbollah now for months, since October 8th.",

We've got to get this pause on and -- and make sure we crush all of these Iranian proxies that continue to not only do harm against Israel, our key ally, but aim at the United States of America. And I think that's the bigger picture here, we always have to focus on. Iran, these are all Iranian-backed proxies, all of their whether you're talking about Hezbollah, Hamas, the Houthis, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, those that have attacked Americans our interests in the region, our service members.

And the bottom line is, we can make sure they come home. We've got to get this pause on get these hostages home, of course, and crush the terrorists who seek to do us harm, seek to do Israel harm.And I'm -- I'm optimistic cautiously so that these talks can achieve that. We have to just keep focused on that and recognize that Hezbollah has more than 5,000 attacks on to Israel and to Israel since October 8th in the region. That whole area of families have not been able to go home. School is supposed to start for children on Sunday. Obviously, that's going to be difficult. They can't return to that region right now.

Two campaigns are at a stalemate, we are told over the rules. Sources tell CNN that Trump's team wants microphones muted when a candidate is not speaking. But the Harris campaign wants the mics left on, and Trump posted scathing remarks about \"ABC\" and some of its journalists over the weekend asking, quote, why would I do the debate against Kamala Harris on that network?, end quote.

They actually want to keep the mics on for the duration of the presidential debate. That is not what the Trump campaign wants. Their pushback being that the rules were already agreed upon. But here is what the campaign is saying in a statement. It says, quote, the Vice President is ready to deal with Trump's constant lies and interruptions in real time. Trump should stop hiding behind the mute button, so they're clearly trying to needle him a little bit here as they try to get this dispute over the mics settled. Now, the Trump campaign has suggested that the Harris campaign is also wanted the candidates to be seated and have notes. That is not the case, according to the Harris campaign. This is very much about the microphones. Of course, they know this is a critical moment. This is another opportunity to put these two candidates in front of a large audience for her to go toe to toe with former President Donald Trump, be in the same room with him. And it's something that she has spent the last several weeks preparing for. I am told that the next two weeks are going to be a lot of doubling down on those preparations for her. We know that she has taken the time out of her day where she can to read up on Trump's statements on what he has said before about multiple policies.

This is something that the campaign has always latched on to, because it indicates, for them, some level of enthusiasm among voters if you have these first time contributions.I will say, though, that part of the discussion happening within the campaign is, how do you keep this momentum going, especially because they had so many big time donors in the beginning of this and they're going to have to seize on moments. And so that is part of the discussion that they're having potentially splashy fundraisers in the future. But certainly they're feeling good about these numbers.

You know, by and large, you're going to see a lot of candidates going their own way and -- and maybe even speaking out against Trump just to save their own seats in their -- in their districts and so on.And Maria, I did want to ask you about this. Trump claimed over the weekend he would be, quote, great for reproductive rights. And then his running mate, J.D. Vance said an interview that Trump would veto a national abortion ban if he was president. What were your thoughts on that when you saw that?",

But it really is no laughing matter, because of what Trump did that he is not only proud of, but he brags about appointing the three justices that were the ones who overturned Roe v. Wade and as such, has put over a third of women in this country in danger. They're literally, their lives are in danger.Many women have gotten sick. Many women have almost died. Many women can still certainly die and are in danger in all of the states that have these massive, extreme bans on abortion. So no, I don't believe J.D. Vance when he says that Donald Trump would veto an abortion ban, of course, he wouldn't. That's exactly what he would do. He has said it before. And we all know that Donald Trump lies. And so when he says that he's great for reproductive rights, to me, that's telling me, Jim, that he knows exactly how dangerous this issue is for him electorally. And one of the things that we always know does not show up, you know, full front and center in the polls is this issue of reproductive rights. It happened in 2022.
