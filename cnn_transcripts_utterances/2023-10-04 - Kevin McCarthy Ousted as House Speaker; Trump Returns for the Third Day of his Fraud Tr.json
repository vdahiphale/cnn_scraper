Tuesday's extraordinary vote pushed by hardline conservatives makes McCarthy the first House speaker voted out of the job in U.S. history.His 269-day speakership is now the shortest in more than 140 years. And the Republican Party has now plunged deeper into chaos. Lawmakers will now need to elect a new speaker, but there's no clear alternative who would have the support needed to win the gavel. And McCarthy says he will not try for the speakership again. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), FORMER HOUSE SPEAKER: I don't regret standing up for choosing Governing over grievance. It is my responsibility. It is my job. I do not regret negotiating. Our government is designed to find compromise. I don't regret my efforts to build coalitions and find solutions. I was raised to solve problems, not create them. So I may have lost a vote today, but as I walk out of this chamber, I feel fortunate to have served the American people. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And the issue here is that we saw defense spending amongst NATO allies really being ramped up before the war even started, but production capacity did not follow and that is the concern here. We've been hearing from both E.U. and NATO leaders saying that production needs to be ramped up at a much faster pace in order to fulfill demand in Ukraine. And of course, this comes off the back of concern and questions circling around the U.S. Congress's decision to pass that stopgap budget without provisions for additional funding for Ukraine at this current point in time.
