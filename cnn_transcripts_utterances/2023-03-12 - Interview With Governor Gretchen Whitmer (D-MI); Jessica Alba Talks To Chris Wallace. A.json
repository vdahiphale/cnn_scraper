But there was a story that came up during all those travels and all those miles.I was at the Detroit Children's Hospital, and I was talking to a mom, whose son was in the hospital. Well, she was driving from Flint to Detroit every day to see her son. And she had three other boys, who were at home. And she hit a pothole and it sidelined her for a whole day. It took a lot of money out of rent and childcare. And so it was that story I think that for me crystallized the roads are a lot more than just roads. It's about whether or not you can put food on the table and take care of your family and get to see your son who's in the hospital. And so I think, as a working woman, I don't have time for BS.
