But the idea that this can completely erase the concerns about inflation obviously has proven untrue, as we have gotten closer to the election, particularly for those last few points of voters who don't follow the campaigns as closely and really aren't necessarily tuned in to these arguments that might seem a little abstract to them.

And when you have the level of dissatisfaction that we have with the economy now, there are going to be Democrats in very blue states that are going to have closer calls than they expect. And some might even fall. Now, New York is a place where, in the end, it looks like Democrats can stabilize in that governor's race. But there are a number of House races that are surprisingly difficult for them. But, as I say, I mean, there's no place that's entirely safe when you have a storm. I mean, the key, as always in a midterm, is going to be who shows up. It's really striking that the final polls that came out yesterday from CNN, Marist, Quinnipiac all had Republicans doing better among likely voters than among registered voters. And the reason for that is they anticipate that young voters in particular will fall back to their low turnout patterns to 2014 and 2010, won't come close to matching what they did in 2018. And that will give a final advantage to Republicans. And so that is going to be one of the critical variables about whether those predictions hold or whether, in fact, Democrats can find a way to mobilize young people, who were never that excited about Joe Biden all the way going back to the 2020 primaries.",
