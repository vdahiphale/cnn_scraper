We're now entering the ninth hour of a ceasefire between Israel and the Lebanese group Hezbollah. The U.S.-backed deal ends a 13-month conflict on Israel's northern border that spirals -- spiraled into an all out war with the terror group. Some residents in southern Beirut waved Hezbollah flags earlier this morning, celebrating the end of hostilities. Israeli forces moved into southern Lebanon to push back Hezbollah fighters. A few months ago forcing evacuations of towns and villages near Israel's border. This morning, some of those residents have begun to return despite a warning from the IDF that their evacuation orders do remain in effect. And in a sign of how fragile this deal is, IDF forces reporting they opened fire on several vehicles approaching a restricted area just a few hours ago. Last night, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, hailing the ceasefire as a victory. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator):  And now, Hezbollah is no longer, and it will help us with the task of bringing our hostages back. We were attacked in seven fronts, and we retaliated. We are changing the face of the Middle East. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Thank you so much for being here. How do you think we got to this point and can you dig in a little bit to obviously, President Biden out there yesterday talking about this deal, taking credit for it. But there are some questions as well about how the impending arrival of Donald Trump to the White House on January 20th here in the U.S. impacted what were seeing where you are.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Avi, you say that right now. The situation is very fragile. And what would you say are the biggest risks that are presented right now in terms of this potentially falling apart well, the most I think profound risk is that Hezbollah will violate it as it has time and time again, that they will continue to bring in arms from Iran via Syria, that they will then transform the villages and towns of southern Lebanon into an armed garrison as they have done for the past 18 years, and well before, and that Israel will, in fact, not be permitted to respond, even though it has been assured that it will have that ability.Israel, I think is quite adamant that it will have the ability to respond to any violation of the ceasefire, including, of course, attacks on Israeli towns and villages. But also Hezbollah attempts to rearm in that part of the country. We have to see if indeed that is maintained and if this is a significantly different situation than that which was presented to us at the end of the war in 2006.",

And Hamas may indeed follow in suit.And we know that, in fact, today, Hamas is saying that it is willing to soften its position and perhaps reach an accommodation with Israel that would see the release of the remaining hostages and a cessation of hostilities in Gaza, which would seem to be a confirmation that, in fact, this tactic seems to have worked.

I think we have been sort of mobilized for this war for so long. The entire country has been mobilized and devastated in so many different ways. I think the prime minister is interested in bringing this, this war to a close. The question is under what terms? I think there are those who have suggested that the prime minister has been waiting for Donald Trumps entry to the White House, to perhaps seek more favorable terms to Israel. But if that can be achieved right now by Hamas softening its stance and in fact expressing any eagerness or even willingness to reach an accommodation, I think they'll find a willing partner on the Israeli side as well.",

The Russian leader was well aware of Merkel's fear of dogs since she was bitten by 1 in 1995, so Putin brought one with him during a meeting with the German chancellor in 2007. In an excerpt obtained by \"Politico\" -- excuse me -- Merkel writes this, quote, I interpreted Putin's facial expressions to mean that he was enjoying the situation. Did he just want to see how a person in distress reacts? Was it a small demonstration of power? I thought just -- I just thought, stay calm, concentrate on the photographers. It will pass. Merkel says she also found her interactions with Donald Trump so challenging that she sought advice from Pope Francis on how to deal with him. In another moment shared by \"Politico\", she writes Trump judged everything from the perspective of the property entrepreneur he had been before politics. For him, all countries were in competition with each other in which the success of one was the failure of the other. He did not believe that the prosperity of all could be increased through cooperation. Let's go live to London and bring in CNN's Max Foster. Max, good morning to you. Thank you so much for being here. Really fascinating. I mean, Merkel was just such an incredibly powerful figure, of course, for so long on the world stage and she's pretty candid about what it was like to deal with people like Putin and Donald Trump.",

This was back in 2019. Let's watch this moment and well talk about it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES:  And honestly with Trudeau, he's a nice guy.

Many people still look up to her as the ultimate sort of liberal figure.And these two clashed against each other, and she had to redefine a lot of her worldviews with the context of someone like Donald Trump in the frame. But I do think she, the insight she gives is that, you know we often talk about Donald Trump being a transactional leader so we think of a negotiation. So he goes into a deal, he gets something out of it they get something out of it. What she's saying is that actually it's more about winning for him. He doesn't think that both sides can get what they want. You have to be the winning side. And I think that does inform other world leaders currently because you can go into a conversation with Donald Trump. And in that context, you have to -- to get something out of it. You have to allow him to win. So you think to yourself, I want to get this out of it. Focus on that. But he needs to get what he wants out of it as well, and he needs to come out on top. And you do see some of the relationships that are very successful with him working in that way and when it comes to the, you know, these strongmen that he's famous for admiring, he's being tested and you know, until someone wins, he's going to continue with that relationship. So I do think she gives a good context on him.",
