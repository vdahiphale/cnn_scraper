      "sentences": "Well, I think they feel confident that this is the kind of thing that President Biden does best. He is - obviously, he's going to go. He's going to show an unprecedented display of support, but he's also going to help try to guide them in the right direction. Hopefully there will be tangible accomplishments that come from this trip.But, over the long term, what the president's doing is showing - is really showing the durability of his belief that American alliances -- and that showing up and engaging on the world stage is the best way to move us away from hopefully a further spiraling conflict and also to ensure that the humanitarian plans and -- are in place and that humanitarian aid can flow in an incredibly difficult situation. You know, I've travelled with President Biden to Israel both when he was vice president and president. And I can tell you that he and Netanyahu have an incredibly direct and candid relationship. He will spend a lot of time on this trip listening, but also, again, you know, being very forthcoming and direct in his advice. So, you know, for the president, we'll see whether there are tangible accomplishments that, yes, he can walk away from this 24, 36, 48 hours and point to. You know, over the long term, I think what he's showing is that American presence, American guidance is meaningful on the world stage. And I think that's a function of his experience and his time dealing with these kinds of crises in office. So, he will hopefully help provide a steadying hand. But as Bobby said and a you've laid out, you know, this isn't without risk. Obviously, this is a moment where he is inserting the United States into what is likely to be a protracted conflict. And certainly risk comes with that. But the calculation here is that his presence, his guidance and the full force of the United States can help move things in a productive direction. PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN ANCHOR: Kate, you were there when the president had the surprise trip to Kyiv. You were there in 2021 when he and his team worked with Egyptian President El-Sisi to secure the cease fire. Were you surprised by this decision?",

You know, when I saw that they had begun discussing this idea, you know, I knew that the president would want to go, in part because, exactly as you said, you know, I've seen up close how important it is to him to do face to face diplomacy. He truly believes that at the end of the day showing up, being able to talk face to face, being able to have those direct conversations where you can look someone in the eye, understand what they need and want, and also tell them very directly what you, what the United States, needs and wants. You know, there's no -- he believes truly there's no -- there's no substitute for that.And so, you know, working on, for example, as you mentioned, working on the secret trip that he took to Kyiv earlier this year, you know, there were a lot of security risks. There was a lot of guidance and suggestion offered to the president that maybe he shouldn't go. He felt incredibly strongly about the need to show up, to physically show support and engage. So, it actually -- you know, it does come with some risk, but that is, you know -- this trip, I should say, does come with some risk. But it didn't surprise me because I have seen how President Biden chooses to act in these moments. And he does not shy away from asserting American leadership. So, it actually - it did not surprise me at all to be honest with you.",

One, yesterday, as CNN reported, there were truckloads, tankers of petrol that were sent in for humanitarian reasons to help so there would be fuel for the generators in Gaza's hospitals. We know for a fact -- and it was actually reported, that some of that fuel was stolen by Hamas for their war machine. They are the people with guns. They are the people who have the power inside Gaza. And they have no qualms whatsoever about stealing materials that are meant for the innocent civilian population of Gaza and siphoning it off for their war machine. And that's what happened yesterday.So, I think what we need to establish are mechanisms so there will be safeguards against that sort of thing. There's no point of the international community coming to support the people of Gaza if it's going to just be siphoned off and taken away by Hamas. The second point you have to know is that we had agreed, and arrangements were made, for the exit yesterday of dual nationals, people with foreign passports. It was all agreed that they can leave. And at the very last moment, Hamas blocked the Rafah border crossing, as if to say, we are holding these foreign nationals as hostages, just as they are holding the 200 Israelis, just as they are holding the civilian population of Gaza as a human shield. Maybe we shouldn't be surprised by Hamas's behavior, whether it's with dual nationals or with the oil. That's who they are, and that's the brutal enemy we're up against.",

But that could change his mind as the House votes today on Jordan's bid to be the next speaker. Could he? Well, of course, we'll have to see.Jordan has gained the support of several key Republicans over the course of the last 36 hours, but as of now, according to our stellar Capitol Hill team and its whip count, still short of the 217 votes necessary to win the gavel. He can only afford to lose four members of his conference. Joining us now, CNN's senior political analyst and anchor John Avlon, and Josh Barro, who puts out the \"Very Serious\" newsletter and podcast. All right, Josh Barro, I was surprised watching some of the flips toward the Jordan column yesterday. There's kind of an alliance of appropriation guys, defense guys who seem to be hard no's and all of a sudden started moving in that direction. Do you think he gets over the finish line? JOSH BARRO, WRITER, \"VERY SERIOUS\" NEWSLETTER AND HOST, \"VERY SERIOUS\" PODCAST: I don't know. I mean I think that the -- I don't think we're going to see the scenario that some people were thinking about where he might have as many as 50 people voting against him on the floor. If he doesn't have 218, I think he will be fairly close. But the problem is, you know, Kevin McCarthy was fairly close in January. It still took him 15 votes to get all the way there. I think, you know, you have these folks who are on the Appropriations Committee, involved in national defense policy in the House, they had specific asks. And who knows exactly what Jim Jordan is saying to them behind closed doors. But it makes sense that it's possible to get them over the hump because they have concerns about funding the government, about spending levels on defense and he can make promises about that and he can conceivably even deliver on those promises. Might be more easily able to deliver on them than someone like Kevin McCarthy or Steve Scalise because he's going to have more of a leash from the Freedom Caucus guys. He's already out there saying he intends to do another continuing resolution. But then you still have these sundry people who have other concerns. Ken Buck is a very idiosyncratic member there from Colorado, very conservative, quite upset apparently about Jim Jordan and also Steve Scalise refusing to say that Donald Trump had lost the 2020 election.",

Liz Cheney said that he knew more than any other member of Congress, was working with members of the Trump administration to overturn the election, which led to the attack. Remember, on the day of the attack, she said, you did this.This is someone who has the -- one of the lowest legislative records of anyone in Congress in terms of passing legislation, let alone working across the aisle. Someone who's primarily - who was described by former Republican Speaker John Boehner as a legislative terrorist because he's focused on destroying and taking things down rather than building things up. So, the idea that he's moderating and willing to make deals and open to concessions is a sick joke.
