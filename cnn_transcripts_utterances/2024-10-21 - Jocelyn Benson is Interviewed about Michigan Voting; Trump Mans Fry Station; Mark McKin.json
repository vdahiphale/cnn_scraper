And so that does generate the potential for threats and violence. And among all, as you're hearing from the clip you just showed, diminishes citizens since trust in a very secure election process. And so all of that has created challenges for us as election administrators, especially because we have in-person early voting, which is new this year, as the result of a citizen amendment passed in '22. But at the same time, the fact that so many people are voting, over a million people have already cast their ballots, you know, two weeks out, more than two weeks out of Election Day, is a great sign that many voters are actually not just trusting the system but participating in it, including thousands of Detroiters, who showed up to vote early this weekend.",

When - when - when it's all about turnout, what's key is enthusiasm, right? You know, whose voters are more excited about going out to vote? And Harris has like a ten point advantage. So, that's one gap. There's a gender gap. She also has about a ten-point advantage on women voters. And then I think there's an early voting gap, as we see from the data coming in, like you just showed in Michigan, there's huge numbers of early voters turning out. Now, we'll wait to see until after the election what that really means. But generally what that means is the Democrats vote early, and so if those numbers are up, it's likely more Democrats.
