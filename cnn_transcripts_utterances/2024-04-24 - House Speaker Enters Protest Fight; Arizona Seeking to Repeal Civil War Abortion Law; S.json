Wade was overturned.Today, the justices heard arguments over whether hospitals have an obligation under federal law to provide abortions to women during non- life-threatening medical emergencies even in states where the procedure is banned. This is stemming from a lawsuit filed by the Biden administration against the state of Idaho, which has a near-total abortion ban.",

      "sentences": "Now, Idaho's law does have an exception to save the life of the mother, but it does not allow abortions in a non-life-threatening medical crisis.Now, the Justice Department says this violates federal law requiring hospitals to provide emergency care. CNN senior Supreme Court analyst Joan Biskupic joins us now. Joan, an eventual decision could impact millions of women, emergency rooms and providers across the United States. Walk us through what the arguments look like today. JOAN BISKUPIC, CNN SENIOR SUPREME COURT ANALYST:  Sure. And just so you know, the solicitor general, Elizabeth Prelogar, said today that at least six other states have abortion bans that are as restrictive as Idaho's. There are about 22 states that now have much more restrictive laws since the Supreme Court back in 2022 completely erased the constitutional right to abortion. Overall, I would say that this conservative-dominated court was very skeptical of the government's position that somehow you could still have abortions being provided in emergency situations in hospitals in these states that say that an abortion can only be allowed if it's necessary to save the life of the mother. She would have to be near death. But the government says, no, there's so many other situations that would come before that moment that would be life-threatening to her reproductive health, to have any kind of failure of vital organs, things that would be -- would not be -- put her right at death's door, but would -- should be handled in an emergency situation. So, we did have a little bit of pushback from the conservatives. But I want to play first a clip from Justice Alito talking to the solicitor general, Elizabeth Prelogar, that shows the kind of skepticism sort of for the heavy hand of government interfering with states here. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) SAMUEL ALITO, U.S. SUPREME COURT ASSOCIATE JUSTICE:  Does the term health in EMTALA mean just physical health, or does it also include mental health? ELIZABETH PRELOGAR, U.S. SOLICITOR GENERAL:  There can be grave mental health emergencies, but EMTALA could never require pregnancy termination as the stabilizing care.",

It's because that wouldn't do anything to address the underlying brain chemistry issue that's causing the mental health emergency in the first place.When a woman comes in with some grave mental health emergency, if she happens to be pregnant, it would be incredibly unethical to terminate her pregnancy. She might not be in a position to give any informed consent. Instead, the way you treat mental health emergency is to address what's happening in the brain. If you're having a psychotic episode, you administer antipsychotics.",

PRELOGAR:  With respect to what qualifies as an emergency medical condition, it can include grave mental health emergencies, but let me be very clear about our position. That could never lead to pregnancy termination, because that is not the accepted standard of practice to treat any mental health emergency. (END AUDIO CLIP)",

KARA CADWALLADER, IDAHO COALITION FOR SAFE HEALTHCARE:  Yes, I just want to speak to -- thank you, first, for having me. And I just want to speak to what's happening on the ground in Idaho, where I practice. We have had disastrous results from this law being allowed to take effect. We are no longer able to provide the standard of care to our pregnant patients who come in with pregnancy complications. They're not seeking abortion. They're seeking pregnancy care, but they have health-threatening complications. And we're being forced to sit on the sidelines and watch while they become progressively sicker and sicker, potentially facing life-changing consequences, like a stroke or kidney failure or liver failure, while we withhold necessary care. Our hands are tied. We feel like we may be facing jail time if we provide that health-saving and lifesaving care. And so, as you mentioned earlier in the piece, folks are being -- pregnant patients are being flown out of the state to access our standard of care. So it's had disastrous results. We have lost -- almost a quarter of our OB-GYN providers in the state have left because it's an untenable situation to be in. We cannot practice according to our oath to take care of patients to the best degree possible.",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RAUL LABRADOR (R), IDAHO ATTORNEY GENERAL:  The reality is that our law is very clear. It protects doctors, it protects women, it protects unborn children, and it ensures that the doctors can use a subjective standard. If they believe that the life of the mother is in jeopardy -- it doesn't have to be imminent. They just believe that the life of the mother's in jeopardy, it allows them to perform an abortion. And it's really hard for me to conceive of a single instance where a woman has to be airlifted out of Idaho to perform an abortion. In fact, I have talked to doctors in the E.R., the same E.R. rooms that they're talking about, and they are telling me that they have no idea what this administrator is talking about.

So they only meet on Wednesdays, and the legislation session justbegan for the day at 10:00 a.m. local time here, so we're tracking what happens. But what happened last Wednesday, two failed attempts, was to try to bring the bill of -- the repeal bill to the House floor, to bypass procedural hurdles to get it even considered on the full floor. They couldn't get that to happen. But this source tells me that there are the votes there today to overcome that hurdle and then to actually pass the repeal. Now, if they succeed in doing, that's not the end of the story. It still has to go over to the Senate for a couple of readings. If they fail to repeal this law, it goes into effect at the earliest June 8. And just to remind our viewers, this law dates back to 1864, when Arizona was a territory. It bans nearly all abortions, except in the case of saving the life of the mother. And a provider could be punished for two to five years in prison. Right now, we're also seeing some developments with Republicans who met just before this session this morning to basically allow for late introduction of House resolutions for Republicans to come up with their own ballot initiatives for November to counter a ballot initiative that's already in the works by abortion rights activists trying to enshrine abortion rights in the state's constitution. So this is going to play out over the next few months, a huge effect on the November vote.",
