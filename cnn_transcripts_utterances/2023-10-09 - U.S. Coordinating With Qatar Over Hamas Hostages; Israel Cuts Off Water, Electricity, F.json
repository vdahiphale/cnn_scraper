We probably will hear more about that from Benjamin Netanyahu, who we expect to speak at any moment now. They're talking about cutting off food, water, electricity, fuel. Gaza is surrounded on three sides, as you know, by Israel and Egypt, and by water on the fourth side. I want to turn now to CNN national security analyst, Peter Bergen. He's vice president at New America and an Arizona State University professor as well. Peter, so a complete siege of Gaza. I've spent time in Gaza City, under attack. Talk a little about what that means, particularly for the civilian population. We can talk about the military component against Hamas, but the civilian population, just in terms of, how did they get out of the way? There's not a lot of places to go in Gaza.",

And has also been instrumental, for instance, in getting American journalists who are held by al Qaeda released. So the fact they are involved in these discussions, Anderson, is a really good sign because they actually have some ability to influence Hamas and also some ability to be seen as sort of a neutral player in the region.",

That have already passed some these as law. This has triggered regular protests in the streets of Israel. Tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of Israelis every single week since January have been taking to the streets to protest this government. I have never seen Israeli society so divided over an issue than what has been happening over the past few. And it's even led to some military reservists vowing they would not serve and they would not heed the call to serve because of this judicial overhaul. I don't know that anybody anticipated the type of security situation that Israel would be faced as they have been in the last few days.

There have been several instances this morning of mortar shells and rockets being fired, and infiltrators trying to make their way across.
