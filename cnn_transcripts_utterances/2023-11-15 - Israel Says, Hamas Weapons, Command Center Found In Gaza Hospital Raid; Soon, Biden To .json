Key world organizations are condemning the raid as we're getting dire new accounts from inside the hospital.Also tonight, a rare face-to-face meeting between President Biden and China's Xi Jinping here in the United States. President Biden now preparing to answer questions about the summit and his efforts to cool tensions with Beijing. And CNN presses Senator Joe Manchin about his next move now that he's not running for re-election. Will he bolt from the Democratic Party and set his sights on the White House? Kaitlan Collins debuts her interview with Manchin this hour. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. Tonight, Israel says its controversial military operation inside Gaza's largest hospital, quote, will take time. At last resort -- at last report, I should say, it was still under way as the Israel Defense Forces is sharing some of the evidence seized during the raid. CNN's Nic Robertson is following all of these developments. He is joining us live from Sderot, in Israel, that's near the Gaza border. Nic, what more are we hearing from the IDF?",

This going into the hospital began a little under 24 hours ago, and in that time, the IDF say that they have found weapons, ammunition, military equipment, they say, belonging to Hamas, computers, computer discs. But the one thing that they haven't said that they have found so far, Wolf, is tunnels, a bunker network.If we remember back over the past few weeks, the IDF has said the reason they needed to get into the Al-Shifa Hospital was because Hamas was operating command and control from a bunker network underneath the hospital. IDF Spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Conricus has told journalists some of what the IDF has found there. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. COL. JONATHAN CONRICUS, SPOKESPERSON, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES: Military equipment. There is an ak-47. There are cartridges, ammo. There are grenades in here, of course, uniforms. And all of this was hidden very conveniently, secretly behind the MRI machine. These weapons have absolutely no business being inside the hospital. This is the bag that we found and this was the stuff that was in it. Now there's insignia, military insignia, knife. For those of who you read Arabic, you'll be able to understand what it says here, but it's Hamas, the military wing, Kataib al-Qassam, of course, a vest with equipment and as always an ak-47, tactical radio, communications, which we'll analyze, lots of discs which will be analyzed and a computer.

We did -- CNN was able to communicate with a doctor in the hospital who described a situation where the IDF were going from building to building to building, and a journalist at the hospital as well, CNN contacted, said that he had seen the IDF searching and questioning young men in the hospital as well as seeing fire fights going on.

(END VIDEOTAPE) BASHIR (on camera): Look, Wolf, while the focus has certainly been on Al-Shifa over the past 24 hours, as we know, the vast majority of Gaza's hospitals not just in Northern Gaza are crumbling under the weight of this ongoing bombardment, this ongoing war, and, of course, the humanitarian situation which is deteriorating by the hour.

Now, they can't say that in interviews to CNN, of course, because Hamas doesn't like when people speak out of turn.
