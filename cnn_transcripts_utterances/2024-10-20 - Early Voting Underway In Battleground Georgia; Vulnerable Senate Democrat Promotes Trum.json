Right now, Israel says that 70 rockets have been fired from southern Lebanon as the Israel Defense Forces says that some projectiles were intercepted. Others were identified on the ground in remote areas.Crews are working out to put out fires as a result of all of that. And despite Israel's incursion across the border, I should note it's been targeting dozens of South Lebanon villages and towns overnight, we are seeing. It also targeted one city for the third time this week, as tensions are very much still running high in this region. As right now, Israel is weighing how and when it's going to respond to Iran's missile barrage from October 1st. All of this is happening following the death of the Hamas leader, Yahya Sinwar. As tonight, we're learning more about a leak of U.S. intelligence that could give more insight into how Israel is weighing its response to the Iranian attack. CNN's Matthew Chance is here with me now. And Matthew, for people who are just waking up and learning about this, this intelligence leak that has happened, it's unclear if it was a hack or a leak exactly where the sources information came from.

It's sort of behind closed doors in Israel about where this leak came from. And obviously, the U.S. is investigating that, it says. It's possible it could have been some sort of low level sort of operative in the U.S. with opinions. This is what Israeli sort of sources that I've been speaking to are saying. But it's also possible and Israeli media is speculating on this.

I do want to get more on this intelligence leak that has now happened that, as Matthew noted there U.S. officials are very much investigating this right now, how this information could have become public. Was it deliberate? Was it an accident? We've got Colonel Cedric Leighton, a CNN military analyst joining us. And first, Colonel, let me just ask you, as you're looking at these documents and what has been revealed out there, how damaging do you believe this is, whether that's in terms of what it reveals or just for the relationship in and of itself? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes, Kaitlan, good morning. There are certain factors here, and Matthew is absolutely right. These are not documents that will reveal everything that the United States knows about what Israel is doing and also, by extension, won't reveal everything that Israel actually is doing or planning for these attacks on Iran or this attack on Iran. But it's still bad news because it shows some degree of vulnerability of the U.S. intelligence system. The two documents in question, one of them is from NGA, which is National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. That's the one that does all the imagery, all the satellite data. The other one is purportedly from NSA, from the National Security Agency. And that's the agency that intercepts communications, the signals intelligence agency I worked for during part of my career. And basically, what they do is, of course, not only get the signals intelligence, but also potentially cyber information. So those are the kinds of things that we're talking about. But documents themselves reveal very little about what the Israelis are actually doing. The movements discussed in them would be routine in any case when there's a preparation for something major, whether it's an exercise or an actual military event. As far as the actual --",

So, if you have access to the computer networks that where this stuff resides on, then you basically have access to a large portion of the U.S. intelligence take.

That does seem to be playing out in several different instances.The way the Israelis went into Rafah, for example, in Gaza, the way the Israelis conducted their operations against Hezbollah, a lot of that is, you know, pretty clear that they didn't limit the way they conducted their operations, that they didn't listen to those U.S. requests. But on the other side of this, though, Kaitlan, is the fact that what Israel is doing does help the U.S. strategic interest in a way because it helps secure Israel. We have committed ourselves to Israel. And in essence, what the Israelis are doing is breaking the ring of, you know, of conflict that Iran and its proxies have had all around Israel. So by eliminating leadership in Hamas in Gaza, and Hezbollah leadership in Lebanon, the Israelis are actually securing their area and thus making it easier for the U.S. to help Israel protect itself.

They spent a total of $66 million dollars on broadcast TV ads in the month of October. So, a third of that money, $21 million, is going to ads about LGBTQ rights.Why do you think the Trump campaign is targeting the transgender community when polls have shown that it's not really a top issue for voters right now? RODRIGO HENG-LEHTINEN, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, NATIONAL CENTER FOR TRANSGENDER EQUALITY:  Well, thank you so much for having me. And you are exactly right that this is really not a top issue for voters.

You know, Trump over and over again has targeted minority groups and has really gone after small minorities to try to make people in the American public fearful. It is a divide and conquer strategy. He's done this not only against transgender Americans and our families but also, against immigrants, like we saw in Springfield. This is what Trump does. He sows division. He tries to make Americans fearful of each other, so that he can gain his own power. It's selfish, and it's a disservice to the American people.",

You know, whenever ads like this run, they foster an environment of hostility, and they make a lot of families of transgender people worry about discrimination and harassment. But what we've also seen is that every time MAGA extremists have tried to run ads like this, it has backfired. You know, this is not the first time it's happened. MAGA extremists ran anti-transgender ads to try to defeat Governor Roy Cooper in North Carolina, and it failed. He won re-election. They also tried it in Kentucky against Governor Andy Beshear, and it failed. He won re- election. And lastly, they tried it in Virginia, in multiple districts, in the State Assembly and State Senate, and not only did they fail, but actually, the voters ended up electing a record number, double the number of out LGBT delegates, and even elected Virginia's very first openly trans state senator. So, even though MAGA extremists may be trying this to score political points at other people's expense, it doesn't actually work.",

Tinder is also helping people actually register to vote by providing this action center within partnerships with vote.org that tells people how to register registration, deadlines, things like that. Elsewhere, you have OkCupid that has added these matching questions that users can answer to show potential matches, things like what's the most important issue to them in the 2024 presidential election, or when I find really interesting, is it a deal breaker if your date is voting for a different candidate than you in the 2024 presidential election? So, really trying to give people a sense of where folks stand, where potential matches stand on these very personal issues that are so top of mind for people as we head into the election.",

Younger users want to be having deeper connections before they get off the app. So, this feels very much in service of that.And this comes at a time when we know that people are sort of burnt out on dating apps. They feel like they want to meet people in real- life. They're kind of tired of online dating.

This is just incredible. Breaking their prior daily record that stood for over a century. There's still a flood warning for Roswell. Points northward. There's a river that flows through the area that's burst -- overflowed some of its banks, but there's also the flood wash that extends over a great portion of Eastern New Mexico, and you could see.Why how much rain has fallen? Some of those darker shades of orange and yellow, indicating three to upwards of six inches of rain. And guess what? It's still raining. More precipitation with this system. Believe it or not, that actual low is going to be the reason why this hurricane I'm about to show you will also be kicked away from the Eastern United States. More on that in just one second. It could be a few pop-up isolated tornadoes today across Eastern New Mexico as well. This is the tornado, Hurricane Oscar, defying all of the weather models that we watched yesterday, moving from a tropical storm rapidly into a hurricane. Still a hurricane right now with the 5:00 a.m. update from the National Hurricane Center impacting parts of the Turks and Caicos overnight, and now it's got its eyes set on the southeastern sections of Cuba. Why is this not a threat for the United States? Well, it's all because of the trough that is going to grab the hurricane and move it away from Cuba, once it makes landfall later today, and then moves it into the Bahamas, away from the eastern seaboard of the U.S. So, again, repeating, not a U. S. threat, but one thing's for sure, a lot of rain, a lot of wind for these islands, these beautiful islands. And just going to recap this, because this is astounding, another prime example of rapid intensification. Just between 11:00 a.m. yesterday to 2:00 p.m. on Saturday, that three-hour stretch we saw an increase in wind speeds by over 40 miles per hour. That's something. Victor, Amara.",

But in the end, it's the Yankees making it back to the World Series for the first time since 2009.Now, New York was down to nothing in the sixth inning of this game. Giancarlo Stanton at the plate. He just continues to be one of the best postseason sluggers of all time. He homered again. This was a two-run shot to tie. It was his fifth home run of the playoffs. And Stanton was named the ALCS MVP. Now, we'd go to extra innings, two on for Juan Soto. And this is why the Yankees traded for him. He comes through in the clutch with the three-run home run. Yankees would then get the final three outs to clinch the pennant. And they now await the winner between the Dodgers and the Mets, game six of that series is going to be tonight in L.A. Now, it was a busy sports weekend in Austin, Texas with F1 in town. But the main event was number one, Texas hosting fifth ranked Georgia third quarter. Texas gets the interception here, but they throw a flag for pass interference. So, long are fans were not happy. They started throwing trash all over the field. Well, get this. The officials then got together. They actually reversed the calls. Never seen throwing trash on the field actually work. Kirby Smart was livid. He said the refs tried to rob them, but the Bulldogs, they would end up handing Texas their first loss of the season. Georgia wins 30 to 15. Missouri quarterback Brady Cook, meanwhile, he got injured on the team's opening series against Auburn yesterday. He went to the hospital to get an MRI on his ankle. Well, it came back OK. Cook then rushed back to the stadium and led the Tigers on to fourth quarter touchdown drives to win the game. He said afterwards, he knew only had two and a half home games left in his career, so he needed to find a way to get back on the field. Head coach Eli Drinkwitz said Cook was an inspiration.
