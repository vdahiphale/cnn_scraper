Maybe late, late tonight, almost by tomorrow morning this time, something rolling through northern Louisiana. But snow in the Four Corners, storms in the middle, and snow still in New England.So let's get to it right now. Most of the storms from overnight have calmed down. There was quite a bit of activity overnight from Arkansas into Tennessee, and even northern Alabama and northern Georgia. But we're watching the next storm system that will develop west of there -- the next one that will bring the potential for severe weather today. Dallas, Shreveport -- maybe to your north on up toward Little Rock, Hot Springs. Here's how we go. Here's how it plays out. We work our way into noon. Storms beginning to fire west of Dallas. Then all of a sudden, Stephenville. And then on up into Dallas, Texas. Some of these could be very, very large. I know you see the area here of the biggest threat to the east of Dallas but I think that could push to the back. I think in a few hours we're going to say hey, wait a minute -- Dallas, Tarrant County, you are in it to win it today. You're going to have to watch this, especially on up toward Hugo, on up toward Denton. These are the areas that are going to see the initial rotation with these storms. And then later on this afternoon it moves a little bit farther to the north and a line -- a squall line rolls toward Shreveport about midnight tonight. Then the big storms here overnight on up toward St. Louis and maybe even to southern Indiana, Illinois, all the way through Kentucky. Tornado threat today. Yes, there's a hail threat. There's a wind threat. All of the above are possible for today in that same area. But also widespread rain. Even if you don't get severe weather you could see four to six inches of rainfall here and that could cause some flash flooding. We're going to watch this for you today. It's going to really start to ramp up around 2:00 or 3:00 this afternoon. Keep your weather radio on or make sure that your apps on your phone are working because there will be quite a few warnings today.",

Well, for one, it's a really fun, interactive, new technology. It's a way to get people excited to come back, user engagement.

Now, the driver of the other vehicle, recruiting staffer Chandler LeCroy, reportedly had a blood alcohol content level that was more than twice the legal limit. The SUV was traveling at 104 miles per hour when it slammed into power poles and trees, killing her and offensive lineman Devin Willock. Now, Carter released this statement on his social media saying, \"There is no question in my mind that when all of the facts are known that I will be fully exonerated of any criminal wrongdoing.\" All right, in the NBA last night, Kevin Durant making his long- anticipated debut with the Suns.
