Welcome to CNN TONIGHT.The Coast Guard says a catastrophic implosion killed the five passengers onboard that submersible that was headed to the wreck of the Titanic. We're learning tonight that the Navy picked up the sound of an implosion on an underwater listening system on Sunday, just hours after the sub lost communications. So why did the search go on for four more days? We've got a live report from the Pentagon coming up. We'll break down everything we know tonight about, on the ill- fated journey and what went wrong. Plus, you just heard Christiane Amanpour's exclusive interview with former President Obama, and tonight we've got reaction to what he says about the indictments of Donald Trump. We'll also examine what he says about his former vice president, Joe Biden, so stick around for that. But let's begin with news of the Titanic submersible. CNN's Jason Carroll is live in Boston, where some of the Coast Guard searchers were based, and Oren Lieberman is at the Pentagon for us. Oren, you're getting new information about this top secret at the time, Navy system that detected this implosion very soon after the sub lost communications. So what do we know tonight?",

      "sentences": "That's right. A senior Navy official tells us that the Navy picked up on a sound or acoustic signature that was likely or could have been an implosion or an explosion at about the time the Titan Submersible went missing and at about the location where it went missing.According to that senior Navy official, the Navy that immediately passed that information onto the incident commander and it was then used to refine and narrow down the search area, an incredibly wide area as we've learned over the last couple of days. So why didn't it end the search immediately? And this is a crucial question, especially when it was picked up on Sunday. That's because the Navy official says the sound itself was not definitive and they couldn't say for certain what it was. And because there were lives at stake here, this search didn't automatically become a recovery or a salvage and remained a search and rescue effort over the course of the next several days after the Navy analysts had a chance to look at this and try to figure out what it was. These analysts also looked at the other sounds that had been picked up. For example, the banging noise that we talked about for the last several days. But officials say that banging noise was likely either natural life or simply a sound or noise coming from the other ships and vessels that were responding to the search area. Of course, the crucial question goes back to the sound that was picked up on Sunday that we now know was the implosion of the Titan submersible. That sound, again, detected at about the time and location the Titan went missing, but because it wasn't definitive, Alisyn, it didn't immediately end the search and that search continued over several days. The Navy, using this top secret system of essentially sensors that are able to pick up on sounds or acoustic signatures and they're able to use these different sensors to triangulate exactly where this was and allow them to narrow in on the search, so that when a remotely operated vehicle finally got down to the bottom there, it was fairly quickly able to find the debris field.",

It's a basically a bomb sitting on the back of their housing.No ROV, no submarine group uses them in their submarines. And I'll take it one step further. No submarine will go near, some submersible operator will go near, they're used in all sorts of beacons and buoys and ocean that are unmanned. Because if they blow up, it's unmanned. But no operator of a submersible will go near a sphere in one of an unmanned equipment to do work on it. They won't go near it because if it blows up, it's like it's a small bomb that will take --",

It was a microcosm of society. There were class structures onboard the ship. There was cowardice, there was heroism onboard that ship. So it really distinguishes it. And what we had here for the last four days was not merely a missing submersible. It was a missing submersible connected to the Titanic. And that's where the passion was. It was totally different than just anything else. And that's why everyone woke up the past four days. having to turn the television on and to see what was happening with respect to the rescue.

My favorite president, Abraham Lincoln, did an awful lot to advance the cause of freedom and conversely the Democratic party was where the Dixiecrats resisted civil rights and progress for years and imposed Jim Crow. So it is something that America has had to grapple with for centuries. I think that we have made real progress and, you know, although I was always skeptical that my election somehow signified a post-racial America, if you look at any speech that I made throughout my presidency I was always somebody who reminded the country of the progress that was possible, that was my brand.

LEGAL ANALYST: Early in his presidency, Barack Obama did not want to be known as the race president. He was very resistant to that until he gave his big speech, I think, in Philadelphia at the Constitution Museum when he took the issue on much more headlong. And I think it's refreshing. One thing that he will always do is talk about the progress we've made. He never says all our problems are solved, but I think it's good for everyone to be reminded we've made and I think former President Obama has always been very effective at delivering that message.",

And they haven't been paying as much attention to the fact that, for example, the African-American unemployment rate is lower than it's been in decades. The campaign will allow President Biden to make those arguments. And I think that, you know, in a media environment that's so cluttered, it's very hard to break through until you get to election.

I mean, I think we mentioned this the other day, that at this point in the cycle in 2015 or 2011, Rudy Giuliani was in the lead.And so, and then after Rudy, became Michelle Bachmann and then Herman Cain. I mean, so polls are very fluid and I do think that, you know, Biden does have a lot to make up for. And I think one thing that's interesting is that, to Obama's point about inflation and gas prices, when they were really high at the beginning of last year and everybody thought the Republicans are gonna sweep the house, when the prices started coming down is when people started paying attention to the campaigns and they realized, wait a minute, gas prices are kind of low now.

So, president of the United States.I think one of the questions that Biden has is how much is he gonna rely on surrogates like Barack Obama to make his argument for him. Obama is a great communicator. But -- but the contrast with Biden is pretty clear. They're very complimentary figures in some ways, but by the president, he has the opportunity and the obligation to make his own case and if he -- if he relies too much on surrogates, I think that would raise some additional questions",

And what we learned from them is that they had, you know, documents, exhibits embedded in these transcripts.What they showed is that the IRS investigators were recommending far more serious charges, including multiple counts of attempts at tax evasion, as well as other misdemeanors, but a total of 11 counts. It's obviously a lot more serious than this deal with Hunter Biden of reaching with the government where he is going to plead guilty to those two misdemeanors. And according to our sources, that prosecutors will recommend that he doesn't serve any prison time. So that was kind of the overarching headline here of just that they were prepared to do this and that there were career officials in the Department of Justice that also backed that decision. Now there can always be differences between what investigators want and what ultimately becomes a resolution as Ellie well knows, they're cutting a deal, they're resolving this case. But that was a key piece of this and one of the whistleblowers was a supervisory special agent. He has a very good reputation at the IRS. His name is Gary Shapley and his -- his main quote here, his main allegation is he says, I'm alleging with evidence that DOJ provided preferential treatment, slow-walked the investigation, and did nothing to avoid obvious conflicts of interest in this investigation. And one thing that he points to says that DOJ allowed the statute of limitations to run out on some of these tax years, which also then narrowed the ability of the potential charges they could bring.",

You know, so these are people that are well regarded and they came forward because they didn't really know what was going on here. And they go into some additional details about what evidence they think existed.And one of the issues was this question of venue. This was investigated by the U.S. Attorney's Office in Delaware. And they said they knew as far back as June of 2021 that could be a potential problem because they usually bring the cases where the alleged crime occurred. So they started looking at maybe in California, that's where Hunter Biden lived or in D.C. because that's where his tax returns were prepared. So then what this whistleblower says is that he was in this meeting in October of last year where the U.S. attorney in Delaware David Weiss had told him, and this was according to his notes that he was referring to, that both the U.S. attorneys in D.C. and California declined to bring the case. He also revealed that he sought special counsel status, which would give him more freedom to bring these cases, and that was denied. And so he said, according to these notes by the whistleblower, that Weiss didn't believe he had the authority to do this. Now that's in direct contradiction to what Weiss has said publicly and what Merrick Garland, the attorney general, has said publicly, and they reiterated that today, saying that Weiss had the power to decide whether, what, and when to charge Hunter Biden.",

There's absolutely no reason this should have taken five years. And if you want to give out the blame, the first half of that was under the Trump administration. The second half of that was under this Biden administration. So slow walked, absolutely. There's no way this should have taken that long. The part where the IRS agents wanted to bring more serious charges,let me tell you, that happens all the time. Every case is worked by a prosecutor, like what I was, and an agent, FBI, IRS, DEA, whatever the case may be. It is the most common dynamic in the world for the agents to say, let's charge them all the way up to the max, sometimes beyond the max. And the job of a prosecutor is to say, hang on. Let me look at it. Maybe some of these things that you are gung ho to charge with your badge and your gun don't quite meet the law. And the dynamic usually is the agent wants to go here and the prosecutor says, legally we need to bring it here. And if we're just looking at the universe of what could have happened to Hunter Biden for tax fraud. There's basically three outcomes. The most harsh outcome would be tax evasion, which would be a felony, which apparently is what some of the agents wanted. The middle ground is the non-payment, which is the misdemeanor. And then some tax cases involving nonpayment get resolved civilly. I had tax cases where my supervisor said, we're not doing that. Send it over to civil. They can file a lawsuit. So he comes out in the middle ground here, not bothered by that part of this.",
