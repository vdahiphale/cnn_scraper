This is the first time they addressed this. What they didn't tell us was the complete story, which is that, subsequent to that search, they had done additional searches and found another set of documents. It's unclear why they didn't disclose that from the outset. And, really, what they've done is created a perception that they're hiding something, which has made it perhaps even more likely that Attorney General Merrick Garland is going to have to appoint a special council, which is something that you're hearing Republicans already discussing. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH):  Where is the raid? Where is the pictures? Where is the special counsel? What is a batch? What does that mean? We know it is more than one.

There were pictures to show how the documents were found and what they were. When it comes to the question of a special counsel, he's calling for a special counsel here, just bring us into the fold here.

There was letters that were written. There was actually a personal visit to Mar-a-Lago by the Justice Department, asking for the documents back. He refused the documents. That is willful retention. I refuse to return these documents even though I know they're the government's property. These are mine, I'm not giving them to you, come and take them, which, of course, they ultimately did. President Biden, it is a very different situation. As soon as the documents were found, at least reportedly, he returned them. He didn't want them.

We'll have wait to see whether there was anything of substance that comes out of this.But as we've been noting over the past few days, this hearing is an important precursor to what is called the preliminary hearing, where prosecutors may actually put forward more evidence, more witness statements as they try to build their case and move this on to trial. Now, an attorney for Bryan Kohberger has indicated that he expects his clients will be exonerated, but, of course, that comes after authorities have already unsealed a trove of potentially damning evidence, including the suspect's DNA, allegedly matching dna at the crime scene, similarity there. Police also tracked the suspect's vehicle movements and his cell phone allegedly placing those in the proximity of the house where those four college kids were murdered. So, again, a lot of damning evidence there. We'll have to see how this defense actually contends with those issues. Now we're also getting some chilling new detail about Bryan Kohberger from people who knew him. One of his neighbors spoke with CBS News and said that after these murders, Kohberger, in discussion, actually brought it up in his opinion and he believed that police didn't have much evidence, didn't have many leads. He also said that he believed that this was a crime of passion. Of course, Kohberger, as we've been reporting, was a criminal justice major, studying for a PhD. And so there are a lot of questions still surrounding the motive in this investigation, the motive in this case, and whether he actually had any connection to these four college students. Waiting for a lot of those details to come out, but, again, he is expected to arrive here at the court, here, in just about an hour's time where this hearing will proceed. I'll be inside of the court. We'll, of course, keep you updated as this case continues, guys.",

But also you can talk about, hey, well, he lived near this area, he went to school near this area. Just because he was in the vicinity, how long is the range for a cell phone to ping.So, there is all of the different avenues to undercut some of the forensic evidence and that is what I would expect a defense attorney to do, to say, look, this is like a puzzle being put together.

What is the demeanor of this individual? How did he act?There is over a month of time where based on what we know right now, Kohberger was going about his daily life. He was going to class. He was interacting with people. All of these statements are going to help investigators hone in on the big question, what is the motive. And then when it comes to the courtroom, the way that somebody acts after this in those type of statements made are likely to come in, in some capacity, and it will show this is the change in demeanor and also what did he do in between that time frame.

They're going to say it's all circumstantial, you don't have a body. The body really tells the story. It tells you the when and the how. And that is how investigators can really backtrack into the rest of what they need to do in order to put together a case for the prosecution. But I could see charges coming with a no body murder case, lots of circumstantial evidence here. But I think investigators are going to take their time. Remember, he's convicted in a federal case. He's going to be serving time. He's not going anywhere. So, there is plenty of time to hone in and get a really air-tight probable cause affidavit against him when the time comes.",

And he notes here that these additional documents were found at the president's Wilmington, Delaware home. Most of the documents, in fact, all but one of those documents, according to Richard Sauber, were found in the garage, a storage place in the president's Wilmington residence garage.

No documents, according to Richard Sauber, were found in that Rehoboth Beach residence. But notable, of course, that they conducted these additional searches following the discovery of these documents back on November 2nd at that Washington, D.C. office that President Biden had in his post vice presidency, that Penn Biden Center office. Now, in a statement, notably, Richard Sauber also says that this review and this search of these additional documents was completed last night. That review was completed last night is the wording here of Richard Sauber.
