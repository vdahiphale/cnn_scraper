No, it's just one special election, but I want to put it in sort of some context of what has happened over the last year, which is it's just the latest big win for Democrats or liberal candidates, right? They flipped the Wisconsin Supreme Court last year. They took control of the Virginia general assembly. They had already held the Senate. They held on to it. They won the lower house there. Beshear, Andy Beshear, the Kentucky governor, and now we have this big win in New York three, switching this district.So this sort of falls in line with this argument that Democrats have been having is, yes, those national polls may be saying one thing, but when voters vote, Democrats win. And I want to also just sort of put this in a context of why this Suozzi win was far from guaranteed. Yes, a lot of people pointed out that Joe Biden won this district by eight points back in 2020, but Republicans swept it in the 2022 midterms. They won the gubernatorial race. They won the House race, obviously, with George Santos. And Joe Pinion who lost by double digits statewide actually won in this district by about four points over Chuck Schumer. And so this win looks a lot more like 2020 than 2022. And how, of course, ditched Suozzi do it? I watched these ads. There were a ton of these ads.",

A lot of the former high propensity college-educated voters we used to rely on in districts like this have gravitated towards the Democrats. They show up for elections. Trump, it is true, has actually brought a lot of new people in the Republican Party, but a lot of them are lower propensity voters. They may show up for Donald Trump. They may come out, and I suspect he's going to do better in this district than what happened in the special last night in November.But when you're talking about special elections, you've got to get your people out, you want people who have a proven track record of voting.

Once you get to the normal, everyday, here it is, it's November, it's the presidential, it will be a different electorate. It just shows there is a pathway.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REAR. ADMIRAL MARC MIGUEZ, COMMANDER, CARRIER STRIKE GROUP 2:  The sustainability, we can go for a long time. We've got our logistics train already mapped out to stay here as long as the president needs us to stay here. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Joining us now to discuss, Republican Congressman Michael Lawler of New York. He's one of the most outspoken Republicans who pushed to expel George Santos. I just want to say this up top, so my mother-in-law is not concerned. I will get to mass today for Ash Wednesday as well. The morning sure makes it a little difficult to do it in the morning before work. I will do it after work. But I know she will appreciate that you've already done that, Congressman. I want to start with last night when you were on CNN, I was watching. You said this is going to be a referendum on Democratic leadership. People are upset both at the state level, the federal level that the Democrats won. So what do you think that tells you about how people are feeling about Democratic leadership? REP. MICHAEL LAWLER (R-NY):  Well, obviously, as you alluded to, this is ashes on my forehead, not crow. But you know, look, I congratulate Tom Suozzi on a well-fought campaign. You know, this is a Democratic district that the president won by eight points. And, you know, you look at the fact that he has been in public office for nearly 30 years, representing most of this district, including representing it in Congress for six years and they spent $25 million on this race. Obviously, I think we all anticipated it would be a lot closer than it was. But I think when you look at all of the polling in the race, the top three issues were the border, affordability, and crime and I don't think that's changed. I think Tom ran a good campaign, and in a special election, you know, it really is about turnout and Democrats came out to vote.",

When you look at a district like mine, which Joe Biden won by 10 points, I'm doing very well in my district, and in part, because I show up in every community, people know where I stand on the issues, they know who I am.And, you know, at the end of the day, when you look at any campaign, it really comes down to the choice between the candidates. And so, I think certainly Democrats, you know, can look at this race and see a pathway forward in some of these districts, but it comes down to the candidate. My opponent, Mondaire Jones was the third most progressive member of Congress. While he was here, he called for defunding the police. That doesn't play well in my district. If you note, Tom Suozzi ran away from President Biden, didn't want President Biden to come campaign for him.",
