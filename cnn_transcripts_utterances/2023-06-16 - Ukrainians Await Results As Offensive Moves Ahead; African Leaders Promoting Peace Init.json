The pontiff had surgery last week to repair a hernia and since then the Vatican has said he's recovering well. Pope Francis has had a series of health issues and physical problems in the last years. The pope has been planning to visit Portugal and Mongolia in August.Alright, let's get more now from CNN contributor Barbie Nadeau in Rome.

He's been here since last Wednesday when he underwent a three-hour surgery and I think people are really excited to see that he's getting out of here.A lot of people were very concerned, 86-year old man undergoing such an extensive surgery, he's been riddled with health problems. But this is a moment we've got lots of people here waiting to see him trying to get a glimpse of them. Many of the patients in the hospital, people who are coming here for visits and procedures and getting out of the hospital today. There's a lot of media here. You know, this is a man who has worldwide appeal. Everybody wants him to be okay. And we're gonna see him momentarily wheeled out here into his little white car and taken back to the Vatican, where we're expecting to see him rest for another couple of days before these important, important journeys he's got in August. But this, at this moment here, to see Pope Francis after this extensive surgery and after this 10-day stay in the hospital, coming out is obviously a moment of celebration for many people. Kim? BRUNHUBER: Yeah, absolutely, and I want to get to -- I mean, he doesn't have a lot of time to recovery. He has that busy travel schedule, as you say. Is that actually realistic, do you think?",

He has surprised many people many times with his energy level, with his endurance level, with everything he's been able to accomplish in his 10 years as Pope.You know, he's sometimes in a wheelchair. He often uses a cane. He's had two surgeries in the last two years. He was in the hospital in March with an infectious bronchitis. And so, you know, he keeps bouncing back. This is a man of utter endurance. And he's also an inspiration to so many Catholics who are also suffering. You know, the fact that he suffers in public is seen as an inspiration. You know, we're expecting him to be, you know, rolled out of here any minute now. And, you know, as I said, this is a moment of great celebration and great inspiration, Kim, to see a man this age, you know, recover from this surgery to be okay, you know, really. And he visited the cancer ward, the pediatric cancer ward here yesterday. There were some images that came out of that right after he came into the hospital, little children in the pediatric wardroom, pictures of him. You know, t's been a very inspiring moment for a lot of people. And, you know, we've seen last Sunday he did not deliver his Angelus prayer in public, he did it privately. And so, everyone now is, of course, wondering if he'll be able to deliver his Angelus in some manner, in some fashion in -- this coming Sunday.

The fact that he's pulled through this surgery, that he's going home just 10 days after it, that he is still planning those trips are on the schedule. He's actually got two audiences scheduled for next week with leaders. The Cuban officials will be in Rome. None of those have been canceled. You know, we're fully expecting to see him in some form or fashion, you know, on Sunday, delivering his Angelus in some way. It looks like, you know, preparations here are getting closer any minute now. We're expecting to see the Pope. He'll come down this little alleyway which has been cleared for him. His little white Fiat 500 here at the end of the row right next to us here is ready and waiting. They've got the door, you know, basically open. And so again, you know, the people, I can't describe the feeling of joy here, the feeling of hope and inspiration that so many people are feeling about seeing this pope. You know, it's hard to describe, you know, living in a city like Rome. A glimpse of the pope, you'd think that that's a common thing. It's not common. People want to see the pope. Anything they can do to see the Holy Father. And you know, we're seeing that right now. People love to get a glimpse of him. Love to get a glimpse of him. And they'll stop traffic for him to have an easy way. No one wants to get stuck in Roman traffic when you're getting out of the hospital. So they'll clear a way for him to get back to the Vatican and to go to Santa Marta where he'll be welcomed with open arms with the staff there. You know, this is a very beloved man, not just by Catholics around the world, but by the people who work every day with him, by the people who live in Santa Marta where he lives, by the cooks and cleaners and nuns and all those people who take care of him. And he appreciates them. And we've seen so many times this pope, you know, really giving an example of what it's, you know, humanity, basic, common humanity and kindness. And you know, I think that's why you've got so many people really happy to see him, happy that he recovered, happy that he is on the road to recovery. Kim?",

This is very much an important place. He's got a whole suite. He's got a whole suite of rooms, you know, up on the 10th floor of this building. And the last time he was in this hospital, he actually looked out of the balcony and gave his Angelus from the balcony. This time, of course, he didn't. Doctor said, don't get on your feet. He had abdominal surgery with a fairly important incision. And so, they didn't want him, you know, to risk further rupture, risk further, you know injury to that. But you know, the Gemelli Hospital is an important part. It's a Vatican hospital and he'll be taken and it's about, I suppose, a half an hour drive down into the Vatican. Obviously, he'll have traffic cleared for him, which is, you know, will make it a lot faster than normal everyday Romans who have to traverse that. And you know, he'll go inside Vatican City, and he, you know, has, like I said, doctors and people to care for him there. So it's not like he's just going home like a regular person would. He'll still be under doctor care there, constantly monitored. They've got good facilities within that, within the Santa Marta, within the Vatican, within Vatican City where he's very protected.

It claims the authorities had hours to reach the vessel, but a rescue operation was, quote, \"not launched until it was too late.\" GIORGIA LINARDI, SPOKESPERSON, SEA-WATCH ITALY: This intervention did not result in a rescue. And this is the point. Even if authorities. went to check on the vessel. As a matter of fact, a rescue operation was not carried out. And this is a clear duty of search and rescue authorities under international laws. BELL (voice-over): Countries like Greece and Italy have long been calling for harder borders. Last week, the E.U. took another step towards a long elusive compromise that goes in their direction. But so far the signals that Europe's borders are closing have done nothing to dissuade those willing to risk death in the name of life. Melissa Bell, CNN, Kalamata in Greece. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And this mark, Xi is very first one on one meeting with the Western business figure in recent years. Now, Gates is in China to discuss global health issues with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. On Thursday, the foundation renewed its collaboration with the Beijing government and Tsinghua University to develop innovative therapies for infectious diseases around the world. Now, it was on Wednesday, when Gates announced on Twitter that he arrived in Beijing for the first time in five years.He said this quote, \"Solving problems like climate change, health inequity food insecurity requires innovation. From developing Malaria drugs to investing in climate adaptation. China has a lot of experience in that. We need to unlock that kind of progress for more people around the world.\" In 2020, Gates stepped down from the Microsoft board to focus on Global Philanthropy. The last reported meeting he had with Xi Jinping was in 2015, on the sidelines of the Boao Forum in Hainan. And in early 2020, Xi wrote a letter thanking Gates for his and his foundation support for China's fight against COVID-19. This visit comes as several western business leaders have been visiting China ever since it reopened after years of zero-COVID measures. You know, you had Elon Musk of Tesla, Jamie Dimon of JP Morgan, Tim Cook of Apple. And while Beijing has been rolling out the red carpet for these western corporate figures, that diplomatic rift has been deepening between the U.S. and China. America's top diplomat Antony Blinken is set to visit China this weekend as he looks to reset relations. But it is an open question whether Blinken will meet with Xi. Back to you.",
