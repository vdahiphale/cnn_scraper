Well, protesters aren't the only ones responding to that move. Theconsul general of Israel in New York resigned. And in the hours ahead, universities in Israel plan to go on strike, while the country's largest labor union, set to hold a news conference, it promises will be dramatic. In Washington, the White House National Security Council expressing deep concern over the developments. Gallant was the first member of Netanyahu's camp -- cabinet to voice opposition to the judicial reforms. But now three other ministers, all members of Netanyahu's Likud Party, suggest halting the plans. Journalist Elliott Gotkine was there when the protests erupted on Sunday and has more from Tel Aviv.

Maybe he's actually going to take a step back from from where he's been heading. But in the end, he basically doubled down and said, yes, I'll be sure to -- to safeguard civil rights, but I'm moving ahead with my judicial reform. I think what we saw last night when he fired Yoav Gallant, the defense minister, was basically a decision by Prime Minister Netanyahu. He is moving ahead with the legislation. They plan to bring it this morning to finalize the piece of legislation in the Knesset, the Parliament's committee, and finalize it and prepare it for a vote on Wednesday when it will be brought for a 2nd and 3rd reading. That's the final voting process in the Israeli Knesset. And the reason to fire Gallant, I think, is basically to send a shot across the bow and to create a deterrent, to tell any other member of the coalition, If you dare cross me, if you dare violate your commitment to my judicial reform, I will fire you. And that is meant to get other people who might be considering doing this in the Parliament to back off.",

They did not say that they would not, as Gallant said, give their hand towards or in support of this legislation. So I have yet to hear of any other possible public dissenter. There are people who are behind-the-scenes murmurs of opposition within the ranks of the coalition, but those people have yet to come forward. I'm not sure. I mean, this. You know, the firing of the defense minister could go both ways, right? It could be the straw that breaks the camel's back and gets coalition members to say while the prime minister has really lost it. On the other hand, we know that politicians tend to be concerned about their -- their own future before maybe the future of the people sometimes sadly, and therefore, this deterrent might actually work.",

Putin added that a storage facility is scheduled to be completed by July. So by the summer, potentially, these small but powerful battlefield weapons could be deployed. But while Putin's frequent references to Russia's nuclear missiles and weapons are alarming for the rest of the world, they don't necessarily mean that we're taking a step closer to Armageddon. Much of this may be for domestic consumption, to show Russians that Putin still has the initiative, when actually, progress on the battlefield has been pretty stagnant -- stagnant. Certainly, the U.S. State Department has reacted calmly to the announcement, saying they don't see any reason to adjust their nuclear posture. Nor any indication that Russia is preparing to use a nuclear weapon. Where this Russian decision will be felt, though, is Belarus, Moscow's ally in what it calls its special military operation in Ukraine. Putin made it quite clear that the tactical nuclear weapons would not simply be handed over to Belarus but would remain under the command and control of Moscow.

Now every decent man should join the war, young and old. Their job is to save Ukraine.\" And Ukraine is urgently calling for volunteers like these.

Just weeks ago, many of these recruits hadn't held a rifle, but their commander, a trained psychologist, carries a Ukrainian flag on his back to raise above liberated towns. \"At the moment, I feel less afraid for myself than for my fighters,\" says Lieutenant Kabest (ph). \"Some of my team have not seen combat, and I have a great responsibility to lead them forward.\" \"I just want people to clearly understand,\" says Akula, \"that the guys who have been there since the beginning are not going to stand forever.\" He says he isn't physically or mentally ready.
