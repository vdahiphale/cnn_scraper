They rejected our direct approaches, ended up talking to Sweden and Sweden talk to us and help negotiate this transfer. But I would not see this as the sign of some breakthrough. I think it's a one off with them being willing to return this private. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We have North Korea offering a very systematic explanation, saying that there was an investigation and expulsion even presenting a statement claiming to be from Private King, in which he says he made an illegal entry into North Korea and also condemned his treatment in the United States military.Of course, that is something that needs to be authenticated. We just don't know if that was truly his own words. Yet at the same time, we are hearing a response from the United States calling this a big diplomatic effort giving a lot of praise to Sweden for taking the diplomatic lead in all of this, as Sweden often does, but also giving credit to an extent to China, not necessarily for diplomatic moves, but for helping to facilitate the standoff, or this release, I should say, between North Korea and the United States allowing Private King to walk over a bridge from North Korea into China. Of course, there are questions about concessions, as you pointed out. And if we look further into both United States, it has been saying about this. There really is no question. I want to read a statement from a senior official on the topic of concessions. You said the answer is simple. There were none full stop. So we have two different interpretations.

They didn't know what to make of him. And I think it took about a month to figure out that he was really of little value as a bargaining chip. And he was much more of a liability. He was a young man, far away from his home, distraught, and isolated.

It's not looking for instability, despite these weapons deals with Russia. So Kim did a sort of a good deed for the Chinese by saying, look, you hand over this American to the Americans, as Xi Jinping prepares for a summit meeting with President Biden the first summit meeting that the American and Chinese leaders will have had in a year since Bali, in Indonesia, when the two are expected to meet in San Francisco in November. I think Russia's cooperation with North Korea spooked even the Chinese a bit. So this was a goodwill message essentially from Pyongyang to Beijing, and then from Beijing to the United States to say, look, we want to make sure we're creating the conditions for goodwill and negotiations. You Americans should reciprocate and show us more goodwill. And make sure that Xi Jinping has a successful summit when he comes to California, as is expected in November.",

And so far the cause of the explosion is unclear. And there are no immediate reports of casualties. This is a developing story and we'll bring you the latest as we learn more about what happened. And in Iraq, 14 people have been arrested in connection with a deadly fire at a wedding celebration. Authorities say the building did not meet safety criteria and the ceiling collapsed after fireworks were set off. They expect to have the results of the investigation within three days. At least 100 people were killed and 150 others were injured when flames broke out on Tuesday night at a wedding hall in northern Iraq. It was packed with 1,300 guests. The father of the groom tells CNN the bride and groom are being treated in the hospital. He blames the hall's owner for the disaster because he says there were no extinguishers or safety measures. The fallout from the crisis in Nagorno-Karabakh is growing by the day, more than 53,000 people including 17,000 children have fled the region into Armenia as of Wednesday evening, and that number means nearly half of the region's population has now left their ancestral homeland, with thousands more expected to follow.

As to reassure local residents after the missile strike the admiral in denial. Nothing happened he says, life goes on. The new clip comes just a day after the Russians released a video apparently showing Sokolov attending a top level video conference call with the Russian defense minister seemingly propped up by a pillow. Russia still irate about the strike on the HQ the Foreign Ministry spokeswoman claiming without evidence Western involvement in the attack. There was not the slightest doubt that the attack was pre- planned using Western intelligence assets NATO satellite equipment reconnaissance aircraft, and was carried out at the instigation and in close coordination with the American and British intelligence services she said. Both the U.S. and the U.K. maintain their militaries are in no way involved in the war in Ukraine.

That is the true power to create immigration policy lies with Congress. The president is very limited in the actions he can take.For example President Biden and President Obama, President Trump all took executive action on immigration. And then what happened? Governors from the opposing party immediately launched legal challenges and that sort of delayed these policies and we end up basically with the status quo. So I think presidents are limited in terms of what we can do. But looking at the big picture, going back say 40 years no matter who is president, our immigration policies have really not worked. We have tried deterrence. We have tried long-term detention. Family separations under President Trump, the anti-COVID policy in 2020, Title 42. And what have seen during that time? We've seen more than a generation, we've seen more apprehensions, more unauthorized crossings, an increase in families being apprehend at the border. So in my view, I think it's time that our Congress steps back and takes a more comprehensive view of this problem that requires cooperation and compromise which obviously are in very short supply in this Congress. And it also requires more coordination between state governors, not just along the border but around the country, and the president. But given the realities of our political system that's pretty unlikely as you know. And we also this reflected in the fact that President Biden only has a 31 percent approval rating on immigration which is, you know, that really is a hindrance to its efforts to mobilize the public behind him when basically two-thirds of the country does not like what he's doing.",
