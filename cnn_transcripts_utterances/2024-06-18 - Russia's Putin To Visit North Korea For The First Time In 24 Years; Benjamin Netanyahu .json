But the Russian president's trip is raising major concerns for the U.S. and its European allies about Ukraine.Satellite images show preparations are underway for a large parade in central Pyongyang, including construction of a grandstand on Kim Il Sung square. Mr. Putin has written an article for a North Korean newspaper praising Pyongyang for its unwavering support on Ukraine. While the White House accuses North Korea of sending weapons to Moscow. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN KIRBY, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL SPOKESPERSON: What we are concerned about, Trevor, is the deepening relationship between these two countries, not just because of the impact is going to have on Ukrainian people because we know North Korean ballistic missiles are still being used to hit Ukrainian targets. But because there could be some reciprocity here that could affect security on the Korean peninsula. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Vast supplies of artillery shells, helping Russian forces sustain a massive bombardment on the Ukrainian frontlines. Russia and North Korea deny arms shipments, but U.S. officials assess millions of rounds have already been delivered. Now the Kremlin says President Putin and North Korea's Kim Jong Un, who toured a Space Center in eastern Russia last year, will cement ties even further in a two-day visit to Pyongyang, such as fueling concerns this is fast becoming one of the world's most dangerous relationships. But Moscow was played down fears it could swap sensitive nuclear missile technology sanctioned by the U.N. for basic North Korean ammo (ph). The Democratic People's Republic of Korea has its own nuclear umbrella, Putin told Russian state television earlier this year. They haven't even asked us for anything, but he insisted. But both countries stand to benefit. The Kremlin says it's working with Pyongyang on a new strategic partnership treaty to include security cooperation, as well as bolstering trade in food and fuel supplies. Both states opposed to U.S. power look set to join forces undermining us allies in Europe and the Far East. It's been more than two decades since Putin last visited Pyongyang. Back when Kim Jong Il, Kim Jong Un's father ruled the country. The newly elected Russian President was trying to revive Moscow's waning influence with an isolated and sanctioned regime. But now Russia is isolated and sanctioned by the West to finally giving Moscow and Pyongyang a common cause. Matthew Chance, CNN, Moscow. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And now 23 countries out of 32 members are currently meeting it. That's more than double the statistic from just a few years ago, and that statistic was a point of ongoing criticism from former President Donald Trump and the current GOP opponent.During Stoltenberg visit to Washington he made remarks outlining several priorities for the Alliance as the months proceed. Those include allowing NATO to take a leadership role in the deployment of military aid and the training of soldiers for fighting on the battlefield. He also said that more costs need to be imposed on China for its material assistance of Russia on the battlefield in Ukraine. But this all comes amid far right movements on both sides of the Atlantic that currently challenged the status quo of the Alliance, as well as continued bloodshed on the battlefield in Ukraine. Now more than two and a half years at war, with war still raging, President Biden told Stoltenberg he wished he could stay another decade. Stoltenberg term is set to expire this year with a top Dutch official expected to take his place. And of course President Biden to will face voters in just a few months.

It was meant to be a small decision making body for the war, and it was meant to be a bit more centrist and to isolate those far right members. But that said, he's going to find himself between rock and hard place. And the reason for that is because those far right members don't at any cost wanted to negotiate a ceasefire deal. Whereas on the other side, he's facing increasing global pressure to agree to a ceasefire, and certainly pressure from the hostage families to make a deal to get the hostages released.",

And this entire time, he has been pulling greater than Netanyahu.And given that Israeli politics have always been volatile, even before the Israel-Hamas conflict between all of these factors, and the fact that you have Netanyahu in between these two places where he's got the far right cabinet members, and also the pressure from the hostage families. All of this leads me to believe that that Netanyahu's days are numbered, that Benn Gantz calls for elections by September, if they don't happen by September will happen at some point this year, and that Netanyahu is going to remain on shaky ground, he's not going to be able, as although has tried to consolidate this power, he's not going to be able to hang on to it, given that Gantz is going to continue trying to undermine Netanyahu, and show that he's not the one who's going to be able to lead the country to an end to this war successfully.",

That said, you're going to see more of their voice come through.But the thing is, there isn't enough support on that side, if Netanyahu only follows the support of this far-right wing and the small parties that make up his coalition, it isn't enough for him to stay in power because of this increasing voice among Israeli citizens against Netanyahu. And then on the other hand, if he only follows the voice of the public and those hostage families, it's also not enough to keep him in office because that right wing Coalition, which is keeping him in office has threatened to collapse the government. That's why I say that Netanyahu really that his days are numbered, he's in a lose-lose situation.

VIVEK MURTHY, U.S. SURGEON-GENERAL: What I worry about and what I find to be disheartening as a parent is that the entire burden of managing all of this social media technology more broadly for our children has fallen on the shoulders of parents, despite the fact that we didn't grow up with this technology, despite the fact that you have some of the most well-resourced companies in the world with some of the best product engineers in the world designing these platforms to maximize how much time our kids spend on them. So we've got to get help to parents. Here's what I'm planning to do with my own kids. Number one, I am planning to wait until at least after high -- middle school for my kids to use social media. And when they're in high school, my wife and I will reassess them based on their maturity, what the data says about safety and whether there are safety standards in place. But there are additional steps that we can take as well. If your kids are already on social media, establishing technology free zones in their day, to protect sleep, in-person interaction, physical activity. This is really vital. That can look like making mealtimes tech free, making our time, you know, an hour before bedtime throughout the night tech free, device, free zones as well. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But I do see like the younger generation of kids who are in -- or parents of kids in elementary school age, they are hearing all this research. And I think it's going to be those parents that are -- more have a conviction and the resolve to really prevent their kids from using social media.

So that not only exploits these reward pathways, but because it's social, it needs -- it's meeting all these developmental needs that are very strong during especially adolescence and in particular early adolescence.

James who's known for his roles in the \"Divergent\" series and \"The White Lotus\" called this new position an honor. At a maximum-security prison in Greece, some inmates managed to find an escape or rather an escape from reality through theater. Within the confines of the prison some two dozen inmates perform the Greek tragedy Antigone, for friends, family, and other guests. According to the director, the men are often skeptical of the theater program at first, but end up finding solace in the small freedom of performing. Since 2016, about 250 prisoners have participated in the drama workshop. Rehearsals, and performances offer a welcome distraction from the walls and barbed wire fences of the prison ward.
