Now, of course, the Biden campaign is trying to shift the narrative after a really difficult week that brought into question the presidents candidacy. Now, of course, this July memo in some ways is a signal to allies that we hear you by laying out this aggressive travel schedule. Now, this includes the president, the first lady, the vice president, the second gentleman visiting collectively every battleground state. It also includes the president going to battleground Nevada to talk at two conferences targeting Latino and black voters. It also includes a $50 million paid media blitz.And notably, this memo also talks about the president engaging in more off the cuff moments. Now, this is something that we have heard repeatedly from allies over the last week, that they want to see the president in more unscripted moments. They want to see him on the campaign trail showing that vigor and aggressiveness that his advisers say is this is the case behind closed doors and, in some cases, at rallies when he is feeding on the attendees and the people there. Now, the president yesterday was here at the July 4th celebration. He did, indeed, have an off-the-cuff moment when someone in the crowd yelled, \"We need you.\" (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  You got me, man.

The campaign has been signaling toward that as an important moment.

They will be watching this interview. We will see them responding in real time. And they're also unsure of what's going to happen. I do want to read for you as well what Donald Trump wrote about this. He really went hard after George Stephanopoulos. He wrote, quote, \"The meanest and most vicious interviewer out there is George Slopadopoulos\" -- obviously criticizing his name -- \"of fake news ABC, one of the worst and most vile broadcasters in the business.\" He went on to continue to attack him. And look, this is a similar strategy to what we saw Donald Trump and Republicans do in the leadup to the debate. They attacked the moderators. they try to paint the media as fake news, not a new concept when it comes to Donald Trump. But they're already trying to get out in front of this interview and paint it as potentially favorable to Joe Biden in the event that Joe Biden does well.

Signs of this are if you have a body temperature higher than 103 degrees, you may have a fast pulse, you may feel dizzy, you may have a headache, you may lose consciousness or pass out, and when that happens, Erica, doctors have 30 minutes to cool the patient's body down before they're at an increased risk of organ damage or even dying from this condition.
