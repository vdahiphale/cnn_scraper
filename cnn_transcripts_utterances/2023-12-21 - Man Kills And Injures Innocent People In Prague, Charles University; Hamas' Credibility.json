My colleague Bianna Golodryga is off today.I want to bring you some breaking news out of the Czech Republic. Police say that at least 15 people -- at least 15 people were killed during a mass shooting in an attack at Charles University in Prague. We know that 24 others were injured. Police say the shooter has been killed. They are still evacuating the university at this point in time. Take a look at this photo. This photo actually, which was posted on social media just moments ago, shows students actually climbing out onto the ledge of a building to escape from the shooter. The news has completely stunned the nation with the President saying that he is shocked by this tragedy. I want to bring in Melissa Bell, who's monitoring these events from Paris. Melissa, at this point, what more can you tell us?",

It's simply not something that we're used to. And yet the toll already rising. There's images coming in of, as you say, a police university that's been entirely cordoned off. It was inside the faculty department within the Arts Department of this Charles University that this shooter killed all of these people. It began this afternoon. He was eliminated fairly quickly, but not before killing. We now know at least 15 people. Now, there is no indication we're hearing of terrorism. That's according to the Interior Minister. Even now, the police chief is holding a press conference. We've learned a little bit more about the man, not his identity for the time being. But the facts say the police that he killed his father in his home village, which is a couple more  --just over a couple of hours from Prague before heading to the Czech capital to carry out the shooting at the university there. We don't know what his linked to the university is or what his motive may have been, but he killed his father before heading to the university. And as you say, extremely violent scenes there that you can see on some of the images that have been shared. Those students that you mentioned cowering from what would have been an active shooting scene at the time were several stories up as they sought refuge under that windowsill. Scenes of extreme chaos also as people tried to free the scene. Again, Zain, I think it's really worth remembering just how rare these sorts of atrocities are here on the European continent. When you think of what people in Prague will have witnessed today, at least 15 dead, 24 to 25 injured, of those, Zain, nine severely. So, this is all too sadly a toll that may yet rise, Zain.",

CNN's Jomana Karadsheh has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) For weeks, this is what we have seen of the war in Gaza. Israel's brutal military might pounding neighborhoods into dust. In central Gaza's Inseirat, whole blocks reduced to rubble, seemingly deserted, unlivable. But there's also this -- the near surreal scenes this week Inseirat. The hustle and bustle of the street market. It's the story of every war where life doesn't stop. It goes on for those trying to survive. But Gaza is like no other place. It's where more than two million are crammed into this tiny strip of land that now looks like it's been bombed back into ages past, where those who've lost everything have nowhere left but the streets. That's where Mutnes (ph) is building a clay oven, hoping people would pay him a shekel or two to use it, he says. Maybe then he'll have enough to buy his children cheese or tomatoes. Our lives are a million years behind. We live in sewage, Manas (ph) says. Every time it rains, the sewage overflows. It's cold. There's no food, no water, no warm clothes. Most here have escaped the bombs, only to be trapped in this misery. Disease and starvation, the U.N.'s warned, may soon kill more than those bombs. Half the population, it says, are now starving, people going entire days without eating. Um Ahmed says she collects a bit of flour from here and there to bake bread for her children. We're all thrown into the streets, she says. They said, go to the south. We came to the south to die slowly. The Human Rights Watch says Israel is using starvation as a weapon of war. It's a war crime Israel denies and calls it a lie. It accuses Hamas of stealing aid. In the wake of October 7th, Israel's defense minister announced a siege of Gaza. Quote, \"No electricity, no fuel, everything closed until all hostages were returned.\" Some aid and water delivery resumed, but nowhere near enough. Much of the blockade remains in place, what rights groups call collective punishment. Sometimes, the lucky ones find more than lentils and bread for the hungry mouths they have to feed. This mother uses a pair of jeans for her fire to boil some chicken wings and bones. I'm using clothes and cardboard to make fire and cook, she says. The situation is disastrous, but I need to find a way for my children. We're in the street because we have nowhere to shelter. Fleeing the bombs, scrounging for food. Now the people of Gaza desperately wait for the moment. They can try once again to live. Jomana Karadsheh, CNN, London. All right, joining me live now to talk about the desperate situation inside Gaza is Hiba Tibi. She's the deputy regional director for Care International covering the Middle East and North Africa, as well. Thank you so much for being with us. I mean, we are running out of adjectives, right, to describe what is happening in Gaza right now. You think about the fact that there are no functioning hospitals in the north and the hospitals that are running in the south are pretty much on their last leg.

Unfortunately, during the truce, we were able and in addition to other humanitarian organizations, just to dig very, very slightly for information to understand the situation.

As you can see in Rafah area, even these plastic sheets and woods that people are using because there are no tents, are costing enormous money.

Look, I think you needto separate the politics from the constitutional principle of it. And frankly, what I think Bill Barr was primarily speaking about was the short- term politics. Trump does thrive on grievance. Can he use this to raise money in the short run? Sure. Can he use this to convince Republican caucus and primary goers that he's aggrieved and besieged and he's being persecuted not prosecuted and therefore you should rally around me? Maybe. There's also what some of the campaigns are saying more privately, which is this is just more of a reason to understand that nominating Donald Trump is a recipe for chaos, if not outright disaster for the Republican Party. But I take a very different view about the legal merits of this case. And I think they should be understood entirely separately from politics and especially partisan politics. People cheerleading it, people saying it's utterly invalid. The 14th Amendment, Section 3, is in the Constitution. It's right there. You can read it. It's designed to stop people who took an oath to uphold the Constitution, who then violated that oath to engage in an insurrection or rebellion or give aid and comfort thereof from having any job under the United States. And debates during the ratification made it clear it was A, it was prospective, not just about the Civil War, and B, it applied to presidents. So, to not invoke the 14th Amendment Section 3 in this specific circumstance, at least to clear up the question if it applies would be to willfully ignore a key component of the Constitution because people are afraid it might be complicated politically. That's the cart before the horse.",

That was an argument, for example, in the overturning of Dobbs. I think one of the crises of credibility in the court, independent third branch of government, is a question of how independent and integrity driven they are, or how much they are being motivated by partisan politics, which degrades trust in the Supreme Court, which is bad for our institutions. Again, I think cheerleading this, saying, you know, the outcome is non- sense. But as I have argued on our air and in our pages, you know, since 2021, this remedy exists, understanding the history around it and applying it is essential.

I think Nikki Haley made that point eloquently. But campaigns are about contrasts. And yes, Donald Trump, there's 37 percent of the Republican Party, according to a \"New York Times\" survey, that will support Donald Trump no matter what, and I'll underline no matter what. Twenty-five percent of the Republican Party say they will not support him, no matter what. Thirty seven percent are persuadable. Trump has been able to corral support because of the intensity of his base support and the fact that fear and greed have cowed people, including especially elected officials, from saying openly and honestly what they say in private about his fitness for office and the actions he took as President. So, I think the more people tiptoe around Donald Trump when they're campaigning against him, I understand the calculus they're making, the math they're doing, but I think ultimately there's a charisma of common sense that comes from a conviction politician. People saying, this is what I believe. And when you apply true constitutional conservative principles, or think about patriotism, think about the Constitution, think about law and order, then you can and should be able to draw a very clear contrast with the legacy of lies that Donald Trump objectively represents. Just in this year, velocity of lies he tells, and the violence he tried to do to the country and the Constitution by trying to overturn an election on the basis of a lie that led to an attack on our Capitol.

We know that at least 15 people are dead. We also know that around 24 are wounded. This is according to Czech emergency services. The suspected shooter was 24 years old. He opened fire at the Philosophy Building at the Charles University where he was a student. Police say that it was not -- it was not an act of terrorism and that they believe the shooter died by suicide shortly after. Take a look at this photo here which was posted to social media. It actually shows students climbing out onto the ledge of a building to escape the shooting. It is the deadliest shooting in Czech history. Fifteen people dead and 24 others wounded. We will continue to follow this breaking news story and bring you new information as and when we get it. All right, the U.S. and other Western nations call Hamas a terrorist organization, but officials say that a U.S. intelligence analysis warns that Hamas' credibility and that their influence in the Arab and Muslim world has actually grown dramatically since they carried out the attacks on October 7th. Sources say that Hamas has received credit, especially in the West Bank, for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners as part of the hostage deal with Israel, and it is now seen in some places as the most effective defender of the Palestinian people. CNN's Katie Bo Lillis, is looking into all of this for us. Katie, it's interesting because Israel had sworn after October 7th that their priority was to dismantle and completely defang and weaken Hamas, if not completely destroy it.

But Lloyd Austin, the defense secretary, sort of summed up some of those concerns earlier this month. He said, in this kind of a fight, the center of gravity is the civilian population, and if you drive them into the arms of the enemy, you replace a tactical victory with a strategic defeat. So, I think it's important, Zain, to kind of keep in mind that this sort of flurry of assessments as we see the Biden administration sort of making increasingly pointed statements, both publicly and privately, to Israel about the need to protect civilian life, even as it supports Israel's efforts to root out Hamas leadership.",

And it seems as though it'spossible that the IDF or the troops on the ground were not informed about the Hebrew signs that the hostages sort of demonstrated to show the IDF that they came in peace and they were indeed hostages and they weren't fighters. But what does that actually tell you about just how hard it's going to be for Israel to free these hostages through military tactics? I mean, the only way to sort of guarantee that these hostages are able to get out safely, it would appear, is through a negotiated truce. It's going to be very difficult and ugly for them to go about this militarily.",

But critics are saying the new rules will disproportionately hurt the nation's working class. Argentina has one of the world's highest rates of inflation. CNN's David Shortell is joining us live now from Mexico City. I mean, these crowds were thick, right? There were a lot of people, thousands of people gathering in Buenos Aires. As I understand it, these protests were largely peaceful. But still, this is a major test for Argentina's new President. DAVID SHORTELL, JOURNALIST:  Yeah, absolutely, Zain. Thousands taking to the street in Buenos Aires yesterday, ahead of this planned announcement where Millet did outline his new plan for the country's economy. He says it's going to rebuild there after decades of failed policy and poverty. I'll take you through a few of those measures that he outlined in his remarks. The aim really being to take government out of the country's economy, which as you noted is in very bad shape. This is an economy with one of the highest inflation rates in the world. So, the first of these reforms that he announced is going to be to privatize some of the country's state-run companies. That includes the country's national airlines, and they've also got some energy groups there that are nationalized, as well. He's also taken steps to deregulate the country's rental housing market and roll back regulations around how the country exports its goods. And importantly, he said that he will roll back some benefits for the country's employees. Now, that's set to be a real flashpoint in Argentina. That country has some very powerful unions who have already started agitating over these announcements. Now, of course, this is Millet. We know he is a libertarian economist who literally campaigned holding a chainsaw in a not-so-subtle reference to what he planned to do to government spending if he were to take office. Just a few days ago, when he was inaugurated, in his remarks to the nation, the basic thesis of his speech there was, this is going to hurt, but in the long run, it will work. Now, Argentina's markets reacting largely positively on the back of these initial announcements. The markets, however, are one thing, mood on the street is another. As we noted, thousands taking to the streets on Wednesday. After his remarks Wednesday evening, a spontaneous protest did erupt in typical Argentina fashion with people on their balconies banging pots and pans. And Zain, there are more protests planned in the coming days.",

Authorities have bought 70 apartments, bought rather 70 apartments for evacuated residents in the southwestern town of Grindavik where some families might otherwise be out on the streets right now, just before Christmas. The government says it's supporting around 4000 people who had to evacuate that town in November. The flow of lava is easing, but the threat of magma still remains. Fred Pleitgen has been at the scene of the eruption for the past few days and is now seeing its impact from both land and air. He joined the Icelandic Coast Guard as they got an aerial view of the potential risks that still remain. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Now, these flights are extremely important for the Icelandic Coast Guard because on the one hand, of course, it helps them to see how the volcanic zone is developing. Of course, this was a massive eruption when it first took place. You saw that deep wall of magma firing into the air, sometimes hundreds of feet high. It's since then cooled down a little bit. There's a few vents that are still active, but magma is still going very high up into the air. And also, there's lava flow from that fissure that's in the ground, as well. Now, what the Icelandic Coast Guard is doing is they're surveying that area, but they're also practicing in case they have to do mass evacuations. There are still first responders who are working inside the quake zone. And even the residents of a nearby town, Grindavik, they can go back there during the daytime. We are of course, right now, in the arctic winter, that means it's dark almost the entire time. So, these guys have to practice all that in the dark and in high winds. They often use night vision goggles to do it. It's extremely challenging flying. It's something, however, that these guys do a lot and certainly something that they also say they need to practice all the time to stay proficient. But of course, the southwest of Iceland has been gripped by this volcanic eruption that's been going on for a couple of days that was a huge eruption. The underground magma tunnel also affected the nearby town of Grindavik. That's been evacuated a while ago but at the same time, residents are still able to go back into Grindavik for a certain period of time during the day to try and get their belongings. However, once nighttime falls, if there is an emergency, these guys would come and get it at really 24 hours a day. There are people who are working inside that wake zone. And in case something big happens quickly then these guys would come and get them out. One of the things that the Icelandic authorities have said is they're concerned because when they first measured big seismic activity to the first eruption that happened, they say it was only about 90 minutes. So, eruptions can happen fast and eruptions can be really harsh. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
