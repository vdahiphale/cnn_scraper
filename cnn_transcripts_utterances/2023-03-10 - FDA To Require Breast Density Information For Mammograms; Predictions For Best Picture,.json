Plus, lawyers for the gunman who killed 10 people in a racist attack in Buffalo are expected to update where they stand in discovery for the case. The shooter is already serving a state sentence of life in prison. Lawyers have said he's willing to plead guilty to federal charges if the death penalty is not an option. And SpaceX will launch its 27th resupply mission to the International Space Station. The Dragon capsule will deliver new science experiments and supplies to the station's crew. All right, looking at markets around the world right now, Asian shares closed lower. A three percent decline in Hong Kong. European markets also down -- heavy trading there. On Wall Street, stock index futures right now also leaning lower here. Markets fell ahead of today's critical jobs report. The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell more than two percent. All three indexes are on track for another losing week. Mortgage rates climbed for the fifth-straight week. A 30-year fixed- rate mortgage averaging 6.73 percent. On inflation watch, gas prices held steady at $3.47 a gallon. All right, the big event today, the February jobs report due out at 8:30, in just about three hours. The economy is expected to have added 205,000 jobs with the unemployment rate holding steady near a 50-year low -- more than a 50-year low of 3.4 percent. I want to bring in Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. Mark, so good to have you on jobs morning. The job market is still stronger than the Fed would like. What's it going to take to maybe cool this off? MARK ZANDI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY'S ANALYTICS (via Webex by Cisco): Probably more rate hikes, Christine. The Fed has signaled -- Jay Powell, the chair of the Fed, has signaled more rate hikes dead ahead. Just how big the rate increases, how long rates stay as high as they are depends on how strong the economy remains and most importantly, how persistent this high inflation is. You know, I hope we get -- this job number today is really critical to determining that story of just exactly how strong this economy is and how high rates have to go, and how long they have to stay there.",

We need -- you know, hopefully, the consensus is right and we get a couple hundred thousand jobs. That would be nice. I sense that it might be a bigger number than that just given all the other data. And then next week we get a cooler number for CPI -- a smaller increase. So this data now really, really does matter in terms of how high rates have to go and how long they stay there, and whether we go into a recession down the road.",

That would be more consistent with the Fed's two percent inflation target given underlying productivity growth.So we're headed in the right direction. And Christine, the encouraging thing there is it's happening despite the very tight labor market -- that 3.4 percent unemployment rate you mentioned, so that's good news.

So here in the United States nearly half of women have dense breast tissue, and having dense breasts can make mammograms harder to read and increase the risk of breast cancer. So these updates from the FDA -- they're required to be implemented within 18 months. By then most women will notice this update in their mammogram reports and they're encouraged to talk about them with their doctor. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

I thought Michelle Yeoh was incredible. And this takes nothing away from any of the other actresses or Cate Blanchett, who is phenomenal in her role, but I've seen Cate do this before and I'd love for Michelle Yeoh to get this opportunity because I don't think she'll get an opportunity again to play roles this unique.

I -- a lot of people are saying that Brendan Fraser -- the weight he gained and the transformation.But on the other side, Austin Butler is playing a real-life person. He did the singing in the movie. He's doing the dancing. And look, I remember watching this and leaving the theater thinking very differently about Elvis Presley. And I thought this was a character in American history that I kind of knew well, right -- you ain't nothing but a hound dog, don't step on my blue suede shoes. I thought I knew Elvis and watching Austin Butler play this role -- it made me feel something different for Elvis. And so when you can take such a familiar character -- something so steeped in Americana and give it your own twist to the point where the family is behind your portrayal, I'm pulling for Austin Butler.
