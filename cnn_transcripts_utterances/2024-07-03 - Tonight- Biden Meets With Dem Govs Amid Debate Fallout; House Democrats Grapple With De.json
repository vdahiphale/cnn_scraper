KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: So I would say, MJ, to your question that what we have released over the past three years, every year since he's been in office has been transparent, and it has been comprehensive.

No good answer as to why he might it has been still fatigued or jet- lagged about when he had that much time back in the states, and also why we only heard that new explanation from the president last night when all day yesterday, Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, had not mentioned that as an explanation.

That's -- we just haven't. We've gotten these six page memos or whatever, but we have not gotten all the records, for instance, the way that John McCain showed all his records, while he was running in 2008. But moving on, MJ, the White House was also asked why Biden doesn't just come to the briefing room himself to take reporters' questions which would potentially -- could serve as a way of, you know, getting the story under control.

It's why we have seen so little of the president out in public ever since that poor debate performance last week. It's been days and the White House press secretary pointed out that he went to a waffle house. He had a rally in North Carolina right after the debate, and then she pointed to the things that he will be doing like that interview with ABC News coming up on Friday, and the fact that he is going to be having a press conference next week.But, you know, as you have heard, and other colleagues of ours and I have heard from Democrats over the last several days, there has just been so much confusion and frustration about why we have seen so little from the president and particularly in unscripted moments, I think the question for a lot of people, including Democrats who have been very much panicked about the state of their party and the state of this race, is if it is so important to prove the critics wrong right now, why have we seen so little of the president? And of course we are starting to see a little bit more engagement from the president in recent days, yesterday and today, he did call lawmakers and he is going to be hosting some Democratic governors here at the White House this evening. So, we'll see if all of that is enough to sway voters, sway people who are concerned, that he's got this, that he can turn the narrative around. It's just too early to tell, Jake.",

You know, we have now been talking about this interview that is coming in a couple of days for a while now, its not happening until Friday. The outreach that we were just talking about, the president has not been making until it sounds like yesterday to key Democratic leaders.So I think that has just really raise the stakes on how much he needs to prove himself in every moment that we now see him out in public, everything that he says, every appearance but he makes, everyone's going to be watching to see, is this going to be the moment where he slips. And I do think that it could be a very different circumstance right now if the White House had put him out in public right away to say the words that a lot of people were wanting to hear, that he's not dropping out, that he's not going anywhere.

You just heard our MJ Lee pressing the White House about transparency? What do you make of how they handle all this, the White House? REP. KATIE PORTER (D-CA): They've clearly fumbled this. And I think that we have to be honest about that. I think there are as many for me, as many questions about President Biden's advisers, both those who did the debate prep and those who are continuing to give him advice, as there are for me about President Biden himself because, of course, we all want our president to be surrounded by people who are going to help him win. And I think that what we've seen in the last week or six days is probably not the course correction that we need. TAPPER: Well, what are the decisions that they have made that you disagree with, that are in there hands, for instance, if President Biden were able to settle this by giving a two-hour press conference, right this minute, one assumes that he would there not having him do that.

He's the best president we have had in my opinion, in my 50 years on this Earth, but he needs to earn the next term. And so I think -- I would just say that none of those colleagues, I don't think they have any more information than any of the rest of us. We're all kind of the same boat.

There are legitimate questions. People have some of these same people were saying there's no problem with Senator Feinstein. Nobody should question whether there's Senator Feinstein for the very end of her term was fit to do the job. And so I think there's a credibility gap then created. I think Washington needs to be more transparent and hold itself more accountable. Don't be afraid of American voters. That's how -- you don't win being afraid of losing, you win by putting yourself out there by engaging again and again and again with all different kinds of Americans and all different kinds of audiences. That hasn't been the playbook of this campaign. I think in the 2020, it was difficult to gauge that because of COVID. But I think here in 2024, this just needs to be in an absolute handshaking, nodding, taking questions, full press engagement, and Washington tries to cover its own tracks and it doesn't, ultimately, in my opinion, work, it just weakens trust in government.
