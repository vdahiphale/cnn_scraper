I mean, he would go and he'd do a little number on this tree and that tree.You know how dogs do it. And this marking his territory. And so that was the first thing those dogs did when they came out. And when I got there, those dogs were in that area. So that is why I believe that it had not been long before they had been let out. Grady was chasing guineas, which was a normal thing to do. What are guineas? A guinea fowl is like a chicken. It is a domestic bird that, you know, we had them. They make a lot of racket. It is like --- I know this sounds silly but it is like a guard bird, because anytime, you know, they just make a lot of racket anytime anything unusual is going on. And if anything disturbs them -- it could be a person or somebody driving up, whatever, they are going to make a lot of racket. So Grady is chasing the guineas. You know, Paul is fooling with Rogan's dog, Cash. Maggie is just kind of standing there, watching the dogs, which is normal. And they were in that place. As the dogs are out longer, they branch out more. But at that point in time, they were right there. So that told me they hadn't been out a long time. Bubba catches a chicken. I am talking to Maggie for just a short time before Bubba catches the chicken. I take the chicken, I put it -- when Bubba -- Bubba didn't chase -- these dogs didn't chase the chickens to kill them. And they did not normally kill them. They did kill them sometimes but it was about the chase with those dogs. And they were proud when they caught one. And you could just tell by the way Bubba would prance to you when he brought the chicken to you. He was proud that he had caught it but he was not trying to kill it. And so most times, the chicken wasn't dead and that chicken was not dead. But a lot of times they would be stunned and they would be just real lethargic. So you had to take the chicken and you had to put it up somewhere, where, you know, the chicken could be by itself for a minute and it would eventually, usually, you know, come back to normal and go on about its, you know, whatever a chicken does.",
