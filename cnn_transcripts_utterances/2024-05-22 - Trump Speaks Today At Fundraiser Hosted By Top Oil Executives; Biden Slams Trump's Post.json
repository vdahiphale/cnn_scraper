      "sentences": "Today on Inside Politics, walking it back. The former president is now backtracking after suggesting he's open to restrictions on birth control. And he deleted a social media video that referred to a quote, unified Reich, if he wins.Plus, minority rules. Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries may not have the speaker's gavel. But could he be the most powerful person in the House anyway? We have new CNN reporting on how he's seizing on the GOP fracture majority to score wins for the Democrats. And exasperated, underwhelmed and indifferent. That's how some swing voters are saying Joe Biden makes them feel. How big a problem is it for the president that voters say that they feel apathy. Alas two top pollsters this hour. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. First up, they say everything is bigger in Texas. And today Donald Trump is hoping that applies to the checks that people are writing him. The former president is attending a series of fundraisers in the Lone Star State. And he is going to have top energy and oil executives there. I'm going to go now to Kristen Holmes, who of course is covering the Trump campaign. What do we expect there, Kristen?",

And we're talking about some of the wealthiest people, not only just in Texas, but really across the country. So, I think we have one of the invitations here. This one, I believe that we're going to show you. This is going to benefit his Super PAC, and this is hosted by three oil executives.OK. Nope, we have the other one. So, this is the joint fundraising committee. This is hosted by a several people as you can see there. Three of them are energy and oil executives. There is also another luncheon that is hosted by three oil executives. The reason why I'm pointing out these specific executives is because it comes after -- just about a month ago, Donald Trump hosted several of these executives at his home at Mar-a-Lago. And according to reports, at one point, he essentially told these oil executives to donate $1 billion to his campaign, to essentially bring him back to the White House so that he could roll back so many of the restrictions, particularly environmental restrictions that the Biden administration has put in place. So, he is clearly trying to woo them for a number of reasons here. Interesting to see how it goes. I will note he's back in New York later tonight. And tomorrow, he's actually hosting a rally in the Bronx.",

Last year, 2023 was down but still record, record profits. Exxon 55.7 billion and 36 billion.So, this is how oil companies are doing with Joe Biden in the White House.

I think the most near-term difference between where President Biden is and former president is on policy was the pause on LNG exports, which the Biden ministration put into place.But if you look behind the scenes over the course of the last three and a half years, I think the company profits demonstrate that sort of oil production in the country, which has been at a record high now for several years, despite the attacks on regulations, completely squelching their ability to make any money. The reality is that when these oil companies and what they're able to send back to their shareholders, they recognize that all the pads will be cleared. And I think that while they have done quite well, and I think they've had an uneasy, but very real relationship with the White House, particularly because of gas prices. What happened in Europe and Ukraine, that has actually been productive on some level over the course of the last few years. The LNG paused, freaked them out. And they were surprised by it. They thought it was overkill. And they thought he was -- Biden was pivoting back hard towards climate policies and kind of climate hawks in a way that he hadn't -- because of the necessity to try and keep gas prices low.",

Starting with something we touched on the show yesterday, which is a video that was initially forwarded and put on Trump's social media account, that talked about what he was going to do in the next term.And in it, he didn't make it, but he forwarded. In it you'll see there it says, unified Reich. Not surprisingly, the Biden campaign, the president himself is jumping on it. Is this on his official account? Wow, a unified Reich, that's Hitler's language. That is not America's. He cares about holding on to power. I care about you. NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Yeah. Listen, I mean, this is disturbing because of what we know about Donald Trump. And so, the idea that this was sort of a mistake, or somebody who didn't know or whatever you can -- you can say about this. It's kind of hard to believe, given his rhetoric, whether it's about dictators, whether it's about, you know, the idea that maybe he's had feelings about Hitler, in terms of maybe Hitler did some good things or having minecon (Ph) on his nightstand. Things that we've heard about Donald Trump's past and his present rhetoric. And listen, I think if you're the Biden team, you want to highlight these instances of Donald Trump seeming to embrace antisemitism in Nazism. And you know, I think voters should be concerned.

He says he's going to do something about it in seven to 10 days, one week, two weeks, something along those lines.And I think this is the case, I think he very clearly has shown that he has a gut instinct, which I think has been proven out by the polls that this is an issue just in general that he wants no part of. And he's tried to communicate that to Republican allies, like stay away from this, don't take hardline positions. The reality is he's got a record. He has a four-year record. And you can talk about a nationwide ban. You can talk about IVF or Comstock Act or whatever. The people who are going to be in his agencies, who will be making the rules, who will be making the decisions on what's happening on the ground level, HHS, DOJ. They've proven his policy in the first term, and they were hardline, anti -- hardline. I don't mean that in a pejorative way. They were anti-abortion.

He said that in his testimony to investigators.And then the government gathered some more evidence. This sort of evidence showing him moving boxes at Mar-a-Lago, and then he clammed up. And so, he's saying he shouldn't have been charged with any crime. He was vindictively chosen to be a co-defendant of Donald Trump's the Justice Department says that's a bug.

After that search, the Trump team went out scoured for more records and found more, including four records at Mar-a-Lago and an empty folder marked classified evening summary in Donald Trump's bedroom. Judge Howell at the time said, this stinks I have, and this is the reason that we're -- I'm going to let you question. His lawyer breach attorney client privilege and get more information in this case. That though, is something that Donald Trump's team has not wanted to fully copy.

And I don't know if most people really understand how critical jury instructions are this -- set of words that can take hours, almost a full day at times. Well, the judge explains everything from what is reasonable doubt? What is your role as jurors? What is evidence? And what exactly is the defendant charged with?And they spent a lot of time yesterday, almost bickering or arguing before the judge about how to instruct the jury. And so, we have -- let's look at some of the things here. There's an open question as to how to read the actual statute of what Donald Trump has been charged with. He's been charged with falsifying business records in this, and we have a graphic of it of the statute, falsifying business records in the first degree in New York law, which requires a finding that number one, business records were falsified. And here we have it, to aid in the -- with the intent to commit another crime or aid in the commission thereof. Now, that language that's highlighted there to aid in the commission there or another crime goes into. The second thing here, which is well, what's the other crime? And do we even know what it is? Well, there's New York election law, which the Trump is -- the prosecutors have claimed that Donald Trump is violated. Conspiracy proven election, we have a graphic on this as well, where one seeks to prevent the election by unlawful means. OK. So now, a lot of what they went back and forth on yesterday was how those two things fit together there that language of by unlawful means. How they fit together, right? And so, this question of what does unlawful means? Even mean is something a crime. And they -- and they argued back and forth about this? Does the jury have to be unanimous on this question of whether an individual engaged in something by unlawful means. Do they -- can the prosecutors just say it or does the jury have to make it a separate finding? Did they have to -- do they have to prove that there was actually a conspiracy between Trump and David Pecker and Michael Cohen. All of these things are -- were debated for hours yesterday in court. We will see once the judge does instruct the jury next week where he lands on a lot of these things, but they're very sensitive -- very complicated questions, and a place where a judge really can make a mistake and can get a whole case thrown out.",
