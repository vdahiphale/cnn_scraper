I think that they were discussing a few possibilities, as my colleagues at \"The New York Times\" and myself yesterday, sorry, this morning, in this morning's paper we laid out, there were a few, like five main possibilities. One would be a cyberstrike. A second, a strike on Iranian asset but not in Iran. And third is a limited, but maybe symbolic act, they call this the idea of kinetic, so an actual bombardment of some kind of site inside Iran, but again, not too big, or resort to the old tools of the shadow war, secret bombings, explosions, assassinations, or do nothing. Those are mainly the main five. The point is that the IDF and most of the security cabinet are in consensus that Iran should not, according to their perception, should not be allowed to rewrite the rules of the game. Iranians basically wanted to show Israel cannot continue the assassination of Iranian senior officials, even if they are stationed in Syria. Israel wants to preserve the exact same thing, that they are able, without risking a regional war. The problem is that while both sides are drawing those lines, there's a severe risk of miscalculation and deteriorating into this war that either side wants.",

They do not believe that these policy disputes amount to high crimes and misdemeanors. So, at some point, Democrats are expected either a motion to dismiss the trial or a motion to table the trial all together. Now, there had been some negotiations between the two parties about seeing if they can come to an agreement to allow some speeches and some votes from Republicans prior to getting to that dismissal point. But they were not able to come to an agreement. And so, we are expecting the Republicans are going to try to offer some sort of votes, dilatory tactics, procedural motions to try to drag this out, to try to make their point in the way that they are not going to be able to make in a full trial, as they have been demanding. So, we'll see how this all plays out. Senators are going to be sworn in at around 1 P.M. today. Just a lot of uncertainty about how it will play out.

In fact, I saw some of those conservative hardliners walking into the speaker's office moments ago to let him know that they're not going to be supporting that package or the procedural vote, which means he will need Democrats to get it over the finish line.

All right, Kelly, thank you so much for being with us. Our television screens over the past six months have been filled with images out of Gaza, obviously out of Israel after October 7th, and to a certain extent, Ukraine as well.

DEPUTY HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR REFUGEES: Well, thanks for having us on the program and thanks for bringing attention to Sudan because indeed, as you've mentioned, this war has been largely under the shadows of other crises, Ukraine, the Middle East and so on. And if you were to walk through Khartoum now, you would see devastation. You would see few civilians out. You would not see the humanitarian aid community in any numbers because it's largely an inaccessible place for people to come in and provide the kind of support that they do with other partners. And you would see houses and apartments that are abandoned because people have quite literally run for their lives with very little with them. And the majority that are on the move are women and children. We see 8.6 million people that have been forcibly displaced from this war that started a year ago, 1.8 million have gone to the seven neighboring countries, 7000 kilometers of border.

Now, Paris and the announcements that were made on Monday were more than welcome. International solidarity and that that $2 billion that was pledged in support. But that those resources need to move really quickly to be able to save lives. You know, we talk about people on the move. People are still leaving to places like Chad, 1800 a day. And what I saw in South Sudan, in the north and rank, people are continuing to cross those borders, as well. We have to tell the story of individual lives that are touched, that are affected, that are lost and the trauma that people are experiencing and why the international community needs to step forward and do more. I think it's quite literally difficult for the international attention to remain focused on a war that continues to rage on for a longer period of time. But this is something we need to continue to talk about in the case of Sudan because of regional stability and really because of global stability, as well.",

As you touched upon, there's a lot of people going to Chad, going to South Sudan. These are countries that just don't have the bandwidth to take in, not just take in refugees, but really offer refugees the life that they deserve. So, walk us through what sort of assistance the international community is giving to countries like South Sudan and Chad, or what sort of assistance should they be given?",

The Democrat-controlled Senate is likely to quickly dismiss the charges without a trial. Now, Republicans voted to impeach him over his handling of the U.S. southern border. Democrats are calling it a political stunt. So, let's bring in CNN's Stephen Collinson, who's joining us from Washington. Stephen, a lot to question in terms of the Republican calculus, one on the military aid that is being held up and whatever bill may likely be up for a vote on Saturday. The other is obviously what's taking place now in the Senate with the articles of impeachment for the Homeland Secretary coming through yesterday. Just walk us through what Republicans are hoping to gain out of what is likely just to be a be a political stunt. What some may say is just a waste of time because the Senate clearly will not take this up.",

Often, there are members of that majority, the very tiny Republican majority that have come to Washington to make a splash and to make some noise and are not particularly interested in -- interested in legislating. That's not to say that the issue of the border is not a crisis. There have been high numbers of undocumented migrants coming to the border over the last year or so. And you can criticize, I think, the Biden administration's handling of it. But most constitutional scholars, including some on the right conservatives who have been involved even in defending former President Donald Trump during his impeachments, say that the allegations that are being brought against Mayorkas do not rise to the level of impeachment. This would be the first cabinet official impeached since 1876. So, you can see how unusual this is. I think that to a great extent, the Republican majority, the far right pro- Trump members of that body, they wanted to impeach somebody in revenge for Donald Trump's two impeachments when he was in office and after he left office over the January the 6th incident. So, they couldn't get the President. There is an impeachment inquiry against President Joe Biden, but it's not getting very far. So, Mayorkas is a politically convenient target. And there is a political gain, I think, for some of those far right members to go back to their constituents and say, look, we impeached the Homeland Security Secretary.",

Bob Casey, for example, in Pennsylvania, John Tester in Montana, that could be used against them in their re-election campaigns in really states where Trump is expected to do quite well. But I think we're going to get a lot of noise from Republicans. They'll be going on conservative T.V. They'll be sending out fundraising appeals saying that the Democrats aren't taking the border crisis seriously. But the Democrats have ammunition themselves because the Republicans blocked what would have been the most conservative immigration bill at the behest of Donald Trump a few weeks ago.",
