It was just -- it was too coincidental. And so that is what -- that was that connection employment. Is it, as a patron, does he know someone who works there? Does he know someone who was there that night? That's what we'll learn over time. But it just seemed -- there -- I've been doing this a while. So the ages of both the victims on a Saturday night does not -- is not normally the age of victims on a Saturday night. This seemed like a facility that had a certain kind of clientele of a certain age, as well as the age of the -- of the murderer is -- struck me as being something in which you would have some sort of social ties.

That was breaking news just 24 hours ago, Justice Department officials uncovered yet another batch of classified material at his personal home in Wilmington, Delaware. The FBI searched the property for nearly 13 hours Friday and found six additional items marked classified. They dated back to Biden's time both in the Senate and as vice president. CNN's Jessica Schneider joins us now. So, Jessica, there was no search warrant or subpoena necessary here, because it was done with the consent of the president's attorneys. But how is the White House explaining this?",

So the White House is getting this message out that they, in their words, have been fully cooperative in the past few weeks with federal officials.So the President's personal attorney stressed in a statement that they did provide that prompt access to Biden's Wilmington home. And it's really clear here that Biden's attorneys, they have been communicating with the team for the U.S. attorney who has so far been handling this investigation. That's John Lausch out of Chicago, and he's handling this all before it's handed over to the special counsel that the Attorney General appointed, Robert Hur. But crucially, Pamela, as you mentioned, this search was not conducted with a search warrant or a subpoena. And that does mark a stark contrast to the search that was conducted in August at Mar-a-Lago. That was undertaken after months of the back and forth with DOJ officials and Trump's team. That was after a subpoena and then ultimately a search warrant was issued all because Trump and his team were not handing over what turned out to be National Defense Information, classified information. And, of course, that's why possible obstruction has been raised as a possible offense in this case. Then you contrast that with Biden's team approach here. They've been making clear that they've been working with federal authorities on this since November, when some of this classified material was first discovered. That was at the Penn Biden center where President Biden did have that office after his term ended as vice president. And then notably, in that statement that the president's team issued on January 14th, they said that once attorneys did find classified material at Biden's Wilmington home, around January 11th, they did immediately contact DOJ officials. They stopped any of their own subsequent searches. And that's when the FBI moved in on Friday. But really to be sure here, the fact that classified material keeps turning up has really complicated things for the White House. It makes clear as well, that this special counsel investigation has only gotten more involved. And, Pamela, because of that, I think the big question remains tonight, is this the only search that will happen, the one that lasted for 13 hours on Friday or potentially will other locations frequented by President Biden, you know, including his Rehoboth Beach home? Will those be searched? So those are the big questions as we close out the weekend, Pam.",

And sometimes, if I'm defending a client, we actually want the subpoena because it gives a certain amount of process protection for the documents being turned over, rather than just saying, I'm the attorney, I did a search, you know, here's the stuff.So Biden's attorneys are really doing the right thing, they're being very careful, because you would want the FBI to come in and collect the information and the documents, so that there's no chain of custody issues. And also, it's really important to point out that these may date back for perhaps decades. You don't know exactly where to look, you don't know who was handling them originally. And in some ways, that really undermines the sort of crisis, urgency nature of it, because no one's been searching for them. No one's been asking for them, but also because you don't know who was around them, who put them there. You, as the attorneys, don't want to be doing that questioning because there's an act of criminal investigation now. So they're doing exactly the right thing. You want to really try and push this towards the FBI to do for them to question people, to the question of other searches. They probably need to talk to some people first to get an idea of where else you could search because otherwise, you're just looking for a needle in the haystack.",
