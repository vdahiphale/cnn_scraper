Their documentary\"Borderland\" exposes the secret border infrastructure across America. Also, ahead, presidential historian Tim Naftali speaks to Walter Isaacson about this fractured moment in American history. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. In Lebanon, the health ministry is calling on citizens to dump their pagers and it's told hospitals to be on high alert after devices belonging to members of Hezbollah suddenly exploded, according to Lebanese media. Now, several people, at least eight, have been killed and thousands have been injured, including Iran's ambassador to Lebanon, according to Iranian state media. Hezbollah, Iranian-backed, says that it holds Israel responsible for the attack and vowed retribution. Just yesterday, Israel had spoken about stepping up its campaign against Hezbollah, but it has not commented on this attack. This is one of the videos circulating on social media. The attack impacted several areas in Lebanon, particularly in the south suburbs of Beirut, a known Hezbollah stronghold. And its hospitals are reportedly overwhelmed with incoming casualties. Now, Kim Ghattas is the author of \"Black Wave\" and a contributing writer at The Atlantic. She's joining me now live from Beirut. Kim, welcome to the program. What do you think this is about? KIM GHATTAS, LEBANESE JOURNALIST AND CONTRIBUTING WRITER, \"THE ATLANTIC\" MAGAZINE:  Well, first of all, it's about absolute chaos and mayhem across Lebanon. These pagers went off at about 3:30 in the afternoon across Beirut and other cities in the south and the Beqaa Valley and even in Syria. And yes, they targeted clearly Hezbollah operatives. Nine people were killed, 2,800 injured. But the scenes of ambulances racing around the city, the mayhem that people have been through, the panic, as people wondered whether this was targeted or generalized, whether they should get rid of their phones, et cetera. You know, this is a city and a country that has been through a lot over the last year, but also over the last few years. So, that is the state of the mood of the country. It was clearly a targeted attack by Israel. against Hezbollah operatives who had gone low tech because they've been the target of assassinations over the past 10 months. And they've been instructed to, you know, dump their iPhones, get off the internet, disconnect their CCTVs. And as far as we understand from initial reports, this was a new batch of pagers that the group had received. And how exactly they were detonated, I leave that to the experts. The next question, of course, is what comes after this?",

      "sentences": "There are several ways of looking at this, in my view. It's either a way to try to demonstrate to Hezbollah that Israel knowseverything about them, that it can get to the sons of their leaders, because several of them were targeted sons of high-ranking Hezbollah officials, and to try, in essence, to cow Hezbollah into submission and make clear that an increase of their attacks against Israel will be met with even further violence, or it could be a prelude to an Israeli large- scale campaign against Israel at a time when Hezbollah is facing the chaos of this this latest very science fiction like, almost, targeted attack against its operative. It's very clear that over the last few weeks tension has been rising and there's been a lot of warnings about an escalation on the border between Lebanon and Israel with very stern warnings from the Biden administration to Israel not to consider a wide-scale campaign against Lebanon because it cannot achieve militarily whatever it thinks it can achieve. The only outcome here is diplomatic.",

And they've been showing pragmatic restraint. Let's call it that way. I know that's not what it feels like for residents of Northern Israel, but you can just imagine what an all-out war could look like. Israel has clearly understood that it can keep pushing these red lines. And if it doesn't face, you know, heavy fire back, it keeps pushing those. This is what I call a game of Middle East roulette. And it's a dangerous one, because at some point, Israel will go too far and it will ignite a regional conflagration that brings in Hezbollah, but also Syria, Iran, of course, and then eventually, the United States.

The question is, you know, whether this spoke to the group of voters that needs to know more about Kamala Harris. They certainly heard about her plans, you know, her specific plan to fix the border, her specific plan to address the cost of living, but maybe what is more important is that they got to see one president on stage and someone else who was in the middle of a two-hour meltdown. Kamala Harris looked commanding. She was in charge of that stage. You watched her and you thought, that's a president of the United States. And I do think that's a question that a lot of voters have.

They report feeling disconnected from their community, levels of self- reported loneliness are through the roof. There are a lot of Americans who are employed but who feel like they don't have meaning and purpose every day when they wake up. And I think we've got to have a broader conversation in this country about why that is and help give Americans access to positive meaning and identity. The MAGA movement is an identity, it is a source of connection and meaning for people. And when you don't have other more positive sources of identity you retreat to negative sources of identity, demagogues who, you know, offer you a worldview in which they explain your troubles as being caused by people who look and sound different from you. So, this is a big conversation for the country to have. It's a big conversation for the Democratic Party to have. But I think sometimes we get lost by thinking that our only job is to try to increase the health of the economy. Studies show that what it really comes down to, happiness is not just your career or how much money you're making, happiness is the question of how good are your relationships. Do you feel part of a community, something bigger than yourself? And I think we've done a really bad job of delivering that kind of purpose and meaning to people, even as we've done a better job of making sure that people have rising wages and have jobs that they can go to every day.",

So, that system, you know, I broadly refer to as the neoliberal economic system, where you basically believe that anything thatwas good for the markets was good for workers and consumers, that America would be better off part of this big, unchecked, unfettered global marketplace. All of that was wrong. In fact, we do need a unique American economy. We do need industries that are unique to this country. We do need healthy local communities, and government policy has to help deliver on that. OK. So, what are Americans feeling today, right? That Americans are feeling a sense of powerlessness. They work harder and they don't get anything in return. The people that make decisions about their economic life, about their sort of cultural and community norms, they don't live in their communities any longer. They're global citizens who run these big private equity firms, these big hedge funds. And so, breaking up consolidated corporate power is really important. And that's what the Biden administration is doing. Our hospitals should be owned by people who live in our community. They shouldn't be owned by a private equity firm in London or New York. And the Harris and Biden administration is doing that. They are right now, as we speak, making it harder for these big private equity firms to buy up our hospitals. That's a perfect example of what would make people feel better. The most important thing in their life, their health care, being owned by a private locally. What else is the administration doing? Well, they're addressing the problem of loneliness and disconnection. People are feeling really lonely today. OK. How do we help people feel more connected? One way is to feel that you've got a community of workers that are supporting your communal efforts to, you know, get higher wages and better benefits. This is the first president, Joe Biden, to walk on a picket line. Why? Because he sees unions, not just as a way to raise the prospects and the fortunes of workers, but also, as a way to build community, where people feel connected to a higher purpose. So, the Biden administration is doing the sort of beginning work of delivering power back to communities and families, trying to create policies that make it easier for you to find connection, but it's just the beginning. And so, the next president has to build on this work.",

And what you've seen since that happened is that more and more voters are starting to see Democrats as the better party on the question of border security, the gap between the two parties used to be about 20 points when you asked voters, who do you think is better on border security and immigration? Now, that gap is around 10 points, because people have, you know, seen the Republican Party is exposed. So, I think this is a pretty tried and true formula. Reach out and try to get accommodation and compromise with Republicans on important issues. And if they refuse, then expose that for the electorate and make the -- and let the electorate make up their mind as to whether they want a party that's just obstructionist in charge, who, as I've said over and over again, talks the talk on things that matter to working class voters, but don't actually deliver or do they want a party, the Democratic Party, who not just cares about these issues, but is actually willing to make compromise and deliver?",

So, we are -- we might be supporting laws that affect our neighbors or friends or family members. And very often, I hear the phrase that the immigration system is broken. I've come to the realization that the immigration system was designed to work just like that because it allows the border industrial complex, which is the large companies to benefit from the suffering of immigrants. If they are able to sell a false narrative that we have chaos and mayhem at the border and that immigrants are the enemy rather than the solution, then it's easier for them to sell their products. We are tired of that false narrative and we want to make it clear that immigrants are used as scapegoats. They are blamed for all the problems in the United States.

The truth is that the border and immigrants are not the problem, but inequality is our problem. And so, this is a direct attack, not only on immigrants, but on every poor person living in this country who are more than 140 million people surviving in the richest country in the nation.

Back then President Obama was called the deporter in chief.

But we want to start a conversation that may be a little bit outside of the mainstream. And that conversation concerns how we can take a different approach. How we can take a radical new approach. In the town that I live in, in the small community that I live in, there are a lot of places that are shut down because there's nobody to work in them. And that's true all over the country. We now know that immigrants and essential workers have been the lifeblood of our economy and really kept our economy afloat during the pandemic. And that's what we'd like the film to question, to address, and to gather people around. I mean, I think that when you meet Gabriela in \"Borderland,\" in the film, you'll understand even more in depth what I mean. She's an incredible leader. She's a local leader. She's a national leader.

And I'm not a psychologist and I don't play one on television, but if you look at the history of many of the would-be and successful assassins, political assassins in our country, many of them were self-radicalized.

But he was describing the edges, Walter, of our political community, the edges, and the edges were these extreme views. And he went through our history and he mentioned different small groups. We call them third-parties who had unusually conspiratorial views, the people who worried about Mason's, the anima sonic party, the people worried about immigrants. And he explained that in our political culture, there is the capacity for conspiratorial thinking, and that it's also always there. It's like bread in the bone. But one thing that he made clear was that it was the outer edge, and occasionally it moves closer to the center. He was concerned about a group called the John Birch Society, which is very far-right, very anticommunist, a group of people who thought that Dwight Eisenhower was an enemy of the United States and somehow a tool of the Soviets. And he worried about the effect they were having on the Republican Party. They supported ultimately the nominee of the Republican Party in 1964, Barry Goldwater. Although, Barry Goldwater himself was not a captive of such conspiratorial thinking. But my point in bringing this up is that he was talking about the outer edges.
