There is some overlap in who both sides would actually like to hear from, including hosts like Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson, Maria Bartiromo. If the trial goes ahead, that's a big if, it would begin soon, April 13th.Joining us now is CNN's senior media reporter Oliver Darcy. Obviously, a big question about what they would hope to get out of these high-profile witnesses. And, you know, the likelihood that they actually will be taking the stand.",

I think he recently got engaged on St. Patrick's Day, and he said he looks forward to traveling between his various residences in Montana, New York, and London.And, of course, we just saw him at the Super Bowl with Elon Musk.

He is facing Brandon Johnson, a Cook County commissioner backed by progressives and the Chicago Teachers Union. I spoke with Johnson yesterday. This is what he had to say about his opponent.

And there's been 225 shootings -- school shootings in the last 10 years, and that's triple the number of shootings the previous 10 years. So, clearly, public safety -- there has to be comprehensive public safety plans to protect schools, particularly in this age of free flowing guns.

VALLAS: No, not at all. In fact, we had a 24-7 hotline. And, of course, that was before social media. Now you can actually create social media platforms to gather intel. But just for that hotline alone, so many of these shootings are actually telegraph because people go on social media, they talk about it. It needs to be carefully monitored. And you can put a system in place where you can really provide students with access to, you know, if they hear rumors or if they hear concerns about just not only potential shooters, but young people are -- perhaps have chronic drug addictions. You'll be amazed at when young people will tell you if they can do it safely and securely and what they will tell each other if you're monitoring social media or if you're creating the right social media platform that that -- the entire school body can access. So, there's - there are strategies in place, especially now, to closely monitor the intel. And then, obviously, be prepared to respond and to react to it.",

Half the -- half of those who ride public transit are afraid to ride public transit because of public safety issues. And the ridership is significantly down. So, clearly, we need to return to community based policing.But what we also need to do, just a couple other things, is, we need to open our schools through (INAUDIBLE) on weekends, over the holidays and over the summer and bring community based and faith based programs to those schools so our young people, hundreds of thousands, can be fully engaged and occupied.
