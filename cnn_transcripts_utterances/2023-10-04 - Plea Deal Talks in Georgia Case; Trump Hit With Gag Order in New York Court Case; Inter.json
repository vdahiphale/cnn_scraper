Already, some conservatives, according to our colleague Annie Grayer, are already jumping in to get behind him, including Thomas Massie, as well as Jim Banks. So those are two members already out for Jim Jordan. But this becomes a game about locking down votes and locking them down quickly. Obviously, there is still time to have these conversations, to have these negotiations, given the fact that the House is no longer here in Washington, and instead will return next week to pick up the speaker's race. But one thing to keep in mind here is that Jim Jordan is someone who a lot of conservative hard-liners have said that they might be able to get behind. But Steve Scalise is another member that some hard-liners have said that they could support. Here's Tim Burchett earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. TIM BURCHETT (R-TN):  He's a great leader. He's a proven leader. And I believe folks would rally around him. And -- but, as I told him, at this time, I am not going to commit to you. I want to hear what other people have to say. It's just -- there might be some dark horse that gets in it that shows that we -- maybe that's the direction we need to know. But Steve would be an excellent choice. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They have gotten their boss into leadership before. And, obviously, that experience, that dynamic is an important thing to keep an eye on. One other person who is weighing whether or not to get into this race is Representative Kevin Hern. He's the leader of the conservative Republican Study Committee. A source familiar told me this morning that he's still gauging support, had conversations with a couple dozen members over the last several hours and last night.

Now, the White House has been very careful. They're not weighing in on the specifics of a speaker's race, but they are urging the House to act with -- in a speedy manner. White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre yesterday said -- quote -- \"Because the urgent challenges facing our nation will not wait, he hopes the House will quickly elect a speaker.\" She adds: \"Once the House has met their responsibility to elect a speaker, he looks forward to working together with them and with the Senate to address the American people's priorities.\" Now, for the president's part, he is focusing on the agenda items that are important to his White House. Today, that focus is on approve -- announcing additional student debt relief across the country. But one thing that the White House is really grappling with in this moment is what will happen to Ukraine aid down the road. It's unclear who the next speaker, will be what strategy they will employ with this. But that is one of the priorities that the White House has been trying to push with Congress and with allies as they're trying to show that enduring support for Ukraine is there. It's unclear whether that will actually get a vote up in the House.",

It's the first time in American history that the dysfunction has got to the point where a sitting speaker has been thrown out. And it's not a good thing. But let me also say this. I see it also as an opportunity. Sometimes, out of very low moments, you can find a new gear, you might say. And what we're looking for is to put people over politics.

But, as of now, only one person, Scott Hall, who's a bail bondsman, has actually accepted this offer. Now, prosecutors also signaled last week that ahead of that trial at the end of this month, they will likely offer plea deals to Kenneth Chesebro and Sidney Powell. Now, they are the two defendants who are expected to go to trial at the end of the month in the first trial in this case, though it's unclear if they will accept that offer. But, John, one person who is not getting a plea offer right now is Rudy Giuliani. His lawyer tells me that they have not been approached about any such deal. And, this morning, the second of his two Georgia- based lawyers withdrew from the case. And Giuliani needed local Georgia counsel to get through the initial stage here. But this move, losing both of his Georgia lawyers, comes as he owes millions of dollars in legal fees to other attorneys who have represented him in other matters.
