I mean, if there's something going awry with the case and they think prosecutors are breaking the rules in some way, maybe they got wind that something inappropriate was done with respect to a witness, for example, then what you usually do actually is you go to the inspector general.So, the fact that we don't have Team Trump either releasing public information about what they think has been done improperly here or going to the inspector general and asking for an investigation, suggests to me that they don't have specifics about prosecutorial misconduct. The one thing they have said is they've complained about leaks. But again, I think if they had evidence that it actually was the special counsel and his team leaking, then we would have heard about that. So, I think that's kind of the PR side of things, rather than the legal side of things in terms of these accusations that they've been making.",

I just think it -- to ask for that meeting would have almost sounded like they were conceding the charges were coming.
