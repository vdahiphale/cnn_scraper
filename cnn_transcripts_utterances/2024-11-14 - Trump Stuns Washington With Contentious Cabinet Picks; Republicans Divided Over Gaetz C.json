This latest round of choices is raising eyebrows and concerns, especially his bombshell selection for the nation's top prosecutor, Matt Gaetz. If confirmed, the Florida Republican would lead the Justice Department, an agency that he has spent years criticizing.One employee at the department said, quote, \"The shock is intense\". This announcement also stunned Congress, leaving Republicans divided. And this now sets up a potential showdown in the Senate and a predicament for Republican senators. CNN's Kristen Holmes is live force in West Palm Beach, Florida, tracking the Trump team. Kristen, how concerned is Trump and his backers about the potential for this nomination to go nowhere?",

Now, it's not just about the fact that they are sure in any way that he could get confirmed, is that they understand that this is going to be a process and they're going to do everything that they can to get him confirmed. But there is obviously always a possibility with these controversial picks that they're not going to get confirmed. And one thing I'll tell you is that they were not surprised by the pushback. They were not surprised by the blowback. And one person described it to me as, we knew people were going to have a meltdown when he announced that Matt Gaetz was going to be Attorney General.But what they are telling me is that they don't believe that Matt Gaetz himself is going to be necessarily the only implementer, if he does get approved and they plan on making this point through this process, or if he does get confirmed, excuse me, not approved, that he wouldn't be the only implementer at the Department of Justice. Essentially my point being that they're talking about how they're going to have a series of these deputy attorneys general who will serve underneath Gaetz, who would be the people who do the day to day work. And that would be part of what they do when they're explaining what Gaetz is going to do, trying to get him confirmed, is to show that there are all these other lawyers underneath Gaetz who are going to be the people actually implementing some of these policies, while Gaetz himself will be the effective communicator at the top. Obviously, as we know, one of the things that Donald Trump was looking for an attorney general, but not just that all of his cabinet positions is somebody who could go on television and talk about his talking points, who could go on and talk about what they were doing, could be a firebrand and a bomb thrower, obviously.
