They're both charged with murder and the deaths of two teachers and two students.And only moments ago, Donald Trump was back in a New York City courtroom, the former president attending an appeal hearing on the E. Jean Carroll verdict. He was convicted of sexual assault and defamation. He says he'll hold a news conference, what he's calling a news conference. We'll see if he answers reporters' questions over at Trump Tower shortly. And happening today, Boeing's troubled Starliner finally set to return home after 12 weeks in space. Not on board, though, it's two person crew. Hello, I'm Wolf Blitzer in Washington and you're in the CNN Newsroom.",

They're -- they both appeared in court earlier this morning for the first time. Fourteen-year-old, get this, 14-year-old Colt Gray listened as a judge explained he could get life in prison if he's found guilty.The teen is charged with four counts of felony murder for killing two students and two teachers. Nine other people were wounded. And only minutes after he was led out of the courtroom, his father was brought in. Colin Gray, 54 years old, sat down in front of the same judge and had his charges read for the same crimes. CNN's Rafael Romo is joining us now from Winder, Georgia, where all this is unfolding. Rafael, tell us more about the back to back father son court appearances today.",

As you were saying, we're talking about back to back father and son court appearances for a mass shooting that has gutted this community and the nation. The families of the victims were in the courtroom crying at different moments during the proceedings, made it for a very emotional moment. Then the son, 14- year-old Colt Gray appeared first, his arms were shackled and he was wearing a green top and tan pants.The 14-year-old remained virtually motionless, other than shaking loose hair out of his face when he first sat down. The younger Gray replied to questions by the judge by saying, yes, sir, in a respectful manner. And he was informed of his rights under the law and the charges he faces. Let's remember that he has been charged as an adult, Wolf, with four counts of felony murder. Some of the victims' families, as I said before, were attending the hearing as well, which made the hearing even more emotional and somber after initially saying that the suspect faced the death penalty, that Judge Currie Mingledorff corrected himself, saying that he's only eligible for a life sentence given that he is a minor. The father, Colin Gray, appeared in the same court -- courtroom less than an hour later. Gray, who confirmed to the court that he's 54 -- 54 years old, could face a maximum of 180 years in prison if convicted on all 14 charges against him. According to the judge, Gray made his first appearance in a white and gray striped jail uniform, like his son. Colin Gray did not ask for bond at his first appearance, where he was represented by a public defender. Gray's voice, Wolf, trembled at times as he spoke to Judge Currie Mingledorff, and he repeatedly rocked back and forth in his seat. Wolf?",

Rafael Romo reporting to the scene.Later this hour, we expect to hear from Donald Trump after he spent the morning inside a courtroom along with E. Jean Carroll. Lawyers for the former president and E. Jean Carroll squared off in Manhattan's Federal Appeals Court. Trump is seeking an appeal after a jury found he sexually abused and defamed the former columnist and awarded her $5 million. Last year's trial was separate from the related defamation trial held earlier this year when a jury awarded E. Jean Carroll $83 million in various damages. CNN national correspondent Kristen Holmes is with me here in the CNN Newsroom. So where do things stand now, Kristen?",

We don't even think one is likely before the election. But just to give some details as to what exactly we saw today, what is going on. As you said, this is the appeal. He is seeking a new trial here.This was a two week case. A nine-person jury determined that he was found liable of, as you said, sexual abuse as well as defamation. They awarded Carroll $5 million. Trump's lawyers are now arguing that the verdict should be tossed because of issues with evidence, particularly saying that the judge allowed certain things in that they don't think should have been allowed including the access Hollywood tape. And again, as we said, the court is unlikely to issue a ruling before the election. Now, the really interesting thing is that this is the first time that Trump has attended any sort of court appearance involving E. Jean Carroll. They were both allegedly in the room for this court appearance. In fact, during that first two week trial, he never even called a witness. Now, all of this to say that, again, we won't have a ruling until potentially after the election. But he did not have to be there today, Wolf. He chose to be there. And as I know we've talked about, he's allegedly giving this -- this press conference particularly possibly just remarks, we know that he gets up there sometimes and doesn't take questions, expect to hear a lot about him ranting against the judicial system because this is generally what he does on days like today.",

So now it is in the judges hands.Obviously, it's incredibly significant if he is sentenced before that November election, regardless of what the sentencing is, this would be the second time that the sentencing is delayed if the judge, in fact, allows that to happen.",

And it's not just, you know, what, you can search on the Internet, Wolf, but whole industries depend on these fiber optic communications. The financial markets do, the energy industry.And I should note that in Europe in particular, there are also cables that carry power, electricity, undersea. So an attack such as this, even on a handful of some of the most crucial conduits, could have enormous economic impact internationally, but also energy impact as well.

But the two astronauts who boarded the vessel back in June will not, repeat, not be on board. CNN aviation analyst Miles O'Brien is joining us right now. Miles, if -- if all goes well, the Starliner will land in New Mexico around midnight later today. This test flight was hindered by what I described as thruster failures and helium leaks. Will officials be investigating other issues once the spacecraft is back on Earth?MILES O'BRIEN, CNN AVIATION ANALYST: Well, you know, one of the problems, Wolf, is the key thrusters which have been causing all the problems and which caused Boeing to make the decision not to return Butch and Suni on this spacecraft. Those thrusters will burn up in the atmosphere tonight. And so that was a big part of why it took so long for NASA and Boeing to come to any sort of conclusion is they wanted to try to test them while they were still attached to the International Space Station. So it's -- it's unclear how things are going to go tonight. The thinking is that they will have a safe landing, but the thinking is also that it's not reliable enough to put humans on there. So in a sense, they're talking a little bit out of both sides of their mouth. We'll see what happens at about midnight tonight when Starliner should arrive in New Mexico.",

What do you make of that comment now? And do you think NASA's culture has now changed?O'BRIEN: I -- I think this is a really good sign here, Wolf. For years and years, NASA has talked about changing its culture. It talked about it after Challenger, and it didn't. And we got Columbia. We lost 14 astronauts because the agency did not have a healthy, viable way for people at the lower levels to communicate their concerns to the upper levels. In this case, the people making the decisions about Starliner were all -- almost direct, almost all of them directly involved one way or another in the loss of Columbia. And I think that that lesson has stayed with them. And that is a very good thing for NASA marching forward. That -- that tells me that the culture may be, at long last, has changed.",
