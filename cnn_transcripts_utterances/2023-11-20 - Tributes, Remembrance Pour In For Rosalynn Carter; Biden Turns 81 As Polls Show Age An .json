And she had an incredible love story with former President Jimmy Carter.And Rosalynn Carter had many passions, as we've learned over many decades in public life. And famously has said this. There are only four kinds of people in the world, those who have been caregivers, those who are currently caregivers, those who will be caregivers, and those who will need caregivers. Caregiving was one of the many causes Mrs. Carter dedicated her life to. And she founded the Rosalynn Carter Institute for Caregivers more than three decades ago to support those who are caring for the aging, ill, and disabled. Joining us now is the CEO of the Institute Jennifer Olsen. Jennifer, thank you for coming in. What does Mrs. Carter's passing and now her legacy mean for all of you today?",

And she watched her mother balance working and raising children and caregiving. And so, she saw that complex city.And then in the lead up to the governor's mansion and the White House, she would be speaking to people often focused on mental health, her other -- one of her other passions, and realized that there was always a person standing next to or behind the person with the mental health challenges. She saw this that was often the invisible frontline of people who themselves didn't have anyone caring for them. And she started to realize that those individuals -- caregivers, were experiencing physical and mental health challenges themselves.",

And as she described it -- she encouraged us to go national to take what we had learned here and to apply it to other caregiver experiences. And so -- and to take the work that we had done with veterans, caregivers, Alzheimer's caregivers, cancer caregivers, and to look beyond those diagnoses and conditions and to support caregivers at every stage of their journey.",

She'd say that there's a need for us to be advocates, but also to be good neighbors and friends to the caregivers amongst us, you know. The person checking you out at the grocery store or the person next to you at work may be going home to take on care responsibilities. And so, today, I would ask everyone to check on a caregiver in their life to see how they're doing.",

He's already the oldest president in history ahead of Ronald Reagan, who was 77 at the end of his second term.And our colleague, Betsy Klein, she reports that Biden's advisors, they argue there's a double standard with news coverage more focused on President Biden's age than former President Donald Trump's age, for instance. And they insist voters are focused on other issues, and that age won't be a deciding factor next November. So, they argue ultimately, that the president's record of achievement. So, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Inflation Reduction Act, other policy achievements. That's what's really going to be front and center next year. Team Biden also noted Trump is just a few years younger than Biden, and have highlighted some of Trump's recent gaffes, including confusing the city where he was in, calling former President Barack Obama his leading political opponent, mixing up the home country of the Hungarian Prime Minister. They also argue that with age comes wisdom and experience, and we've seen the president recently engage in these long strenuous trips, high stakes meetings with world leaders as evidence of his stamina. But young voters I speak to, they have expressed deep disappointment with Biden's response to the war in Israel. And perhaps, Kate, beyond age, that is something he will have to address.",

However, getting these voters to turn out is likely to be one of his biggest issues going into this election year giving them something to vote for. You've seen younger voters express frustration with the fact that student loan debt wasn't canceled. Rightly or wrongly, they're not happy with the president about that even though there were some extenuating circumstances. It wasn't exactly Biden's fault that his plan wasn't able to go through. However, inflation, the economy, not feeling like they could buy a house. I mean, it's really just those kitchen table issues. And then you add on to it the mass disapproval among younger voters with the Israeli and Hamas war, and how Biden has handled it. Right now, just really, you're seeing all of that pent-up frustration really reflected in these polling. Will that continue? As Eva mentioned, the Biden campaign is trying to stress his achievements, things that he's done that is -- that is making the lives of everyday people better, but that's the case they're going to have to continue to make.",

We all use artificial intelligence whether we know it or not. E-commerce, customer service, health care if we have, in-home devices, changing the thermostat. That uses artificial intelligence. A lot of us don't know it because of ChatGPT. And this was created by Sam Altman, who was until Friday, the CEO of OpenAI. He was ousted on Friday. And just about 60 hours later, he now has a new job at Microsoft. Microsoft had already invested in OpenAI $13 billion. They own 49 percent of the company. And now they just got their biggest asset, which is Sam Altman, who is now going to be doing artificial intelligence at Microsoft. And potentially taking with him, hundreds of employees from Open AI, who wrote this open letter this morning, over 500 of them, that's most of the company, essentially calling on the board of OpenAI to resign after what they say was the mishandling of the firing of Sam Altman. But really what is at the core here is how do we, as a society, approach artificial intelligence. Sam Altman was saying we need to put our foot on the gas and make sure that we are moving artificial intelligence into the future. The board, on the other hand, felt like they needed to dial it back. Let's look at potential regulations around this. A lot of people say, could artificial intelligence be weaponized? And that's really at the core of what the discrepancy was. Clearly, though Microsoft with this hiring doesn't feel that way. They want the biggest leg up in the artificial intelligence race to be Google, to be Amazon. And now, they have that with Sam Altman.",
