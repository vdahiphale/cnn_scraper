We are live in New Hampshire.Also, tonight, a Trump court victory keeping him on Michigan's primary ballot, but will the same be true in November? And we have breaking news on a similar case, a Trump defeat in Colorado. Later, the remarkable story of how two men's fishing day ended with them saving another man's life, a man trapped and lost to the world for nearly a week inside a wrecked truck with deadly weather closing in. Good evening, everyone. John Berman here, in for Anderson. What Christmas break? That's what the Republican presidential candidates must be asking tonight. There was virtually no time left before the first contest. And happening now, live pictures of former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley. She is in the middle of an event in New Hampshire. She's armed with the governor's endorsement there, a fresh infusion of cash, and possibly, she hopes at least, one of the most precious commodities in politics, momentum. Now, it is a relative term with Donald Trump looming over everything, but momentum nonetheless, especially with \"The New York Times\" all but writing a campaign obituary for Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, including quotes from advisers making references to hospice care just wanting to make the patient comfortable. The question for Haley tonight in the next few weeks, can she make the momentum not just relative, but real? CNN's Eva McKend joins us now from that Haley event in Berlin, New Hampshire. Eva, what is Governor Haley talking about tonight?",

She talked about her time at the UN. But really central to her campaign is that she is part of this new generation of conservative leadership and that not only can she confront Trump in this primary, that she can go on to beat President Biden in a general election. You mentioned that Chris Sununu endorsement. That is really pivotal here, the governor extremely popular. He is not with her this evening, but he is going to be with her during a slew of stops in the state tomorrow.",

He is going the distance here. I don't know if -- oh, okay, I think Haley is a little bit mad at us right now that we're being a little bit too loud. So, I'm going to wrap up here, John.

We do know that these officials entered these talks with a set of very specific asks for the Mexican government, as they look to kind of pull every lever that they possibly can to curb the flow of migrants at the southern border. One of them was trying to move these migrants further south in an effort to kind of decongest the US southern border.Another step that they were looking for is trying to have better control over the railways in Mexico. These are the lines that migrants take from Central and South America through Mexico to the US southern border. And then the third thing was trying to come up with incentives, like visas, that would allow some of these migrants to remain in Mexico before crossing into the United States. And I think when you look at the make-up of this delegation, these are cabinet-level officials, Secretary of State Blinken, the homeland security secretary. It really does go to show just how urgently the Biden administration is looking for some solutions to this problem. They do feel that there is more and there can be more to be done on the diplomatic front. And certainly, President Biden is highly aware this will be a central issue in next year's presidential election -- John.",

There have been some differences with Biden, but on this issue, they do feel like they have an understanding.But it was interesting. Before Blinken arrived in Mexico City, the Mexican president came out and said that the real thing that could help is more American assistance to Latin America, instead of -- as he put it -- putting up barriers, barbed wire fences, or thinking about building walls. And the other interesting thing I thought that he said was he made a reference to next year's election. He said that the interest in this immigration issue will intensify. And I think that shows you, John, he understands he has some leverage here with President Biden, who is dealing with both the left and the right, as he is kind of in a squeeze on this most intractable issue in American politics. I think when you talk to both sides, there is a general agreement that the only way that these scenes at the border are going to be resolved is if Congress actually changes the rules. What President Biden wants to do in the coming year is apply pressure on Republicans to get some of those rules changed. Of course, he is under pressure from progressives as well who are worry what he might agree to, whether some of those rule changes could amount to the most restrictive policies we saw under President Trump.

And, Margaret, I want to start with you. We were looking at Nikki Haley at an event in Berlin, New Hampshire. And over the last few months, this has been a battle to be the Trump alternative. And that battle over the last weeks and months has been really a two-person race between Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley.

Why do I say that? It's an open primary. Independents can vote. It produces an entirely different result than when only Republicans can vote. You need to look at the 2000 primaries with then-Governor Bush and Senator McCain. So, Nikki Haley is going to have her best night in New Hampshire. Once she gets to South Carolina, it's close. Only Republicans can vote. Scott would know this better than I do. I think Michigan is open. She'll do better in open primaries than closed primaries. But you can't win.

I mean, at this point, Haley and Christie in New Hampshire are begging independents and Democrats to cross over into the Republican primary.Obviously, you can't do that in Iowa. You can't do that in a lot of states. Some are open, but not very many. And so, I think Mr. Carville is absolutely correct. And I think if you level set here, Trump sitting at 60% plus nationally in the polling averages, he looks like he's romping in Iowa. If he does -- and Ron DeSantis has a poor night in Iowa -- what does he do? He might drop out. Well, if he does, those people, some of them are going to Donald Trump. So, even consolidation from the field coming out of Iowa might actually help Trump, even in New Hampshire, where he's facing down Nikki Haley. And then, of course, when they head onto Nevada, Trump's very strong there. They go to South Carolina, you know, Nikki Haley will have some choices to make at that point about facing down Donald Trump in her home state, where he is dominant in the polling. One thing I would say, if somebody totally beats expectations -- let's say Ron DeSantis gets within five points in Iowa -- he will jump over expectations, or if Haley beats DeSantis in Iowa, or if Haley gets close to Trump or beats Trump in New Hampshire, that can create almost immediate shifts in the polling moving forward. But if Trump were to win by significant margins in the first two states, I think this thing is academic at that point.",

The history would tell us that nobody has ever lost, at this point, being this far ahead in the polling. I mean, it's possible Donald Trump could score the biggest competitive Iowa caucus victory ever in the Republican Party's history coming up in January. That's going to be a huge news night for him and provide him with momentum coming out of it. But for DeSantis, it's always been Iowa or bust. That's where the voters are most likely to buy into his kind of politics, at least in the early states. That's where they've invested a ton in the ground game. And they think they're well organized.

So the Colorado GOP, they're a party in this case, so they say they've just appealed to the US Supreme Court.We do expect Donald Trump's legal team to follow suit soon, probably in the coming days. But what this filing guarantees in the short-term is it guarantees that Donald Trump's name will, in fact, be on the primary ballot in Colorado because, remember, the State Supreme Court here ruled that he should be taken off the ballot for engaging in insurrection, but they paused their decision -- their ruling to give time to the US Supreme Court to consider whether to hear this case. The Supreme Court will likely hear this case. But since primary ballots have to be certified January 5th, next Friday, this appeal basically guarantees the ballots will have to be printed with Trump's name on it. So now, John, the question becomes, you know, does the Supreme Court hear this case? They likely will because of this major constitutional question. But how quickly, also, will they hear the case? And when they do hear the case, you know, will they end up dodging the ultimate issue here about how to interpret the 14th Amendment? You know, some are saying they might decide on really a procedural issue, something like the Michigan Supreme Court did, just saying that maybe this isn't for the courts to decide and is, instead, a political question. So a lot still hangs in the balance when it comes to the 14th Amendment and Trump on the ballot.",

They're saying, \"The Court should not permit the defendant to turn the courtroom into a forum in which he propagates irrelevant disinformation, and should reject his attempt to inject politics into this proceeding.\" And really, John, this filing from Jack Smith's team is also notable because all of the proceedings right now, they're on hold, they're on pause, while the DC Circuit Court of Appeals considers this immunity argument. They'll hear the case on January 9th.

Instead, what the Michigan Supreme Court did today, they wrote a really short order and they said that they stood by what the lower courts had done in dismissing the case. They concluded that this was really just a political question about whether the 14th Amendment applies to Trump. It should be decided by political bodies, by Congress. And you know, as I mentioned before, that's a lot of what legal scholars are saying, as what the U.S. Supreme Court actually might do. They might not rule on the ultimate issue here.
