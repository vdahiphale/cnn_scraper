One person has died, more than 70 were injured onboard a Singapore Airlines flight encountered severe turbulence on a flight from London to Singapore. The Boeing 777 jet carrying 211 passengers and 18 crew members made an emergency landing in Thailand as a result. Six people critically injured by the turbulence, which cause, as you could see there, significant damage inside the plane. Parts of luggage compartments collapsed, those oxygen masks down, food and glass strewn everywhere. Joining me now, CNN's Richard Quest. He's covered aviation for years. So, Richard, help explain to us what we know -- and I know there's a lot more investigation that has to be done -- about what exactly this plane is likely to have encountered, and then how it behaved after encountering that weather.",

And what happens is the plane then starts to move around. It starts to fall and it starts to climb.Now, Jim, there's our aircraft moving along as you can see. You can see the damage that happened. But when you look at the chart, when you actually see what took place, you realize that the actual aircraft movements were not that big. On the left side -- you can't see it on your screen -- but on the left to the actual amounts it moves. The plane is going up and down by about 150 feet at a time. Sometimes it goes up 75, then it comes down 50, then it goes up 135, comes down 200, all within the space of 90 seconds. These are not massive differences in altitude, but the violence comes from the velocity. Suddenly, the plane is going up 900 feet a minute, then its dropping by 2,000 feet a minute, then it's going up 500 feet a minute, then its dropping by 500 feet a minute. And it is that fierceness and ferocity that causes the damage. People either not with their seatbelt, the galleys are open, because they're about to serve a meal. And just like you can imagine, you fall, you see -- if your -- it's not through with the plane, you fall, you hit your head, and that's what  happened.",

When the ground heats up, or the oceans heat up.What happens? Thermal currents rise, when thermal currents rise, then you get more turbulence. You get cumulus-nimbus cloud formations building up. You get stormed formations. If you're landing in Atlanta Hartsfield in the summer, you will bounce around if it's late afternoon, same in Washington, D.C., because intense heat and weather creates different thermal waves and thermal movements. And the plane bounces around. Now extrapolate that much greater and you start to see why this is so serious. What could have been done here? Well, initially, could that be better information on the weather ahead. Number two, how -- did people have seat belts fastened if they're in the seats? The crew were serving meals, should they have been warned? This sort of stuff will happen.

Defense rested today after calling just two witnesses for less than two hours of testimony. That after prosecutors called some 20 witnesses, who testified for more than 50 hours in total. Jurors now will have to weigh whether the prosecution has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Donald Trump illegally covered up hush money payments to Stormy Daniels because he did not want her affair allegations to come to light before the 2016 presidential election.

Jim, good to be with you and Areva.So it's limited in terms of what the judges leeway is because the judge has to follow the law and we know what the law is as it relates to what the charges are here. There are 34 counts. The issue is the fraudulent of the business records such as the ledgers, such as the invoices, such as the checks. Now, with regard to that, the law speaks to the issue of knowingly, knowingly, right, giving the indication that something is fraudulent. That means that your intent, it's your goal, it's your objective, and so that's as to the state of mind. That is not the only issue. Then you have to jump and take the leap if it's to be a felony with respect to okay, now that you've knowingly proved or not as to whether or not the defendant in this case is knowingly engaged in the fraudulent problem offering of business records. What was the intent or purpose of that? Was it for the intent, goal, objective purpose of furthering some other objective, right, or engaging in other legality, concealing in some other way. So I explain it like that, Jim, because you're limited with respect to what the law says. Now, Jessica was very properly and excellently explaining the issue that you have to now make this relatable to the jury and how do you do that? You do that by having a conference as the attorneys are having and trying to get a sense from both sides with respect to what the jury should know. Last point, in doing that, very rarely is there agreement between the attorneys and oftentimes then it's left up to the judge to oppose what they think. Last last point, and that's this, we know that the jury is the ultimate or assessor of what factually happen or did not happen. The judge is the one who pronounces the law. Hence, the judge will instruct the jury on what law to follow with respect to applying the facts as they believe them to be two, the law, right, as ultimately the judge says it is, and that's what's happening right now.",

The reality is, is this so much other evidence we've given you that corroborates what he says. And when you talk about what we didn't corroborate, we corroborated everything because what in the world would the president not be looking to hide a story for when the realities are Access Hollywood came out, that's damaging. He was involved. We know that, as it relates to them giving the prosecutions argument. Relating to the Karen McDougal situation, he knew all about that, but he doesn't know about this. He's writing checks, he doesn't know about it? To the reverse, the defense is going to argue, look, Michael Cohen can't be trusted. It's all about Michael Cohen. It's all about his credibility. He's a theft, he's a liar, he's a criminal, he's a crook. Are you kidding me? If you don't believe Michael Cohen, you have to acquit.

That act, which expanded coverage for veterans exposed to burn pits, as well as Agent Orange and other toxic substances during their service was signed into law back in 2022. Since then, the Biden administration has approved more than 1 million claims for veterans under the act. The issue is very personal for President Biden. The event comes just days before the ninth anniversary of his son, Beau's death and he has often said he believes Beau developed brain cancer because of his own exposure to burn pits while he was deployed serving in Iraq. CNN's Camila DeChalus joins me now. This is certainly an issue very much close to President Biden's heart, but it's also for him an outreach I imagine to veterans and to other voters.",

Now, I was there a few months ago and a lot of these voters, I spoke to when Biden -- when Trump was actually trying to make their appeal to them.They were going after Nikki Haley, saying that was a candidate that they wanted to put their support. But now that she's out of this race, Biden knows that he needs to make more of a concerted effort in the state, even though it goes blue. But just to really do outreach. And the fact that he's talking about this topic as you mentioned, this is a personal issue for him. He talked about his son, Beau, and oftentimes really me that correlation about how he believes that his son's brain cancer was closely associated to his time in the military service when he is exposed to the burn pits. So this is an issue that not only it is a topic where you can say this is what we've done during our administration. This is a type of legislation that we passed, but it's also something that's really close to his heart and he really wants to make that connection with voters.",

Then, just two days before this updated ChatGPT launched, just over for a week ago, she said Altman got back in touch with their agent and asked her to reconsider. She said she didn't have time to think about it and then the company went ahead and launched it anyway.She said she was shocked and angered and in disbelief to hear this voice that in her words was so eerily similar to her own. And it wasn't just Scarlett Johansson who thought this. There were many, many people who were comparing this updated ChatGPT voice called Sky to Johansson's voice and specifically Johansson's voice in the 2013 film \"Her\", which, of course, is a quasi-dystopian film about the relationship between humans and technology. Now, OpenAI says that this was never Johansson voice. Altman said in a statement last night that they used a separate voice actress, but that they ultimately decided to pause this Sky voice out of respect for Johansson. But nonetheless, not a good look for OpenAI here. And this really gets at the heart of what so many in Hollywood, as well as writers and artists have been concerned about this fear that A.I. could be using there work or their likeness for training.
