The 11th atmospheric river so far this season is expected to hit in the coming hours. Forecasters are predicting this latest storm to bring up to 6 inches of rain for parts of Northern and Central California. Areas already facing severe flooding. More than 15 million people remain under flood watches from California to Nevada and evacuation orders are already in place for parts of Monterey County after a levee breach flooded communities and threatened homes. Sheriff deputies are going door-to-door to help people to safety. And first responders are pulling dozens from the rising waters as rivers of water rush through the communities. CNN's Mike Valerio is in hard-hit Monterey County. It looks like you're standing in a lake. But then, at the same time, it looks like that's like a downtown area.",

And we thought, Fredricka, we are asking ourselves, would this water recede, but this water has been here for more than 24 hours. In fact, the water level has gone up because we have this water. We have this levee breach on the Pajaro River that has not been sealed as of yet.So if you look over to my right, it is still pretty tough to get in and out of this apartment building unless you have waders. And take a look at this iPhone video that we shot just a few minutes ago, before coming on the air, just walking up and down some of these neighborhood streets. This explains the National Guard rescues that we saw yesterday because in some of these neighborhoods, well, you don't just see water coming up to the passenger and driver doors, you see water channelized into these narrow neighborhood streets and starting to rush past these front doors and really gain speed in terms of the current. But, you know, in terms of rushing water, we have new video in this morning, Fred, of an amazing rescue close to Salinas. A man was trapped in his car, found safety on this island in the middle of the Salinas River and watch as he was rescued, pulled into this helicopter launched by California Highway Patrol. Watch.

However, with the westerly wind across the Pacific Northwest, and the northern coastline of California, but this is not the next AR. We're waiting tor that heavy moisture to really crank up in here which is why we still have flood watches still in effect, 15 million over -- 15 million under some sort of flood watch. And we're watching these slowly expand. I'm sure they will within the next 24 hours as that forecast holds quite a bit of rain.Sunday night into Monday, notice the heavier rain really starting to ramp up, not only then but again rolling into Tuesday morning. Where the heaviest of the rain really starts to set in. And this is where we can really tap into that moisture. [11:05:01] Talking about picking up four to six inches of rain. Widespread along the northern coastline and then stretching down into the southern coastline of California as that low begins to make its way further south, which is why we have that moderate risk for flooding along the north coastline on Monday. But again, along the foothills of the Sierra Nevada, Tuesday, and then pushing down into San Luis and even L.A., Tuesday into Wednesday. Not only the moisture in the form of rain, but we've had quite a bit of snowfall. That snowpack still rather impressive here on satellite. Notice the feet of snowfall that we've picked up. It reaches well past the roofline of some of these homes and unfortunately many homes roofs have been caving in. And on top of that, is well above average even after all of the rainfall that we've been dealing with. So with that rain, we've had to release some of this from the dams. This is just yesterday from Lake Oroville, impressive amounts of water being released and the reservoirs still above average. And we're watching this relieve the drought just over a matter of two months time. But the problem is, Fredricka, we still need some ground water and that is going to take some time. We need this to slow down, not just happen like it is going to happen over a short amount of time.",

      "sentences": "So, Fred, these three women left a small South Texas town of Penitas, Texas which right at the U.S.- Mexico border. In fact, three -- two of those three women actually resided in that town. They crossed the border at Mission, Texas and then as you mentioned they were heading to the city of Montemorelos in Nuevo Leon.These are their names, Marina Perez Rios, Maritza Trinidad Perez Rios, and their friend, Dora Alicia Cervantes Saenz. So the husband of one of the two sisters last spoke to them over that weekend after February 24th according to investigators. He grew increasingly worried when he was unable to get in touch with them and that is when he turned to investigators there in Penitas, Texas on the 27th of February. The police department there then turning to the FBI who have not at least responded to a request for comment right now in terms this of investigation. Right now, the U.S. State Department saying that they are aware of reports of three U.S. citizens possibly missing in Mexico, but they could not go into greater detail there about these women. But let me just give a quick layout of the land, Fred, about -- to give you an idea of where these women were last seen. So if you see on a map, you can actually see in Mexico, some of those states that the State Department has actually labelled as placed that Americans should not travel to. Now, in order to get to Nuevo Leon, you would have to drive through the Mexican state of Tamaulipas. If that sounds familiar, that's actually where Matamoros is, which is where that -- where those -- where that kidnapping took place of those tourists a -- a few days ago. So that is certainly going to be something that is going to be a concern. But authorities are basically going to be calling on the public on both sides of the border for any kind of information about these three women. Again, what we know is two of them actually resided there in Texas in Penitas, while the third, Dora Alicia Cervantes Saenz, was a friend of theirs and they were last seen, again, crossing the International Boundary in Mission, Texas. So still a lot of questions about this case and these three women just the latest to go missing in Mexico.",

At last night's Gridiron Club Dinner in Washington, D.C., the former vice president said, I'm quoting now, \"President Trump was wrong. I had no right to overturn the election and his reckless words endangered my family and everyone at the Capitol that day, and I know that history will hold Donald Trump accountable.\"Pence also chastised Republicans who have minimized the insurrection. And who have downplayed the people who entered the Capitol by characterizing them as tourists. The comments come after Pence's attorneys filed a motion last week asking a judge to block a federal grand jury subpoena for his testimony related to January 6th. President Biden meantime will head west this week as he gears up for potential re-election bid. The president plans to meet with his U.K. and Australian counterparts. He will also visit the site of a recent mass shooting and give remarks on gun violence. Meantime, back in Washington, Democratic leaders fear years of negativity toward Vice President Kamala Harris could pose a political problem ahead of 2024, according to new CNN reporting. That negativity fueled after comments Senator Elizabeth Warren made during an interview with a Boston radio station in January. When asked whether President Biden should run again, Warren was enthusiastic in her support. But when asked about whether Harris should be part of the ticket, this is what Warren had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA): I really wanted to defer to what makes Biden comfortable on his team. I've known Kamala for a long time. I like Kamala. I knew her back when she was -- when she was an attorney general, and I was still teaching, and we worked on the housing crisis together. So we go way back. But they need -- they have to be a team and my sense is they are. I don't mean that by suggesting I think there are any problems. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

She is the first woman vice president and the first South Asian vice president. Really, those three things together have made her historic in this role. But have also put her on a different pedestal when it comes to deciding whether or not she has the capability of in the future running for president as we know that she has those type of political ambitions. But here, the White House has tried to wrap their -- wrap their arms around Harris and embrace her and put per into positions that are -- feel supportive and that is what her allies have wanted to see. I'm talking about her abortion platform, being the leading messenger for abortion. Allies have really respected what she's done in that role. The White House says that she's been essential in that role. Of course, in the first two years of her vice presidency, we talked a lot about how she had very difficult things on her portfolio, like the root causes of migration, and like voting rights. But here, they really want to see the White House celebrate the vice president who they feel is kind of an -- in unwinnable position. Of course, if she shines too much, she overshines the president, but if she doesn't shine enough, she doesn't live up to that historic role. So it's a balancing act that this White House and the vice president's office is playing.

So that's the first point.The second is a Chinese Communist Party cell, a CCP cell is embedded within ByteDance. And it turns out that the editor in chief of ByteDance is the Secretary of that cell. And he has said that all of its products must adhere to correct political attitudes. And so what that practically means is that the CCP ultimately controls the content on TikTok.
