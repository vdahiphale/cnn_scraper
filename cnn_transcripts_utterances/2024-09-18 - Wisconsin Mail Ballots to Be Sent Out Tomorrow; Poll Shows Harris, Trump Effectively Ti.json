There's an MIT performance index that ranks electoral administration systems, Wisconsin is consistently in the top three. So I'm confident that everyone who cast a ballot will know that their ballot will be counted. The question is how many folks can we make sure cast ballots for Harris? Because Wisconsin is the land of the nail-biter.",

I'll say it again, it was only 21,000 votes that President Biden won by in 2020. And if you look at a poll from earlier this month, it is incredibly close. Kamala Harris, there has 51; Donald Trump has 49, but it is still very much in the margin of error. What is your confidence level right now in Democrats taking that state?",

And that's two or three votes per precinct across the state. And the other thing is that in both 2016 and 2020, the polls had us up significantly and then it came down to these razor-thin margins. So right now, we are up in all the major polls in Wisconsin, but we expect this to be hyper tight. We expect this race to be a photo finish, and we are going to organize like that next volunteer shift, that next donation at wisdoms.org (ph), that next phone-banking call could be the one that tips the entire state, that tips the entire country.",

He was in Wausau. He was in Superior, Wisconsin. They're not going to skip Wisconsin, they are in all parts of the state.
