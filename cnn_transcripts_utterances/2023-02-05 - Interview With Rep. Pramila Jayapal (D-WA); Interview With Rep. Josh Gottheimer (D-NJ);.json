I'm Jake Tapper in Washington, where the state of our union is deflated.The U.S. military is recovering the remnants of a 90-foot-long suspected Chinese spy balloon that was shot down just off the South Carolina coast on Saturday after an F-22 Raptor's AIM-9X missile popped the balloon after its weeklong mission gathering intelligence over the United States and Canada. Defense Secretary Austin said yesterday that President Biden on Wednesday ordered that the balloon be taken down as soon as safely possible, and that, to avoid any risk to Americans, the Pentagon waited until the balloon drifted just off U.S. soil to act. Underlining the embarrassment of this all for President Biden on the eve of the State of the Union address, a senior administration official acknowledged that the U.S. believes the Chinese government was able to maneuver the balloon and was using it to try and monitor sensitive sites across the country. The Chinese government is responding to the downing of their balloon with -- quote -- \"strong dissatisfaction and protest\" -- unquote -- accusing the U.S. of overreacting to what they claim was a civilian aircraft that veered off course by accident and warning they reserve the right to -- quote -- \"make further unnecessary reaction\" -- unquote. But the Pentagon said a similar spy balloon had been spotted flying over Latin America. This incident prompted Secretary of State Antony Blinken to cancel a long-planned visit to China this weekend, unraveling months of cautious outreach and pushing the two nations closer towards a collision. And joining me now is the secretary of the Department of Transportation, Pete Buttigieg. Mr. Secretary, good to see you. Thanks so much for being here. Really appreciate it.

The president called for this to be dealt with in a way that balanced all of the different risks. That's exactly what happened. The military did a terrific job. From our perspective in the DOT, of course, our main concern is the safety of the national airspace. This thing was above where flight operations happen, and so any debris would have passed through that national airspace. Look, the FAA works very closely with the Pentagon, in this case, had to do ground stops on those airports on the Eastern Seaboard, close off some of the airspace to make sure that everything was safe and secure during the operation.

I'm Jake Tapper.Many Republicans reacted with outrage after President Biden waited for the suspected Chinese spy balloon to leave the continental United States before shooting it down, for safety reasons, they said, at the Pentagon's guidance. Joining us now is the vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. Senator, thanks so much for joining us. So you have said the President Biden should have shot the balloon down earlier. The defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, said -- quote -- \"After careful analysis, U.S. military commanders had determined to downing the balloon while over land posed an undue risk to people across a wide area due to the size and altitude of the balloon and its surveillance payload.\" And, as you heard Secretary Buttigieg just a few minutes ago said that the debris field after the balloon was shot down was about seven miles' long. Should President Biden have ordered that it be shot down anyway, regardless of that risk? SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL):  No, not regardless of the risk. First of all, they can track these things. I would hope you can track a slow moving balloon that clearly is headed here, as you can see from its trajectory. I think that's one of the things we will learn this week, is how soon, how late into January did they already know that there's this high-altitude balloon and what its trajectory was and where it was headed, and why didn't they take action at that time? That's number one. I think the other thing that we need to know about it and understand is, why did it take so long for them to disclose this to the American public? I don't think the trajectory of where this balloon was going was a mystery. I think, pretty early on, they probably -- because of the prevailing winds, because of the direction that it was headed, I think it was pretty clear that this thing was going to enter the Northwest in Montana, in Idaho, move its way down the Midwest and exit the Eastern Seaboard just off the Carolinas. I mean, that's an unprecedented flight path. And why did it wait until Wednesday to notify -- or Thursday to talk about it the American people, knowing people were going to be seeing this thing?",

And that's why I go back to the whole point of the message. There are probably other ways that China could acquire whatever they acquired using this balloon. I may be wrong. There may be some unique attributes to it that I'm -- that I'm not aware of yet, but we will learn more about this week. But I think, more than anything else, beyond just the ability to collect information, it is the ability to send a clear message, and that is that we have the ability to do this, and America can't do anything about it. If they're not going to be able to stop a balloon from flying over U.S. airspace, how is America going to come to your aid if we invade Taiwan or take land from India or take islands from the Philippines and Japan? And I think the fact that they would do that leading up to State of the Union, leading up to what was then Blinken's scheduled visit, none of that is a coincidence.

What we have never seen, what is unprecedented, and whoever the source was at the Department of Defense would have to acknowledge this, what is unprecedented is a balloon flight that entered over Idaho and flew over Montana, over all these sensitive military installations, air force bases, ICBM fields, right across the middle of the country. That has never happened before. That is unprecedented. That it flew briefly over some part of the U.S. or continental U.S., that's one thing. But what we saw this week, it's unprecedented.

And so they didn't -- so they didn't want to have to talk about it. But why didn't the president go on television? He has the ability to convene the country in cameras, and basically explain what we're dealing with here and why he's made the decisions he's making and what they intend to do. I don't understand, once they went public with it, knowing the amount of interest this was going to generate, presidents have the ability to go before camera, go before the nation and basically explain these things early on. And his failure to do so is -- I don't understand that. I don't understand why he wouldn't do that. And that is the beginning of dereliction of duty. And the second is, we have to act swiftly on these things. I think that's part of the -- one of the things the Chinese are trying to message. And that is, the U.S. had to see this coming and decided they couldn't or wouldn't do anything about it early on, and now had to wait until this thing went across the middle of the country. And what are we going to do the next time this happens? Are we going to allow it to fly through here again, and shoot it down once it gets to the East Coast?

REP. BRIAN FITZPATRICK (R-PA):  Thanks for having us, Jake. What I would like to do -- and this is my proposal. We will see where we ultimately land with our bipartisan group that Josh referenced. I would like to go right at the 1917 debt ceiling law itself that established the debt ceiling. Rather than have a numerical dollar amount, which doesn't make any sense -- we just end up raising it every other year -- is convert it to something like a debt-to-GDP ratio, a number that could be agreed to, have a cure period thereafter. And if that cure does not occur, certain guardrails go up on discretionary spending. We have two problems right now, Jake. We have a risk of default. We cannot allow our country to default under any circumstances. We also have a debt-to-GDP ratio that exceeds 100 percent. That's occurred two times in our nation's history, World War II and now. And that threatens the valuation of our currency and risks our competitiveness with China, and we see how big of a threat that is. So, that's the solution that I would like to advance. As Josh mentioned, we have a group that's working day and night on this right now. It reminds me a lot, Josh -- I'm sorry -- Jake, of the infrastructure negotiations. We worked in the background. We let the White House work with our Senate counterparts. It ended up not working out. Our solution ended up what the -- what was signed into law. So we're doing that same work in the background now.",
