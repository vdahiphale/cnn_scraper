The markets and how they have been trading at the start of a new week. And look, and you'll see, we are up from the Dow strongly. It's bullish, it's been up all day, and it seems to be staying there, at least the triple stack suggests also a strong reaction for the market for the day. The markets as they are and the main events of the day: The world's top bankers tell me what keeps them up at night, as recession is on the cards. It's not the economy, it is geopolitics. In London, in the UK, Rishi Sunak's warning of difficult decisions to fix the UK's wounded economy. And the chief executive of Standard Chartered on the most at risk in this crisis. Live from Riyadh, in Saudi Arabia. It's Tuesday it's October the 25th. I'm Richard Quest. And yes, in Riyadh, I mean business. Good evening. You don't need to be a rocket scientist or a Nobel Prize winner in economics to know the global economy is in a terrible mess. Geopolitical risk has rarely been higher. In the UK, for instance, political instability has brought about the third Prime Minister in seven weeks. In Ukraine, there is alarm over Russia's escalating disinformation campaign. In the United States, inflation is rapidly becoming the dominant issue in upcoming elections as the Fed raises rates. And so corporate leaders have gathered here in Saudi Arabia to discuss how to weather the storm. We are in Riyadh. We are bringing you QUEST MEANS BUSINESS from the Saudi Future Investment Initiative -- FII to its friends, the nickname, \"Davos in the Desert.\" Some of the biggest names in finance join me on today's panel. You're going to hear from Jamie Dimon, Chief Executive of JPMorgan; Ray Dalio, the founder of the world's biggest hedge fund; Goldman's David Solomon; Catherine MacGregor, CEO of Engie, one of the biggest utilities in France, and Yasir Al-Rumayyan, the Governor of the Saudi PIF, the Public Investment Fund. Many of them said a recession is not their biggest concern. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And Rishi Sunak of all people was perhaps the most aware of just how much money there was to pay back, and so, he had already started to lay the plans for tax rises to actually tried to pay for this massive bit of spending and he didn't try to hide that fact. And perhaps that also hampered his bid for the leadership over the summer. Clearly, his party has come to the realization now, at least the elected MPs have now come to the realization now that many of Liz Truss' campaign promises over the summer, while they turned out exactly how Rishi Sunak predicted they would turn out, which would be disastrous, and especially for inflation.

They are obviously just playing with the demand side by tightening but if they don't see real changes in behavior, my guess is they will go further. And I think generally when you find yourself in an economic scenario like this, where inflation is embedded, it is very hard to get out of it without a real economic slowdown. So, I too am in the camp that we likely have a recession in the U.S. going to happen and I think most likely a recession - - there might be a recession in Europe. And so until you get to that point that you see a change, whether it's in labor, the demand side, you are going to see central banks continue to move on a trajectory.",
