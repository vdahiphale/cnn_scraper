      "sentences": "Right, exactly. Look, I mean, it does come just days after Donald Trump was in D.C. meeting with House and Senate Republicans and the big goal for that was unity. And so today, I'm told the big goal is we need to stay on message and we need to get the right candidates elected.Now, remember, Speaker Johnson has a very slim majority in the House, and it's proven difficult. It's been very hard for him to get some, not just key priorities passed in the House, but also the general standard type of procedure packages as well. And so this goal, it benefits - this meeting, I should say, benefits both Donald Trump, but also House Speaker Mike Johnson and Richard Hudson, the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee. And look, Donald Trump in the past has - in his endorsements have carried a lot of weight. We know that many of the people he's endorsed have gone on to win their primaries. However, in 2022, many of those people, even though they won their primaries, ultimately lost when it counted on Election Day. And Donald Trump since then has really had fewer endorsements. From my conversations with Trump's team, they argue that they really do not want to be putting their weight behind people that they don't think can win. So what I was told this meeting is about is really trying to get on the same page about who to endorse and, as well, what the messaging should look like as they look ahead to November. Now, the other part of this that I find really interesting is Donald Trump and Mike Johnson have grown a relationship over the past few months as he's become Speaker. And recently, after Donald Trump's indictment - or not indictment, excuse me, his guilty verdict in his Manhattan trial on 34 counts of falsifying business records, Trump called Mike Johnson and complained to him about how he wants Republicans in Congress to be doing more to wage war on Democrats. And in order to do that, he needs more Republicans in his majority and so that's part of all of this as well.",

Yes, Joe Biden is still ahead here by a significant margin, but Trump has closed the margin also significantly. His support, 7 percent four years ago at this point. Look at that. He's tripled it. He's tripled it up to 21 percent now. Joe Biden from 86 percent to 70 percent. Another way to look at that is the margin. It was 79 points at this point four years ago.

And this really just gives you an indication of where this Black support from - for Donald Trump is coming from.All right, if you look at the black voters at the age of 50 or older, this is the margin Biden versus Trump. Four years ago at this point, Biden was up by 83 points. All right, that shrunk a little bit, a little bit. It's down to 74 points now, but nothing massive, nothing major here. This is nine points. But look at it among black voters under the age of 50, Brianna. Oh, my goodness, gracious. It was 80 points at this point four years ago. Look at where that margin is now at just 37 points. That is a shrinking of the margin of more than half. You know, I said earlier on in our air that I was speechless. I still am speechless because you go years and years and years looking at numbers, looking for when there was a significant shift, when something truly changed in the electorate. If this polling is anywhere close to being right, this is one of those historic moments where something we've never seen happen before, at least in our lifetimes, is happening. Black voters under the age of 50 are leaving Joe Biden, the Democratic Party, and while he still leads, that lead is significantly, significantly smaller than it was just four years ago.",

And that's what we're seeing. And here's a very important point. The fact that we're going to see more extreme heat on a warmer planet, that's obvious. That's an obvious impact of human-caused warming. But one of the subtle impacts that we're just beginning to really understand is how the actual pattern of the way the planet is warming up is changing the behavior of the jet stream and leading to these very persistent extreme configurations that give us these unprecedented extreme weather events. And the climate models that we use to predict the future appear to actually underestimate the impact that climate change is having in creating these very persistent jet stream patterns and many of these extreme weather events. And so, if anything, our models are actually underestimating some of the key impacts. As I like to say, uncertainty isn't our friend here.",

It's about those guys and women back there, because these firefighters have been here 24/7, and these wind conditions were making it really difficult for them.And so what we're seeing is a continuous effort here on the ground to get all of these hot spots cleared out. And you have them working with the chainsaws, with hand tools. They brought in the hose earlier. And so you're seeing these efforts on the ground, but you're also seeing the efforts in the air. We tried getting closer to the fire line just a few moments ago, and it's impossible, essentially, to get in there. But some of these firefighters are hiking up the mountain to get to that fire line and to continue battling these flames. You guys were just talking about climate change. What happened in this area is that we had so much rain in California over the last couple of years that a lot of the grass, the bush, the trees, all of that grew and that creates that fuel for this fire. So as things heat up for the summer, those conditions is essentially what makes these flames uncontrollable. They have gained some. They've made some progress in terms of containment for this fire. It was at 2 percent, we're now at 8 percent. So we have seen it improve, but we've also seen the acreage burn continuing to grow now more than 15,000 acres. And you mentioned evacuations. About 1,200 people are under evacuation orders. And there are more evacuation warnings. So they're telling people just be careful. The wind is strong, and it can change at any moment.

Earlier today in a speech at the Wilson Center, the Secretary General called on NATO to play a bigger role in delivering aid to Ukraine to avoid delays. He announced that 20 of 32 allies are now meeting the 2 percent defense spending benchmark that was set in 2014. That's more than doubled. And he also called on the alliance to impose more costs on China, which he says is fueling the largest armed conflict in Europe since World War II. Earlier today, I asked NSC Spokesman, John Kirby, whether the president shared that view. Here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
