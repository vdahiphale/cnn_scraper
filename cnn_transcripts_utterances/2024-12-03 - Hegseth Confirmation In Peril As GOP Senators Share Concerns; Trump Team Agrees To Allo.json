I'm Kaitlan Collins, in Florida. And this is THE SOURCE. There is breaking news in the air, here in South Florida, tonight, where, just over the causeway of Mar-a-Lago, they have been getting word from Washington that another of President-elect Trump's most important Cabinet picks is potentially in serious trouble tonight. While Pete Hegseth was back on Capitol Hill today, making a full-court press to lead the Pentagon, some of the Republican senators who will decide his fate are signaling that they're uncertain if they'll back him. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R-LA): I have read all the articles. I have seen all the allegations. And Mr. Hegseth is going to have to address them. I want to know if they're true.

That's a strategy that has raised some eyebrows, given House members don't get a say on his nomination.But as that is playing out, I have new reporting on the Trump strategy to save Pete Hegseth. I've learned that he's expected to sit down, likely tomorrow, for an interview with Fox News. That's noteworthy given most, if not all of Trump's Cabinet picks have been told not to do any media appearances until after they've been confirmed. It's also notable because Fox News was his employer until just a few days ago. And just a few moments ago, I was told, his mother is also expected to appear on the channel for an interview. That comes after she was inserted into his confirmation drama, when The New York Times published an email from Pete Hegseth's mom that she sent him, amid his divorce in 2018, accusing him of abusing and mistreating women. She later apologized, she said, and that the email was sent in anger. Now, Hegseth himself is likely to face questions about the allegations that are weighing down his nomination, assault allegations which he's denied, and others about his alcohol use. Some of those took the Trump team by surprise, partly because until today, the transition team had yet signed an agreement -- yet to sign an agreement with the Justice Department, allowing the FBI to start background checks. Now, Trump's team had considered bypassing the FBI and using private investigators instead. But a growing number of Republican senators were vocal that they wanted those FBI background checks. Now, that being said, it is not clear whether all the names picked for the positions that require Senate confirmation will be sent to the FBI, for that vetting process, given Trump has long-harbored hostility toward that agency. Here with me tonight, to start off, is CNN's Kristen Holmes. Obviously, as Mar-a-Lago is kind of monitoring all this, they have people who are with Pete Hegseth, that are going up there, to these -- to these meetings. Do they seem to be growing more concerned, over at Mar-a-Lago, about how his nomination is going to potentially stand tonight.",

They said they hadn't really even asked him about the allegations. They said they were happy with their meetings with him. It was a completely different story, today. We saw so many of these allies of Donald Trump's, and senators, coming out and saying they had concerns, that they had more questions, that they believed that he should be vetted more thoroughly. That is going to alarm anyone in Trump's orbit. Because, particularly when you look at the math, remember the entire reason that Matt Gaetz withdrew his name was because Donald Trump was making personal phone calls to these senators, and learned that there were just too many nos. And he was told by people close to him, he would have to expend too much political capital to get Gaetz confirmed. He has a lot less invested in Pete Hegseth than he had in Matt Gaetz. So, when they're watching these senators come out, and watching this process happen, that's obviously going to be of concern to them.",

However, when it comes to the alcohol use in particular, and these report after report that we have seen, of him falling asleep at events, of him getting so drunk he's chanting inappropriate things, going to a strip club? This is all in the whistleblower report that The New Yorker published. Those are things that are going to concern Donald Trump. There are people that I know, who are close to Donald Trump, who are heavy drinkers, who never drink around his presence, because they don't want to be considered a drinker, in front of the former President, now President-elect, because it's something he looks down on. He has a very complicated relationship with it. He himself doesn't drink. His brother was an alcoholic. He has talked about this openly.

Hegseth -- Pete Hegseth has been working to address that directly from the halls of Congress, today. You saw him there, not answering questions from reporters, but meeting privately behind closed doors with the Republican senators. We've just learned those efforts will continue tomorrow, when House Republicans are going to be with him, in a closed-door meeting. Now, House members don't have a say on Cabinet picks. So, it remains to be seen what the strategy behind that is. But this all comes as I'm also hearing that Hegseth, who is a veteran and former Fox News host, is going to return to his former job, tomorrow, most likely for a sit-down interview that's expected to air. His mother is also expected to appear on Fox, tomorrow, as well. Several Republican senators have said that they do believe he's facing a tough road to confirmation.
