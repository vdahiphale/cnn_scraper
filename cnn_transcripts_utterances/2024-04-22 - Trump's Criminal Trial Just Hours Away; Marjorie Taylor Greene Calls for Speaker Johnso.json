Just ahead, opening statements begin in a few hours in Donald Trump's historic hush money trial. We now know who the first witness will likely be.Plus, the U.S. aid package for Ukraine is expected to clear the Senate after passing in the House. But the Ukrainian president worries time is not on their side. They need weapons now. And today is Earth Day, a day to support environmental protection efforts and raise awareness. CNN speaks with a young up-and-coming meteorologist about what the climate crisis could mean for her generation. We are just hours away from opening statements in the first ever criminal trial of a former U.S. president. Donald Trump has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts for his alleged role in a hush money scheme to conceal an affair with adult film star Stormy Daniels. Trump has been outspoken about this trial and wants a gag order imposed on him by the judge lifted ahead of a hearing on Tuesday, where he'll face accusations of violating that order with some of his social media posts. Meanwhile, a source tells CNN the prosecution's first witness will likely be David Pecker, the former publisher of the \"National Enquirer,\" who is said to be a key player in the hush money plot. CNN's Marshall Cohen gives us a closer look at several of the potential witnesses.",

We know the opening statements will happen Monday, both sides trying to lay out their case for the jury and preview any evidence. What can we expect?Oh, so today is going to be a very energizing day. I'm sure that both sides are on pins and needles because they know that all eyes are watching them. But what we can expect today is the opening statements. And again, I say statement because it's not argument. So, the prosecution is going to be very limited in terms of what they say. So, the prosecution is going to lay out, set a preview of what they expect the evidence to show, try to give a preview to this jury, a layout of how they're going to present the evidence. And then they'll remind the jury that they'll come back at the end of the case doing closing arguments to argue how they prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt. The prosecution will go first. The defense will then have the option to give an opening statement. By New York law, they're not required to give an opening statement. But I assume in this case, of course, that they are going to give an opening statement and they're going to be confined as to any arguments that they can make as well. Of course, both sides have different narratives and it's the tale of who gives the best narrative for this jury. What I'm curious to see, who will be the first two witnesses that the prosecution calls? Because today may be the day right after opening statements that they call the first witness.",

So, in terms of who's going to be the star witness, yes, people say it's Michael Cohen. Yes, people say it's Stormy Daniels. But really, the witness is going to be the documents. Those are going to be the most important pieces of evidence and the witness in this case against Donald Trump.And of course, Michael Cohen, because Michael Cohen is going to lay out, give a narration as to why these documents are important, why the other witnesses are important. And technically, at the end, all the other witnesses are going to be corroborating what Michael Cohen says. And eventually, at closing arguments, the prosecutor is going to be able to argue. Look, Michael Cohen, he said what he said. Yes, he has his baggage, but he can be believed. Why? Because it's corroboration to show that he can be believed and will ask this jury to find a former U.S. president guilty of these 35 -- 34 counts of falsifying business records. KINKADE:  We were just showing some of those people there who could testify. And we have heard reports that the former publisher of the National Enquirer, David Pecker, could be the first to testify. And according to prosecutors, he's already admitted to running this so- called catch and kill scheme to help Trump and included paying sources not to tell negative stories.

The Georgia hardliner is one of at least three Republicans who say they will support the move to oust him.The new aid package, which is expected to be approved by the U.S. Senate this week, includes about $61 billion for Ukraine.

He says the country is preparing for a potential Russian offensive in the coming months.

They say that right now is a very difficult situation in many areas of the front line. In fact, Ukrainians are acknowledging they lost a key village in the east of the country which is very important to the defense on the eastern front. In part, I've been in that area, they were saying that they are very much starved for artillery ammunition in those areas. So therefore, the President of this country, Volodymyr Zelensky, he actually came out and he said that it's absolutely key from when political decisions are made to things being delivered to the Ukrainians that that process speeds up as fast as possible.
