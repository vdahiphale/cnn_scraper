You will hear his story and the moment that he realized it was the same man accused of deceiving voters on everything from where he went to college to his religion. That veteran speaks out in an interview you'll see first OUTFRONT tonight. And also, the chilling evidence against Brian Walshe, the husband accused of murdering and dismembering his wife in Massachusetts. Evidence authorities say includes googling, can you throw away body parts. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, the Davos deception. So the elite luxury alpine ski resort in Davos, Switzerland, is the center of the world's elite tonight, hosting right now probably still lots of parties going on, who's who in the world of money and politics. One world leader after the other there slamming Putin's invasion of Ukraine, even as the reported home of Putin's ex-wife is located just steps away from the high-end partying going on. And it isn't just Putin's ex-wife. Switzerland is also a country where Putin's girlfriend, Alina Kabaeva, has stayed for long stretches of time, according to \"The Wall Street Journal.\" But world leaders were comfortable making public proclamations in a country that some close to Putin have called home.

But as I said, just steps away from where these speeches are being made is the reported home of Putin's ex-wife, Lyudmila Putina. You can actually see it in the background of this shot on Yahoo Finance. And the person who pointed this out is Maria Pevchikh, head of investigations for Putin opposition leader Alexei Navalny's anticorruption foundation. In fact, that is where Putin's ex-wife shares an apartment with her now husband of more than five years. It's also the same country where, according to \"The Wall Street Journal,\" Putin's girlfriend, the Russian Olympic gymnast Alina Kabaeva has enjoyed extended stays, including in a high-walled mansion near Geneva. And we should note, it's always been hard to drill down exactly where those close to Putin live. The Kremlin doesn't comment on Putin's personal life. But his ex-wife and girlfriend are not the only two Russians close to Putin who have gone to Switzerland in search of a luxurious, comfortable life. Russian oligarchs store massive amounts of money there, up to nearly $50 billion in assets according to Switzerland of what they're disclosing. Now, to be fair, Switzerland has imposed sanctions on Russians but has only captured a fraction of that wealth there. It seems to be a case of saying a lot of things in Davos, and maybe doing some things that are appeared to be quite different. And all of this is happening as the war rages on the front lines and people are dyeing in Ukraine. Helicopter carrying a number of senior Ukrainian officials including the interior minister also crashed today outside a kindergarten, a horrible tragedy, at least 14 people killed including a child. President Zelenskyy saying that even if it was an accident, the blame ultimately, of course, does lie with Putin. Fred Pleitgen is OUTFRONT live in Kyiv. And, Fred, you were at the crash site today.

One of the things we have to mention is that there was pretty thick fog when that chopper was taken down. But, of course, this is a huge tragedy for Ukraine. Denys Monastyrsky, as we just saw there, one of the top officials and, of course, especially right now as the police forces here are so important in Ukraine, and also the emergency services after some of those big Russian strikes during those cleanup and rescue operations, a huge blow to this country that is already being tested so much, Erin.",

He's a former chief of the intelligence engagement division at the U.S./European Command. And also with me tonight, retired Army Major General James \"Spider\" Marks. So, General Marks, let's start with Switzerland. As I did at the top of the program here, you've got all these people, they're eager to say something, but, of course, the irony that they're standing in a place where in the background of the pictures, you're seeing a home of someone incredibly close to Vladimir Putin. MAJ. GEN. JAMES \"SPIDER\" MARKS (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Well, the hypocrisy of that type of gathering is very obvious. But we need to keep in mind that there are multiple elements of power that any nation can use to try to achieve its national security objectives, whatever they are. And that's diplomacy, economics, military and information. So the economic piece is as important as the military piece. The challenge that we have right now is we're focusing in Davos, you have to get beyond the parties, you have to get beyond the hypocrisy, you have to get beyond the fact that Putin his paramour lives over there with his ex-wife. I find that incredibly -- I'm not a marriage counselor, but I find that incredibly unbelievable that those two gals are getting along. But the point is, is the focus needs to be on those nations that have chosen not to participate in the sanctions. And most of the world have not participated in the sanctions against Russia. You've got India and certainly you have China. I doubt China's going to jump on that bandwagon. But the United States has an opportunity, and this gathering in Davos has an opportunity to look India in the eye and say what's up with you guys. They have a very cozy relationship with Putin. They have about 1.4 billion folks, and they need what Russia has. And so they're buying willingly and openly from Russia. That's what needs to be addressed.",

It's a fight because you have your brothers that are losing dramatically when they engage with Ukrainians.So, truly what Putin is saying, look, I'm going to mobilize more troops, I'm going to try to mobilize my industrial base, and he's going to continue to surround himself with a bunch of yes men so he does not get any of the bad news.",

Basically it's called a ceiling because in order to borrow more money, Congress has to authorize raising that limit in order to meet the government's financial obligations.Now, there are gimmicks and games that prolong the process somewhat so you hit the ceiling and they can kind of finagle for a bit. But the formal deadline is tomorrow and default will come within months if Congress doesn't take action to raise the limit. And default would be bad for the U.S. and for the global economy and for all of us. It would do all kinds of things known and unknown. It would raise borrowing costs. It would impact Social Security payments, veterans benefits, federal employee salaries. It would impact pretty much everything. And there are no signs right now of a deal to do this. Republicans say they want spending cuts on the table. The White House says there will be no negotiations, full stop. Republican Congressman Andy Biggs tweeted today, quote, we cannot raise the debt ceiling. Democrats have carelessly spend our taxpayer money and devalued our currency. They have made our bed, so they must lie in it. Of course, we all lie in this bed, Democrat, Republican, or independent, in terms of the implications and also who borrowed all the money. And the White House fired back, in part, Representative Biggs is dead wrong to actively support the ruin of millions of American livelihoods, 401k plans and small businesses, all in the name of scorched earth partisanship. Well, this is how we start. And here is the thing. Just the threat of a default, back in 2011, led to the only credit rating downgrade in American history. It was a big deal. And it was important. And it is something that we have covered extensively, back even when the show first launched more than 11 years ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
