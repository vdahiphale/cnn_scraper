Burchett said he ultimately voted against McCarthy after the speaker -- former speaker mocked his decision to pray over whether to oust him -- listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. TIM BURCHETT (R-TN):  He just basically said something that I thought belittled me and my belief system and, you know, I -- that pretty much sealed it with me right there. I thought that showed the character of the man. I said to him during the conversation I wish you hadn't waited until right now to call me. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I said, Tim, I read your quote. You said you were going to pray about it. I wanted to talk to you about it. And somehow he construes that -- I'm a Christian. I'm not going to offend somebody for it.

I don't know.But I can tell you this. So, yesterday, when we returned from lunch and the courtroom reporters went inside that there was this big delay and everybody was wondering what was going on. And then the judge went to the bench and he essentially just issued this rebuke, staring straight at the defendant's table where the former president was sitting. And basically was talking about this Truth Social post that Donald Trump has posted yesterday, and it was of the court clerk who sits right next to the judge. And it was a picture of her with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. And in that post, the former president essentially said that she was Schumer's girlfriend without any evidence to back that up. And it's very unclear what the relationship of those two even is past that picture. So this was a bridge too far for the judge. And keep in mind the context here. This is a judge who not only is deciding the outcome of this case but also someone who Trump has attacked personally to him. So again, this was just too much. And he basically said that this was disparing -- disparaging. It was untrue. It personally identified his clerk, which he didn't like. He asked that the post be deleted, which it was. But he says it was also emailed to millions of people and so that's why he issued this gag order. And he said, quote, \"Personal attacks of any member of\" -- any court staff are unacceptable -- \"of my court staff are unacceptable, inappropriate, and I will not tolerate them.\" And he basically said no longer. You cannot post anything, email anything about my court staff or there are going to be some strict sanctions. What that means, it's still unclear. We know that the lawyers all met behind closed doors without press inside that courtroom. So it's still to be determined what exactly he meant by that.

Needless to say, you pushed back vehemently against that. But as you read this piece in the Times -- it says, quote, \"If Mr. Trump returns to the White House in 2025, he has vowed to push for the designations and to deploy Special Operations troops and naval forces to, as he puts it, declare war on the cartels.\" It seems -- we've heard what DeSantis said in that CBS interview about what he would do as president.

So I understand the sentiment but I don't think that's the right approach. I think -- in my view, we have a very good model, and I explained this at time -- at times to folks in the party -- and that was playing Colombia that we did in the early 2000s with the country of Colombia where DOD played a supporting role providing helicopters and other aviation, special forces doing training. And together, working with the Colombian government, we really made a big dent in to not just the guerilla movement down there but also the drug trade. And to me, that's the malrigo (PH). I've seen varying expressions of this need or want to use the military. Some have spoken more about what I'm describing. Others have taken a more aggressive approach, like President Trump.
