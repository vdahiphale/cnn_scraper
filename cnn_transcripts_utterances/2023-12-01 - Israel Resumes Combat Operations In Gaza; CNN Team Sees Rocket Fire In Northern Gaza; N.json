Finally opening up about that college admissions scandal that landed her in the clink often says she was trying to give her daughter a future and she felt like she had to break the law.Plus, Donald Trump's attempted defense today pushing to get his criminal case in Georgia dismissed arguing that the indictment against the former president violates his free speech. And leading this hour, unfortunately, the ceasefire is over. Israel is launching new strikes in Gaza accusing Hamas of violating its deal to hand over more hostages. The fighting resumed just hours after a report in The New York Times that Israeli leaders dismissed warnings of a pending Hamas attack. Let's start with CNN's Jeremy Diamond who is near the Israel-Gaza border. And Jeremy, we've seen explosions and flares over Gaza all day. What is the Israeli government? What is the IDF saying about the renewed military operations?",

And just the last couple of hours, Jake, we have seen dozens of rockets being fired from just behind me in the northernmost part of the Gaza Strip. I want to show you one of those moments just earlier when we first got some of those rockets being fired.And you can see that there were multiple sirens going off. Dozens of rockets being fired in just one barrage. I counted 19 rockets being fired from a position right behind me that appears to be in the city of Beit Hanoun, which is the north eastern most city in Gaza. And what's remarkable about that, Jake, is that the Israeli military for a couple of weeks now has been claiming that they are in control of the northern part of the Gaza Strip. And yet, clearly, Hamas still has the ability to fire rockets from some of those positions. It also of course, comes as they have had a week now to resupply, to regroup, which was one of the fears of military analysts here in Israel. But what is also clear is that the Israeli military is continuing to pound key parts of Gaza. And the result of that, of course, has also been heavy civilian casualties once again. We know that in the southern part of the Gaza Strip, it appears according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, that several 100 people have already been killed among them. They say many women and children.",

Those negotiations are still ongoing. And sources have told us that if Israel is presented with a list of 10 women and children as they have been asking for in order to extend the truce today, that they would be willing to once again return to that pause and fighting in order to allow for the release of those hostages. It appears like Hamas is claiming that they simply don't have that number of women and children left in their custody in order to release. Some of that may have to do with some of those individuals, unfortunately, being dead. Some of it could also have to do with the fact that other militant groups hold other -- hold some of those hostages themselves.But what is also clear is that at some point, these negotiations have to and are already starting to move towards the broader question of men as well as Israeli soldiers. Israeli political leaders recognize that getting those hostages out will come at a significantly higher price. And they also believe that these military operations that the military pressure on Hamas will help to lower that price, putting pressure on Hamas at the negotiating table as well.",

But what's clear is that the New York Times report goes further than those accounts with very specific blueprints that the Israeli military and its intelligence community appears to have obtained. But it's not changing the posture of the Israeli prime minister who has effectively said that all questions about this intelligence failure should be answered after the war ends. Of course, he is the only one really who has yet to take responsibility. Most of Israel's security leadership already has. Jake.[17:05:26] TAPPER: All righ. Jeremy Diamond, thank you so much. And this news just in the Biden administration and Israeli officials believe that Hamas continues to hold hostage a number of women who are approximately 20 to 30 years old, who were kidnapped meant many of them from the Nova music festival. The fear of course, that there is a specific reason why a group of terrorists would want to keep holding hostage a bunch of young women. Let us return to the blockbuster New York Times report. The paper revealing that Israel knew of Hamas as attack plan more than a year ago, but Israeli officials dismissed it as aspirational and ignored specific warnings. This comes on the heels of an article in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz last week saying quote, \"Over the past year, the Israel Defense Forces spotters situated on the Gaza border, all women warned that something unusual was happening. Those who survived the October 7 massacre are convinced that if it had been men sounding the alarm, things would look different today,\" unquote. Now we thought of having an Israeli government official come on to respond. But frankly, we have been asking about intelligence failures, since the very beginning of the saga, starting with the horrific Hamas terrorist attack on October 7. And we've been getting the same answer over and over and over again, this one. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
