So, there is an obligation for them to send him here.But he's in the middle of his murder sentence in Peru, but they are still doing that. When I was in Peru covering Joran van der Sloot, they said from the onslaught that they were going to send him to the United States once these extortion charges had been filed and they knew about them. You know, it was 2005. And to take us back there, Natalee Holloway. She was just about to graduate from high school, she had her whole life in front of her and they took a senior trip to Aruba. And she met Joran van der Sloot. It was at Carlos and Charlie's one night. Her friends saw her dancing with him. She was never seen again after that. And her parents realized she wasn't on the plane coming home. They found out Joran van der Sloot was one of the last people to see her. He was questioned, he was arrested but he was always released. In 2010, they were still searching for answers and they put out a $250,000 reward. Joran van der Sloot heard about that and he contacted a member of the family and said, look, I can tell you everything. I will tell you how she died, where she died, where her remains are. I just want the money. They worked with the FBI -- the family worked with them. He was actually given $25,000. An associate with a family flew to Aruba, drove with him in a car and he showed them a house and the foundation, and he said she's in that foundation that she got killed because she hit her head when we have gotten an argument. My father buried her and there she is. The associate went back. Months later, he e-mailed saying it was all a lie. I'd -- it wasn't the truth at all. By that time, Joran had gone to Peru, and it's believed he was gambling away that $25,000 that he had. He met in the casino, Stephany Flores, the daughter of a very prominent businessman in Peru. And within hours, she was dead. He is now serving time for her murder and will be extradited. But remember, this may be an ex -- this may be an extortion case and wire fraud case but the family wants out -- answers.",

So, explain why this should maybe make us a little happy. MATT EGAN, CNN BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMY REPORTER: John, this is more proof that this inflation crisis is getting better. It's not gone but it's moving in the right direction. So, look at this. 2.3 percent producer price increase year over year. This is wholesale inflation. It's pricing pressure that's in the pipeline. Before, it gets to us as consumers. Context? 2.3 percent now. It peaked at nearly 12 percent last year.",

That has bounced around, but that number has also come down as well. That's a good sign. I think if you put that number with yesterday's inflation report, it does show things are moving in the right direction. But there are risks out there in this economy, including the debt ceiling. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, she issued another warning overnight. She said, \"in my assessment, and that of economists across the board, a default on U.S. obligations would produce an economic and financial catastrophe.\" John, she is basically pleading with Congress to defuse this ticking time bomb before it wrecks the economy.",

That's the nightmare scenario. Hopefully, doesn't happen. But if it does, look at this. You see 400,000 jobs would go away from New York, hundreds of thousands from Ohio, and Pennsylvania. And don't forget, this is all coming at a time when layoffs are starting to increase, albeit from historic lows, but new numbers out today 264,000 initial jobless claims. That is up from the recent lows. Some context though, this is the highest level since October of 2021. If it keeps rising, I think that's going to start to really concern economists. A 300,000 would be a signal that the economy is actually starting to lose jobs. 350,000 jobs for these initial claims, that would be a signal of a potential recession.

So, look for this missile system, among others, that they have, to be central in a Ukrainian counteroffensive plan, which by all -- by all designs -- and Ukrainian officials, by the way, are speaking about this publicly, will be a significant one. This is going to be a key moment into the war. And this weapon system is going to be a key weapon system in the war so far.

ELIZABETH COHEN, CNN SENIOR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENTAnd you can see what it looks like you put it sort of between the child's shoulder blades on their back. And this patch contains 1/1000 of a peanut essentially -- 1/1000. Just a teeny tiny amount. This is for children who have severe peanut allergies. And so, what they did in this study is they did this patch every day for a year and they found that 67 percent of these patients were able to safely ingest like around one to three peanuts Now, you might think one to three peanuts, who cares that's not very helpful. Here's why it's helpful. These children, if they were to become like by mistake exposed to a peanut like mistakenly eat one, they could die. So, this is sort of giving them a little bit of a margin of error if you will. Now this is not available on the market. There's an oral version of this and there are benefits and downsides to both of these.
