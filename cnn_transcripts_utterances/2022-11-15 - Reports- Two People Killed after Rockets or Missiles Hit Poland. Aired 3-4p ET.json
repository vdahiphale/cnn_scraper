I'm Isa Soares in London.We begin this hour with major breaking news: Two rockets or missiles have reportedly struck inside Poland, a NATO, of course and EU country and reportedly killed two people and it comes on a day of what has been relentless Russian strikes right across Ukraine. Strikes that have targeted cities and regions right there, as you can see on your map, really including residential neighborhoods in Kyiv. Poland is now holding I am being told an emergency meeting. The Pentagon says it is aware of the report. Our Christiane Amanpour joins me now from London. So Christiane, a lot we still do not know.

      "sentences": "Well, the truth is we don't. We know perhaps that two people have been killed by some kind of debrismissile, whatever it is, but we really do not know what actually it is. We have called the Polish government. They have told us we are trying to confirm what it is, we're investigating. We know from calling around to various NATO bordering countries who we speak to regularly on our show in Foreign Ministries, Defense Ministries, that everyone is trying to find out exactly what happened. We know that other countries, for instance, the Baltics have said, if it is the worst case scenario, that there was an attack, then that would mean that we stand fully shoulder-to-shoulder with our NATO ally, Poland, and we will do what NATO or what Poland asks us to do. So the reason everybody is getting very anxious, and rightly so about this is because any deliberate attack on a NATO nation would in fact, trigger Article V, if the attacked nation was to ask for that to be triggered, which would then trigger a response from all the other NATO nations because that is the doctrine. However, we do not know what happened as of this time. Neither The Pentagon is saying that it knows what happened, nor the British Defense Ministry, nor in the countries around, and Poland, the country in which something happened is currently investigating it. What needs to happen, and you just talked to a former NATO Ambassador, Kurt Volker is that Russia needs to immediately clarify what it did or didn't do and what its intentions were. There is also a possibility, and we don't know this, but we do know that what the Ukrainians claimed to have been 90 missiles that were fired across the country by Russia today. They say their anti-missile defense, the air defense systems shot down 70 of those. Now, is it possible that some of those were shot down in a border region? Is it possible that there was some debris from shooting down these Russian missiles that were targeting Ukrainian infrastructure and civilian targets, could that have been part of the cause? Again, we don't know. But all of these are possibilities, and therefore we have to hear from Russia and we have to hear from Poland. And, you know, the United States has massive Intelligence capabilities and it has probably -- obviously deploying all of that. And as I said, many of these countries are talking to each other, calling each other, trying to figure out what's going on. And you can imagine, NATO also is -- the headquarters in Brussels is also engaged in first and foremost, trying to understand what happened.",

We have seen several times in the last 10 days or so, two weeks, where Russia has responded to this seeming poking by Ukraine, that's my word, with barrages of missiles against civilian targets. And we know that today according to the Ukrainian officials, there was some 90 -- that's their number -- Russian missiles, rockets, projectiles targeted at places all over the country and at civilian infrastructure, including, of course, the electric grid, the energy grid. We hear Ukrainian officials say today that today, because of the attack, seven million Ukrainians are without power and that is what has been going on, and any number of those could have been intercepted. The Ukrainian say they intercepted 70 of them. It could have happened near the border. Again, we have to wait to know what exactly went down there. It is farmland from as far as I can ascertain.

However, I'd have to say, you know, that area has a lot of reconnaissance being carried out, certainly by NATO, and all of the countries on what is going on in that area. Granted, it was out in the country, but still, there was a lot of reconnaissance and data being collected about that area. So, you would think, pretty, you know, soon, we would know, or they would know, the NATO would know, the United States would know certainly what exactly happened. But the question is, there is a sequence here. You know, Poland has to decide, since it was on its territory, what does it want to do? And then it will or won't or will decide to approach NATO. And then the Russians have already said, you know, that this is a provocation, that they didn't launch any missiles. However, I think with the Russian statements, you have to be very careful about precisely what they are saying, because what they are saying is, we didn't fire any missiles there. But as has been pointed out, one of their missiles or two could have been shot down. So again, this is a very subtle thing with grave implications, if taken to the extreme.

And in fact, just, I believe, it was yesterday, President Zelenskyy goes to Kherson, walks the streets, listens to the Ukrainian National Anthem being played on the streets of Kherson, which the Russians still claim, and the Russians had no true answer for that. All they could say was, well, it's still -- we consider it Russian territory. So this is really, again, a dramatic moment where militarily and politically, President Putin has been embarrassed, that's the minimum of really to see that debacle of leaving it.

In the past hour and a half or so, two rockets or missileshave reportedly struck inside Poland as you can see there on Przejazdowo, a NATO and EU country, and killed two people. It comes on a day of relentless Russian strikes on Ukraine targeting cities and regions right across the country. President Zelenskyy speaking in the last hour, said \"Terror is not limited to our national borders.\" Sam Kiley is in Ukraine, in the City of Kryvyi Rih who saw some of those relentless strikes today. And Sam, there is, a lot, of course we do not know. We're waiting for a meeting from the Polish side. We are also waiting to hear from the US or that the State Department has said in the last half an hour or so that they are working with Polish government and allies, but didn't want to go -- they didn't want to speculate and they didn't want to -- they are waiting for answers on what happened to then take appropriate response.

Now that is flat out untrue. We know that to be the case, because the city of Lviv, which is close to that border has itself come under attack from missiles, some of which have been shot down. This is a very wide -- nationwide series of attacks right across the country from north, south, east, and west, extending to Mykolaiv in the South, Kharkiv in the North, Lviv in the West, and that is critical because there were Russian missiles flying around in that area. There were also Ukrainian anti-aircraft missiles attacking them. It is conceivable that these are projectiles that result from one of those attacks. So it is very surprising indeed that the Russians will come out quite so quickly with an outright denial rather than a claim that they are conducting investigations. But we've seen that pattern from the Russians throughout. They deny attacking civilian targets here. They deny the murders and tortures that have been uncovered across the country in Irpin, Bucha, Kharkiv, and now in Kherson 400 war crimes are now being investigated by the Ukrainians following their victory in the City of Kherson just in the last few days. So I think that what is really important that we do know about the geostrategic developments pointed out by President Zelenskyy is that Moldova has also now suffered significant loss of electricity as a consequence of automatic disconnection between it and Ukraine, and that has come. You can see it's very, very dark here. There's a very great shortage of electricity now across this country. There are sirens now blaring here in Kryvyi Rih as I speak to you, warning of more potential air raids against the electric and other critical infrastructure of the Ukraine. So, this has been a day perhaps, the heaviest day of bombardments of these nature for many, many weeks and there were intense bombardments along the Polish border.",

But I think then also it would be a mistake sometimes to see this as a conversation. This is a military campaign, in which the Russians, arguably should, from day one, have gone after the critical national infrastructure. If you want to destroy a country's administrative capability, its ability to wage war, you go after its electrical circuits pretty much on day one. That is something that they have stepped up in a very significant way. The problem now is that what everybody has been fearing from day one of this campaign waged by the Russians, is that it is spilling over into Moldova in terms of civilian effects and now, in some kind of violent way, into Polish territory. That is a serious danger much more widely.",

That's what we hear from the State Department, what we arehearing from the National Security Council at the White House, that they are essentially waiting and watching. Of course, we will be looking to their Polish allies to get the latest information. In fact, my colleague, Oren Liebermann, at the Pentagon, and I have just confirmed that the U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin will be speaking with his Polish counterpart in the coming hours. We have been told by Polish government officials that they have been holding an emergency national security meeting. In speaking with both American and other foreign officials here in Washington, D.C., everyone is now looking to Warsaw for any indication of what may have happened here. The only two countries that seem to be making any sort of firm statement about what they believe to have happened are Ukraine and Russia. Russia is denying it all, essentially saying that this is a deliberate provocation. Meanwhile, we have heard from President Zelenskyy of Ukraine tonight. He is saying in no uncertain terms that these were Russian missiles that landed on the territory of Poland. So now, the question becomes, was this intentional? We have been discussing it over the course of the past few hours, whether Russia would tell the rest of the world that we made a mistake. It doesn't appear to be that way because now we've heard from the Russian defense ministry, denying it. Were these Russian missiles that were shot out of the sky by Ukrainian air defenses? Was this some kind of probe to see what kind of response there would be from NATO? Is this a response to Ukraine taking back Kherson from the Russians? Or the CIA director Bill Burns, meeting with his Russian counterpart yesterday in Turkiye, and issuing some kind of warning about the use of nuclear weapons? These are all major questions. What is very clear here is that there is a potential for a significant escalation. Poland, of course, a member of NATO. So once they have come to some kind of conclusion, will they take this to the rest of NATO? The first thing that came to mind when we heard about this incident today was Article V. Of course, that is the article that is the foundation of NATO. If one country is attacked, all the other NATO countries rally to their side. It's only been invoked once after 9/11. That is a long process that is has to be agreed upon unanimously. The question now, is this conflict spilling beyond the borders of Ukraine? You were showing that map there a second ago, that small Polish town, about the same distance as the Russian border is to Lviv in Western Ukraine. Of course, many people are going to be hoping that this is an accident and not a deliberate escalation of this war in Ukraine that could spread beyond Ukraine.",

So even if the two rockets or missiles that landed in Polish territory were not intended to do so, I think it is part of the major escalation that Russia has decided to undertake following the loss of Kherson. And I think after what the end of the G20 (ph). So in that sense, even though we still need to do forensic and to determine what kind of rocket, why they would've landed on Polish territory, I think there is ground right now for Poland to Invoke Article IV, which essentially, when one member of the alliance wishes to consult with the other members when it thinks its territorial integrity is under threat. So not only the attack but the threat that I think (INAUDIBLE).",

Ukrainian (INAUDIBLE)solidarity with Poland and stands ready to provide any necessary support. Collective response, he went on to say, to Russian actions must be tough and principled. Among immediate actions, a NATO summit with Ukraine's participation to craft further joint actions. He went on to say, which will force Russia to change its course on escalation, providing Ukraine with modern aircraft, F-15s and F-16s, as well as air defense systems so that we can intercept any Russian missiles. Today, protecting Ukraine's skies means protecting NATO. So in terms of NATO action, you were talking there of Article IV, of the emergency consultations. Does this change at all if it was an accident or if it was deliberate, does it change the way that NATO, that Poland and its allies see this and deal with this?",

However, I think, again, there has not been a burden of proof to go to war (INAUDIBLE). But it is enough to evoke Article IV, which again is not something that is consultation. I think here NATO needs to do two things. One is to speak and to speak with one voice and one clear voice, that the NATO territory should not be touched by any Russian weapons system or any Russian action. (INAUDIBLE) Article IV can also lead to some defensive action. For example, the location (ph) of the Polish air defense system but also and importantly what Minister Kuleba was alluding to this, the augmenting of the Ukrainian air defenses. Because again, Ukraine is our first line of defense here. So if you want to have a proper defense from NATO, we need to help Ukraine do that.",

We know that thePoland side has been meeting, security meeting. That has been happening, what, since (INAUDIBLE) I came on air at 7 o'clock London time. So almost two hours now. As soon as we hear from them, as soon as that gets underway, of course, we will bring it to you. It's important, of course, that we hear directly from Poland. We have yet to hear from them. I want to bring in now former NATO Supreme Allied Commander General Wesley Clark, joins me from Little Rock, Arkansas. General, thank you very much for joining us. Of course, as we've just outlined there, we're still waiting to hear from the Polish side. We've seen the State Department also waiting for clarification from the Poles. We have heard from the Russians, though, saying the reports of missiles in Poland, a deliberate provocation. Your initial thoughts as we wait, of course, for further clarification here? GEN. WESLEY CLARK, CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Probably a mistake by the Russian commanders who are organizing this, this strike; something probably went wrong. But the fact that it's not being apologized for leads me to believe that the Russians were likely to take advantage of it anyway, as an intimidation, as a tweak to check whether NATO was going to respond on this very small infringement of NATO territory. So it has to be responded to. And the first thing we need to do, of course, validate that it happened. Now we should be asking the Patriot batteries that are in Poland, where they're deployed, is there any radar traced, did we track this? If the Patriot radar batteries are not in position close enough to the border to secure the border, then probably we need to look at repositioning or even deploying additional assets there. So it's clear you can't just defend at the border. You've got to have your range envelope extending into Ukraine if you are going to stop this kind of thing. So that's the sort of the minimum military response that should be taking place.",

I think the United States is going to be able to very strongly continue to support Ukraine in this. So that didn't work. He hasn't succeeded in splitting NATO. So one way to interpret these two missiles is perhaps this was a sort of tweak. Let's ramp up the pressure a little bit, let's see what NATO does. And then it's always deniable. So we don't know how to interpret that. But from the NATO perspective, it's important to show resolve. So we've got to have a response.",
