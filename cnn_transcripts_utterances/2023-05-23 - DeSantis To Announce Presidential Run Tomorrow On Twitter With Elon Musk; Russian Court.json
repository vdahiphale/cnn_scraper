The Biden administration has declared him wrongfully detained. And today, the U.S. embassy in Moscow said it's deeply concerned. Gershkovich is facing up to 20 years in prison on espionage charges, which he and the U.S. government deny. We have CNN's Jennifer Hansler following this for us.

That court outside of Moscow granted that extension. So that means Evan will be spending another three months at least in Moscow's notorious Lefortovo Prison. The U.S. embassy today reiterated that the charges against Evan are baseless. They called for his immediate release. The State Department said there was an embassy official there at the hearing. As you noted, his parents were also there at the hearing. The State Department said they knew that his parents were traveling to Russia. And they did not help or arrange for that trip, but they also did not fault them for wanting to be there and see their son. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

DON RIDDELL, CNN HOST, \"WORLD SPORT\": Yes, really, really interesting. You say he's 38, that's true. That is young for a human being. It is old for an athlete. I think LeBron James would agree with me on that. Really interesting to hear these comments. Because, as sports reporters, we love asking these guys questions, sometimes consequential questions in the heat of the moment. And you get great reactions. You get really, really raw emotional responses sometimes. And that's great. But you have to ask how much stock is there really in those answers. It's hard to imagine that LeBron James is ready to step away from the game. Of course, he's disappointed. It's no fun losing a conference final series. And certainly no fun being swept 4-0. And that is what happened to Lebron James last night. But it's clear that he can still compete. He played every minute of that game last night. He scored 30 points in the first half, which, by the way, is something he's never done in his entire career of playoff competition. And that, by the way, is over 280 games. [14:55:06] He scored 40 points last night. So he can compete and he still can do it. You mentioned one of the reasons why he might keep playing. Bronny is going to college next year. He actually will be playing on the same street as LeBron just a couple of miles away. He recently said he would move, I think the quote was, \"move heaven and earth\" to make sure that he got onto the same team as Bronny when he joins the NBA. So you would imagine that LeBron would still want to stick around and do that. He's disappointed right now, of course. If the Lakers are stronger next year, they might even be more competitive next year. That's another reason why he may want to stick around. But what he's certainly done is guarantee that this is going to be the story line for the rest of the summer. This is what everybody in the NBA will be talking about -- Boris?",
