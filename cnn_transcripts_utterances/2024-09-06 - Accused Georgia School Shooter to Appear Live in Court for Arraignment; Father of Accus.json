Colt Gray has been charged with four counts of felony murder. He has been held at Gainesville Regional Youth Detention Center. In a significant development overnight, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation confirmed that Colin Gray, the father of the Apalachee high school shooter, has been arrested and charged in connection with the crime. And the 54- year-old is now facing eight counts of cruelty to children in the second degree, two counts of involuntary manslaughter in the second- degree, and another four counts of involuntary manslaughter. Why did authorities decide to charge the suspects father? This is what Georgia Bureau of Investigation director Chris Hosey had to say about it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

In May of last year, deputies interviewed both Colt and Colin Gray after the FBI flagged online threats at an unidentified location, but the sun denied any involvement.And last December, Colin Gray purchased the gun that was allegedly used in the mass shooting, as a holiday present for Christmas for his son.

And now here we are. Can we extrapolate that the reason that the father is now charged and charged with something that no other parent in the country has been charged with in one of these mass shootings, which is second degree murder, as well as involuntary manslaughter, can we extrapolate that the reason these charges came is because eventually he did allow his son to have a gun and knew, because of the past visit from law enforcement, that he was having these ideations?",

We know because of the statements made by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation folks that he's been arrested because of his knowingly giving or enabling his son to have this weapon. So we know that it's based on that. It's a little bit harder to line out exactly what the charges are addressing factually because we haven't seen the indictment or the affidavit supporting the indictment yet.But I can tell you that the crime of -- it's a little odd because we know there's only two counts of second-degree murder, and we know we have four victims. Under Georgia law, it's defined, second-degree murder is defined as when in the commission of cruelty to children in the second degree, a person causes the death of another human being irrespective of malice. Cruelty to children in the second degree, sorry for the law lesson here, is a crime that is committed when someone with criminal negligence causes a child under the age of 18 cruel or excessive physical or mental pain. So those two second-degree murder charges are likely relative to the two student victims of the shooting, the two students who we know have -- are now deceased. But again, we'll have a better understanding of exactly how all this its works when we do finally get to see a copy of the affidavit or indictment. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Jean Carroll to appeal that $5 million verdict and a jury finding that he had sexually abused Carroll and defamed her when he denied it and criticized her appearance.So, both sides will only have about 10 minutes to make their arguments. Trump's lawyers are expected to say that the trial judge made mistakes by allowing two other women who had accused Trump of sexual assault for testifying and also allowing the jury to hear the \"Access Hollywood\" tape where Trump is caught on that hot mic making comments about how he can just easily grope women. They are saying that never should have come in. Carroll's lawyers say that that is all evidence of Trump's MO and that it was fair game for the jury to hear that. We're not expecting a decision today. This will just be the oral arguments. And unlike some of Trump's other appearances in court like his criminal trial, there are no cameras in this courthouse. So, he will not be able to make comments in the hallway or address the cameras here, but he is expected to head to Trump Tower later today where he is going to have a press conference. Now, as I said, no decision expected today and Trump is not required to be here, but he's choosing to be here during his campaign to make this appearance, where only those of us inside will be able to see him -- Sara.",

A US official told me the following: We are concerned about heightened Russian military activity worldwide and that Russia's decision calculus for damaging US and allied undersea critical infrastructure may be changing. That's the key phrase, decision calculus. They believe that Russia may be more likely to carry out operations now to damage these cables, they have an entire unit set up to do so. It is known as the General Staff Main Directorate for Deep Research. It goes by the initials GUGI -- G-U-G-I. This has been around for a long time, but what's notable here, John, is that they then adding additional resources to this group which operates, as you see there, surface ships, submarines, and naval drones, additional resources to this unit, even in the midst of the Ukraine war.   So, even as it's devoting so much to the ongoing invasion of Ukraine, it has maintained this unit highly secretive one, highly protected one as a priority for the Kremlin.",

It's for communications, civilian communications, government communications, military communications, but also all the things and industries that depend on that kind of traffic, internet and communications traffic, including financial markets, entire industries, the energy industry. Also, in Northern Europe, you have undersea cables that carry energy between countries including among American allies. So, an attack that would disable or damage those cables would have enormous effect beyond just things you and I tend to use on the internet, right? There is so much in the world today that depends on that and that is why the US is making quite clear, to view any attack like this as a major escalation and they're watching very closely. I'll tell you, John, I was on a NATO patrol in the Baltic Sea last spring. And at that time, they told me they were watching Russian ships. We could see them on their radar as they were sitting above these key choke points and they said they're not doing that for fun, right? They're doing that because they are mapping and they are making plans at least for attacks like this.",
