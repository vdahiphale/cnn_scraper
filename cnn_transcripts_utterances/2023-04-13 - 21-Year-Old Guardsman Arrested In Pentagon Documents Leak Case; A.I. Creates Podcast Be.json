But if she can't come back month after month after month with this close Senate, that's not just going to hurt California, it's going to be an issue for the country. So, we take her at her word, she's coming back. Let's see what that date is and what they tell Senator Schumer. But for now, she really made the right decision to step aside from the committee.

His name is Jack Teixeira and he's described in The Washington Post as a lonely but charismatic gun enthusiast who was allegedly the leader of a chat room on Discord. That's a social media platform popular with gamers. We'll have more details on this in a moment. But does this story give us some insight into what's going on with young men who spend a lot of time online? Plus, you know, we ring the artificial intelligence alarm on this show often.

And I was talking to the captain who is younger than me who went around the room and introduced me to the guy in charge of the nuclear engines who was 22. And the woman in charge of the entire mess, right, there was like 5,000 people, that ship was filled with 21-year-old gun enthusiasts, right? So, I'd just be real careful about painting with a broad brush. The only thing that I would take from this that I'm comfortable saying globally is the meaning thing. The young men today feel untethered and unmoored and older men, I'm afraid, aren't so different. Nick Eberstadt has a great book where he talks about. It's called men without work. 7.2 million able bodied men in the prime of their life not only not working but affirmatively not looking for work. We have never seen that in this country outside of war. Never in peace time have we seen this going on.

So, there are real ramifications.You know, the Russia/China summit that happened recently in Moscow, among the things discussed between Xi Jinping and Putin was A.I., how do we lead the world in A.I. And you know now, I think here in the U.S., the Biden administration has said the Commerce Department is opening it up for comments for the next 60 days. All of us can write into the Commerce Department right now for our thoughts on A.I. That's where we're at. The Italians, meanwhile, a couple weeks ago, said we're pausing ChatGPT in the country. It is banned until you fix some stuff. The Italians are far ahead of us in terms of dealing with this. So, there are real things happening and then the tech companies are like, we're not stopping. The Microsoft CEO this week said, full speed ahead on ChatGPT. Why would we stop? If you want to regulate us, regulate us? So, it falls on the government, like many things, to put a pause on this, potentially.",

At the same time, we took shop class out of high school.The result of doing that is $1.7 trillion in outstanding student loans and 11.5 million jobs that can't be filled right now that don't require four-year degree. Ergo, we continue to lend money we don't have to kids who are never going to be able to pay it back training at the jobs that don't exist anymore. Of course, they're miserable, right?
