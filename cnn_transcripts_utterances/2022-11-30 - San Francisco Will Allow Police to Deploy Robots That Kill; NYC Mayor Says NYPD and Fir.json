They're measuring the gases that are being emitted. They're measuring how much the ground flexes from the infusion of magma underneath out on to the eruption at the surface.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MIGUEL MARQUEZ, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The claim in a new lawsuit seeking class action status, Yale University discriminated against students with mental health disabilities, alleging that Yale's withdrawal policies and practices pushed students with mental health disabilities out of Yale, and if they try to get back in, they face unreasonable burdens. The lawsuit coming shortly after a \"Washington Post\" investigation relying on interviews of more than 25 current and former Yale students. One student telling the \"Post,\" she suffered a sexual assault, eventually attempting suicide, then feeling forced to withdraw from the university. Another account in \"The Washington Post,\" a 20-year-old math major, who had already withdrawn once, posted on Facebook, \"Dear Yale, I loved being here. I only wish I could've had some time. I needed time to work things out and to wait for new medication to kick in, but I couldn't do it in school, and I couldn't bear the thought of having to leave for a full year, or of leaving and never being readmitted.\" Her fear so great of not being allowed in a second time, she died by suicide in 2015. Yale says it made some changes to its policies, but those bringing the lawsuit say, it's not enough. In a statement. Yale said, \"Our primary focus is on students' safety and health, especially when they are most vulnerable. We have taken steps in recent years to simplify the return to Yale for students on medical withdrawals and to provide additional support for students.\" \"The university is confident that our policies comply with all applicable laws and regulations. Nonetheless, we have been working on policy changes that are responsive to students' emotional and financial wellbeing.\" Miriam Heyman, who wrote a 2018 white paper on mental health in the Ivy League for the Ruderman Family Foundation, which is cited in the lawsuit, says Yale is not alone when it comes to failing to accommodate students with mental health disabilities.",

And colleges in general across the country are -- lack the basic infrastructure to support students' mental health.MARQUEZ (voice-over):  The problem widespread. A \"Washington Post\" analysis of data from the Healthy Minds Network indicated, nationwide, student rates of depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts more than doubled between 2013 and 2021. And the 2021 report from Penn State Center for Collegiate Mental Health found that funding isn't keeping pace with demand for mental health services, that the yearly average caseload for a college counselor is about 90 students, with some centers reporting an average of about 300 students per counselor. (On camera):  This issue has now caught the attention of Congress as well. Senator Edward Markey has sent a letter to the Department of Education and Department of Justice, asking them to issue guidance and policy reforms to protect access to higher education for students and to strengthen nondiscrimination protections for students who may need medical leave.

It's really amazing to be able to share this experience that's been so difficult for me and so many others over decades.When I was dealing with my mental health crisis, I felt like Yale was presenting me with a stark binary choice. I could either continue with a full-time schedule at Yale and all the challenges that would come with, or I would have to commit to an extended absence in which I would have to give up university health insurance, on-campus housing and every manner of institutional support that I had. That choice made things so difficult. And what I didn't understand at the time is I had a federally-protected right to have more options on the table. Reasonable accommodations are critical to the way that mental health practices are properly achieved on campus.",

They want the student to deal with their issues anywhere except Yale's campus.And in some instances, taking time off is a healthy decision. In other cases, it separates students from their primary support group.

We've been doing research and collecting data on campus mental health issues nationwide and using that to inform the policy change that we advocate for on a national level. We have found Yale to be a particularly egregious example. There are a lot of tricky facets to this issue. But as Rishi said, it can't be a blanket policy.

It was a very stressful time. I'm fully supportive of four-day work week because the reality is, it's not that you're making more money doing less work, it's that you become actually more productive in those four days and you can still make the same amount of money. So, as long as your work product stays the same and you are as efficient and get things done, I think it's fine. Hey, let's do three days.",

When the case was hot, you work the case and your schedule was kind of dictated around what it was you were working on at that time.That being said, for the uniform patrol officers who work some of the most stressed or in the most stressed environment within policing, it made a huge difference for them to be able to have a three-day reprieve from work. Regardless of whether it happen to be, you know, overlap with the weekend or nontraditional middle of the week day's off, those officers, you would have to like pry them away from those days off.
