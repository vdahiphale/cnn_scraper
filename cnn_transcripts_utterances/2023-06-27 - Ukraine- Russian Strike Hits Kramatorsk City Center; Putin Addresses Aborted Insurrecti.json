Two people are dead and 22 injured after a missile strike in Kramatorsk. There are dashed hopes in America's industrial heartland as the electrical vehicle maker, Lordstown Motors files for bankruptcy.

Now what we see is it appears that more than one, we believe a missile struck this general area, the damage is extensive, not just in the restaurant itself, but all around. And now what we have behind us is rescue workers are really digging through the rubble, trying to find more injured. In fact, Kosta, our fixer just saw one injured civilian, a worker in the restaurant being pulled out. Now, I was able to get actually inside of what remains of the restaurant, which isn't much and what I saw is that they're huge slabs of concrete that they're trying to dig under. They've brought a crane to lift some of them more of those out. Now the latest figures we've heard from an official in the president's office is that at least three people have been killed, 25 injured. The expectation is that there are more people under the rubble. Now, the air raid siren went off about 20 minutes ago and one of the worries is that there could be what's known as a double tap that as soon as a strike happens, the first responders come, people gather, another strike will happen. So that's always one of the dangers. And keep in mind, Richard, that Kramatorsk is not far from where some of the most intense fighting occurs, and oftentimes, Kramatorsk is struck as a result. Bakhmut, for instance, is only about an hour's drive from here. So this city, alas is no stranger to strikes like this that killed civilians and soldiers alike -- Richard.",

But actually, what Putin outlined later in the day to another group of soldiers was the amount of money that Prigozhin had been making and his company Concord, another billion dollars have been making out of the government on different sorts of contracts, and suggested there could be financial irregularities with Wagner or Concord and that was going to be investigated.

Certainly, the Ukrainians suggested they are moving around Bakhmut, the symbolic city largely that Wagner fought so hard to get, the city center for the Russians. There are suggestions of incremental gains continuing in the southern- eastern areas at the front line and also a new set of movements by Ukraine they've claimed across the Antonivskyi Bridge near the city of Kherson, to the far west in the Dnipro River, where Kakhovka Dam was recently subjected to an explosion. Still at this point it's not the big breakthrough, not the sign of a Russian collapse that perhaps some analysts felt the turmoil in Moscow -- this is the phrase that Putin used -- turmoil might have necessarily led to. But it is still early and while we know that Wagner is likely pulling some forces back, they have not been omnipresent on the front lines. The units they've sent to Moscow will likely pull back and prepare a significant time before this weekend. You have to remember too, Richard, your average Russian soldier in a trench doesn't have a smartphone. They're often not allowed them so that they don't give their locations away. You can see lots of signals in the same place and Ukraine's occasionally hit that. So the news of this extraordinary weekend will slowly filter into the Russian front lines. It will obviously impact significantly damaged Russian morale. And then put that aside. If you have a Russian top brass, essentially freaking out about its own personal survival, its own position in the constellation around the Kremlin, their minds aren't on supply lines, tactics strategy, embellishing defense on those front lines. So there will be an enduring weakness but, fundamentally, I think that the real thing Ukraine will be hoping for here is if they continue to push along that front line, make Russia force itself into complicated choices. Are we going to put resources into Bakhmut or the southern front, not leave Crimea cut off? If the difficult decision goes up the chain to the top brass or even to Putin, their minds are elsewhere. They make terrible decisions at the moment. Do they make yet more terrible decisions and give Ukraine a strategic advantage? We'll have to wait for the days and weeks ahead. Richard.",

The concern, of course, in the U.S. and in Europe, to, it will be a repeat of summer's travel chaos, as particularly the 4th of July holiday approaches. Pete Muntean is our aviation correspondent. He is with us from Washington. I've had emails, you've had emails, from every airline telling us, bumper numbers, bumper numbers for July the 4th. Even if there are weather delays, because, of course, if you don't have your current air traffic controllers, you can't run the system. And it's optimal even with weather. Then you throw in these other issues. What is Scott Kirby saying?",

Scott Kirby from United Airlines says that the FAA really failed theairline over the weekend, because it simply didn't have enough air traffic controllers in Newark, which is a huge hub for United Airlines, not only here domestically in the U.S. but also internationally. That really caused a bottleneck of cascading delays not only on Saturday but then again on Sunday when weather hit. Now they're seeing again on Monday and today, into Tuesday. Just checked FlightAware, we've had about 2,000 delays nationwide. Actually scratch, that 4,000 delays nationwide; 1,300 cancellations and United has really taken it on the chin. About 774 delays, 424 cancellations. So it's a huge problem for the airline. It's because, it says, that the air traffic control system, run by the Federal Aviation Administration, simply does not have enough people. In fact, the Department of Transportation Office of Inspector General watchdog report, just released last week, said that there is a shortage of controllers at 75 percent. Three-quarters of air traffic control facilities across the U.S. So when bad thing, like weather happens, that makes it especially hard for these airlines, Richard, we both know so well, to recover from this. It really causes the deck of cards to come tumbling down. And you are seeing now on Tuesday, things are still bad for the airlines. They are still trying to recover at United Airlines, not just United but Delta, JetBlue, Southwest Airlines, all really hit by these problems. It's a nationwide issue. We have heard from folks simply trying to get to other places around the world. One woman trying to get to South Africa, saying that she couldn't get on her flight, had to stay on a cot in the airport. It is really dismal for some of these passengers. We are not out of the woods yet. So many people packing into flights over July 4th, it might not be over. Hopefully the weather will be good. Although the FAA staffing issue is not going away anytime soon.",
