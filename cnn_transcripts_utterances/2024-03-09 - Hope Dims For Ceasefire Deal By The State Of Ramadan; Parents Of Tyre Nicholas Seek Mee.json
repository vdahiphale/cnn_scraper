And we're going to zero in on the swing state voters their vote targeting with experts who know how to win them. Plus no ceasefire, no hostage deal before the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, and no relief to the humanitarian crisis. I'll speak with someone who says she's frustrated by who is being put out front to defend the U.S. strategy on Gaza. And the parents of Tyre Nichols, they were guests of President Biden's 2003 State of the Union. Well, now they want to meet with him after they say they were blindsided by a vote in the Tennessee State House. They will join me live. I'm Victor Blackwell. Let's start the show.The presidential race is heading to Georgia today. It will be the first weekend of the 2020 camp -- 2024 campaign, I should say where President Biden and former President Trump are again their party's presumptive nominees. So now it's time for the candidates to fine tune these messages and swing states that could decide the rematch. President Biden is framing his accomplishment as bringing people together.

So in order to do nothing, with stopping the bombing with stopping the oppression, frankly, of Palestinians, while juxtaposing that with black American civil rights struggle, I saw that as pretty darkly cynical.

And President Biden will rally voters here in Atlanta in the district represented by my next guest, Congresswoman Nikema Williams. She's also the chair of the Georgia Democratic Party. Thank you for coming into studio this morning. All right, so the latest state poll has the President a few points behind former President Trump's latest poll out from \"Fox News,\" 51 percent to 43 percent. How do you turn that around in Georgia?REP. NIKEMA WILLIAMS (D-GA): Well, first, thank you for having this conversation, Victor, because what people need to realize, it's a long time between now and November, and there was a \"Fox News\" poll. But between now and November, what we know is that we have to continue to have the conversation. Georgians have been counted out before when it comes to the presidential elections. When we flipped the state in 2020, we won for a Democrat for the first time in 28 years. So we understand that there's a lot of work that goes into this. Nothing is given. We're not a blue state. We're not a red state. We're periwinkle. So we have work to do. And we have to keep having that conversation.",
