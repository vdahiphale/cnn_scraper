We're breaking down a brand new forecast of Milton's potentially catastrophic power and path.And more than a million Floridians have now been ordered to evacuate and the governor is warning residents there's little if any time left to get out safely. This hour, I'll speak with local and federal officials about the devastating toll Milton could take on a region still reeling from Hurricane Helene. Plus, new revelations about Donald Trump's secret talks with Russia's Vladimir Putin while Trump was president and after. Stand by for details from a new book by the legendary journalist, Bob Woodward, that also describes President Biden's private complaints about Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu and much more. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. Let's get right to the breaking news on Hurricane Milton, regaining strength and growing in size big time. This monster storm is bearing down on Florida with landfall expected tomorrow night. We have teams standing by in the hurricane danger zone and over at CNN's Extreme Weather Center. Let's watch what's going on. CNN's Randi Kaye is in Sarasota, Florida, part of the Tampa Bay area that's bracing for a direct hit. Randi, are people there taking the evacuation orders seriously?",

If you're less than, let's call it, 25 feet above sea level, you really should leave, whether you're in Zone A, B, C, or whatever, anywhere from Anna Maria Island all the way down to Fort Myers. That's where the surge is going to be.And then right in the eye itself, which may be very close to Anna Maria Island, somewhere in there, you're going to have winds of 125 to 135 miles per hour. That will take off roofs and power lines and trees and all those things. But it's the surge, and I listened to Randi's package where there was five feet of water in the house, and it was actually a six-foot surge. This is forecast to be a 10 to 15-foot surge. So, the airplane is in it right now. We didn't have a plane in it for a very long time. Sun is setting on the hurricane. You can see kind of the ripples there as we look at that visible satellite. But here's the plane that looked on through. Now, I want you to go find your grandma, grandpa's aunts and uncle's barometer and try to find 26.72 inches of mercury on that barometer because it doesn't exist. It is so far below anything of reality. That's how low the pressure is. You wouldn't be on a modern barometer probably either, unless maybe it was digital. But as we see the impact, the track has changed slightly, moved to the south about 20 miles from that Anna Maria possibility, all the way down just a little bit farther to the north, obviously, of Sarasota and Bradenton. But we're talking about storm surge. It's the water that will be above the ocean level, the normal ocean level, whether it's 2, 3, 6, or for that matter, 8 or 10 or 15. There will be islands that get completely washed over by this surge. There will be homes that don't exist. There will be roads that will be gone. There will be bridges that will be gone. And then, of course, we have the possibility of a couple million people without power and then, of course, the loss of life. I'm trying to keep that to a minimum because I don't think I'm going to keep it to zero, Wolf, because people sometimes just refuse to leave, even when they know they should.",

Liz, thanks very much for coming in. I know you brief the president and other top officials hourly sometimes on what's going on. How bad is it going to get? LIZ SHERWOOD-RANDALL, WHITE HOUSE HOMELAND SECURITY ADVISER:  As you've heard in your broadcast, this is an extremely serious storm, a hurricane that's going to make landfall probably Category 4 or 5, very high storm surge, very high winds. And every person on the broadcast in an official capacity, law enforcement, Mayor Castor has said, get out while you can. And the president today said the same thing. He urged Americans who are in the communities that are in the storm's track to evacuate now. It's hard to leave. You don't know if you'll find your home when you come back. But you and your loved ones can save your lives if you move now. And we want to tell people if you're worried about where to find shelter, you can text shelter and your zip code and 43362. Again, text shelter and your zip code to 43362, and you will get back an answer where the nearest shelter is and how you can get there, what the directions are to that location.

FEMA has been on the ground. We've moved in heavy equipment. We're doing everything we can to support those who are doing the hard work to get that debris out of the way of the storm. But whatever is left could become very dangerous to those who are in the vicinity, another reason to get out of the way now.",

And speaking FEMA, as you know, Donald Trump, has been saying that FEMA is not necessarily even on the ground, that they're wasting a lot of money, they're giving money to migrants instead of helping the people who need it most.SHERWOOD-RANDALL:  You know, as the president said today, this is a situation in which people are scared and they need to trust their leadership to do the right thing. This government, this administration under President Biden and Vice President Harris' leadership is doing the right thing, surge in support to the people of Florida now in the form of search and rescue teams, Coast Guard teams, power restoration teams, ambulances, food and water, everything we can get in place in advance of the storm to help people. And then in the aftermath, we've got a thousand people on the ground already to help immediately with what has to happen after the storm passes through and anyone who is left behind, who is not evacuated, may need help. We need to be there for them. We need to help survivors who've had to move, come back into their communities as quickly as possible and assist them in putting their lives back together again. So, I will say about the misinformation and disinformation out there, our brave search and rescue teams, when they run toward danger in the wake of a hurricane like this, don't ask what someone's politics are before they save their lives.

We're making sure that everybody in the administration is focused on what we can do now. The president convened this meeting. It's 16 departments and agencies, the leadership of those departments and agencies today to give clear guidance to each of them about what he expects them to do to prepare for and respond to this storm, just as we are doing to respond to the impacts of Helene.

This is both in leading up to his invading Ukraine and during a very tense situation where our intelligence analysts felt that there was a 50 percent chance that Putin, who was sort of desperate on the battlefield in Ukraine, might actually use a nuclear weapon. So, in this part of the book, Woodward has Biden talking about Putin, and he says, quote, that effing Putin. Putin is evil. We are dealing with the epitome of evil.

There's stuff like chairs, tables, I've seen appliances, dishwashers, a water heater. You don't want that stuff, especially some of the construction equipment, there's cinder blocks as well and sheet metal, you don't want that stuff flying at your head at roughly 125 miles an hour, which is what forecasters are projecting will happen once Hurricane Milton makes landfall here.

And a lot of his policies were not popular.And so when you're trying to be the change candidate and then you say, well, there's nothing I would have done differently from what Joe Biden did, that's easy for your opposition to pick up on and say, wait a minute here, as the Trump campaign said, how can you turn the page if you thought there was nothing wrong before?",

We saw that from an ad that came out today. I think the change here is Kamala Harris will take care of Americans before she takes care of Vladimir Putin. I think that's a fundamental point here.Now, the next part of this, I think, for the Harris campaign is to define some places where they might want to be a little bit different than Biden. I think they've already talked about expanding the $35 insulin to more people than just seniors. They talked about getting $25,000 for homeowners, like trying to lower costs there. So, you have some policy agenda. The question they have to answer though is the people who want to hear about some policy change that's going to be different than Joe Biden are those people really the ones who are available to her to swing and sway for this election, or is that just a talking point for some of the Trump folks who are trying to needle her to get her to distance herself from the president that she can't be distanced from because she was his vice president?",
