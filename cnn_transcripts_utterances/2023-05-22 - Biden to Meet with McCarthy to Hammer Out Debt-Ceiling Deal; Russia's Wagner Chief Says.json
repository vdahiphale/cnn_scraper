He doesn't have the kind of negotiating room that he would have if he had a larger Republican majority.In the back of his mind, has to be this reality that he is going to lose conservative votes. If he actually makes a bipartisan deal with President Joe Biden. And that calculus, whether or not he is going to be willing to potentially put his speakership on the line for that deal is something that is looming large in these negotiations. Also looming large is the reality that these two men have a very untested relationship. They really haven't spent that much one-on-one time together. They never spent that much time in the previous two years, when Biden was president and you had McCarthy, who was in the minority at that point. So there is a huge question mark right now, whether or not their relationship really can get this deal over the finish line. Like Arlette mentioned, the negotiations over the weekend happened in fits and starts. With both sides trading back and forth proposals that the other side argued were unreasonable, I talked to one Republican last night who told me that they feel like right now, this deal is just hanging by a thread. Whether or not they can actually find a way forward is a major question mark. And like you noted, time is running short. To move this through the House of Representatives would take several days, at least 72 hours for members to look at a plan and then vote on it. In the Senate, it could take even longer. Now, that's always possible that they could move more expeditiously. But as Kevin McCarthy noted over the weekend, he has been planning for potentially the Senate to need seven days. Maybe they need less than that. But that just gives you a sense of how short we are running on time.",

Tenth of -- so you have the Treasury Department that will be having a \"Hunger Games\" of sorts of which bills to pay. So you're talking about IOUs for service members. That's one option.

CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Poppy. It's really murky, because of course, we've got the Ukrainian side of the story, then Russian side and then in the mix, also Wagner. So a lot of competing versions of events. What we know as of this morning from the Russian side, Russian-backed official in the region is saying that they have started demining operations in the city, trying to make a show of some kind of post- liberation cleanup there. The Wagner chief, Yevgeny Prigozhin, is saying that they are putting up defense lines on the Western edge of the city. And he is preparing to leave, he says, with his forces starting on Thursday. Perhaps that and other challenge to the Russian ministry of defense. The infighting that we've seen in recent weeks. As for the Ukrainian side, we've just had an update with the deputy defense minister, with a completely different version. As we've seen, she said that fighting continues, Ukraine continues to advance, albeit with a lower intensity, on the flanks. We know that some of the gains they've made recently, most of them, in fact, have been on Northwest and the Southwest of the city, perhaps an attempt to try to encircle that city. And she also said that they retained control of certain industrial facilities and private houses, although Ukrainian officials do acknowledge that any lands they control within the town itself is extremely limited. We've known that now for several weeks. So, clearly, this has huge propaganda value for Russia.

And I think the fact that Nikki Haley and Tim Scott, you know, are both running speaks to, I think, the deeper diversity of the Republican bench in the South than people sometimes think. And I think both are going to be very -- play significant roles. Not only because they stand out from the pack in obvious ways. The only African-American in the Senate. But because Tim Scott's message, he's going to be selling something that traditionally, people who run for president sell. That, you know, no one in the era of Trump seems to be doing, which is doubling down on the defiant optimism, right? He's saying the mess of this country is opportunity, not oppression. That could sell very well to a national audience, as well as a Republican primary.",

This is kind of thing most Republicans don't get.
