Republican nominee Donald Trump appears to have changed his stance on Florida's six-week abortion ban. He is also refusing to commit to vetoing a possible federal ban.And Democratic nominee Kamala Harris has fired back at Trump with a strong response to his comments on abortion. The Republican presidential nominee says he will vote no on a constitutional amendment in Florida, his home state, that would allow abortions there after the first six weeks of pregnancy. Well, Florida law currently bans abortions after six weeks. The amendment will be on the state's ballot in November. It's another reversal for Trump, who has previously said he's against a six-week ban but will now effectively vote for such a ban by voting against the amendment. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Israel says it has completed ground operations in parts of southern Gaza. And it's allowing residents to return to their homes. However, many Palestinians are finding their homes destroyed and their neighborhoods in ruins. The Israel Defense Forces said it eliminated more than 250 of what it called terrorists and destroyed a so-called terrorist infrastructure. Meanwhile an Israeli strike on a humanitarian convoy in Gaza killed four transport workers on Thursday. The convoy set out from Kerem Shalom crossing for a hospital in Rafah. The aid group, American Near East Refugee Aid, says there was confusion over the travel plans and the four victims decided to ride in the lead vehicle. But it not been cleared by Israeli authorities. The IDF says it attacked the lead car because the men inside appeared to be armed, a breach of the agreed plan.

The Ukrainians are saying, essentially they want to present the U.S. with a list of targets inside Russia that they want permission from the U.S. to be able to hit with some of the weapons that the United States has given to the Ukrainians. Now, of course, the U.S. has given the Ukrainians some weapons that can travel a considerable distance but so far the Ukrainians are only allowed to use those weapons to strike Ukrainian territory that is occupied by the Russians and some territories very close to the border between Ukraine and Russia. The Ukrainians clearly want to open that up. They believe that is key to their effort to try and stop Russia's advances in certain places but also for their own troops to be able to advance further into Russian territory. Right now, we have a situation here in Ukraine where the Ukrainian military is still advancing further into Russian territory in the Kursk Region. There have been some gains that the Ukrainians say that they have made overnight. On the one hand, it's also still remarkable that the Ukrainians are able to advance even more than three weeks into the beginning of that incursion into Russian territory. On the other hand, the Ukrainians are having serious problems in the east of Ukraine, in the eastern front, as they call it, especially in the region around the key town of Pokrovsk. The Russians in that area are not making huge gains but they're definitely making steady gains. And the Ukrainians say the biggest problem that they have down in that area is that their forces are simply outmanned. The Ukrainian general command has said that they want to beef up their forces in that area to try and at least spot stop the Russians and maybe even push them back -- Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Kyiv.

      "sentences": "A feud between a billionaire and a supreme court justice, what could go wrong?Well, now 200 million people in Brazil are no longer able to access X. Not only that but those who try to, the court say, will be hit with a fine of almost $10,000 a day if they tried to access the site via a VPN. All providers in the country are now blocking the website from mobiles and other devices. Now Elon Musk took that to X and said that the oppressive regime in Brazil is so afraid of the people learning the truth that they will bankrupt anyone who tries the oppressive regime. He's talking about is the supreme court specifically, supreme court justice Alexandre de Moraes. He has been the lead in an investigation that's been sweeping Brazil over misinformation and hate speech online that the court says might have the intent to undermine democracy. This includes the Big Lie of Brazil, that the election was stolen, that there were fraud, fraudulent voting happening along those lines in the elections all the way back to 2019. This rhetoric has been escalating. And this is the government's attempt to tame it. Now Musk has basically refused to comply with some of the orders of the court to terminate some accounts on X. He said that he will not give into this kind of censorship. He called the supreme court dictators and said that he will stand by allowing people to say what they want on his platform. Now he's also been hit at this point with this closure after removing all of the representation of X in the country. Now no company can actually operate in Brazil without representation this is why we got to the place that we did. Now another company led by Musk might also be affected in this. That's Starlink. That provides internet service for many remote regions in Brazil, up to 250,000 users. And they could also be affected as the assets of that company become frozen. Musk says he will continue to operate in the country and will now give the services for free -- Julia Vargas Jones, CNN, New York. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Well, technology allows us to stay connected to our jobs through emails, texts and phone calls all the time. But workers in Australia now have the right to disconnect from work during the off hours. It's a new rule that allows employees to refuse to answer calls or respond to texts and emails from their bosses unless it's an emergency. CNN's Kristie Lu Stout has the details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  For all of Australia's beauty and relaxed reputation, it might be hard to imagine that many people here feel overworked. But according to some lawmakers, Australians are working an average of six weeks unpaid overtime every year. And so the government has stepped in to protect people's right to disconnect. As of Monday, people won't have to answer out-of-hours calls, texts or emails.",

NOVAK DJOKOVIC, WORLD NUMBER 1 TENNIS PLAYER:  I try to, you know, try my best. I mean, I didn't have any physical issues. I just felt out of gas.
