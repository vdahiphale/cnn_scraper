And the country in this race is whether Donald Trump is fit to be president or whether he is a threat to American democracy as we have known it.And the other leading candidates, with only a few exceptions like Chris Christie, maybe Mike Pence in his way, they have knotted themselves into pretzels to avoid addressing that issue. And as Christie said, that's been a moral failure, but it's also been in practical political terms a failure because it's left them contorting themselves trying to find a meaningful distinction with Trump.",
