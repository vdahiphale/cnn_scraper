When someone says, you know, we need help, and then you can be the person to go and deliver that help, that`s very rewarding. There`s nothing tangible that you get given for it. It`s just a sense of pride. I`ll be with the service for as long as I can be, but whether that`s time and an able body, or whether it just ends up not maybe being an able body. I`m just one of those old guys telling war stories. If it`s of benefit, I`ll be here for as long as they`ll have me. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

There was a generalmanager back in 1933 that went on a duck hunting trip with a friend of his over in Arkansas. As a practical joke, they decided to bring back the live duck decoys that they were using and set them loose inside that fountain. Now, when the general manager woke back up the next morning in a clear mindset, I`m sure he probably got up and was like, when he got down here, there was a crowd of people standing around the fountain staring at these ducks. So that led to ducks living in the fountain. But then seven years later, a man by the name of Edward Pembroke just so happened that he was an animal trainer in the Ringling Brothers in Barnum in Bailey Circus as a young man. And he was the one that came up with the idea of turning the ducks that`s living in the fountain into a ceremony. I have the honor and the pleasure of marching the ducks for you all this morning. My title here at the Peabody Hotel is of the Duckmaster. A very unusual title to hold. It`s my job to train the team of ducks that we have here and they have a $200,000 Duck Palace upstairs on the rooftop. There would be at least two to 300 people on the busy days. The number of people doing the duck march, we`re talking into the thousand.",
