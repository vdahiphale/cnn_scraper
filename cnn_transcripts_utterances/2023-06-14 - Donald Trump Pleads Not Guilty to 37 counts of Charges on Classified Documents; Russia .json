Russia doesn't have enough drones, warplanes or ammunition. And if the Russian president hoped his invasion of Ukraine would put a strain on NATO relations that may have backfired, President Biden says NATO allies have never been more united in his meeting with the NATO secretary general. Former U.S. President Donald Trump is coming out swinging after being arrested and arraigned on federal charges. He pleaded not guilty at a Miami federal courthouse to 37 counts in the classified documents case. After leaving court, he went to a popular restaurant where supporters sang happy birthday to him since he turned 77 today. And he said, some birthday, we got a government that is out of control. Trump also called the country corrupt and rigged. Then because the judge imposed no travel restrictions, he went to his Bedminster, New Jersey golf club to fundraise off the outrage. Trump told supporters that the latest legal action marks the most evil and heinous abuse of power in American history. And he accused President Joe Biden of drumming up the fake and fabricated charges. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He had his arms folded, twiddling his thumbs, mostly facing forward as the judge spoke to him about the case. His attorney, Todd Blanch, entered the not guilty plea on his behalf, which is unusual. In most cases, defendants are required to stand up and address the judge and say they plead not guilty. His co-defendant, Walt Nauta, is going to have to come back because he didn't have a lawyer present who could operate here at the federal courthouse in Miami. One of the interesting developments in the court hearing today was the judge ordering the former president to not discuss the charges with Walt Nauta, his co-defendant, or with any other witness, which is, of course, an interesting restriction. The Former President is facing the fact that a lot of people who work for him at the Trump organization at Mar-a-Lago were witnesses in this case. And his attorneys raised some concerns about that.

At least three people were killed and 13 wounded in the port city of Odessa. Ukrainian officials say multiple commercial establishments in a residential complex have been damaged and people may still be trapped under the rubble. Military officials say three people were also killed in the Donetsk region due to shelling. This comes as Ukraine makes progress in its counteroffensive. A Ukrainian military official says they're gaining ground in the East and quote, \"systematically destroying Russian manpower and equipment.\" Ukraine says its fighters are also pressuring Russian forces near Bakhmut, and Russia is losing ground around the embattled city.

A lot of the times it saved my life, he says. It saves our lives every day from shrapnel, shelling and bullets. But some of the vehicles have already been lost and the Russians continue to fire back. Constant artillery shelling and even airstrikes too close for comfort as our crew had to duck for cover. Still, the deputy brigade commander says his soldiers are just getting started. Our counterattack will definitely be successful, he says. We believe in victory. We are moving forward towards our goal. We are advancing.

According to a Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs readout of this meeting, it said that Qin Gang assessed the status quo of the U.S.- China relationship, saying that it encountered new challenges and difficulties while adding that the responsibility is clear. According to the readout, it also added this. Let's bring up an excerpt for you. Quote, \"It is hoped that the U.S. will take practical actions to implement the important consensus reached by the two heads of state in Bali, making reference to the G20 meeting in November last year and effectively manage differences,\" unquote. The ministry also called on the U.S. to stabilize and to return to the track of healthy development. The U.S. State Department also acknowledged that this meeting took place with a statement. And the U.S. Secretary of State took to Twitter to provide this statement. Let's bring it up for you in a tweet. Secretary Blinken said, quote, \"spoke tonight with PRC State Counselor and Foreign Minister Qin Gang by phone. We discussed ongoing efforts to maintain open channels of communication as well as bilateral and global issues.\" Now sources, including two U.S. officials, tell CNN that Blinken is bound for Beijing in the coming weeks. He was originally due to visit Beijing back in February, but that trip of course was delayed because of the Chinese spy balloon incident. The phone call that just took place is happening at a time of deep tension between these two global superpowers, especially as the White House accuses the Chinese military of increasingly aggressive behavior. You had most recently that near miss that took place in the Taiwan Strait between the Chinese warship, as well as the US worship. Tension is ongoing over a whole raft of issues from territorial disputes, Taiwan, trade, access to sensitive technology like chips. The list goes on, but yet both sides are talking, both sides are engaging with one another. Last month you had that high profile meeting in Vienna between Jake Sullivan and Wang Yi, another top Chinese official, a meeting that was described at the time as being candid and constructive. It was also reported that the CIA director visited Beijing last month, a trip that only came to light publicly this month. And earlier this month in June, you had the U.S. Commerce Secretary, as well as a U.S. Trade Representative, have meetings with the Chinese Commerce Minister in the United States, and the latest form of engagement between the U.S. and China we're seeing now with this phone call between Qin Gang, the Foreign Minister of China, and the U.S. Secretary of State, setting the stage for Blinken's long anticipated visit to Beijing.

Now we've heard from the chief of staff of the SDF, Yasunori Morishita, and he said he has launched an investigation adding, quote, \"This kind of incident should never happen in an organization that handles weapons.\" Now gun crime as a whole is very rare in Japan itself. Last year, for example, there were just nine firearms incidents for the entire year, one of those, of course, being the very high profile assassination of the former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on the streets as he was giving a campaign speech. But usually any firearms incidents are either gang related or very rare indeed. There are the police, for example, the military who are allowed to have guns. But beyond that, the rules are extremely tight. Gun ownership is so low because it is so restrictive and so difficult to be able to get a gun. In this case, however, of course, it is slightly different because this is a situation where guns were present. It was a live fire drill at a unit, we understand, in Gifu Prefecture in the center of Japan.

In fighting and chaos in Trump's legal circles is nothing new, analysts say, and it's often due to a client who's notorious for not listening to legal advice.",

If she doesn't recuse herself, I hope that the lessons learned from the way she made rulings in the earlier matter related to the handling of these documents being reversed not once but twice by the conservative 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, has taught her that her job as a judge is not to make rulings favorable to Donald Trump simply because he appointed her, but to do her duties under the Constitution.And that would be to allow this case to move forward in a fair and impartial manner. But she does have, if she remains on this case, she will have a great deal of power, a power with respect to scheduling of when this case moves forward, a power with respect to the motions that will be filed and how those motions will be handled, how they will be ruled on. She will control to some degree the evidence that will be admitted during the trial process. We know there's a big question about the evidence. coming from Evan Corcoran, Trump's lawyer. Will she allow that evidence to be in or will she quash that evidence? So there are some legitimate, I think, concerns about how she will handle this case if she does remain on the case as the judge. But I hope that she will remain true to her duties and obligations under the Constitution.",

It's a small district, and they knew that there were limited choices with respect to who might preside over this trial. So I think the Department of Justice has already factored in to the equation of trying Donald Trump in Florida that she could be the judge. And I think, like the rest of the American people, they are hoping that this judge will do her job, that she will not act as a partisan representative for Donald Trump, but she will act as an impartial jurist, which is her job under the Constitution. I believe that the Department of Justice believes that its case is so strong, based on the allegations outlined in the indictment, that this is a case where they can get a conviction no matter who is the judge.",

For more, let's go to CNN's Stephanie Busari live in Lagos, Nigeria. Stephanie, what are we learning about what took place? STEPHANIE BUSARI, CNN AFRICA SR. EDITOR: Rosemary, details are still emerging about this tragic accident that took place in aftermath of a wedding party. We're in the height of rainy season here in Nigeria and this community in north-central Nigeria is badly flooded and the roads not usable. So guests -- some of the guests after the party decided to get on boats and unfortunately the boat hit a tree trunk as you said and capsized. Now many of these passengers would not have been wearing safety jackets and the boat certainly would have been overloaded. A local chief told us that there were about 300 passengers that got on that boat.
