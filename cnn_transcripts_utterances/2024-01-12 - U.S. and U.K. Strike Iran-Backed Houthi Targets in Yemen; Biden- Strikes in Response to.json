Last night, the United States and Britain hitting dozens of Houthi military targets in Yemen. That is the Iran-backed rebel group.The Biden administration saying the airstrikes are self-defense. The Houthis have launched a string of drone and missile attacks in the Red Sea, which have wreaked havoc on that vital shipping lane.",

The U.S. and the U.K. acting in a kinetic fashion, that means actually hitting targets here, but with the backing of several other countries, including Australia, Canada, Bahrain, and the Netherlands.So that gives you an idea of the amount of planning, preparation, and coordination that had to go into an attack like this. There's now a briefing going on about the operation itself. We have learned there were a total of 28 sites struck, more than 150 precision-guided munitions used. You have seen some of the videos and images here. This is video from Yemen of those strikes as they took place. Again, nearly 30 sites hit belonging to the Houthis, the Iranian proxy rebel group that controls western Yemen across a number of cities there, including Hudaydah, one of the important cities right on the coast there of the Red Sea. The U.S., the U.K. and others felt this was necessary after repeated Houthi attacks on international shipping lanes in the Red Sea. And that very narrow strait there, the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, one of the world's most critical waterways. The U.S. had tried to apply diplomatic pressure, including through a U.N. Security Council resolution, but the Houthi attacks kept coming, at least 27. And we just learned a short time ago about another attempt earlier today from the Houthis to launch anti-ship ballistic missiles, so perhaps now 28 attacks on international shipping lanes, including one after the U.S. and U.K. operations. So the Houthis not backing down here. They're now saying that any U.S. and U.K. asset is a legitimate target for them. And there is an expectation that this isn't just pure bluster or rhetoric that the Houthis will try to find some way to respond. Boris and Brianna, it's worth pointing out that they have options here should they choose to, and they have the capabilities to do so, either U.S. vessels in the Red Sea, U.S. bases in the Middle East or they could target U.S. allies there, too.",

They had promised the attacks would continue. They have said these are standing in solidarity with the Palestinian people and against the war in Gaza, standing against Israel, though it's hard to see how that is with about 2,000 kilometers of Saudi Arabia between Yemen and Israel.But that was the reason given and the attacks continued. Worth noting that the U.S. called these self-defense strikes and we're still asking about this. The Biden administration says American vessels came under direct attack from the Houthis over the course of the past couple of days. We're waiting to learn what vessels specifically. But clearly, the U.S. and the U.K. felt compelled to act, given simply the repeated nature of the attacks on one of the world's most critical waterways.",
