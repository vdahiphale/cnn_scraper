According to a GoFundMe page for that teenager, she enjoyed playing softball and was a student-athlete. The following day, on Friday, the body of a 17-year-old boy was also found on the side of another road not too far from where Silvernail was found. And then on Saturday, a 16-year-old girl -- the body of that girl was found inside of a car that was submerged in some water.

And while protesters were outside the chamber demanding action on gun control, inside those lawmakers took over the session with bullhorns, and now they are facing possible removal from office.On Monday, there were more protests in the House chamber, this time over the possible removal of three Democratic lawmakers. That vote, by the way, to decide if they're going to lose their job -- that vote happens tomorrow. One of those lawmakers is Rep. Justin Jones. He posted this video to social media and says it shows Republican State Rep. Justin Lafferty pushing him and grabbing his phone. Police are reportedly looking into that matter. I should note that Rep. Lafferty has put out a statement saying, quote, \"...Jones came to my desk and as I turned he shoved his phone into my face in a threatening manner. I reacted as anyone would. Attempts to characterize this as anything else are misleading and false.\" So with me now is Democratic State Rep. Justin Jones who represents Nashville. Representative Jones, thank you very much. I want to keep our eye focused on what's happening, right? We wanted to explain that confrontation to our -- to our viewers. But you're at risk of losing your job tomorrow. If you lose your job for taking the floor in the way you did to call for more action on guns, will it have been worth it? REP. JUSTIN JONES, (D) TENNESSEE STATE HOUSE:  Well, thank you so much for having me on today. And I think -- I mean, it's morally insane that a week after a mass shooting took six precious lives in my community here in Nashville, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle -- their first action is not to take actions to rein in this proliferation of weapons of war in our streets, but it's to expel their colleagues for standing with our constituents. And so this is not just about losing my job, it's about silencing the voices of over 70,000 people in my district. Altogether, the three of us represent over 200,000 people whose voices are being taken and silenced by a party that is acting like authoritarians. I mean, it's very concerning and it represents a clear and present danger to democracy all across this nation. That should trouble us all.",

Took the focus off their families. This is a pair of tweets from our -- you know, took the focus off the voices of other protesters. And I wonder how you respond to that.J. JONES:  That we went up to the well because our people were continually silenced. Protesters were silenced. The Speaker of the House refused to let any member speak on the issue of guns, and so he shut down Democratic debate. And so we found a way to get in the way to get in good trouble, as John Lewis called it, because that's what was needed. That he was shutting the microphone off the movement of the people -- and that's why we had a megaphone because he shut off the microphone on the people. And the Speaker of the House is now, once again, trying to silence voices by trying to oust us. Voices of opposition. Voices trying to hold him accountable for his proliferation of guns --",

That our State Constitution, Article II gives -- which gives representatives the right to dissent from and protest against legislation and actions that are injurious to the people -- Article II, Section 27. And so we -- you know, we believe that we were acting in the spirit of our State Constitution and the United States Constitution to voice the concerns and grievances of our constituents. That's why thousands of people gathered with us on Thursday once again, and Monday. And they'll be back this Thursday where we're ousted -- when they threaten to oust us because the people are saying that this is an attack on democracy. This is an attack on the voice calling for action to rein in its proliferation of weapons of war on our streets. And so this is -- this is -- should concern people all across the nation.
