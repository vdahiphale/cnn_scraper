The former President claiming that he cooperated with the Feds, which he didn't, also alleging that Biden did not, which he did. The White House is blasting the report as politically-motivated, and certainly a political headache. Meanwhile, a potential Trump running mate tells me that she would not have done what Mike Pence did, on January 6th, you know, abiding by that thing called the Constitution? The apparent new Republican litmus test for the second-in-line to the presidency. Also tonight, Israel's Prime Minister wants its military to have plans, to evacuate Rafah, where over a million Palestinians are sheltering, as the White House is warning that military action there would be a quote, \"Disaster.\" I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. When the history books are written, about the 2024 presidential election, there will be a lot to say, about just the last 24 hours alone. Americans now left to wonder if the current president is competent, and if the former President, his likely opponent, is a criminal. With that as the backdrop here, Donald Trump is wasting no time, jumping all over President Biden, after he was not charged, over his handling of classified documents that were found in his Delaware home. The White House, meanwhile, is training its fire at the Special Counsel, who cleared Biden, of those charges, but also branded him as an old man who has frequent trouble with his memory.

And it's got to explain what he found, and why he is either pursuing or declining charges. And to be clear, Rob Hur's report checks those boxes. In great detail, lays out what he found, and of course, why he's not pursuing charges. The difference with the situation with Jim Comey, Jim was not a Special Counsel. He was not under any sort of obligation, certainly not under an obligation, to make a public statement, about what we thought of the investigation, we had conducted into the emails. Jim felt that it was important and necessary, for the public to understand, for us to be transparent, about what we found, and what we thought about the case, because the case had been so public, since its inception. The public knew about the investigation before we ever even got it from the -- from the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community. So, there was so much anticipation that Jim felt that there was no one in a better position than us. We had done the investigation, and we should go out and tell the public what our conclusion was. And I think that was, you now, those were questionable decisions. I think where we stepped far over the line, and made a mistake was in Jim's rhetoric, clearly criticizing Hillary Clinton, but of course not recommending that she be charged.

Jim made the decision, to go forward in the way he did. And I think that the effect of that statement, I mean, who's to say how great of an effect it had on the -- on the election.

It's question -- I have all kinds of questions, why, in several places, he says that President Biden willfully retained national defense information, and then goes on to say, after page 200, that the evidence to -- there is insufficient evidence to support that conclusion, and that's why he wasn't pursuing charges.

And so, they are pushing something that is untrue. Two, they don't believe it, but they are willing to cheat to win an election. Or three, particularly what Whatley is saying, who is the North Carolina Republican Party Chair, and potentially the next National Republican Party Chair, that he speaks of urban centers that have voters of color, or people of color, who showed up, in record number, to elect someone, who was not Donald Trump. And so, there is an effort, potentially, to disenfranchise those voters. Regardless of any of the three reasons why they would be saying it, it's problematic, and it's anti-democratic, and it's why it's so troubling that Donald Trump continues to be the front leader. But I'm not just going to give these folks a pass. And I appreciate Scott saying it's performative, and saying it's performative. These folks are leaders. Well, they're supposed to be leaders. And so, I expect more than performance. I actually suspect -- expect some substance, and for them to do the right thing. And for Stefanik, in that interview, the other night, when you continued to ask her, and she just flat-out said she wouldn't have done it, should never be held -- holding office. She shouldn't even be in the Congress, right now, if she actually thinks that that is what should have happened, on January 6, or that's what she would do, if she was Vice President. That is extremely troubling, and voters should be paying attention to that.",

He's saying they're being indiscriminate? It's unclear. Look, I think there are things we should do to try and assist the Israelis, right? Are there U.S. Military planners over there, helping them, looking over their shoulders, just to make sure that is consistent with the laws of war, or that limits collateral damage, something that we take special care for? Maybe there are other things they could try. Maybe they should suspend airstrikes, for a while, and make this really a ground-based attack and focus. So, I think we need some more clarity there. On the other hand, look, I think part of the problem is that Netanyahu is not clear, about what he intends to accomplish here. He keeps talking about defeating Hamas, which is not going to be possible. It's an ideology. You're never going to kill every last fighter. So, I think if he would define more of what he wants to do, for example, take out their senior leadership, and destroy their means of attacking Israel, which would mean getting into the tunnels? Then that gives you a little more -- a little bit more specificity, and seems like more realistic objectives to achieve. So, look, there's a lot of imprecision here. I think the Israelis continuing the need to work to do better. But clearly, they have the right to self-defense. And we can't forget about what happened October, what -- on October 7th, and what Hamas has continued to pledge to do, time and time again.",
