It is 2 o'clock in the morning, Thursday,in Guam where residents are facing a long and terrifying night as Typhoon Mawa roars through the island. The eye of the storm past north of the U.S. territory, but its eye wall, that's the strongest part of the typhoon, is lashing the island with heavy rainfall and ferocious winds. Most of the island is in the dark as the power grid has been impacted by the storm. The Weather Service has issued warning for flash flooding, landslides and storm surges, as well. The governor ordered the evacuation of low-lying coastal areas earlier this week. CNN Meteorologist Derek Van Dam is with us live now from the CNN Weather Center. We knew this was gonna be bad but just in terms of the wind and the rains, this is historic. Just set the scene for us in terms of what people in Guam right now are going through. It's two o'clock in the morning. So what are they experiencing?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, well first of all, it's dark. It's terrifying moments for those residents, the people who are on the islandright now. Because take it from me, who has been through this, riding out a hurricane or a typhoon of this strength in the middle of the night with no power is absolutely terrifying to say the least. Now, the silver lining out of all of this is that they didn't get a direct landfalling storm. Even though they've got lashed with very heavy winds and strong heavy rain, the worst part of the storm actually just veered to the north. And in fact, I went through what is called an eyewall replacement cycle and why that's important is because it kind of leveled off the intensity briefly before it reached Guam. And now that it's north and west of the island, the U.S. territory, it's starting to show signs of re strengthening again. So, this system is going to continue to get stronger as it moves into the open waters of the Western Pacific. It is kind of clearing out the eye wall. And there was a moment across Northern Guam where they had issued an extreme wind warning, that's the National Weather Services wording that they use for only the rarest of moments when winds are so strong that they pose a danger to life and property, and you can certainly see that with the winds howling there in the middle of the night 220 kilometers per hour. There's the clearing in the eye that is assigned to the meteorologist that this storm is starting to get restructured and reorganized. So, what are the threats going forward for Guam? Well, we still have heavy rain and tropical storm force winds, so conditions are slowly going to improve through the next six to 12 hours. But you can see gusts over 100 kilometers per hour as it stands. That is powerful. Look at the amount of rain that's fallen over 500 millimeters. Flash flood warnings in effect, and more rain is in store for the system as it slowly starts to pull away over the next 24 hours. We're still in the thick of it. We need to get through this overnight period and into the day on Thursday before we can really start to assess the full scale of the damage. Zain.",

Russia is vowing to respond extremely harshly to further attacks on its soil that Moscow is blaming on Ukrainian militants. The governor of the Western Belgrade region says that nine people were injured in drone strikes overnight. It comes two days after a daring ground assault inside Russia. Anti-Putin Russians claimed they crossed the border from Ukraine to carry out the attack. That prompted some high-profile criticism from a key Kremlin ally who says that Moscow isn't able to protect its own territory. Yevgeny Prigozhin, also called Ukraine's army, one of the strongest in the world. CNN's Fred Pleitgen joins us live now from Kyiv.

About a year ago, I think that there were many Republicans who were hoping that by now we would see a strong alternative to Donald Trump emerge on the Republican stage in terms of who's gonna run for president. Ron DeSantis was supposed to be the alternative. He was supposed to be Trump without the baggage but there are some say look, he does not have the charisma. And when you look at recent polling actually just new CNN polling came out about 15 minutes ago showing that Trump is in the lead in terms of the party 53 percent, DeSantis 26 percent.

The abortion issue just proved to be a losing issue for Republicans and Donald Trump, of course, enabled that to happen, the overturning of Roe vs. Wade. So what happened?

Remember his announcement speech down at Mar-a-Lago in November which was very subdued, rambling, a littleboring, and it looked like Trump was the past. And at that point DeSantis, who's young, he's energetic, he's passing bill after bill after bill of MAGA, \"Make America Great Again\" ideology. Logically, he looks like a much better bet, even if you might question whether he's going to be any more appealing to some of those swing state voters than Trump. I just feel that the Trump appeal is emotional. It's not logical. It's not even political. And I think Trump has done quite a good job at re- establishing himself over the party. This narrative that he's created, that he is the -- he's being persecuted with all these investigations against him, with the indictment and the case in New York, I think, is effective and has brought some Republican voters closer to his side. But again, you know, this is very early. Twenty-six percent that Ron DeSantis has in that poll is not nothing. We don't know how the cascading set of investigations around Trump will play. If you look back to the 2008 campaign, for example, in the Democratic side, at this point Barack Obama, after a great flourish and a lot of popularity, spent six months really struggling to find his feet in the Democratic campaign. Ron DeSantis has never been a national candidate before. He's in Florida, which is a lot safer politically, given the Republican orientation and the representation of Republicans in the statehouse there. It's gonna take him a little time, so I don't think we should rule out the fact that he might be able to find his feet and become a stronger challenger to Trump, especially if a lot of these other candidates who are currently in the race don't catch fire and he's able to consolidate the anti-Trump vote. But the question still remains is, how is he going to take on Trump? And why would a Republican who still likes Trump change their mind and decide they're gonna go with DeSantis?",

This is when the most intense winds and rain hit. The U.S. National Weather Service, Guam, reports maximum sustained winds of 140 miles an hour. That's 225 kilometers an hour, packing quite a punch. They said that the weather service building was being hammered and that the doors and windows were rumbling and vibrating, they could hear the howling winds and things breaking outside.

You're looking at the innocent souls who lost their lives that day. While the shooting itself may, of course, horrified America so did too the fact that it took police so long to act.

This happened last year on what was the last day of school, there were awards, kids were in class watching a movie just to sort of end the last day of school. Some parents had the opportunity to take their kids home early. They chose and said, you know what, let me allow my kids to stay here and continue having fun and spending time with their friends. And sadly, we know what happened right after that. And so for this whole entire year, the families have been living with the loss of their children. But what's made everything so different here and much more complicated is this failed response from law enforcement and the fact that there's been no accountability, there's been no transparency, there is a lot of infighting in these different organizations and law enforcement agencies, people pointing fingers at each other about who did what wrong. And the families, all they're asking for is A, the people who were in charge that day need to be held accountable, and B, we need to know exactly what happened to our kids. We need to know how they died, how they suffered, what pain, if any, they had, because we need some closure and understanding. And then for the survivors, certainly, living in this community, going back to the same school system has been really difficult. Some of them are not going back to school. They're too scared to go back to school. The building behind me is that school. It's closed. People today are coming. They're laying flowers and there are crosses with the names of the kids who died and the two teachers, the 19 kids and then the two teachers. The other thing is parents just recently had an opportunity to go back to the school, to visit, to see that classroom, finally. Close to a year they were granted permission and they say it was, of course, the saddest moment for them realizing that they were standing in the place where their kids died and now they're waiting to build a memorial behind me but they need for the building to be demolished. So, that's the next big step here is to have this building demolished so that they can build a memorial, which is what they're going to do today. Today is going to be a day about remembering their kids and a day for this community which has been so divided to come together and to remember the people who died.",

What we've noticed is that enforcement acrossthe country, when they have their press conferences after their mass shootings that have occurred since Uvalde, they're all very insistent that they went straight into the fire. So, if nothing else, Uvalde brought back the training that the first responders go in hard and fast and not wait around like they did in Uvalde.

You know,as I mentioned, prior to talking to you, there have been over 241 mass shootings in this country just so far this year. That is a staggering amount. When you think about, I mean, I'm from the U.K., when you think about what happens in other countries, you know, in the U.K., we had just one elementary school shooting, Dunblane, in the late 1990s, and it pretty much never happened again. Australia also had one mass shooting in the mid-90s, as well, again, never happened again. Because after those mass shootings, everybody, community members, parents, politicians, everybody got together to make significant changes. We're seeing a sort of similar movement in Serbia right now where there have been a couple of mass shootings quite close together. You know, for these other countries, it's only taken one, you know, I'm talking about the U.K. and Australia, for example, it's only taken one. Why in the U.K. has it taken, and does it continue to take, hundreds, if not thousands, if you add them up over many years?",

They have had a -- they have presented a them versus us that for some reason the government was going to come and take their guns so they have been adamant that that's not going to happen. It causes a polarization in that particular arena that we are working in. And it just does not allow movement. They use an argument of a slippery slope that if you ban one gun or if you regulate one gun that you're soon coming for all guns. We know that is obviously not the case, but what they have on their side is a Second Amendment to the Constitution. So, they look at that and they use half of it, they use the second half. They ignore the first half of an amendment and then they fight from that position. And they are very, I have to say, they are very good at their arguments.
