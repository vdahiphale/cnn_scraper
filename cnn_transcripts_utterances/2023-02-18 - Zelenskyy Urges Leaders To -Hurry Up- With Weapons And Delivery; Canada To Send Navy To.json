The U.S. has been a big supplier of weapons and equipment to Ukraine and Harris is leading a large American delegation to that conference.Friday, she met with French president Emmanuel Macron, who said Europe's stability depends on defeating Russia in Ukraine. And worth noting that no Russian officials were invited to the conference. CNN's Nic Robertson is covering it for us in Munich and joins us with latest. I have to say, Nic, you're a veteran of this conference and so it's very good to have you there, especially to see a difference, a stunning, staggering and sad difference the year has made. We talked about Zelenskyy's urgent message and yet we also have Kamala Harris coming up with her speech. What seems to be at the heart of the issue now that the allies have admitted there's going to be a long conflict and Ukraine will need a lot more weapons?",

We heard President Zelenskyy saying hurry up with the weapons but I think next year I'll be at the Munich Security Conference, because the war will be over. That's not, I think, had he been in the room and been able to read the room, the room would have told him that's ambitious. We support you in your ambition but we don't necessarily think that's going to happen. Where are we today? It is that effort to come together, work together. And that's what we understand when Kamala Harris had the meetings yesterday with Emmanuel Macron and the German chancellor, that was the discussion, welcoming German's move to send Leopard tanks to Ukraine. Raising the specter of relations with China and upholding the values of democracy globally in the face of what China represents there against those values. And I think those -- that we'll get from her speech today as well. It's the idea that we're moving forward; the United States is going to stand by Ukraine; we're going to stand by in our support of our European friends, a strong part of NATO. Also just before you came to us, secretary of state, Antony Blinken went in and also is having important meetings. The British prime minister is expected here, calling for NATO  assurances for Ukraine, moving sort of beyond where the support is at the moment. But giving stronger assurances to Ukraine and doubling down on the message, send the weapons now, which is what President Zelenskyy wants.",

Russia has been trying to capture the city for months now and Wagner mercenaries often lead the charge there.The U.S. now estimates Wagner suffered some 30,000 casualties in the war and that includes about 9,000 dead. As Alex Marquardt reports, Wagner is not second guessing its strategy, despite the heavy losses. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice- over):  Just a week from the first anniversary of the Russian invasion, this is, according to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the toughest fight in Ukraine right now in the eastern city of Bakhmut. Called a meat grinder by both sides, Russian troops from the Wagner mercenary group, most of them convicts, continue to be sent in wave after wave to their deaths. ADM. JOHN KIRBY (RET.), COORDINATOR FOR STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS, WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL:  Men that he just plucked out of prisons and threw on a battlefield with no training, no equipping, no organizational command just thrown them into the fight, 90 percent killed were convicts. We believe the Wagner continues to rely heavily on these convicts in the Bakhmut fighting. And that doesn't show any signs of abating. MARQUARDT (voice-over):  The battle, laying bare the stark divisions on the Russian side. With Wagner chief, Yevgeny Prigozhin openly blasting Russia's official military leadership, saying they managed soldiers from beauty salons and country clubs. Arguing that if there were more of his private troops, they would be halfway across Ukraine by now. The toll has been so severe on the Russian side that according to Ukrainian officials, regular troops have been backfilling Wagner to mechanized infantry and tank units supported by artillery and aircraft. If Russia were to take Bakhmut, it would change little but be a symbolic victory as Ukraine struggles to keep them at bay. President Zelenskyy today urging world leaders at the Munich Security Conference to speed up their military aid, comparing the fight to Goliath taking on David and his sling. VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  We need to hurry up. We need the speed, speed of our agreements, speed of our delivery to strengthen our sling, speed of decisions to limit Russian potential. There is no alternative to speed, because it is the speed that the life depends on. Delay has always been and still is a mistake. MARQUARDT (voice-over):  That Russian potential is still significant with hundreds of thousands of mobilized troops believed to be in reserve and Russian President Vladimir Putin able to call up more to offset his enormous losses. Now according to the U.S. State Department, numbering over 200,000 Russian dead and wounded -- Alex Marquardt, CNN, Kyiv. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And we're learning more from those who survived beneath the rubble for more than 200 hours, some nearly 300 hours now, about the experience being buried beneath the rubble, some only able to survive in a cavity of about 40 centimeters wide. Others young children, saying they were surviving off of protein powder. This has been a harrowing experience. As you can imagine, the emotional trauma that many of these survivors have gone through poses a long and significant challenge ahead. We've been speaking to aid groups, humanitarian assistance leaders providing support to the evacuated. They say they're going to need all the help they can get. And the conditions in southeast Turkiye are difficult, they are challenging in some areas and dire. We're talking about freezing cold weather, thousands of people made homeless. The sanitary situation there is of course, very, very difficult and poses serious health concerns. But aid groups are working around the clock on the ground. But as the search and rescue begins to winds down -- less than 200 rescue operations now -- the focus is shifting to those who survived. We're already seeing people being evacuated to other parts of the country. They're being housed in university dorms, hosted by volunteers. We're seeing also, of course, children who have been separated from their families, from their parents. Some have now been orphaned. Other, we don't even know identities, names, still being traced and tracked to try and reunite them with loved ones. The Turkish government said they've so far managed to reunite more than 900 children with relatives after being buried beneath the rubble. But there are still countless children waiting to be processed. So that could be a process that takes months. And that is, of course, a significant challenge for the Turkish government. The message is there needs to be more support from the international community. The U.N. so far has appealed for $1 billion over next three months to provide that support. That comes two days after they appealed for nearly $400 million to provide support in northwest Syria. And there is real concern for the situation in Syria. We're talking about a population that was already heavily dependent on humanitarian assistance after years and years of conflict in the country. We're also seeing Syrians who were in the country but now are living in the southeast of Turkiye, crossing the border. The destruction is widespread, not only in Syria but also across southeast Turkiye. And many countless people have been left homeless -- Paula.",
