      "sentences": "Hello and welcome to our viewers joining us here in the United States and all around the world. I'm Nick Watt. Israel's war against Hamas is intensifying. Israeli forces are pushing into Gaza by land and continuing heavy strikes from the air. The IDF said on Sunday that it struck more than 450 targets over a 24-hour period, including command centers and missile launch sites.According to CNN analysis of video published by Israeli media, IDF forces have advanced about three kilometers inside Gaza. But as the ground invasion expands, there's growing concern about the deepening humanitarian crisis in Gaza. That issue, sources say, has prompted the United Nations Security Council to hold an emergency meeting. In the hours ahead, sources say that The UAE is expected to seek a resolution for a, quote, \"immediate humanitarian pause\" in the fighting in Gaza. All this, says the U.N. secretary general says the situation there is growing more desperate by the hour. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONIO GUTERRES, U.N. SECRETARY GENERAL:  The world is witnessing a humanitarian catastrophe taking place before our eyes. More than 2 million people with nowhere safe to go are being denied the essentials for life, food, water, shelter and medical care while being subjected to relentless bombardments. I urge all those with responsibility to step back from the brink. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Yesterday, one of those hospitals, the Al-Quds Hospital, second largest, as you said in Gaza, got a warning from the Israelis. They called it a threat. And according to the Palestinian Red Crescent, it goes like this, quote, \"two phone calls were received with a clear and direct threat that the hospital must be evacuated at once, otherwise the Red Crescent holds full responsibility for the lives of everyone inside the hospital.\" Now Israel didn't deny the accusation. In fact, the IDF says that it's called with similar warnings more than twice. It claims that Hamas is being sheltered inside that hospital and others like it. The Red Crescent is calling on the international community to protect that hospital, because the video that you're looking at right now is of recent strikes in the immediate vicinity of that hospital. In fact, the Red Crescent says these strikes were so close that the actual building itself, hospital building itself sustained some damage. You can see the hallways sort of filling up with dust in the aftermath of these strikes. The hospital director said, reiterated really again that there is no way to evacuate patients safely there. There are children, some of them in incubators. He also said that there are 12,000 people who are taking shelter inside of that building, and the vast majority of them are women and children. He also denied very firmly the Israeli accusation that Hamas is being sheltered there, saying that no one who is armed is even allowed in the building, Nick.",

Families and crowds gathered in Tel Aviv over the weekend demanding swift action from the government.Families of hostages want the prime minister to trade all of Israel's Palestinian prisoners for all of Hamas's hostages. Netanyahu vowed to exhaust all options to secure the release of those loved ones. Meantime, the U.S. government says it's also working to help American citizens in Gaza leave the Strip. White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan says the matter has to stay a top priority. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAKE SULLIVAN, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER:  We are in almost hourly contact with regional partners and with Israel to try to get to a point where there is a deal to have the hostages released. It is difficult. It is challenging. The Hamas terrorists have not been forthcoming about allowing these hostages to go, but we believe that there can still be a pathway to get their release, and we are going to work tirelessly to make that happen. And even though we have started to see Israel move in on the ground, that has not changed our basic view that this has to remain a paramount priority, that we have to keep working at it, and there's negotiations are ongoing.

There's something disturbing happening in the world. And what's happening now, I think, shows us how the anti-Semites, the haters of our people, the Jewish people are coming out of the woodwork and we have to stand as one. The Jewish people have to stand as one, but the world has to stand as one against this surge of hate to defeat it because today, Nick, it's coming at us here in Israel into our homes and trying to kill us.
