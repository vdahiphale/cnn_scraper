The most prominent pick to emerge so far, likely Florida senator Marco Rubio. The Trump foe turned defender is expected to be nominated as secretary of state. Well, the list also includes former immigration official Tom Homan in the new role of border czar. One trait they have in common is demonstrated loyalty to president-elect Donald Trump. Steve Contorno, who is with us now from St. Petersburg, Florida, has more. So we have, up on the screen for our viewers, those that are either already announced or likely to be picked. What do we make of those who are coming together as a cabinet post inauguration in January?",

And Marco Rubio fits that description, even, even though he is someone who, as you said, was a onetime rival. He ran for president against Donald Trump in 2015 and 2016 and, during that time, he was immensely critical of Donald Trump's foreign policy chops. He suggested Trump was not up to the challenge of competing and putting America on a world stage with China and Russia and handling issues in the Middle East. But he eventually warmed up to Trump. And during Trump's first term, he was very influential in forming Donald Trump's approach to Latin America and some of the policies that stem from there. It's still somewhat of a interesting pick because Rubio is known as somewhat of a saber rattler. He is someone who has been very critical of Iran, of China. He is someone who has pushed for regime change in Venezuela. He was very, very close in the -- with the White House, with John Bolton, who was one time Trump's one of his top national security advisers and then became one of Trump's biggest critics. And Trump would push back by saying, this guy wanted to go to war with everyone and Rubio was very close with that individual. So I think for those who were looking for the Trump administration to perhaps bring in people who aren't, don't fit the bill of a, quote-unquote \"neocon,\" Rubio is somewhat of a puzzling pick. Although, like you said, loyalty is sort of supreme in these picks so far.",

Axios reporting the president-elect met this weekend with the Israeli minister of strategic affairs, Ron Dermer, at Mar-a-Lago. Dermer is a close ally of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. Next hour the current U.S. president, Joe Biden, will meet with the Israeli president, Isaac Herzog, at the White House. This happening as eight aid groups say Israel has failed to improve humanitarian conditions in Gaza. The U.S. has given Israel until today to do that or face a potential reduction in military assistance. Well, Kylie Atwood, back with us this hour. And you've been leading on the reporting on this. So what do we know at this point about what is going on on the ground? We know at least eight agencies have said that not enough is being done.

They wanted to see that by the end of the month. They didn't see that. The Biden administration didn't do anything about the fact that that hadn't been stood up. So if that is indicative of what they're going to do with response to Israel not actually meeting the demands of this letter, that demonstrates to us that there isn't necessarily a thirst by the Biden administration to do more than they have in the past. They use this letter, of course, as a tool to push Israel to allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza. But when it comes to how much they actually want to, you know, lay out implications, put any costs inflicted on Israel, it doesn't seem that there is an actual appetite within the Biden administration at this point to do that.

That's because Donald Trump, coming into office as the president-elect, that puts them in a situation where both sides are going to want to advise the judge what to do next. And they're going to -- they're saying that they want to make sure that there is a balance of the competing interests here. One, the needs of the Office of the Presidency. So the role that Trump will be stepping into. And then also making sure that there's an acknowledgment of the jury verdict of guilt, which was the conviction of Trump as a criminal defendant in this case, in the state of New York. So what they're going to do is they're going to tell the judge what they want to see happen next by next week. We were already expecting some movement in this case today. Judge Juan Merchan, who oversaw the trial, was looking at whether the guilty verdict of the jury could stand. Because there were questions over whether parts of it would need to be cut out because of the immunity that the Supreme Court says should be around the presidency, though much of this case was not about Donald Trump's time in office. It was about his time before he became president in 2017. So that decision from Judge Merchan, it's not going to be rolled out today. That's also frozen. And the sentencing of Donald Trump that was scheduled to take place before he was going to be entering the Office of the Presidency again in the U.S., that also is going to be on ice.

Now there is a long standing understanding in the federal government that a sitting president can't be facing the fallout of criminal charges. And that's why the other cases against Donald Trump are all frozen or gone at this point. But in this situation, this is a case from New York State. In New York State court, Trump as president wouldn't have power -- pardon power over it. So he couldn't pardon himself to get out of this conviction. But his attorneys are trying to make every argument that they can to get this case dismissed, saying he's coming to the presidency. You can't sentence him if he's coming into the presidency. But, Becky, I will say they have tried over and over and over and over again to have the case dismissed outright and have failed every single time.

Things have changed, however. At this point it's very clear, both the Saudis and Emiratis want to make sure that they absolutely stay out of any war that involves the United States, Israel and Iran. And part of the reason for this, of course, is the anger amongst their own populations with what Israel has been doing in Gaza and the West Bank and increasingly in Lebanon but also because of realization that Iran's ballistic missiles are so effective that they penetrated Israel's many layers of air defenses. And as a result, will also be able to penetrate whatever the United States has provided these countries. So they're much more vulnerable vis-a-vis Iran as well than what they thought they were back in 2016.

On the one hand, they recognize that Trump actually wants a deal. The question is, will he have a team around him that will help ensure that the deal is secured? Or will it be like it was last time, where he had a team around him that actually pursued a policy that was far more likely and designed to bring about a military confrontation between the United States and Iran?

And it is also really ground the provision of humanitarian assistance nearly to a halt. I'd add to that, that commercial deliveries, one of the metrics that Secretaries Blinken and Austin asked to increase was 50 to 100 trucks a day of commercial goods getting into the Strip. Because that has really been what's sustaining people, not necessarily the humanitarian aid that's been getting in. And that has, in the last 30 days since that letter was sent to Israeli authorities, ground to a complete halt. So what you are essentially witnessing in the north of Gaza is no humanitarian assistance or very little humanitarian assistance getting in and no commercial assistance getting in, which means that people there have been left entirely on their own in an active conflict zone. With no assistance and nothing to buy, to sustain themselves and their families which, in practical terms means what we've been hearing that people are not only skipping meals as they have been over the past year but now eating every few days.
