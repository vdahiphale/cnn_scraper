But for too many it was too late. In the town of - they mourn one of the many who have not made it out alive with the death toll rising by the hour. This is a race against time. How many are buried under the wreckage of this massive quake zone, no one really knows estimates in the tens of thousands. Here in Adana, search and rescue crews work tirelessly around the clock, digging through what used to be a 14 storey residential building, where families lay asleep when the monstrous earthquake hit. Survivors have gathered at the site of the rescue mission, their shelter and hot meals. And in the bitter cold, they huddle around these fires, everyone with a story of the horror they've survived the shock, the trauma, the pain visible on every face. Parents doing what they can to try and make their little ones forget many here are anxiously awaiting views of their loved ones and friends buried under what's left at their homes. KARADSHEH (on camera): They are asking us to get down and we believe this is because they're scanning the building wreckage. This is a very, very careful and delicate operation that's going on to try and see if they can locate any survivors because so far they haven't been able to. KARADSHEH (voice over): No survivors yet, only lifeless bodies pulled. It's been three days why can't they get my son out this father rails? Is night falls the rest of the family we desperately for any news of 25-year-old - they've been out here for three long nights.",

And this is available or could be achieved with close air support by fighter jets and long range missiles which the U.S. has provided. Also, Germany could and therefore we should because it's our freedom.

So, the challenge is that we have to change our mindset in Germany.

So, the key factor is our chancellery, it is not the ruling parties who are able and are willing to do that. So we are in fear that Chancellor Scholz would like to cooperate with Putin. And the first tanks will arrive already in March. I have informed myself today in an organization in a big staff, European coordination close to Berlin, who are preparing the delivery.

But these other meetings that are again, where he can get face to face with a small group of leaders, about half a dozen or so in each of these four groups.

Aid agencies warning that new snowfall and the lack of power could cause what they call a secondary disaster. The death toll was growing along with a sense of desperation. Nearly 20,000 people have died in the disaster so far, and mountains of collapsed concrete are turning into tombs for the victims. In neighboring Syria, the first UN aid convoy since the quake hit has finally made its way across the border. Activists had fear the Damascus regime could handle aid to the mostly rebel held area. And as we just mentioned, of course, the disaster zone fears are mounting for survivors. Aid agencies warning that the snowfall and lack of power could cause this secondary disaster. Well Nick Paton Walsh has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY (voice over): It's hard to imagine how this rubble gave anyone hope. Yet for 50 or so hours after the quake, it almost did. And when it stopped, when the chances of surviving ebbed the bodies, so near the epicenter here, kept coming. The paralysis of grief when these two parents see their eight-year-old daughter's red hair blood stained, another four-year-old girl with no parents here to bury her father, simply walking behind. WALSH (on camera): There's been constant intense activity desperately trying to save lives. But we are sadly now into the window where so many of the ambulances that arrive will likely be taking away people who've perished. WALSH (voice over): Up high hope is strongest, digging furiously by hand here. On the other side of the rubble, medics rushed forward, moving fury, but how nothing here came sooner. The stretches here too late, return empty. Another body pulled out of a Syrian refugee in his 40s as the excavations gained pace, an audience of agony watches wait.",

There is a feeling that the government did not act quickly enough. We've all seen these images of people who were in more remote areas, heart breaking, and heart wrenching stories of them hearing their relatives under the rubble. But unable to reach them because no help had arrived because rescue workers were not on the scene because there was no equipment to move these huge slabs of concrete we've also seen countless families, of course, just huddled in the freezing cold without access to food, water, fuel, anything at all, really. And it's those families now that are raising questions, should the government have acted more quickly? You could argue that a disaster with this scope in scale, absolutely enormous, mind-boggling, mind-boggling numbers, you're talking about. Tens of thousands of people injured, thousands of people killed countless of people under pinned under the rubble of their homes. So, you could argue that no government could really be prepared. But then there was another question being asked here, Lynda, and that is about the buildings. You mentioned that there the structure of these buildings were they sound as you mentioned, Turkey does have strict rules that came into place. After the 1999, a devastating earthquake, then building codes that should have required more of these modern buildings to be earthquake resistant. Yet we see all those in that earthquake zone, many apartment blocks just pancaked completely. So again, questions being raised. Was everything up to code, if not what went wrong? And yes, very much right now the focus is on the search and rescue operations. But these questions are not going to stop being asked of President Erdogan who has admitted to shortcomings. But perhaps one sign that the government is very much aware of the growing anger are these reports that social media access was limited, while President Erdogan was making the visit to those affected areas. Again, an indication that there may have been dissent, anger, frustration online and the government here trying to keep it from spreading.
