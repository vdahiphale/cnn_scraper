It is the bus drivers, the cafeteria workers, teaching assistants, custodians, the union that represents them that is called this strike. But the Teachers Union has also called its members out in sympathy.The two sides still pretty far away from each other on pay and other things. They've been talking for nearly a year and couldn't figure it out. There were supposed to be some last-ditch talks late yesterday. Those talks didn't even happen over an argument over whether they should have been secret and leaked to the press. It was a whole thing. We've just heard from the union again this morning that says listen, a lot of our workers, their pay puts them below the poverty line here in Los Angeles. That pay needs to increase. They also want better conditions. And, of course, while the adults argue about this, you've got more than half a million kids here in Los Angeles who are not going to school today. Now, there is some child supervision offered. There are also box lunches. There are many kids here who rely on school not just for education, but for food. LA Zoo has also said free admission today. I'm not sure how long it'll take that up. We expect to hear throughout the day from both sides if they are managing to get any closer to an agreement to get kids back into school. Back to you.",

The Fed essentially finds itself, Kate, walking a tightrope here.On the one hand, you have this chance of additional banking instability. On the other hand, you have oh yes, inflation, which presents its own host of problems, we can show you how sort of the rate hiking cycle has looked and see how half a percent would essentially look or a quarter of a percent rather. The big challenge here for the Fed is we don't know how this banking situation -- let's call it a situation. Some have called it a crisis. We don't know what the other side of this looks like.

And so, they're holding on to liquidity. They're holding on to cash just trying to protect themselves. But what that means is that that's less cash, less funding for loans, car loans, business loans, etcetera. So, that will have a real impact on the economy.But Jan Hatzius, the chief economist at Goldman Sachs saying, essentially, it doesn't make sense to raise rates right now in the midst of this ongoing stress in the banking system. That could present substantial downside risks to the economy. So, there will be an impact. The question is, we don't know how large it will be. And so, maybe the Fed should pause, maybe take a beat, see what things look like. On the other hand, inflation, which of course, we've been dealing with host --",

      "sentences": "Thanks for walking through it.Let's get some more perspective on this right now. Joining me now is Democratic Senator Tina Smith from Minnesota. She's a member of the Senate Banking Committee. Senator, thanks for being here. So, the Fed admitted today, Rahel was laying out how complicated the decision is. And the former president of the New York Fed just said on CNN that he thinks there's no right answer when it comes to the rate decision this time. What do you think? I mean, do you -- what do you think the impact of a pause in raising rates would do right now? SEN. TINA SMITH, (D-MN): Well, as you've just described, this is a very complicated situation. The Fed has a mandate of controlling inflation -- keeping inflation stable, and also they have a mandate about maximizing employment. And now, on top of those two very important goals, we have this situation with banks, most notably the Silicon Valley Bank that had significant risk on their balance sheet because the assets that they held declined in value as interest rates went up. So, the Fed has to balance all of these things as they make their decision. I hope that they are cautious that they think about the potential negative impact of additional rate increases in the midst of all of this uncertainty. And, you know, we know that inflation is bad, especially for working families who have very little discretionary income. And raising interest rates actually doesn't get at in this moment the key components of those price increases, which have to do with housing costs going up, and also other services costs going up. So, I think it's a time in my view for them to exercise caution.",

And I look first to the importance of holding the management of this bank accountable, that by all appearances made irresponsible decisions that put their depositors at risk, and then paid out massive bonuses to themselves just days or hours before the bank collapse. So, there's accountability there that we have to get to the bottom of.The question of the supervisory role that the Fed played and what happened there is also a really important question. Reports recently has suggested that the Fed expressed to Silicon Valley Bank their real concerns about the status of their financial condition. I want to know why the bank didn't act on that, or if they did act on those -- on those Federal Reserve you know letters, you know, what happened as a result of that? So absolutely, there's a question that we need to answer about how that supervision happened or didn't happen. And then last of all, we have to really look at whether or not the regulations that we have in place were these regional banks that are quite large, though not deemed systemically important, are those regulations tough enough? Do they have high enough capital requirements? Should they be stress tested to make sure that these kinds of interest rate risks like we've seen don't do great damage to depositors? So, there's a lot that we need to look at here.",

And they're being filed at the exact same time that a judge inside this Delaware courthouse right now is deciding whether this $1.6 billion defamation case against Fox News can actually move forward to trial or if this judge should just decide the case outright.So, this particular lawsuit filed by Fox News producer Abby Grossberg. She says that she was coerced into giving misleading testimony during the depositions in this Dominion case. She says her misleading testimony really shifted culpability away from Fox executives as well as Fox corporation. So, here's what Abby Grossberg is saying in this lawsuit. Saying Fox News attorneys acted as agents and at the behest of Fox News to misleadingly coach, manipulate, and coerce Ms. Grossberg to deliver shaded and or incomplete answers during her sworn deposition testimony, which answers were clearly to her reputational detriment but greatly benefited Fox News. Now, Fox News for its part is responding to this lawsuit really citing attorney-client privilege as a reason what -- why they can't comment on this. As for this fox news producer, Abby Grossberg, she's actually out on administrative leave while her case goes forward. And all at the same time, there's this looming $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit. I've been inside the courtroom here as these arguments are playing out. We've heard a lot from Dominion voting systems' attorneys. They're saying that all of the texts and e-mails that they've uncovered throughout this deposition process really show that Fox News hosts, they knew exactly that the claims that they and others were making were false as it pertained to Dominion voting systems allegedly and falsely rigging the 2020 election. Up next will be the Fox News attorneys. They're saying that they are fully protected and all this by the First Amendment. Interestingly, here, Kate, also on the eve of these arguments, there was a filing from Dominion saying that they want Fox Corporation Chairman Rupert Murdoch and his CEO son Lachlan to testify if and when this case goes to trial. If it does go to trial that, will be decided by this judge, and it would be about mid-April. So, there's a lot at stake here. And high stakes of course with this $1.6 billion defamation suit, Kate.",
