Look at this. These are the papers as he tries to prove a point about General Mark Milley, and who if anyone wanted to attack Iran.

It is popular with locals. Can be busy at earlier times during the day. Off-duty military there often as well. Russia notoriously clumsy and bad in its are targeting with heavy weaponry, but also to occasionally finding its target.
