And we're hearing that from Donald Trump today in a new interview, and really his first reaction to what he lived through. One of the things that he said was how this is -- how this is -- he's recalibrating how he's looking at this coming week with the convention when he said, I had all prepared an extremely tough speech, a really good all -- really good all about the corrupt, horrible administration, but I threw it away. I want to try to unite our country, but I don't know if that's possible. People are very divided.I have covered you for years, Congressman, you have been in the politics quote unquote, \"game\" for many years. Do you -- people are very divided. No one is blind to that. Do you think it is possible? Do you think if not unity, civility could return in a real way?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, you know, but I think if you look at policy versus politics, if you look at the record versus strong rhetoric, there's very clear differences between the way the previous administration when President Trump was in office and this current administration.I think we need to get back to what is it that we have to really debate? What is it that we have to evaluate America's position in the world? Domestically, are we doing the right things for the people that we all represent? And people tell me, well, you know what, Kelly, I didn't vote for you, but I appreciate the fact that you did this or that. And I said, well, listen, I didn't know until right now you didn't vote for me. But one thing I wish we would all do, study the records, look at the policies and make a decision. What is in the best interest of America, American citizens and our position globally? How does the rest of the world look at us? On Saturday, we look like a third world country where if you don't like whatever it is you're running against, look, just don't vote for who you don't like. Vote for who you do like. Vote for who you've studied the records to see who can do the best job. But it's become too much just back and forth, back and forth. Some of the language has become way, way, way too off the charts. And I will just say it's easy to get caught up in. But the idea for me is always when you come out of that locker room. And now I'm talking about the United States locker room. We got our kids participating in the Olympics. Listen, I think that we should all look at America. We just don't want to participate. We want to dominate. We want to have the best policy in the world, the best people in the world, for the greatest country, greatest nation the world has ever known, who has been so blessed by the divinity that we believe in. Whatever you believe is fine. I just say yesterday my wife took our grandchildren to mass. They came back from that. And, of course, they had celebrated going to receiving the sacrament and everything else. I think that is who America is. Let's look about who it was that came before us, the sacrifices that they made to give us these opportunities. And let's put whatever rhetoric it is we have behind us, look at records, look at results, look at where we're going as a nation, and then make a decision. What is in the best interest of not only yourself, but those coming after us, the future generations? That's the whole key to where we're coming. Listen, this has been a rough couple years for people. Saturday was rough for the folks that were at that rally. We can rally now as a nation to make a determination who is going to lead us the next four years. So I'm just asking people, let's look at the game films. Let's look at the best policies for America. And then let's make a decision who we vote for, who we want in office, who we want to be our quarterback to call the right plays at the right time to win the game. I don't want to just participate. I want America to dominate in the best senses of it.",

And any minute, any moment now, he could be announcing and revealing who his running mate pick is, after all of this. Joining me right now is CNN Senior Political Analyst Mark Preston. We've heard throughout the morning -- we heard last night, we've heard throughout the morning, I've heard from many of the elected officials that we had on the show this morning, the call for unity, the call for bringing the temperature down. It is important. It needs to happen. I'm wondering, though, what that looks like when it transitions onto this stage, when this really gets underway.

But there's also this call between the Biden campaign and the DNC. They held with staffers. And they said ahead of the primetime address, and Jen O'Malley Dillon, the Campaign Chair, said \"There's no charted course for what we're going through in this country and for this campaign.\" How -- what -- what -- I mean, what a moment for a rival campaign to have to navigate as well.

He was shot on his way to a campaign speech in Milwaukee, which is coincidentally where this year's Republican National Convention will begin this morning in just a bit here.For more on the historical nature of all of this, we are joined by Presidential Historians Allan Lichtman and Doug Brinkley. We are very lucky to have you gentlemen here this morning. I am curious, from your perspective, if you look at the litany of people who have either been assassinated, had assassination attempts against them, this is not new.

Yes, this was a horrible tragedy that involves a former president and presidential candidate. But mass shootings like this are as common in America as the sunrise. They occur every single day. The very day after this tragedy, seven people were killed in a mass shooting in Alabama.And as a historian, I draw on the model of the shooting of Ronald Reagan, when his staunchly conservative Republican press secretary, James Brady, was grievously wounded. Instead of seeking revenge or political advantage, he brought the country together to adopt the first major gun control measures to deal with this epidemic of gun violence. That's a top killer of our kids that kills, murders 40 Americans every day, are murdered by a gun, and many more commit suicide by gun. An American today is --",

Judge Aileen Cannon, of course, who is the Trump-appointed judge overseeing the classified documents case, has dismissed the case because of the appointments clause. This is something that Judge Clarence Thomas had written about in the immunity decision here before. But it's interesting that Judge Cannon is basing it all on this.

Those were the charges.There were other people facing those charges as well. And what Judge Cannon has now found is that case closed, the special counsel's office does not have the power to bring these charges in federal court. She writes that any scheduled hearings are canceled, any pending motions are denied as moot, any pending deadlines are terminated. That's it. This judge believes this case cannot go on. Of course, there is the possibility that the Justice Department could appeal, but this is the trial judge that has been handling this case for a year now, siding essentially with what Justice Thomas wrote in his recent concurrence in the -- looking at the special counsel's office.
