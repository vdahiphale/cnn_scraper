Kate.KATE BOLDUAN, CNN NEWS CENTRAL CO-ANCHOR:  That's so interesting. Great reporting to you and the team. As always, Natasha, we're going to have much more on this and they're going to continue working, your sources. Thank you. Sara. SARA SIDNER, CNN NEWS CENTRAL CO-ANCHOR:  All right. As the U.S. grapples with what is unfolding in Israel, vowing complete support for Israel, one full congressional body is basically paralyzed. Unable to function because it has no leader. Today, a step towards finally getting a speaker of the House. Right now, as we speak, House Republicans are meeting privately to nominate the next speaker of the House. The process could be lengthy, however, and pretty messy as you have been seeing all these days. Its divided GOP conference is forced to come back together and pick just one person that they think could get this job done. Majority Leader Steve Scalise and Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan both want that gavel, but it is unclear right now if either has the votes to win the nomination. CNN's Manu Raju is joining us from Capitol Hill this morning. Manu, you are always all over that -- all over Capitol Hill. You get to everyone, and you just got to Jim Jordan, one of the people who is up for a vote. What did he say?",

And he didn't quite say directly, but he said that it would be the -- you get behind whoever gets 217 votes and the House -- in -- would behind closed doors.And this is why this is significant, behind closed doors right now the House Republicans are meeting. They're discussing their way forward. They're going to have a secret ballot election to decide who will be their nominee to be the next speaker of the House. Under current rules, that requires 111 votes. A majority of the House Republican conference. Jim Jordan is trying to change that along with some other members to make it 217 votes. That is a majority of the full House. He believes that he wants to sort all these issues out behind close doors, come out from behind closed doors, unified behind one pick which could be a protracted and very messy process. So, when I asked him about that just moments ago, he indicated that's his ultimate decision to decide whether to support another person for the job if they can get the votes a majority of the full house.

So, there is so much uncertainty within the GOP. Can they actually get behind one candidate after last week's ouster of Kevin McCarthy, that unprecedented vote still leaving lots of very, very raw emotions.But nothing could get done here in the House, including aid to Israel, aid to Ukraine, taking steps to avoid a government shutdown until they elect the next speaker of the House, which is why this moment is so significant. See if Republicans can actually get behind someone who can get the votes on the House floor to be elected as the next speaker. Sara.",

I think there's really no significance with this for Hamas. I think the real significance, Kate is that this represents not just the headline, but I think this represents a trend line. And it is a very important trend line because you've got the most extreme right-wing government in history of the State of Israel, pursuing annexation policies on the West Bank, and trying to undermine Israeli democracy.I think both of those initiatives, frankly, are going to stall. And you get some -- I know I'm being pejorative here, some adult supervision into this. Will it contain the -- what the Israelis are going to do in Gaza? I think that's a central question. The blood is up. Every Israeli I talked to or I hear former military intel folks, they're all saying we need to, \"Change the reality,\" in Gaza. What does that mean? The eradication of Hamas as a governing force, as a -- and a military force? A new political reality? A semi-impermanent Israeli reoccupation of Gaza? A U.N. transitional force funded by government -- elected by Palestinians, funded by Gulf money in an effort to create a new future for Gaza?

We have just been talking about this, but a classified briefing for House members finished just minutes ago to get members there up to speed on the latest of what is happening in Israel. One of the congressmen in the room, Jared Moskowitz. He is from Florida. He serves on the House Foreign Affairs Committee.Thank you so much for joining us. I know you just came out of the meeting. We have heard this one striking thing that has come out of that briefing, that the U.S. has collected specific intelligence that really does cast doubt, that Iran was directly involved in the surprise attack by Hamas on Israel. Can you give us and our viewers any sense of how you understood how the intelligence agencies came to that initial conclusion? REP. JARED MOSKOWITZ (D-FL):  Yes, thanks for having me. Obviously, I'm not going to talk about classified information, but what I would say is I think that's being slightly misinterpreted. What I would say is that that is still an ongoing process. They were clear about that that they are still gathering intelligence on that matter, but that there's no initial intelligence that shows that. So, I -- before we jump conclusions that Iran was not involved in this attack, let the intelligence community please finish their investigation. However, what I would say was super clear to everyone in the room, even before we received this information, this is publicly known, obviously, that Iran has been financing Hamas, training Hamas, helping Hamas, communicating with Hamas, providing cyber technology, you know, throughout the last coming years. So, Iran is complicit in the act, if not indirectly and also directly.",

They're in the throes of trying to figure this out. But in the interim, you talked about Iran's involvement. It has been a long involvement. They support Hamas, they support Hezbollah, there's also rockets coming over from Jordan into Israel.What do you think the U.S.' involvement should be knowing that they are in the background and this is happening rid now where Israel has a fight on two fronts?",

I am curious what you think of -- there has been a lot of discussion of the $6 billion that was unfrozen -- that was Iran's oil money that was unfrozen for humanitarian purposes.

So, you know, my district and when I was in the State House in Florida, represented the family of Bob Levinson who the Iranians took hostage and unfortunately died in their hands. So, I believe the United States needs to do everything it can to get back American hostages at all point in time.I was against the $6 billion being a part of that deal. And what I would say to make it clear is that none of that money, none of that money has left the fund that it is currently in that Qatar is involved in. So, none of that money has moved at all. As far as whether it should move, I think without having a specific policy that that money is frozen, my guess is that money is going nowhere in -- under the current situation.",

I do want to ask you, you have talked about and we have all been watching the horror, the terror that has unfolded in Israel with so many people, 100 to 150 people taken hostage. Babies massacred, you know, mothers, grandparents also killed. So, that sorrow is unfolding there in Israel. But there is also great sorrow in Gaza at the moment.And Doctors Without Borders says that the situation in Gaza is catastrophic. The hospitals are overwhelmed. The number of wounded is extremely high. There is a constant influx into the hospitals in the Gaza Strip. And as you -- you just sort of look at that happening, there is also now the cutting off of water, electricity and fuel supplies. And they're saying, that unacceptable. It punishes the entire population and deprives Palestinians of really basic needs.

I was at that Kibbutz just a month and a half ago, and the 40 babies being murdered there and most of the population in the Kibbutz. To see a holocaust survivor taken hostage, I mean, the idea that she survived the holocaust and now she's a hostage again. I mean, Jews are never going back to those times.And so, what's happening in Gaza now, we have to be clear. What's happening in Gaza is -- that's Hamas' fault. The situation in Gaza is Hamas' fault. It's Hamas' fault for the fact that they've taken none of this aid that they've gotten over the years to help the Palestinian people. And it's Hamas' fault that they committed genocide in Israel and now Israel has to respond to make sure Hamas is eliminated. With that said --",
