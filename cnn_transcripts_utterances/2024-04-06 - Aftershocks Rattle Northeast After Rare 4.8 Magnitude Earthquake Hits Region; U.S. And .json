In the past, what Iran has done is use proxies to attack obscuring its hand, obscuring its command orders, even though it's known, for instance, that Iran trained and supplied much of the weaponry that Hamas used in its October 7 attacks against Israel. Iran said that it wasn't informed of that actual planning and that day that it had, yes, supported the Hamas movement. But it tried to erase any culpability.In this case, Iran has directly warned that it is going to target Israel in some way for the attack on the diplomatic compound inside Syria that of course, Israel has said, was a Quds Force or Revolutionary Guards Command Center as well as being a diplomatic compound. And it killed high ranking officials in the Quds Force, which the U.S. also considers a terrorist group. So could it be some sort of Hezbollah rocket attack on the north at a level we haven't seen before? Or at Iranian drone strike on Israel proper? I think if it's the latter, that would possibly trigger some sort of larger response by Israel, or possibly by the US. And in the past, Iran hasn't wanted to risk that.",

And that word cabinet is much more open understands the need of getting aid in there.So by issuing an ultimatum like that, Netanyahu was able to silence some of his critics on his extreme right wing government and say, we've got to open the passageways in the north and get more aid in there because this has been such a public mistake by the Israeli Defense Forces.

So, they say it makes it easier for them to tie the Republican opponents to, you know, abortion restrictions in Florida. However, Republicans and even some Democrats, I talked to acknowledged that look, it's very plausible that this abortion ballot measure will go into effect or will be voted into the state's constitution and training abortion rights.

He has been pretty strategic or trying to be strategic on this issue over the past year since Roe v. Wade was overturned. He knows how difficult this is for Republicans.
