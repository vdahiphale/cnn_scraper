I don't think that that gets us into the realm of motive-hunting in the area where we are as concerned I think as the court would be about doing something that would undermine the presidency and the executive branch. And 1512 c2 -- we may have different views on the clarity and the scope of that statute. I think if the court does interpret corruptly as involving a consciousness of wrongdoing and elevates that to consciousness of illegality, then we're in a different realm.

The law governing the armed services or lawful conduct of war or any other provision of law imposing a public duty.\" That sounds a lot like dividing the line between official and private conduct.

And generally, in criminal cases even cases that involve First Amendment issues like threat statutes, the jury is the determinant of the facts and I have a little bit of difficulty with the idea of trying the whole public authority issue separately to the judge and having that go up on interlocutory appeal with review of facts before you could ever get it forward into a criminal case. That said, if I would prefer a regime in which the court altered some of the procedural rules surrounding the President, then a total absolute blanket immunity that takes away the possibility of criminal prosecution even if it was a core violation of the statute in the teeth of attorney general advice and has no overriding public.",

And if the court wished to attach to that kind of a rule interlocutory appeal then that that would be a lesser safeguard than the one that my friend is proposing here. Other kinds of defenses, though, really do intersect with the general issue. And for those I have a much greater time seeing how the court could implement that. And would there be costs in going to trial? Yes, there is no perfect system here. We are trying to design a system that preserves the effective functioning of the presidency and the accountability of a former president under the rule of law and the perfect system that calibrates all of those values probably has not been devised I think that the system that we have works pretty well, maybe it needs a few ancillary rules.

We would like to present that as an integrated picture to the jury so that it sees the sequence and the gravity of the conduct and why each step occurred. That said, if the court were to say that the fraudulent elector scheme is private, reaching out to state officials as a candidate is private. Trying to exploit the violence after January 6th by calling senators and saying please delay the certification proceeding is private campaign activity. We still think, contrary to what my friend said, that we could introduce the interactions with the Justice Department, the efforts to pressure the Vice President for their evidentiary value as showing the defendants knowledge and intent, and we would take a jury instruction that would say you may not impose criminal culpability for the actions that he took. However, you may consider it insofar as it bears on knowledge and intent, that's the usual rule with protected speech, for example, under Wisconsin versus Mitchell. My friend analogizes this to the speech or debate clause but we don't think the speech or debate clause has any applicability here. It's a very explicit constitutional protection that says senators and representatives shall not be questioned in any other place. So, it carries an evidentiary component that's above and beyond, whatever official act immunity he is seeking. And the last thing I would say on this is, we think that the concerns about the use of evidence of presidential conduct that might otherwise be official and subject to executive privilege is already taken care of by United States versus Nixon. That balances the President's interest in confidentiality against the need of the judicial system for all available facts to get to the truth.

A remarkable, well, two hours and 40 minutes or so. The Justices going back and forth on essential questions facing this country as relates not just to former president Donald Trump but future presidents, as well. All of this stems from Trump's claim. He cannot be tried for his role in attempting to overturn the 2020 election that he enjoys well virtually limitless immunity as a president and former president. There is of course also the criminal hush money trial happening right now in Manhattan. We're going to get to that in a moment, but, so many questions for what we just witnessed or at least heard in the last several hours here. And I want to bring in former Federal Prosecutor Shan Wu. A couple big questions first. It strikes me listening to the case made by the President's lawyer here that he is arguing for really, the broadest interpretation of immunity, I think we've ever heard. I mean, he was asked, you know, the classic case of if a president ordered SEAL Team Six to assassinate his opponent. Is that necessarily criminal, well, we have to consider it. Was it an official act, et cetera, if he sold nuclear secrets to it to a foreign adversary. Would that be, well, we'd have to consider whether it's official if he staged a coup, is that as far as Trump's lawyers argument goes that really all of that is okay unless either there's an explicit statute that prevents a president from doing it or you at least have to argue whether it was an official or private act?",

Military strike happen to be on someone who is not a military target you just did it for fun or to eliminate someone. That doesn't matter because the fact that he has the power to order it makes everything else unrevealable. That's the scope of the immunity.
