Putin's state TV ramping up its calls for a nuclear strike on the West, as Russian forces have a new weapon in their arsenal that is already having devastating effects in Ukraine.

We were told though they were going to give us some sort of briefing on what the two talked about.We were also told were going to get some sort of images from this meeting. So far, we have absolutely nothing. I did talk to sources who said that they were still meeting. That's why we know the length of the meeting, but so far, that content has been kept under wrap, still reaching out to sources as they kind of disperse after that meeting. Again, it was just at five, so broke up rather recently. But the interesting contexts around this meeting, obviously, we heard Biden talking about Orban, so it's not surprising that the White House does it not issue any sort of formal invitation to Orban, but also Orban did not reach out to anyone in the White House or the Biden administration to sit down for a meeting. He is still a world leader as is the president of the United States, Joe Biden. And yet he's here meeting with the former president. And one thing to note is that Donald Trump's not just a former president. He is also the presumptive Republican nominee, and he could be president again. And this really gives us some insight into how Donald Trump might align himself in the world stage and what leaders he might stand by. As you noted in your intro, you talked about all of the things that Viktor Orban has said that he stands for. But one thing you didn't note is how much he praises former President Donald Trump. He has praised him on his immigration stance. He has said over and over again that Putin would not have invaded Ukraine if Trump was still in the White House. That goes a very long way with the former president, that kind of loyalty, and that kind of praise. So when you're talking about this meeting today, that might be something that pushed it into existence because of the fact that Donald Trump takes those kind of compliments so seriously -- Erica.",

You clearly have the White House say that they can now zero in on who they know their opponents going to be, and there's a reason they're doing it at this time. Joe Biden knows that when this, when this election is about him in thereferendum on him, they're on weaker position. When it is about Donald Trump, the White House feels better about that. So I think you see both last night and today as a kind of show of the message. But I think when the president's biggest political liability is age, the performance also matters. And what you saw yesterday was a Joe Biden that have had his Wheaties, right, have had was really kind of making a show to reassure Democrats that he has the energy to be the person leading them going forward. But I also think it's a shot across the bow. The Republicans, and that they get the Joe Biden that they had last night in the summer and into the fall, that's going to be someone who gives the Democrats confidence.

And you know, it's funny. You played that sound bite where Trump said that, you know, that he's such a strong man and you need a strong man leading your country. They're strong men against their own country, against them the people of their own country. I think that's something that should be thought about there. And I think you're looking at a second Donald Trump term.

He's going to say that he has the experience, the know- how that he did. These are the people that he knows, and there's a way that you can trust him over Donald Trump. But Donald Trump is not haphazard when it comes this issue. He has consistently like these type of leaders and he has promised in his policy planks for 2024 to model that kind of authoritarian -- that kind of authoritarian government. And so, I'm saying it is not just a personal attachment between him and these authoritarians. He wants to mimic them.

And it's a reminder that in addition to these two civil judgments, he also faces mounting legal fees that he owes in these four criminal trials that he is facing. Now one question out there is whether the RNC will help him. This week, his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, along with another Trump loyalist, both took over the RNC.

He's worth -- he's a lot less successful than he wants the world tobe. And he has -- and his properties don't produce nearly as much income, which was why there's this cash squeeze and he's trying to negotiate $100 million when he has to come up with $450 million. How far he will go has -- I think he's going to defy the court every step of the way. It's going to be, make me do it, like the child saying, I'm not, no -- I'm not going to do it. Make me do it. You can't make me do it. But I do believe that the -- his Hail Mary might be money from a Russian oligarch or alone from someone who he's friendly with. But the problem he has is that if he falls or goes down, any loans that he has collateralized against any of his other assets, you know, are likely to go down, too. And so, it's not a particularly wise business decision. And he doesn't have that many friends",
