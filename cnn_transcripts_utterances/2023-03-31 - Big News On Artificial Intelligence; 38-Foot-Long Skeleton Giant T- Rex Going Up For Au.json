He says teachers use it to check their students` papers. (On camera):  Is this like one AI cross checking another AI?",

      "sentences": "Major leaders in tech like Elon Musk, professors and researchers, are so concerned about the rapid development of artificial intelligencethat they`re now calling for AI labs to stop developing the technology completely for at least six months. They signed a letter which is published by the Future of Life Institute, a nonprofit backed by Musk. The letter comes just two weeks after OpenAI announced GPT-4, an even more powerful version of the ChatGPT technology. This version was able to pass tests, create websites, even draft lawsuits. The tech leaders want experts to develop a set of protocols or rules for AI, and they said if they don`t, the government needs to step in and stop it. CNN`s Correspondent Donie O`Sullivan met with a professor at UC Berkeley School of Information and tried out an AI software that mimics voices to see how powerful and dangerous this technology could be.

O`SULLIVAN:  Does my voice sound different to you? N. O`SULLIVAN (voice-over):  Yeah, I just said that to Sinead (Donie`s sister). I said Donie sounds so American. (LAUGHTER) A.I. O`SULLIVAN:  This is not actually me. This is a voice made by computer. N. O`SULLIVAN (voice-over):  Oh, my God. Are you serious? A.I. O`SULLIVAN:  Yeah, sorry. DONIE O`SULLIVAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  There has been an explosion and fake audio and voices being generated through artificial intelligence technology. AI-GENERATED VOICE:  This is an A.I. clone version of Walter White`s voice. AI-GENERATED VOICE:  This is an A.I. clone version of Leonardo de Caprio`s voice. O`SULLIVAN:  All you need is a couple minutes recording of anyone`s voice and you can make it seem like they have said just about anything, even -- AI-GENERATED VOICE:  Anderson Cooper. We`ve come here to U.C. Berkeley today to talk to Hany Farid, a digital forensic expert, about just how easy it is to put words into other people`s mouths.
