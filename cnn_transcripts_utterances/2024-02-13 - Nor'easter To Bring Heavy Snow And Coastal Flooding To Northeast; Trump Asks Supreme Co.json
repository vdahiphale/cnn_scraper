      "sentences": "Good morning to you. Thanks so much for getting up early with us. I'm Jessica Dean in for Kasie Hunt.And right now, the northeast is in the grips of a fierce Nor'easter. Airports slowing to a crawl. We know over 900 flights have already been canceled across the country today. Now, this is the same system that pounded the Gulf Coast and the southeast over the weekend. In the crosshairs today, eastern Pennsylvania through northern New Jersey, and then southeast New York up to southern New England. A pretty big land mass there. Boston declaring a snow emergency and closing all public schools. Meantime, New York City is poised to see its highest snowfall totals in more than two years. Meteorologist Derek Van Dam is live in New York City's Central Park. Derek, when we saw you about a half-hour ago there were big flakes. It looks like maybe they've let up just a little bit. But lots of snow, it sounds like, to come into New York City today.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, that's the beauty of being close to the coast. The water temperatures about three to five degrees above average for where they would normally be in the middle of February. So that influences that rain-snow line, especially when you're close to the coastal areas like I am right now.You know, they call New York City \"The city that never sleeps,\" right? Well, there is so much going on in the city this week, including the New York City Fashion Week. There's also the special elections taking place in Long Island. So a lot of snow potentially impacting big consequential events within the city. And there are so many other factors to the storm other than the five to eight inches that we're anticipating where I'm standing here in Columbus Circle in Midtown Manhattan. We're going to turn around here with my incredible producing and camera team. You can see some of the snow starting to accumulate here. But let's get to the graphics to show you the other hazards that as a meteorologist I'm concerned about. We have high wind warnings along the coastal areas of Massachusetts -- Cape Cod, Nantucket. This is an area where we could see wind gusts over 55 miles per hour. That's significant because this heavy, wet snow that we've seen fall and we'll continue to see fall means that it could take down power lines, tree limbs. That is a concern. So we're going to look out for power outages as well. And something else that is often overlooked is this minor to moderate coastal flooding that could be associated with this storm, especially as we peak the storm mid-morning today and coincide that with high tide. The New York Harbor -- high tide is 11:00 a.m., Long Island Sound at 2:00 p.m. And so we get that onshore push. So all that water almost a seemingly routine or annual Nor'easter like we're receiving now could also create a little bit of coastal erosion as well. So you can see the coastal flood advisories that are in place right along Long Island and into the Delmarva Peninsula, and the New Jersey coastline. There is the storm. As quickly as it enters into the equation it exits and says goodbye and good riddance. By tonight, things will clear up but the winds will pick up behind it and it will feel bitterly cold and remind New Englanders that, yeah, it's still winter -- Jessica.",

The judge presiding over that case said yesterday that the district attorney, Fani Willis, could be disqualified if it's shown that she financially benefited from a personal relationship with her lead prosecutor on that case. So what do you make of the legal argument behind this disqualification effort? And then, what happens if Willis is, in fact, disqualified?",

      "timeStamp": "05:35:06",
      "speaker": "JACKSON",
      "sentences": "Yeah. So to the first question, I mean, optically, obviously, it's a disaster. You want to have a prosecution which is sanitized in all respects where the special prosecutor moves forward -- Fani Willis, as we're looking at there -- has nothing to do with it. Where there's no romantic entanglement. And so, from an optical perspective, I think it's troubling.From a practical perspective the issue to me is whether or not, regardless of whatever relationship occurred, was the prosecution one of integrity. Was there a grand jury proceeding? Did that grand jury that sits to determine not proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt but whether there's reason to believe that a crime was committed and that the subjects of the investigation committed it? Was that proceeding and did that proceeding proceed as it should? Is there a guardrail in terms of whether people get their due process -- not only Mr. Trump but the other defendants who are in the case? And so, I just don't -- I mean, at the end of the day, it's -- you know, I -- this whole thing seems to be a distraction. But the judge can consider whether there was a financial benefit. What the nature of the relationship between Fani Willis and special prosecutor Wade was. How did she financially benefit, if at all? How did that impair the proceedings? And if it impaired it to a degree that he believes that there's a conflict then, yes, she could be disqualified. To the second point, though, I just don't know that it really impairs the actual proceeding itself. So there's a -- there's a scenario here where she could be disqualified but the proceedings can continue and the defendants can continue to be prosecuted, including Mr. Trump. The open question is how the hearing goes on Thursday and what the judge ultimately decides to do, Jessica, predicated upon all the evidence that's presented at that time.",

The former president announcing last night he's going to be endorsing Michael Whatley, who is the North Carolina GOP chairman, to replace Ronna McDaniel as RNC chair. And he wants to install his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, as the committee's new co- chair.

And by and large, that standoff -- Democrats had run pretty well with that in the Virginia state legislative elections last year, the Wisconsin state Supreme Court race, and a lot of those swing state governor and senator races in 2022.But this iteration -- that standoff is tougher for Democrats than most, because in the New York City media market, immigration and crime are extremely hot issues. And conversely, abortion -- the fear of losing abortion rights probably isn't as intense in New York because Democrats control the state government as it is in other states.
