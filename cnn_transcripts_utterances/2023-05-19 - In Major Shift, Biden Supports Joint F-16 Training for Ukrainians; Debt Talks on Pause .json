This as we are getting updates from the war zone, including reports of explosions in Russian occupied territory.Also tonight, a serious setback for talks on raising the federal debt limit and avoiding a catastrophic default. With negotiations now on hold, I'll ask the former treasury secretary, Larry Summers, what the president and the Congress add leadership should do next as time for reaching a deal is running out. And new insight tonight into Senator Dianne Feinstein's health and mindset after new confirmation of medical complications she faced. I'll speak with her former Senate colleague, Barbara Boxer, amid growing questions about Senator Feinstein's ability to serve. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer and you're in The Situation Room.

CNN's Chief White House Correspondent Phil Mattingly is with the president at the G7 summit in Japan. Phil, there are significant new developments on both of those fronts today. Give us the latest.",

      "sentences": "Well, I think key from the Ukrainian calculation will be, Wolf, that if they are successful in this much touted counteroffensive, expected any moment, then the F-16s, particularly as they come online in any kind of numbers, and particularly if they then are armed with the state of the art weapons that they can carry, because they are just carriers of weapons at the end of the day, these aircraft, then they will allow the Ukrainians to hold on to and consolidate and advance the gains that they've been making if. If they don't get them, the Ukrainian argument is then ultimately they'll be vulnerable to the grinding down of their rare defenses by Russian missile and aircraft attacks and then a Russian counterattack led from the air. That is really the doomsday scenario, is being unable to keep the Russians out of their airspace.And so far the Ukrainians have been amazingly successful of it since Russian planes do not venture significantly into Ukrainian territory. They fly along the frontlines but they drop their bombs and then scoot away in a kind of fish hook shape they leave behind in the sky. You could see them do a sharp U-turn after dropping their loads and that is because they are afraid of the air defenses. If they're afraid of what is coming at them at eye level, too, that, from the Ukrainian perspective, make a very significant difference. Wolf? BLITZER: Yes. Let's follow up on that with Colonel Leighton. Colonel, from a military perspective, how will the arrival of these F-16s shift the battlefield and the tactics on both sides right now and how might Russia respond? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes. So, Wolf, in this situation, the addition of the F-16s is going to really change the balance. Because what that will do is that will increase the aircraft inventory that's available to the Ukrainians. If they are trained properly, they'll be able to do basic fighter maneuvers, they'll be able to come in and, in essence, take control of localized air space, and that is something that they really haven't been able to do consistently. So, that would change the Russian equation and force the Russians to do other things, perhaps use other weapons and certainly employ things, like the S-300 or the S-400 air defense systems, which they have at their disposal, and that could make a big difference. And the other thing that is really important is if they are being trained by the U.S. or by allies, we think that we can do this now in four to five months. But there will be some elements, such as close air support that will not part of the training package that the Ukrainians get.",

It never happens that it all gets worked out well in advance because then everybody is thinking they're leaving something on the table.

A couple of weeks are an eternity, and we don't really know at this point whether June 1st was identified by Secretary Yellen as a date at which we had to begin to worry, but we don't know that that is when we would go over the brink.

There was a cease and desist order, a letter essentially in his file of reprimand, yet he was seen doing it again in January, looking at information on a system that he had no reason to look at by his job.But beyond those letters, it doesn't seem like from what we know there was any action taken against him. Current and former service members we've spoken with say that is absolutely baffling. Even if not after the first one, the second one should have immediately triggered a red flag.

She asked the Republicans on Senate Judiciary Committee to allow the Democrats to appoint someone else temporarily so that she could heal from shingles. And all of these Republicans who say they care about her and they're her friends, people like Lindsey Graham, they wouldn't do it.
