I'm Erin Burnett and we are standing by for a new batch of votes to be posted from two states, Arizona and Nevada. These are the two states with Senate races still up for grabs that really will probably control -- determine who controls the Senate. Of course it could go all the way that runoff in Georgia.But get ready because the most populous county in Arizona, Maricopa, is expected to release more results there. The top official there, Bill Gates, in Maricopa County just telling me that they're about to release results in a little bit more than 62,000 ballots that could provide more clarity in that Senate race between the Democratic Senator Mark Kelly who currently holds the lead over the Republican nominee Blake Masters in the counting. Masters just a short time ago in a fundraising e-mail writing that he is quote expecting a contested road forward and legal battles to come. And in Arizona overall, there are 665,000 votes still outstanding. So, a lot more to be counted, about 400,000 of those are in Maricopa County, 148,000 are in Pima County, that is where Tucson is. aAnd officials for both counties are going to be holding news conferences over the next hour. Now, let me bring you to Nevada. This is the other one we're watching here. Adam Laxalt currently ahead. But as you can see on the 84 percent of the vote is in right now. The Democratic incumbent Catherine Cortez Masto is lagging, but 120,000 votes still have to be counted. So we just don't know. We are expecting more of those votes to come in tonight. And as you can see, both parties still within reach of controlling the Senate. Democrats win Arizona and Nevada they'll have 50 seats without Georgia, which of course is heading to that runoff now on December 6. Right now, Kyung Lah is in Arizona, Gary Tuchman is in Nevada, Jeremy Diamond is at the White House. I want to begin with you in Arizona, Kyung. And obviously we've got anticipating an update here. You've got some more information on some of these votes outstanding right now.",

We're getting a little more clarity on exactly what kind of votes are being counted and will be released as far as the overall tally. We are being told by Maricopa County the elections department that the types of ballots that are going to be included in tonight's release are ballots counted from Saturday night, Sunday and most of Monday. So, these are ballots, early ballots before actual Election Day.And we also got an update from the tabulation process. So what is happening as of just about 30 minutes ago that 17,000 so called box three ballots, they're actually being processed behind me. That process has just begun. Those box three ballots will not be included in tonight's tally. They are anticipate -- the elections department anticipates that that will be a part of tomorrow's tally. So, it is still happening. It is slow, but the county says the reason why is they want to make sure this entire process is accurate. And we keep getting these updates almost hourly from the county. And we anticipate a little bit more information when Bill Gates does hold his news briefing with reporters here at the elections department. I'm also getting a flurry of responses from the various campaigns. The -- on the Republican side, the Kari Lake campaign says for them, the conditions have been changed. They -- their position and posture has not changed until they start counting those Tuesday ballots, which again, will not be a part of tonight's release. At least that's the anticipation. The Mark Kelly campaign, we did get a statement from the campaign manager who says, quote, \"we remain confident that we will win this race.\" And as far as Katie Hobbs, their campaign, even though it is so close with the Kari Lake campaign says that they are still feeling very good.

So right now, Republicans are leading in 222 races, Democrats are leading in 213. If we were done right now, Republicans would have a gain of 10 seats, and they would have a very narrow House Republican majority, if it ended right now. But we're not right now, and this is leading.Look at the races we have called, Republicans have 209 to 192 for the Democrats. So Republicans, you need 218 for the majority. So they're just eight seats away from winning a House majority. But that would be a very narrow House majority even if they got to the 222. But they could get higher than that or it could be lower than that. Let's so -- if you look at the map, I just want to walk through a little bit, 290 -- 209 right now, 292 called races right?",

But this one could be a long time before we get that.And you can go from northern Maine, all the way to Southern California to Alaska. So we have more races to count. The final tally is going to take days, it could even take a couple of weeks. Will we know a House majority in the next day or two? It's possible.

Those ballots either have been mailed in or were putting drop boxes on Election Day. And then there's an additional 13,000 ballots that are either provisional or need to be cured. A lot of people sometimes don't sign their ballots, all they have to do is sign it and then it can be counted.

There's not a lot of evidence for that right now. I think instead, there is a moment where Trump is wounded because people recognize how dangerous he is, or divisive he is and how bad he is for close elections, even in the midterm.

This was an anti-Trump party coalition more than it was a pro- Biden coalition, at least at the margins. And there were other things going on as well. And so I don't know if it's likely that this smells the end of Trump, but I do know that it's never -- it hasn't been this possible for a very long time. And it's going to require institutional actors to step up and figure out how to do this. A lot of it depends on how DeSantis handles things.

But the key vote is in January, and that's where McCarthy would need 218 votes on the House floor in order to become speaker. And that is why the margin is so significant with a narrow House majority, just a handful of defections could be enough to scuttle or complicate McCarthy's bid to become speaker. And in speaking to a number of these conservatives, they are holding out their support for Kevin McCarthy because they want him to commit to a number of rules changes, some of which would give them power to essentially almost a sitting speaker if they don't agree what he is doing on the floor. Now, Scott Perry, who is a member of the House Freedom Caucus, indicated to reporters just moments ago that he is not committing yet and supporting McCarthy speaker bid. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP.
