First up, though we start with the ongoing crisis happening in Gaza. Families are making their way south as Israel orders more evacuations of Gaza. Neighborhoods and warns it is expanding its ground operations to the entire territory. In some cases, this means leaving places where people previously sought shelter. Israel said today it has struck 200 targets. The number of dead in Gaza, edging towards 16,000, according to the Hamas- run health ministry, with more than 300 killed in the past day alone.

The Israeli military saying that overnight, there were some 200 airstrikes across the Gaza Strip, and Israel announcing that it is now expanding its campaign to all of Gaza. Remember, the first five, six weeks of this initial phase of the campaign was in the northern Gaza Strip. Now they're moving south, which raises major concerns about where these civilians are going to go? Of course, northern Gazans had been told to move south and many of them had gone to this city of Khan Younis, where Israeli and American officials now believe many of -- or much of the Hamas leadership has gone to. And so, now Israel is calling on civilians in Khan Younis to move even farther south. The U.N. estimates that there are 1.8 million Gazans, who have been displaced. That is the vast majority of the 2.2-million-person population. Kate, the big question is whether Gazans are actually getting this message. How easy is it for them to actually get that. Israel's relaying these evacuation orders via social media via leaflets that have been dropped with Q.R. codes that take you to a rather complicated map, a grid map with different numbers in different areas. So, not only is it complicated to understand, but it is -- it is that you cannot assume that Gazans are actually getting this message, because of how weak the Internet connection has been because of the numerous blackouts and communication that we have seen over the course of the past few weeks.

There was a strike, according to the head of the pediatric unit there, on one of the entrances. This is a place where there is some, -- where between 5,000 and 6,000 people in the compound of the hotel, of the hospital under the assumption that they might be safe there but what we're seeing is that when it comes to Gaza, really there is nowhere that is safe.

The courtyard is full of body bags. Dozens were killed in a series of Israeli strikes, Saturday, many more still under the rubble.

For instance, Hezbollah says that at least three Hezbollah fighters were killed on Friday and Saturday in different stretches of the border in different incidents. Today, Lebanese state media says that a woman and her child were lightly wounded by an apparent Israeli airstrike. A Syrian man in a separate incident was hurt by some kind of an Israeli blast.

So, this has been an ongoing border conflict. I would describe it as artillery duels across the border. However, the Israeli military has said that it is used war planes to carry out airstrikes on this side of the border as well. And despite the threat, despite the fears and the concern, there are surreal signs of life going on. For instance, in a Christian village that I was in today, I saw people putting up a giant Christmas tree and hanging Christmas lights on it, even as you could see the impacts of Israeli artillery rounds, only a few kilometers away in the distance. And that just gives you a sign of almost how inured people are in this part of Lebanon to conflict. I mean, recall that this is a part of Lebanon that was occupied by the Israeli military for nearly 20 years, up until 2000 -- the year 2000. And in 2006, there was a vicious all-out war in this border region, with Israeli airstrikes being carried out as far out as Southern Beirut. We have not seen that level of intensity of combat, yet the fears are is it could escalate and get to that level. Hezbollah, in almost all of its claims of attacks on the Israeli military, says it's carrying out these attacks to support Palestinians in Gaza. Becky.",

It's a -- it's a -- it's a -- tricky needle to thread to express support for Palestinians to argue that Hezbollah is this force ofresistance that fights against Israel, and yet, is not committing all of its forces and most powerful weapons to that battle. And that may have something to do with the state of Lebanon today. While, I think, anecdotally, there's a great deal of popular sympathy, particularly for civilians in Gaza, and the -- just intolerable civilian death toll there. More than 15,000 civilians killed in under two months of fighting there. At the same time, I think there is very little stomach in Lebanese society for a full-fledged war, the likes of which was this country experienced in 2006. And that might be impart due to the many crises that Lebanon has had to endure in the last couple of years. Crises that some would argue are the making of the governing elites. So, we had the massive blast in the Beirut port, for which nobody has been prosecuted, and an economic collapse that the World Bank has described as one of the worst since the 19th century. The leader of the Maronite Church has gone on record in a Sunday sermon saying that he doesn't want his bullet to drag his country into a war. It is not Lebanon's business. And when you have 30 percent unemployment last year, when you've had the middle class in this country, seeing its savings decimated. That's part of why people are very reluctant to see a repeat of the damage that took place in 2006.",

Now, that will take time as a just transition, we have to take the workers with us. And our net zero target is 2045. So, five years ahead of the U.K. target and many others in the world.
