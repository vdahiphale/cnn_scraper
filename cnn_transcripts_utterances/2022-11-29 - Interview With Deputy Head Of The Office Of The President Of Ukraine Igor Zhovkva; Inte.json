The president of Ukraine has suggested our formed -- and announced our formula of peace. Next day, Russia responded with hundreds of missiles.

Led by the U.S. Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, pledging solidarity and $53 million to bolster the electrical systems. The minister is also added this. We condemn Russia's cruelty against Ukraine civilian populations, such as forcible deportations, torture and barbaric treatment of women, children and persons in vulnerable situations. NATO may say that Putin is failing on the battlefield, but he is exacting a fierce revenge against civilian targets and on Bakhmut right now, a town in the Eastern Donbas. Ukraine's foreign minister says that his country needs, \"Weapons faster, faster and faster\". So, joining me now from Kyiv is President Zelenskyy's Chief Diplomatic Advisor, Igor Zhovkva, welcome back to the program. Can I ask you what I proposed at the beginning of this introduction. Is Ukraine getting the number of weapons that it needs for this winter at war?",

Look what we did in the Kherson region, that is because we got enough amoralized (ph) because you start with the ammunition -- with the artillery fire when you start in the counteroffensive, then you go by manpower using the combat vehicles and tanks.

While for them, it's probably their dream of taking over the Bakhmut and then they are dreaming, this is their cost and dreams since 24th of February to conquer all the Donbas region. Which they're failing to do. I mean, they set themselves deadlines. It was 1st of May, 1st of June, now we're almost at 1st of December, not -- they -- even close they are to get all the territory of Donbas or all the territory of Luhansk.

So, when you fail on the battlefield, you start to fight against civilians. You start to fight against critical infrastructure. You fight -- you start to fight against kindergartens, children's playgrounds, museums, schools and universities. So, this is true. But his aim is to freeze us because we had a winter. The temperatures in Ukraine fall under zero Celsius degrees. And month by month and now week by week, we are experiencing severe massive simultaneous missile attacks over all the major cities of Ukraine. There's no longer safer place in Ukraine currently. This week, we are expecting again the new missile attacks against critical infrastructure. Yes, to deprive us of heat, energy and everything. But we are managing to repair.

So, that's why we want to deprive the world from the great famine. And now the territory act with Russia is doing as of now.

And so, a good deal of what I do for a living, as my late father-in-law said to me when I said I couldn't remember the day that she died. It was always approaching. It was always receding. He said, well, I bet you blew out your candles on your birthday cake as a kid wishing she'd come back. I said, yes. How did you know? And he goes, look what you do for a living. I said, excuse me? He said, you wake the dead. You make Abraham Lincoln and Louis Armstrong come alive. Who do you think you're really going, trying to wake up? And of course, it's her. And so, she is ever-present in my life. In -- there is not a day -- and as you know, the half-life of grief is endless. And yet, what we do with it, the difficulties and the traumas, as we negotiate -- art is the negotiation of the fact that none of us get out of here alive.

And we know what our catechism is. We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal. The guy who wrote that owned hundreds of human beings and his lifetime. And so, we have, in our own collective memory, a group of people who have had the peculiar experience of being unfree in a free land. And that has been the source of so much pain and so much tragedy in the history. And it's also been the source of so much joy and so much positive investment. You can just -- you know, Louis Armstrong alone helps to balance the scales of injustice with his extraordinary art. But you've got -- it's all there in front of us. So, you can't help but do it -- I mean, the main thing about us, Walter, is freedom, you know. Like, and the tension in that, like, what I want, personal freedom versus collective freedom, what we need. And they're often at loggerheads. And I think the book, without consciously or didactically or pedagogical saying it, you see that dynamic in it. You see the majesty of our beautiful continent that we inherited. You see the tragedy of the dispossession of the native peoples. You see all of those tensions. But underlying so many is what historians -- my goodness, I'm an amateur, would call our original sin.
