      "sentences": "He doesn't really talk about Cyrus Vance, the former district attorney, who had the case going back to 2019.If there was such a groundswell of support for charging it, why didn't they do it back then? So there's a lot of blame to go around here. Two, a really important point here is that, if you read the book, there wasn't clear consensus, I believe, in the office as to whether to charge. Certainly Pomerantz and one of his colleagues felt strongly the charges should have proceeded but there were others in the office who didn't. So, you know, I don't think it's a difference of two people's opinion. I think it was a complicated decision that this office was grappling with and that one of the very senior and, frankly, very accomplished attorneys just doesn't agree with the decision that got made.",

It does seem like the bar in order to obtain a conviction of a former president needs to be ironclad evidence.But the current Manhattan D.A., at the moment, seems to be much more focused and interested in Trump's alleged role in these hush money payments that were made to Stormy Daniels. Now, I guess the question is, could that just be an easier case to prove and, if it is, why?",

Number one, you have Stormy Daniels, who would likely come forward to testify.Number two, Michael Cohen, Trump's lawyer and former fixer. The challenge with Michael Cohen, he has a perjury conviction and he's sort of a, for lack of a better term, \"dirty witness,\" and he would get beaten up. What you have in the Stormy Daniels case is a number of checks that were signed, hush payments, I believe with the former president himself. You have some evidence tying him to the actual crime that might have been more complicated in a vast real estate valuation scheme. But it's hard to know if none of us have seen sort of the case files that all these prosecutors have. It's hard to know exactly why one case is -- seems to be moving forward and one isn't.",

Ukrainian President Zelenskyy spent months trying to wrangle this military equipment from Western allies.And it could be an important step for Ukrainian troops as officials warn that Russia is likely preparing a major offensive. CNN's Nic Robertson is near the army base in Estonia where this training is taking place. Nic, how soon could the tanks make their way to the front lines? How long will the training take?",

      "sentences": "I think the training is going to be shortened as much as possible because the Ukrainians are desperate to get them to the front lines.But I've been speaking with the tank crews from the Danish Leopard II tanks. The Danish government hasn't decided if it's going to send Leopard II tanks, along with the Germans doing it, the Portuguese and others. The Polish as well. But they all train very much in a similar way. And what this tank commander was telling us is, it takes about two weeks to get a crew ready to move the vehicle around.  It takes about two months to get them sort of familiar enough to really use it effectively in battle, not get it blown up quickly. But to actually use it with other tanks on an operation with infantry, which is what the Ukrainians want to do, punch through the Russian lines, seize territory. That's going to take a lot longer. I think, realistically, by mid- summer, you can expect to see these tanks being used somewhat effectively by the Ukrainian forces. Perhaps by the -- by fall, being able to put together big attacks. That's a bit of a stretch from where we stand at the moment. But they know when they get these tanks in their hands, they have greater maneuverability, fire capability. They fire further, fire faster, which means they're more destructive. And they can maneuver on the battlefield better and fight at night and shoot at one target while hunting another target. All of these things make them more effective. And from what we've seen here in the forests here, these huge beasts, 60 tons, move with really lightning speed, racing around the forest here. Right now, I can tell you, they're hiding in the forest because part of the military exercise tonight is that the French commandos are going to try to find the Danish Leopard II tanks. And that's another skill set that the Ukrainians will learn, how to hide these huge pieces of military equipment in the forest so they can't be spotted by drones or thermal imaging. A lot to learn. They're big pieces of kit, high tech, but a lot of important things they need to understand about them.",

He said he was alone with the congressman in his congressional office.And he says, at one point, the congressman came over to him, put his hand on his leg, put his hand on his groin, and then invited him over to his house that evening. And that's when Myers says he pushed the congressman's hand back and left the office. Now, at the time, Myers was not an official employee in Santos' office. He says he was working in a volunteer capacity, he was waiting for formal paperwork to go through, finalizing a formal job from the office. Now notably five days after the incident, Myers says that he received a call from Santos' office questioning him more about his background, specifically his time as a journalist. And then it was then, a few days later, Myers said his job offer was rescinded by the congressman's office. Up on Capitol Hill a few hours ago, the congressman, for the first time, responded to claims of these allegations, and he said to CNN that these allegations are 100 percent false.

So the commander of NORTHCOM briefed reporters, saying the delay in shooting down the balloon allowed the U.S. to collect very significant intelligence about what was actually inside of it.And the reason they were able to do that, actually, is because they were granted -- the military was granted specific authorizations by the U.S. government to collect intelligence on this object. Which is not something they would normally be able to do on something within the United States. So they were granted very specific and special authorizations to do so. In that kind of two-day, three-day delay, as it transited over the continental U.S., they say they were able to collect important information about how this balloon works. Interestingly, we're also learning more about what the debris field actually looks like from this balloon that was shot down on Saturday. And we are told that \"USS Pathfinder,\" a survey ship, is on-site and mapping that out right now. The debris field is about the size of 15 football fields by 15 football fields. So it's pretty large, about one square mile. They're still going through this recovery operation. And they have not given us any details yet on what they have actually been able to recover intact from this balloon. Of course, that is going to be really key in terms of what they are able to recover and then send to a lab to analyze and what they can find out anything more about China's surveillance program here -- Abby?",
