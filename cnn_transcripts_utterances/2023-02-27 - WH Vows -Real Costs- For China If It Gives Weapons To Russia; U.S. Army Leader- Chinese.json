But U.S. intelligence officials now believe that China is considering providing Russia with drones and ammunition. And there are active negotiations according to multiple sources about the price and scope of that kind of lethal assistance. Now, U.S. intelligence officials have information suggesting that China is leaning towards providing that lethal assistance, but so far, no indication that a decision has been made.

And U.S. officials are hopeful that by being so public with these warnings, that perhaps they can change the minds of Chinese leaders who might be leaning towards providing this lethal assistance.

I think that although they're making public pronouncements to the contrary, perhaps or at least, they tried to participate by putting out this 12-point peace plan. Of course, they forgot about the 13th point which was, of course, removing all foreign troops from the sovereign state of Ukraine. But I don't think that their economy is fragile right now. They're just coming out of COVID and I really don't think they're serious about supporting the Russians in a big way. I just don't think we're going to see that happen. And I think that actually behind closed doors, they told them, look, Vladimir, we're not going to support you on this much longer.

I know you came up with a suggestion that it appears the administration is at least mauling and that is sending over weapons that were seized from Iran. How significant would a move like that be?KENDALL-TAYLOR: Well, I don't think it's a silver bullet, certainly. And in many ways, it's more symbolic. Yes, my colleague, Jonathan Ward at CNAS and I produced a piece in The Washington Post that called on the United States to take weapons that the U.S. military and also the French and the British have seized weapons that were heading from Iran to Yemen to support the Houthis in their civil war. A lot of those weapons are now just sitting gathering dust in ammunition depots. And so what we're calling on is for the Biden administration to consider sending those weapons to Ukraine. Already the United States is scrambling to increase our own production of ammunition to keep pace with what Ukraine is using in the war. So this is a really low cost opportunity to support Ukraine. The Biden administration has already shown tremendous creativity in the tools that they've used, the approaches to support Ukraine, so I think this is another important way. And by the way, relations between Russia and China - sorry, Russia and Iran have been deepening significantly. So this is another way, I think, to introduce some friction in the Russia-Iran relationship that also serves our interests.",

Recent Comments by Scott Adams regarding race and race relations do not align with our core values as a company.\" So what we're seeing are these major publications, including the Washington Post that describing these recent comments that you just played a short while ago as basically promoting segregation. And you also have the heads of other publications that are calling this basically a racist rant. And what's interesting when you listen to his hours of recent streaming, it's very difficult to gauge just how concerned he is right now. For starters, he loves attention. And I know that because I heard him say it during his latest stream. He also said that he was expecting this level of backlash, even as he was saying these comments he just played a short while ago. And he's also very familiar with the fact that he expects to lose a majority of his income as well. However, he says this is \"a useful provocation.\" There are many ways to start a conversation about race in America and referring to black people as a hate group is certainly not one of them.
