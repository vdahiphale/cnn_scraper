      "sentences": "Good morning, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt, live in Washington, D.C.And we do begin this hour with major breaking news overnight. A bridge in Baltimore collapsing after it was hit by a large ship. You can see that happening there. Video from that live-stream shows the moment of impact with the Francis Scott Key Bridge which then crumbles into the water. This happened around 1:30 a.m. Eastern Time overnight. Officials say that multiple cars fell into the Patapsco River below. Right now, rescue crews are searching for at least seven people. One official called the collapse a quote, developing mass casualty event. CNN's Gabe Cohen has been dispatched to Baltimore. He joins us on the phone and route to the scene. Gabe, good morning to you. What do we know at this hour? GABE COHEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (via telephone):  Yes. So, Kasie, is you mentioned at this hour we have confirmed that this shipping container, a couple of hours ago around 1:30 a.m. Eastern Time collided with it appears to a column of the Key Bridge. That's along the Interstate 695 here in Baltimore. It is a critical bridge if you live in Washington in Baltimore, New York, Philadelphia, as you drive through the region, it gets a lot of traffic and as we understand it, there may have been according to the fire department, a little bit of low visibility when the shipping container collided with the column. We don't know exactly what went wrong, but according to emergency crews they're looking for potentially 20 people in Patapsco River at this hour. We don't know the latest on any potential injuries, but it's a fairly frantic scene. I can tell you were in the area around Baltimore, not far from the bridge. But first responders have that entire area around Interstate 695, around the Key Bridge are locked down. We're seeing crews flying by us, there are a lot of different departments that seemed to have responded to this. We know that different federal agencies are involved both in the search. They're trying to rescue people who were in the water. We just don't have much of an update at this hour, Kasie, on how they're doing. But we know the Patapsco River this time of year might be 45 degrees or so according to some of the data we're seeing online. And so it would be a really urgent search to reach people who might have one to three hours in water temperature, that cold as, as crews tried to rescue them",

      "sentences": "Well, Kasie, it's not totally clear right now. As I mentioned, they really have the area locked down as were still seeing those crews coming in and out. And look, this is a really industrial area. Shipping containers are constantly coming in and out there are a lot of these ports and shipyards along the water, along the Patapsco River as you head into Baltimore.So it's not an area where there are a lot of homes along the water right here. This is a lot of industrial space and so we're not really sure at what point we're going to get much access to this because as you can tell from the aerials and the video, that's emerged of the collapse, this is really a disaster zone right now. This is a serious seen where they are still working on the acute crisis, which is rescuing people out of the water as you said, we've heard seven, we've also heard up to 20 from fire crews. And so, they I think are very focused on that right now, and they are trying to keep everybody out because it's still quite an urgent scene.",

      "sentences": "No, of course. So, Gabe, just to bring everyone up to speed, who may be just joining us here. This again, is the Francis Scott Key Bridge outside, it's in Baltimore Maryland. It's the outermost crossing of the Baltimore harbor. So ships that are coming in from the Chesapeake Bay, this would be the first bridge that they would go underneath on their way in to Baltimore harbor.There you can see it on your screen. That's the map. That's also the road. It's called 695 here in this area. It's known as the Baltimore Beltway and it runs in a circle around the city of Baltimore. It's really an essential traffic link according to the Transit Authority in Maryland, it carries about 11 million people over the course of the year was opened in March of 1977. It's named for the author of the Star Spangled Banner, and you of course may remember that that was written in Baltimore. And so, this is you know, the history of this -- this bridge, the events that took place here, of course, is this critical transit link. Now, if you look on the right of your screen, this is a live picture that we're getting in from an affiliate. You can see the ship is still there. And these sort of emergency responders have noted that there are some containers that are still its difficult to see in this picture because the sun obviously is not up yet, but there are some of these containers hanging in a way that is making this a very difficult scene for first responders who, of course, have to be very, very careful in how they are approaching this. Now, again, Gabe, we're just learning early details about the ship itself as I said, a little bit earlier, its a Singaporean flagged ship the Dali, I think its important for people to understand that its very common to see ships of this size, container ships coming and going. If you're driving on these roads in the Baltimore area, this is not an unusual situation or site by any means, it's something that is routine only navigated safely by ships of this size and magnitude. I do think, you know, one thing people have been pointing out, Gabe, is that it did seem to hit the support structure dead on in a way that caused the immediate and basically total collapse of the span.",

      "sentences": "For sure, Gabe. And again, let's just pause here for a second and bring everyone up to speed because we did speak with Kevin Cartwright of the Baltimore city fire department on our air here about a half an hour ago, 40 minutes ago or so, and he did update us too, as you point out, call the same mass casualty multi-agency incident.He said that there may be up to 20 individuals in the Patapsco River, which is the name of this body of water at this point where the bridge crosses, as well as he says multiple -- multiple vehicles in the water as well. And again, as we noted at the ship, and you can see it live on the darker picture you're seeing on the right side of your screen is live video. On the left side of your screen, what you're seeing is, the moment that this bridge collapsed at about 1:30 a.m. Eastern Time overnight and you can see that it hit on the way down the top of these piles of containers that the ship was carrying. And that those containers are now presenting hazards to these teams that are trying to rescue people in the river. Mr. Cartwright, again, the Baltimore Fire Department representative, did also tell us that there are divers in the water, right now trying to conduct these rescues. We've also seen on social media that there are volunteer fire departments, for example, from Harford County, which is a neighboring -- neighboring county to Baltimore County. Heading to the scene really underscores your -- your point, Gabe, that this is a real all hands on deck type of situation as -- I mean, this is really kind of a once in a lifetime event for a city like Baltimore, that something like this, what unfold. And again, to give people some contexts, this is used by 11 million people over the year per year. This bridge, it's a major route for commuters in this major metropolitan area that Baltimore, Washington consists of. And the bridge is actually located, so it's named for Francis Scott Key, author of \"The Star Spangled Banner\". It's -- it crosses within 100 yards of the site where Key watched the bombardment of Fort McHenry in September of 1814. And, of course, it's that battle that inspired him to write the words of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\", that's again within view. You can see Fort McHenry off in the distance when you drive across this bridge, which I have personally done many times in my life. Gabe, let's just start again from the top as more and more people join in with us and learn about this as they find themselves waking up. Let's just walk through what we know about what happened early this morning and where things stand now.",

So, I decided to drive p because an old dog is chasing the fire truck and came up here, and was progress, this was a multijurisdictional response to a disaster. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

You know, I think that obviously anyone who watches this video would, of course, have so many questions about how something like this could happen. The fact that the collision was so dead on with that support structure to cause this to happen, the way that it did. Obviously, we don't want to get into irresponsible speculating at all, but what can you give people who look at this and wonder, how could this have happened? Could it happen by accident? Did somebody do it deliberately? What do you see when you watch this?",

There may have been in mechanical issues. There may have been systems that weren't working, any number of which can have impact on the pilots of the boat, essentially, not knowing that they were going to close or at this case, right at that support structure.So there's -- there are many mechanical malfunction excuses that might play into this before we get to the point of somebody who did something intentional. And so, of course, you're going to want to ask all those things and then you're going to want to know all the background information from the people who are responsible for piloting that vessel at the time, how long they've been on the job, whether or not they've had any issues, problems in other employment roles, whether they've been on other boats that have bumped into things that they shouldn't have. An innumerable number of competence and mechanical issues that are probably more likely to play into the answer to this question than something intentional but those are the roads that investigators are going to have to go down. It will be essential to have the support and the transparency of the corporate entities that own this vessel to ensure that they get this sort of transparency and cooperation at a folks they possibly can that can be very dicey in and of itself because these people are and the corporations behind them, or are likely now going to be subjected to intense and debilitating -- at least case civil lawsuits over the massive losses that are going to be connected to this to event. And you have folks don't like to talk when litigation is hanging in the balance. So these are all things that the investigators are going to have to get over, you know, problems, hurdles are going to have to navigate in trying to get any information out of this company and its employees and those folks who are on the scene.",
