And Nikki Haley is still hanging on. But for how long, after seeing her hopes all but slip away on Super Tuesday? A live look at the White House right there in front of the Washington Monument. They're still not awake there. Come on, guys. It's 6 a.m. here on the East Coast. Good morning, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt. It's wonderful to have you with us. It looks like that November rematch that most Americans tell us they don't want, well, it's exactly what we're all going to get, after Donald Trump's near sweep on Super Tuesday. Trump dominating nearly every race, winning by big margins in state after state and now closing in pretty quickly on the 1,215 delegates he needs to clinch the nomination. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They're former Republicans that Donald Trump alienated throughout his last umpteen years of doing exactly what he's done. And they're Democrats who used to be Republicans. That's just -- that's a 35 percent grouping that is really quantifiable heartburn. And it's important work. You know, it's interesting to hear Donald Trump call her angry, right? Nice and sweet or whatever his words were, the first parts of the campaign, which I think was a mistake on her -- on her part. I think it was a mistake on hers and Ron DeSantis's.

And Kasie, you've covered campaigns for long enough to know that that's pretty telling.Of course, there were no public remarks that Nikki Haley had scheduled. There weren't any campaign events that she had scheduled beyond Super Tuesday events that happened in Texas on Monday. So it was clear that they were really focused in on the results last night to determine the future of her campaign. And obviously, as they tabulated everything that was coming in, it was clear enough to them that they felt that this was the moment for her to bow out, not to continue campaigning on. Now, when you talk to campaign officials, they also said that there was a sense of jubilation among the campaign last night, that they were happy warriors, that they were feeling good. I do think that Nikki Haley's campaign feels like she did what she set out to do, which of course, you know, not becoming the nominee is not ideal. She wanted to be the nominee of the party. But she did set out to try and make the case that there is an alternative pathway forward for the Republican Party here. She truly believes that there are principles that the Republican Party should stand for, that Donald Trump does not stand for. And she made that case incredibly clearly throughout the entire course of her campaign. Just last week, she was campaigning in more than ten states leading into Super Tuesday, even though they knew that the stakes were going to be incredibly high, that the odds were incredibly low that she was actually going to be able to clinch the nomination. She was still out there campaigning, making sure that Americans who wanted an alternative to former President Trump had an option that they could choose in her. HUNT: All right. Kylie Atwood, thanks very much for your great reporting, for being on top of it for us this morning. Really appreciate it. Our panel is back with us. And David, let me just put this question to you.

She is somebody who worked in his administration, as well. So that's immediately what I look towards. But I think you're right. This is -- this becomes the immediate pressing question now.

They really felt that Nikki Haley was standing in the way of making it official that he would be the nominee. But they had already been really turning their attention to November and to taking on Joe Biden. But this will help them in a number of ways, having Donald Trump be declared the presumptive nominee. Of course, we have to see what will happen with the upcoming primaries. We knew that they were really hoping to be able to declare him the presumptive nominee next week with some of these other races that would really give him the necessary 1,215 delegates to make it so. But the whole goal for them is to be able to do that as early as possible, which they now feel they will be able to do and really unite the Republican Party behind him. They want to be able to pull from not just the Republican hold-out voters that they are looking for, but also donors. And the money part here is a huge deal. They want to be able to have the RNC officially be able to come behind Donald Trump, to use the infrastructure of the national Republican Party to boost him in a potential general election campaign.",

Like he privately snubbed her around, you know, requests to have dinner with him and some other things that were, you know, not normally how Trump would necessarily -- basically this has signaled Trump was pretty unhappy with her. How is he likely to interact with her going forward? Say if she was willing to endorse him or are we more likely to see him continue to attack her? TREENE: You know, it's interesting. I think -- and we can look kind of at Ron DeSantis as part of this. You know, Donald Trump for the majority of last year, had railed against Ron DeSantis, the Florida governor. A lot of that was from personal animosity against him for believing he wasn't loyal. And then once he came out and endorsed him, Donald Trump kind of laid off him. And actually, they were willing to embrace Ron DeSantis if he were to be a surrogate. Of course, that's a different case. But it's actually a little bit different with Nikki Haley from my conversations with Trump's campaign, they believe that Nikki Haley has gone too far. We've reported this many times, that Donald Trump has been grumbling even long after his aides had told him to just focus on Joe Biden, he's been very frustrated with Nikki Haley for remaining in the race for as long as she did. And has been very frustrated with her criticism of him. They feel that she's really gone very far, not only in that criticism, but also with some of her policy. So I think it'll be harder for Donald Trump and his campaign to embrace her, if she were to endorse. Of course, that's a big question. If she would even do that after what she has been saying on the trail in the last several months. So I think an interest of relationship between them will never be what it once was. I don't think, you know, there's going to be a wholehearted embrace of Nikki Haley, regardless of whether she endorses. And the other part of this, too, I just want to bring up is that, you know, they really do not think that Nikki Haley is a part of the Trump Republican Party. And that's what a lot of this will come down to, I think, regardless of what she does with the potential endorsement. They see her as, you know, being a different part of Republicanism, a different part of conservatism, someone that does not represent the Trump ideals. So I have a very hard time believing that they'll -- they'll find a strong place for her in the Trump world or in the Trump operation looking forward. But, you know, we don't really know. There are times when Donald Trump has had a lot of critics in the past who have fiercely attacked him. And then later on embrace them for the sake of the party. As his advisers argue, they would rather fight Democrats than fight Republicans. But we'll see what happens.",

Alayna, thank you very much.I mean, so I think we should just take a beat, too, to just point out, you know, what Nikki Haley has accomplished in this race. I mean, she went farther than I think a lot of people expected her to, certainly when she first got in. It was driven by debate performances early on. And she did, for as much as, you know, people have been joking about Vermont and the District of Columbia kind of already here. She is the first woman to win a Republican presidential primary contest. KANNO-YOUNGS: But I think that's right. I think it was mentioned earlier that, even though you have Trump sort of talking about how the party is unified, clearly, there was some representation here of the frustration with the former president, what he represents. And more broadly, just sort -- I think there's a lot -- I speak to a lot of voters, even on the Democratic side, that often talk about sort of the remainder (ph) of the status quo with these candidates, as well. So I think there she represents some of that frustration, as well, when it comes to the age of these candidates and sort of a lack of satisfaction with them. You're right, there was also the debate performances. I mean, going up against Ramaswamy, as well. And sort of some of those moments definitely benefited her. And you also saw her lean on sort of some of the experience, both in state government, as well as foreign policy experience. But I mean clearly, Trump has grip on this party right now.",

Right?If it's Joe Biden and Donald Trump, there's 100 million folks. And they're there for a number of reasons, right? If you're a Republican and you're not with Donald Trump, it's because you don't believe the 2020 election was rigged. It's because you're disgusted by the personal behavior. You're disgusted by the lack of ethics and morals and values and the family. How do I explain to my teenage kids how to act and grow up when somebody who's supposed to be the head of my party acts and does and says things -- the same things to do. Democrats have their own list of issues. And I'm sure you would wish, if you can hit the reset button, you'd pick somebody younger than Joe Biden, somebody who was more polished and policy centered. But the reality is that's where we're at. We have culture problems in our parties. And for -- if you're a company and you have a culture problem, you don't make micro-sized changes. You change the leader. And to me, this is the tectonic shift. Nikki Haley proved that there's a culture problem inside the Republican Party. And it's exact -- the exact number is 35 percent. That creates the permanent math problem for Donald Trump in this coming election. No matter how bad Joe Biden is, Donald Trump cannot beat him.

The real meat of the debate was the middle third, which was \"consider Trump and others.\" They had voted, supported him in the past, but were open to another candidate. That's where we tried to get in on the DeSantis side and battle him. And it was really hard lane. But as the Tim Scotts of the world and others started to drop out, Nikki grew in that \"never consider Trump\" universe. So unfortunately for her, it wasn't a pro-Haley universe. It was just a universe of folks that, to the governor's point, were dissatisfied with Donald Trump, were not going to support him across the board. And she fit that model.
