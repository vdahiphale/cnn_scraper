The pictureonly tells half the story in a sense, the half of the blackout because of the failure of electricity, but the situation is extremely tense, as Israel has told half the territory of -- the total of Gaza to evacuate south and that is something the UN says is impossible. Meanwhile, the IDF says it is carrying out local raids. Friday, October the 13th. I'm Richard Quest, good evening to you. The picture of Gaza that we all see as we all see what happens. Israel says it's infantry and armored units have been entering the Gaza Strip for the first time since the Hamas attack last weekend. The IDF says \". soldiers collected and searched evidence that would assist in the effort to locate hostages. In addition, IDF soldiers thwarted terrorist cells and infrastructure located in the air located in the area.\" The Israeli forces have told people living in Northern Gaza to evacuate south for their own safety. We're talking here about more than a million people to relocate to the southern parts of the region, a region that didn't have its own right is absolutely jam packed to begin with, and from which there is no way out as the Rafah Crossing has also been closed. CNN's Becky Anderson is in Jerusalem. Becky, tonight, two aspects of this: The warning to move south, and the first, if you will, that we know of anyway, incursions by the IDF into Gaza.",

And as you absolutely rightly pointed out, this is the IDF telling us in an effort to try and locate these hostages between a hundred and a hundred fifty of them, the IDF hasn't said exactly how many, but that is Hamas' count. We know these hostages, according to Hamas are littered around Gaza, so it's very difficult for the IDF to know where to start at this point, but they are definitely looking for evidence about where these hostages might be and also trying to denigrate Hamas' military capabilities on the ground. Richard, what we don't know is how many raids were conducted. They say that this was in a day when those were specifically conducted, or whether they actually were able to collect any decent evidence as to where these hostages might be. But it is really important that we sort of think about the context of this because of course we are, you know, a way to anticipating what could be certainly the prospect of a huge assault, a ground incursion. They have saturated, the southern part of the Israeli border with some 300,000 troops. They have given a 24-hour warning. You're absolutely right to point that out as well, 24 hours to evacuate that area, a million people down to the south. Let's just consider the size of that. That is the size of Delaware's population, asking in 24 hours, and this was midnight last night. And I speak to you at what -- 10 o'clock here, so we've got two hours to go if the Israelis were to stick to that, to get a million people down south of the Wadi Gaza. So you know, this is really tough stuff, and the UN has been very specific about saying that this is an -- this is almost an impossibility. I just want to bring up a statement from the UN because I think this is important to point out. If you can get that statement up onto the screen for our viewers.",

He was concerned about what was going on at the Haram Al Sharif or the Temple Mount complex. Of course, the Jordanians have custodianship over that Holy Site, a Holy Site for Judaism, of course, the site of the third holiest shrine in Islam, the Al Aqsa, and of course, this is a revered site for Christians. And Hamas now using much of what we've seen, the escalation of violence that we have seen at that site talking about the desecration of the Al Aqsa Mosque. Hamas have been using that as a reason for what was this monstrous attack Saturday, last week.

WESLEY CLARK (RET), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:   I think it's going to be a reconnaissance-driven operation. So they've already started moving. They've got other first raids that have gone in, they're probably going in to some of the headquarters sites that have been bombed. They're looking for information, for paperwork, for broken computer disks or whatever that will give them greater information. At the same time, they are building up their strength. They're working their plans, but there is no urgency about this than it has to be done tonight. One thing you have to do is do it right. Now, the objective has been given by Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu to eliminate Hamas. That is very tall order it is going to be a very difficult thing to do.

So I think we have to keep the balance in sight here. Yes, we're worried about these million people. And the world is working with Egypt to try to get that border crossing, open at Rafah, but you can also understand that President Sisi is not so happy to have a hundred thousand, two hundred, five hundred thousand Palestinians swarming into Sinai at this point.

There'll be suicide bombers, there'll be minefields. There'll be all kinds of obstacles. So they'll try to make it as painful as possible. Can Israel do it? Yes. But Israel hasn't wanted to do it up till now. Israel believed the fiction that they could live with Hamas. And apparently Hamas put that fiction out so they could prepare militarily for this two- phase attack. It's a two-phase attack. Phase one is you strike in Israel. Phase two, you go on the defense against the Israelis, when they come in, and use the advantage of the built up urban area and the population to not only inflict losses on Israel, bog it down, embarrass it internationally, cause international opprobrium and upset all the other moderate regimes in the region.

That is most of the population. It is the most heavily concentrated part of the population of the entire Gaza Strip and they are essentially saying evacuate the entire part of that population into the south where there is no infrastructure of any significance. On top of that, there are a very large number of hospitals, which are already of course, inevitably under extreme strain both in terms of numbers, fuel, and supplies. Gaza is now entirely besieged, fuel cut off. They can't move critically injured patients. So far, authorities there have told CNN that that would be a death sentence to move these people. So yes, people are on the move. Hamas is not preventing anybody in that area from leaving, they're asking people to stay, it is true, that they cite military locations alongside and under civilian buildings and other targets or other places that shouldn't be targets. And that if targeted, or indeed used as a military bases covertly, both of those ideas potentially could be subjected to war crimes prosecution.

I mean, they may simply get overwhelmed by the sheer weight of humanity there, there isn't a massive Egyptian presence, and they certainly wouldn't want to be in the business of shooting refugees who themselves are fleeing airstrikes or a ground assault. So it's a bit of a conundrum for the Egyptians, but they are politically allergic to the idea of, first of all, allowing the Israelis in their view to empty the Gaza Strip of its Palestinian population. And then secondly, coping with the importation of potentially two million Palestinians into Egyptian territory that could never go back. For example, there are still the descendants of refugees from the 1948 wars between the Israelis and Arabs in what was then the Palestine and the newly born Israeli state, they are still stateless and citizens, for example of Southern Lebanon and of course, considerable or have been the source of considerable friction and problems ever since, and of course, living in very frequently miserable condition.

You know, the situation on the ground in Gaza is very dire, as I say, already, the IDF, the Israeli Defense Forces say that they've engaged in limited land incursions into the Gaza Strip to deny the militants, the ability to fire rockets in that way into Israeli territory. The IDF are also looking for the places where hostages are being held captive. So, remember, what complicates this military operation more than really any other incursion that we've seen by the Israeli armed forces into Gaza isn't just the scale of it. It's the fact that there are between 100 and 150 Israeli hostages being held at secret locations across the area and that is complicating.",

I mean, to your original point about intent, I think, you know, it might be that this has -- this has become a catastrophic success for Hamas, that the ineptitude of the initial hours in terms of the Israeli response, meant that Hamas was far more successful than it could have ever imagined. And so, I think that might be part of the equation. But clearly, when Hamas marches across border offensive of this magnitude, there has to be an expectation that there would be serious response. And of course, they've been planning for it. And that's part of the reason that many people are very concerned about what a major ground offensive in Gaza looks like. And of course, the scale and ferocity of that offensive and what that fighting looks like, also has direct implication in terms of the assassination risks.",

I wouldn't waste your time talking about U.S. domestic politics except forthe effect it could have on what's happening elsewhere in the world. And the race or the attempt to find a new Speaker of the House has grown even more chaotic with potentially serious consequences. The majority leader Steve Scalise has dropped out. He cited a lack of support. He had a very slim win over Jim Jordan when the caucus voted, the conference voted. Jordan is a staunch ally of Trump. He says he will seek the job. However, it's unclear if he has enough votes to win the gavel. Not if you look at how many he got when it was the first vote. Depends how many you would take from Scalise. And then a new candidate, Austin Scott has decided he'll throw his hat into the ring. Until we get a new house speaker, the House is effectively paralyzed and can't improve emergency aid for Israel. CNNs Melanie Zanona joins me from Capitol Hill. I mean, you couldn't write this in a book and people believe it. We thought Scalise was it. Look, it all comes down to this rump of a 15 or so recalcitrant renegades on the Republican Party. Do we know if they will support Jordan?",
