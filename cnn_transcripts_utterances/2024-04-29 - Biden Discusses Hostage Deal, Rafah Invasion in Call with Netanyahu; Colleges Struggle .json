This is what 136-mile- per-hour winds is capable of doing.Look at this overturned United States postal truck. Look at those cinder blocks, complete walls tossed over like they were toys snapped, sides of buildings. You can see roofs completely taken off of homes. This, unfortunately, caused 30 injuries and one fatality in this area. And get this: they had two large and extremely dangerous tornadoes coincide into Sulphur, Oklahoma in less than one hour. This is all Saturday night. And of course, you can imagine the fear that that struck into the community here as that continued, with one initial tornado causing this damage and a secondary tornado bearing in on the same area. That particular day, there were the most tornado warnings in a single day from the Norman, Oklahoma city weather office. That's a significant statement, because this is Tornado Alley. This is where we get the most tornadoes in the country. And in fact, when you start issuing that many tornado warnings, you know it's been active. A hundred and thirty-seven all weekend. We are nearing the average to date. And there is still more strong storms ongoing across the Deep South as we speak -- Kasie.",
