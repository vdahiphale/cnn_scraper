      "sentences": "Right. Well, the DALI is this Singapore-flagged, a container ship built in 2015 and operated by a Singaporean company called Synergy. To give you a sense of the scale. It's a -- just under 300 meters long. And I'm here in the port of Hong Kong to give you a sense or viewers of just how gargantuan these containerships can be.This one that we're looking owned and operated by different companies is about 360, 370 meters long, maybe 70 meters longer than the one involved in this deadly accident. You can see that it is loaded with five, six containers high on top of the decks. The DALI at the time of the deadly collision had more than 4600 containers on board according to the management company and could have been carrying up to 10,000 containers. That's just to give you a sense of how much cargo these things can carry. Now people are going to be looking at its safety record. As recently as September of last year, the U.S. Coast Guard inspected the DALI and found no deficiencies with it. However, in June of last year, authorities in Chile, they inspected the DALI and they did find a deficiency that they reported saying there were structural conditions, sorry, that there was a deficiency involving propulsion, and auxiliary machinery, gauges, thermometers, et cetera. So, propulsion is part of what led to the accident in Baltimore. It'll be important to see if there could have been any connection whatsoever between what was going on in June and what happened in Baltimore this week. There was also a record of something taking place a collision in November of 2016, involving the DALI. Other issues to look at are deadly incidents involving ships -- other ships managed by the Singaporean company Synergy because we've been able to track down that there were at least three deadly incidents involving this company's ships since 2018. A crew member dying aboard one ship off the coast of Australia due to an elevator accident in 2018. In 2019, an officer went missing and likely fell overboard. That was in Singapore. And then there was a collision in 2023 between a tanker ship operated by synergy and a barge from the Philippines. Now to give some more context here, there is another container over here in the port of Hong Kong and it is right next to a suspension bridge. That's bridge -- stone cutters bridge sort of get into a busy port like this. Ships like this have to pass under bridges. The Francis Scott Key bridge was constructed at the end of the 1970s. Industry insiders say that container ships of this size simply didn't exist in those days. They had not been built to the size of ships like that which is 400 meters long. If you lay a skyscraper sideways that would be 70, 80, 90-storey building. There have been precedent -- there has been precedent for collisions. In fact, just last month, up the Pearl River from where I'm floating right now, a Chinese barge hit a bridge in the city of Guangzhou. Now that accident involved a smaller ship -- a smaller segment of the bridge collapsed. [02:10:06] A least five people were killed. There were several vehicles that went hurtling off the bridge landing on the boat or in the water. And that happened on February 22nd. So, apparently this is a growing concern when it comes to vital international shipping.",

Well, another major abortion decision looms for the U.S. Supreme Court after hearing arguments and a case over access to the pill Mifepristone. It is the primary drug use for medication abortions. While a ruling is not expected for months, a majority of justices already appear skeptical of a nationwide ban or new limits on the pill.CNN's Paula Reid has details from Washington. PAULA REID, CNN SENIOR LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Hundreds of protesters gathered on the steps of the Supreme Court as the justices considered the most significant abortion case simply overturn Roe v. Wade. This case focuses on expanded access to Mifepristone. One of two drugs typically used in the process known as medication abortion, which accounts for roughly two-thirds of abortions in the U.S. But during Tuesday's arguments, a majority of the justices appeared likely to maintain the expanded access to the drug which was first approved by the FDA in 2000. NEIL GORSUCH, ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE U.S. SUPREME COURT: We've had one might call it a rash of universal injunctions or vacatures. And this case seems like a prime example of turning what could be a small lawsuit into a nationwide legislative assembly on an FDA rule or any other federal government action. REID (voice-over): Shortly after Roe is overturned, a conservative group of anti-abortion doctors and advocates sued the FDA over its approval of Mifepristone. The case now focuses on FDA approval of expanded access to the drug.",

REID (voice-over): And Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson pressed on why the group believes restricting everyone's access to the drug is necessary, given the doctors can raise religious objections under federal law. KETANJI BROWN JACKSON, ASSOCIATE JUSTICE TO THE U.S. SUPREME COURT: I mean, it makes perfect sense for the individual doctors to seek an exemption. But as I understand it, they already had that. And so, what they're asking for here is that in order to prevent them from possibly ever having to do these kinds of procedures, everyone else should be prevented from getting access to this medication. So, why isn't that cleanly overbroad scope of the remedy, the end of this case? REID (on camera): We expect this decision to come in late June, which will of course be the heart of the presidential campaign season. Now whatever the justice is designed here could potentially be a factor in that critical race. Since Roe was overturned the Democrats have used the abortion issue to galvanize other supporters, or as former President Trump who has taken credit for roe being overturned has also said look when it comes to Republicans, there needs to be some concessions on this issue because, \"we need to win elections.\" Paula Reid, CNN, Washington.",

What's to stop anyone in rogue plaintiffs from going after other drugs that might offend their religious or political sensibilities in some other way? And also, from a technical standpoint, if companies can't rest assured the FDA approval is here to stay. It's especially after 20 years of studies and trials and being proven safe and effective, then why would companies invest billions of dollars in years and sometimes even decades and to developing these extremely expensive and groundbreaking new drugs? And drugs have to undergo extensive studies and trials in the abortion pill, in particular, has withstood and survived decades of scrutiny. And has been proven safe and effective time and time again. And I think it's just unconscionable that six religious extremists on the Supreme Court get to decide and they don't have medical degrees.

He's believed to have met CIA director Bill Burns Tuesday night after talks with national security adviser Jake Sullivan and U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin earlier in the day. Austin urged Israel to urgently ease the humanitarian crisis in Gaza telling Gallant that the number of casualties is \"far too high and the amount of humanitarian aid far too low and the situation is getting worse.\"A U.S. official says Austin also discussed alternative options for Israel's proposed ground operation in Rafah. Hamas is calling on countries to end \"offensive airdrops in Gaza.\" This comes after Palestinian paramedics say at least 12 people drowned while trying to retrieve aid packages from the sea.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): As they spot a plane and the aid begins to drop, they run as fast as they can. It's the rush of a people so desperate, so hungry, who would do anything to feed their children, now on the brink of starvation. This is what survival in Gaza has come to, fighting for food, that little bit of aid that makes it into the north, where manmade famine now looms. People chase parachutes that fell into these choppy waters. It is desperation that drives them into the sea. What you're about to see next is disturbing. It's the reality of a war growing more cruel by the day. The fastest, the fittest emerged with boxes of American- issued meals ready to eat. Others didn't make it out alive. People gather around the thin, frail body of a man who drowned trying to reach that aid. Twelve people drowned, according to paramedics. The parachutes fell into the water, Abu Hammad (ph) says, but people went to eat. They went into the water and drowned. The current was so strong, they didn't know how to swim. It's what you do when you have nothing left to lose. Iman (ph) goes in swimming to get food for his children. He returns dead. This man says, bring us aid through the land crossings. Our children are dying. We are dying. What are you doing? Where is the world? The world has been piling up life-saving aid into trucks stuck at land crossings. Seemingly powerless in the face of Israel that's accused of using starvation as a weapon in this war. A charge it denies. Forcing the International Community to resort to dropping aid from the sky. Several countries carried out aid drops on this day, deliveries that have been criticized for being ineffective, insufficient, and unsafe. Earlier this month, another air drop disaster, when a parachute failed and eight packages came crashing down, killing at least five people. It's a war that's testing humanity.

In a December statement, Combs responded to the claims and all the lawsuits saying, sickening allegations have been made against me by individuals looking for a quick payday. Let me be absolutely clear, I did not do any of the awful things being alleged. Cassie's attorney responding to Monday searches and the investigation. Hopefully, this is the beginning of a process that will hold Mr. Combs responsible for his depraved conduct. Another lawsuit filed in February by a former employee producer Rodney Jones who goes by the stage name Little Rod accusing Combs of among other things, sexual assault. The musician was not at either home at the time, his whereabouts still unknown.",

And this really feels like a fall from grace for one of the biggest stars and moguls in the music world.(END VIDEOTAPE) CAMPBELL (on camera): Now, we received a statement today from Combs's attorney blasting the show of force by armed tactical federal agents outside both residences. The attorney calling this a witch hunt and a gross overuse of military level force. Still he says that Combs is cooperating with investigators. He goes on to say in the statement that neither Mr. Combs or any of his family members have been arrested, nor has their ability to travel been restricted in any way. There has been no finding of criminal or civil liability with any of these allegations. Mr. Combs is innocent and will continue to fight every single day to clear his name. Of course, the big question still, what if anything did federal investigators find at those residences and how might that information be used in any possible criminal investigation. As of right now, investigators aren't saying. Josh Campbell, CNN, Los Angeles.",
