Vance? REP. ERIC SWALWELL (D-CA): Hammer home the cost of electing Donald Trump as president. First, Donald Trump is almost 80. He will be the oldest person to ever finish a presidential term. So, that means J.D. Vance could get the call. And J.D. Vance is the poster boy for Project 2025, which takes a wrecking ball so many freedoms. And really make sure people are clear that we can't have this guy as the person who gets the call. But also to emphasize that Kamala Harris, you know, is the new way forward and that she's - she has middle class capitalism where an opportunity economy can come to all Americans if they want to buy a house because they work hard and they believe they should not just get by but do better. If we're going to invest in small businesses and gives small businesses a $50,000 deduction if they start a business and create jobs. So, it's a contrast of looking forward and looking back. But also again, Kate, reminding people, if J.D. Vance gets the call, this guy is going to be a real wrecking ball to your freedoms.",

He's a football coach. He was a governor. And, of course, he served his country in the military.But this is really about, you know, Kamala Harris' vision for every American. And also, again, contrasting that with the Trump tax. Eighty percent of the goods at Walmart, by the way, Kate, are imported from outside the United States. Donald Trump would put a 60 percent tax on all of those goods. So that means four out of five of the items in your cart are going to have a 60 percent Trump tax. That's going to cost American families a lot of money in contrast with the opportunity economy that Kamala Harris is going to bring. That's what Tim Walz is going to hammer home tonight.",

Israel launched ground incursions into Lebanon overnight targeting Hezbollah, the terror group that operates inside Lebanon. We are getting a sense this morning that Hezbollah, which is a client of Iran, may be about to get assistance for Iran itself.I believe CNN's Arlette Saenz is ready at the White House for us.

Israel, right here, launched these ground incursions into Lebanon overnight, focusing and targeting on Hezbollah. What we're concerned about now, the White House is, is not return fire from Hezbollah and Lebanon, but this turning into a more regional conflict. Iran launching ballistic missiles into Israel.Now, as Arlette noted, this did happen once before. There was this exchange, frankly, between Iran and Israel, where Israel launched into - where Iran launched into Israel, then the United States, with the Israelis, the Jordanians, the British were able to repel almost all of those launches. Israel retaliated. Again, that was seen a little bit as a show. Both Israel and Iran, while they were firing at each other, showed some restraint. Arlette, if you're still with me, any sense whether the United States has concern this time that what Iran will try to do here is perhaps a more intense strike or a strike with the intention to target Israeli cities, maybe even Tel Aviv?",

Now, it does come as you have heard U.S. officials really across the board stress their belief that there needed to be some preparations for the possibility of an Iranian attack against Israel in the wake of the killing of Nasrallah. You have seen the Pentagon talk about some of the capabilities that they have on hand to potentially respond or deter any type of attack. But it has just come as U.S. officials have been watching this closely. They haven't detailed exactly what or where this Iranian missile attack might be heading.

      "sentences": "Listen, its enormously significant. This is just the outcome. A direct conflict between Iran and Israel that, frankly, President Biden and other U.S. officials had been hoping to avoid. It's not unprecedented. Of course you'll remember that in April Iran launched dozens of missiles and drones towards Israel, which, we should note, the vast majority of which were shot down, not just by Israel, but by U.S. forces, as well as other partners in the region, including Jordan.So, we have been here before. But for this to happen in the midst of what has become a multi-front war for Israel now, not just in Gaza, of course you now have Israeli boots on the ground in southern Lebanon, and you had a strike just in the last couple of days by Israel, 1,500 miles away against Houthi rebels in Yemen as well, to add another front to that is really - it's - it's extremely volatile. It's dangerous. And, of course, why I'm standing here would be a likely target. Now, we should note that Tel Aviv has its own formidable missile defenses at several levels. Of course, you talk about the Iron Dome, but you also have ones at higher altitudes intended for ballistic missiles, including what's known as David's Sling. So, they have capabilities to defend, but the risk, the danger, the fear, John, is that Iran might attempt to overwhelm those defenses by firing a large number of missiles at the same time so that Israel could not shoot them all down, or Israel and its allies. It's a significant - it would be a significant escalation. And I think it's notable for the White House to say this so publicly right now.",

Israel, of course, has conducted all these operations against Hezbollah leaders there over the last few weeks, ground incursions overnight.

With these most recent attacks against Hezbollah, Israel hassignificantly depleted, it hasn't eliminated, but it's significantly depleted, at least for now, not just the leadership of Hezbollah, but it seems some of its firing capability. So, that is a blow to Iran's influence. And - and this has been exactly the fear, including of U.S. officials, that as Israel escalates inside Lebanon against Hezbollah, that Iran might escalate as well and feel that to demonstrate its power, it needs - it needs to strike back. I mean you have this - it's such a familiar - it's such a familiar game here. I mean game is not a great word for it, but - but it's - it's a constant, you know, testing of red lines. One side fires. The other has to reestablish deterrence, as does the other. And you find yourself in an escalation ladder, which is exactly the outcome that so many in this region had been worried about.",

He has moderated three debates with Walz, and he joins us now. Thank you so much for coming on. You've moderated these three debates with Walz. What did you see there?
