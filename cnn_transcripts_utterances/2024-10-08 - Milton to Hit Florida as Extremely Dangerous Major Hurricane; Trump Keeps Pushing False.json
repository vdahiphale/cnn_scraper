What U.S. officials are focusing on instead now.I'm Kate Bolduan with John Berman. Sara Sidner is out today. This is CNN News Central. Florida is bracing for a once in a lifetime storm. Hurricane Milton is churning right now and headed directly towards the state's densely populated west coast. You see it right there. Millions of people could be in its path. Every official that is tracking this thing is using language that should scare you. From the Hurricane Center this morning, Milton has potential to be one of the most destructive hurricanes on record for West Central Florida this morning, Tampa officials are warning that Milton's extremely dangerous strike could bring impacts not seen in over 100 years, and Tampa's mayor literally saying you're going to die if you don't leave the evacuation zones. Take a look at this storm from space. This is the view right now from NASA and NOAA. This thing is huge. So far, Milton is one of the top ten strongest hurricanes ever recorded in the Atlantic. It is the strongest storm to occur anywhere on the planet this year. Right now, a mass exodus has been underway and is still underway. The rush to evacuate, and thank God people are paying attention, but it is triggering long lines and traffic jams, with an expected landfall of Hurricane Milton still late Wednesday or early Thursday. We're waiting for updates throughout the morning to see how, if and when the track changes. CNN's Carlos Suarez is in Fort Myers for us, preparations underway. First, let's get to CNN's Derek Van Dam, though. Derek, what's the latest? I mean, this view from space is crazy.",

      "sentences": "No doubt, Kate. And they're mincing words, right, the authorities there. But, you know, we're facing this imminent major hurricane strike across the Florida Peninsula. But I want to talk about three things that I've narrowed down that worry this meteorologist who's dedicated his entire life to studying this incredible phenomenon.That is the fact of this trajectory of the storm, the expanding wind field and also the fact that this will be a nighttime or likely a nighttime landfall that will complicate the scenario. 155 mile-per- hour winds, I want to talk about this trajectory. Okay, this is not a side swipe to the state of Florida or the Florida Peninsula, as if you were driving a vehicle and another car side swipes you, this will be a T-bone crash. And what that means is it will maximize the energy potential with this approaching hurricane. So, even though we have a weakening storm on approach, it still has all that pent up energy as it reaches the coastline of Florida. The expanding wind field, this is the second concern for this meteorologist. It will double in size as it leaves the Yucatan Peninsula. Now and makes its way towards Florida. And there will be a moment in time overnight, Wednesday into Thursday, where the state of Florida will feel hurricane force winds from the west coast all the way to the east coast that will knock down power. It will knock down trees and cause catastrophic damage along the coastline, especially where you see the shading of purple. It's also going to push up a lot of water, Kate. And that is my other concern, with a nighttime land falling, major hurricane and storm surge of 10 to 15 from Port Charlotte to Tampa and Tampa Bay, that means that water levels will be twice the height of my height, just incredible. There's so many facets to this storm. The flash flood threat cannot be minimized. We have an extremely rare, high risk of flash flooding on Wednesday for the state. So that's something to consider as well.",

      "sentences": "Good morning, Kate. Yes, look, the administration has decided to essentially put this 21-day ceasefire proposal that I had put forward for peace potentially between Israel and Hezbollah on ice at the moment, just basically coming to terms with the fact that it does not seem like the Israelis have the political at this point to actually stop the fighting.And this was a really, you know, tough decision following that, you know, moment a few weeks ago when it seemed like the administration was on the brink of clinching this very important ceasefire deal between the Israelis and Hezbollah. But Israel essentially upended that plan, which was very, very close to being secured by going after Hassan Nasrallah and killing him in an airstrike in Beirut. So, now the administration is saying, look, we think that our energy is going to be better spent here trying to shape and limit Israel's operations in Lebanon and, of course, that potential retaliatory strike that we are still waiting to see from Israel against the Iranians following that massive missile barrage last week. The main concern right now within the administration and something that they believe their political capital is better spent on is preventing that Israeli operation in Lebanon from getting any wider and from expanding beyond the limited operation that the Israelis told the Americans was the original plan for Southern Lebanon. They are watching with increasing concern, Israel's operations in Beirut, which, of course, is a very densely populated city where we have already seen a lot of civilian casualties as a result of the airstrikes there. State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller, he actually, you know, said this yesterday that the U.S. is concerned that the Israelis might be undergoing some kind of mission creep in Lebanon. He said, quote, We support their ability to target militants, to degrade Hezbollah's infrastructure, to degrade Hezbollah's capability, but we are very cognizant of the many times in the past where Israel has gone in on what looked like limited operations and has stayed for months or for years. And, ultimately, that's not the outcome that we want to see. So, obviously look, the U S gave similar advice to the Israelis. When it came to Gaza, the Israelis did not necessarily listen to the administration at that point in terms of limiting civilian casualties, keeping that operation limited. There are concerns now that the same thing is going to happen with Lebanon. So that, you know, apart from a ceasefire, which is on ice at the moment, that is what the administration is now focusing its energy on. Kate?",
