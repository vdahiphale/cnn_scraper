A very good evening to you.Political uncertainty reigns in France, it continues to rain after a fractious left-wing alliance upset the far right in Sunday's election, really a shock as Paula was saying there. Emmanuel Macron has rejected Prime Minister Gabriel Attal's resignation for now while negotiations are underway to form a new government. The New Popular Front now holds the most seats in the National Assembly, have a look at the breakdown there, but it is short, as you can see, of an absolute majority. Even so, many are celebrating, the setback for the far-right, which had dominated the election's opening round. Our Melissa Bell is outside the National Assembly in Paris and she joins me now. So Melissa, I wonder the question is, for our voters as we see, there is such a fractured National Assembly, what happens now? Just talk us through the options here.",

It doesn't actually answer the question of what happens now, and there is really no one who knows. We know that the president himself believes that this is likely to be a long drawn-out process. We heard it from a source close to Emmanuel Macron that it is possible that France has no government at the time of the opening of the Paris Olympics in just 18 days' time. The negotiations have gone underway, but one of the big problems, Isa, is that this particular lions that has scored this extraordinary victory, managing to bring the country together, managing to lead to all that tactical voting and keep the far-right out is itself a very disparate bunch of parties that had trouble in the past getting along or agreeing on terribly much. So they've been united in their opposition to the far-right. The question is now, what they are for. And beyond the questions of policy, there is the immediate question of what candidate they are likely to propose to become the next prime minister. And of course that will matter a great deal because the color of the prime minister, whether he is from the far-left, from the moderate-left, from ecologists, or a compromise again, between parties that have traditionally found it difficult to compromise on terribly much will determine how easy or difficult Emmanuel Macron finds it then two cohabit with this particular prime minister and the government he is likely to form over what is going to be the second half of Emmanuel Macron's second and last presidential term. Essentially, I think one prediction is fairly certain, which is that he is not going to be able to do very much. Whichever candidate he choose, whether he is moderate or less moderate is not going to be someone that works for his party or is a representative of his centrist alliance. And therefore, you can expect a fair amount of political deadlock ahead -- Isa.",

In fact, it came in third, but still recorded the party's best ever electoral success. BELL (voice over): Doubling the number of its parliamentary seats with the far-left doing well, too. The radical party's gains, largely made at the expense of President Macron's centrists. A reflection of growing anger much of it outside of Paris like here in Normandy, where the National Rally won outright in the first round. JEAN-PAUL RIBIERE, DEPUTY MAYOR, TALMONTIERS (through translator): The vote here is more of a disapproval of what is happening in Paris compared to what's happening in the rural world, which is that no one listens to us. No one hears us.

So that means that today, many of the right-wing parties look up to the ideology of the far-right because they think that helped them in winning. So it is very concerning because today, their ideas are normalized. They are part of the mainstream and they're part of the political landscape.

It is in the Milwaukee suburb. In 2020, Hillary Clinton lost it to Donald Trump. He got 55 percent back in 2016. These are the kind of swing voters that settle the close states. A number of Democrats Biden voters we spoke to said they thought it would be best, Paula, if he would get out of the race. They said they were frightened. They were scared by what they saw in the debate, and they have every reason to believe his condition will only get worse, that he can't be president for four-and-a-half more years.

Now as part of the agreement, the plane maker will pay up to $487 million in fines. Boeing will also have to cooperate under the -- have to operate pardon me, under the eye of an independent monitor for the next three years. The guilty plea adds to Boeing's reputational damage, but it's a far cry from what the billions in penalties that is being sought by the victims' families. One of those family members joins me now from London. Zipporah Kuria lost her father Joseph in the 2019 Boeing 737 Max crash in Ethiopia. And we thank you for joining us on what are obviously difficult circumstances. I mean, look, do you believe this deal helps Boeing escape justice and perhaps more importantly, to families like yours, escape accountability when it comes to those who died? ZIPPORAH KURIA, FATHER KILLED IN 2019 BOEING CRASH: I mean, escaping accountability seems to be what Boeing specializes in instead of safety. And I think this deal definitely enables them to do that yet again. You know, you talk about the fine that they have to pay half of that was already paid in the DPA, Deferred Prosecution Agreement that they had in 2021. And this sweetheart deal is just kind of a reap on that. So yes, they're definitely yet again evading justice for us and also accountability for them.",

And also, the fact that this independent monitor would be selected by Boeing or suggested by Boeing to even indicate that that would mean that there would be objective and doing their job thoroughly is absolutely ridiculous, which is harrowing, at the same time, because that's what got us here in the first place. You know, the FAA allowing them to regulate themselves, the DOJ making the same mistake and expecting different results. And, you know, like I said, it's harrowing because our fear is people will continue to die. And we will continue not to be safe because they're not being held accountable.",

And it's really terrifying that the Department of Justice is aware of that. They've watched this happen. They have documentation. We've provided them with ample evidence over the last five years as to why the DPA should have been invalidated. And also, when they breached the agreement, why they should have, you know, had harsher penalties for them not just the financial ones but also like, you know, actual criminal charges for the executives that are involved in decision making. And when you have been given everything you can do to make sure the best outcome is achievable, and you choose not and people die as a result of that. Of course, that has to land on your conscious because you were at a pinnacle point in a crossroad where you could have changed things and you chose not to. It's enough looking aside but when the consequences of you looking aside is more lives lost. And that's something that you have to definitely as we would say in London, that's an L you'd have to eat.

Zipporah Kuria, thank you so much. Appreciate it. Now the media company Paramount global has agreed to merge with Skydance Media. Now you'll know paramount for its blockbuster properties like the movie studio behind Top Gun and networks like CBS and MTV. The deal and Shari Redstone's control of media giant, she's received a flood of interest for the group from media power players like Barry Diller and Sony. Now, under this latest deal though, Paramount still has 45 days to -- it's called go shop, right? Shop around if there is a better offer. Sarah Fisher has been following this story for months and months. The deal itself, Sarah, if you can bring us in on this in simple terms like -- it looks like a series recap if you could give us a description of that. Plus, the final episode. Is it the final episode?",

For example, after the initial exclusive inner window between Skydance and Paramount to negotiate ended, a bid came through from Apollo and Sony. But she didn't like that bid because it was likely to face regulatory pushback. And it might have meant having to break up the company that she worked so hard to bring together. So, I think sky dance is likely it. It's a very complicated transaction essentially, they're going to invest in Paramount's parent company and then they're going to actually merge Skydance with Paramount after that. There's a lot of different financing coming in including from private equity for RedBird. And so, this is a very convoluted deal. I think that's why it took a long time to hammer out but it does provide a lifeline for Paramount as it faces a lot of challenges in the streaming market and the decline of linear television.",
