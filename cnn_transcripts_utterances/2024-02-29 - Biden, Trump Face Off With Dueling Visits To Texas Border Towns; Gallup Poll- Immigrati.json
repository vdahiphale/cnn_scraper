Both are now trying to go all in on immigration, but who has the best hand on what so many voters say is the most important problem facing this country.Plus, supreme consequences. Team Trump's delay tactic is getting a huge assist from the highest court in the land. Could their decision to hear the former president's immunity claim ultimately lead to a get out of jail free card. And breaking news out of Gaza. Dozens are dead in chaos after Israeli forces opened fire near a food aid truck. We've got the latest from the region. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at INSIDE POLITICS. We start in Texas, where we're about to see a made for TV split screen moment. The two inevitable presidential nominees are visiting two different southern border towns at the same time. For President Biden today marks a dramatic shift. The White House is trying to turn a political vulnerability into an opportunity to hammer Republicans for tanking a bill that address the crisis. All because Trump said so. CNN has full team coverage across Texas. Priscilla Alvarez is in Brownsville where Joe Biden is heading, and Kristen Holmes is in Eagle Pass where Donald Trump will arrive at any moment. Let's start with Priscilla. Priscilla, what can you tell us about what to expect?",

And today we expect President Biden to hammer Republicans over that failed Senate border bill that included some of the toughest border security measures in recent memory.Now, of course, this coming from an administration that has grappled with a number of searches at the U.S. southern border. And that sources told me it's really been a tense topic of discussion within the walls of the White House as this became a political liability for President Biden. So, what we're expecting today is more on that failed Senate border bill. That was one that White House officials worked very closely with Senate negotiators to find a compromise, including for example, including an extraordinary authority that would have allowed the Homeland Security Secretary to shut down the border, certain triggers were met. So, we'll expect to hear more on that from the president today, really putting the onus on Republicans for not putting a solution on the table. But this comes at a critical time. We're in the presidential election. And a Gallup poll released this week, showed that this issue of immigration is increasingly becoming one that is a priority for many voters. And so, the president is urgently trying to address this and really flip the script on Republicans.",

And it was that gunfire he says that triggered mass pandemonium with people running away and the truck drivers also speeding off and in the process of killing additional people. Now the Palestinian Ministry of Health says that 104 people were killed in this incident altogether, 760 injured. According to Adel Al Zaanoon, the majority of those people were indeed killed by those trucks speeding off, but it was the Israeli gunfire according to him and other eyewitnesses on the ground that prompted this scene of mass pandemonium. The Israeli military has a very different narrative. They agree that these trucks pass through that people climbed on top of them. But they say that a stampede started before any Israeli gunfire. Here's Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lerner just moments ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. COL. PETER LERNER, ISRAELI DEFENSE FORCES SPOKESMAN: We understand that the convoy passed through the Israeli positions and continue to move forward -- and continue to move north. As they move forward, amount of people -- a huge amounts of people as we clearly shared in the visuals that we've distributed, stormed and stampeded the truckloads as they climbed upon.

You don't see in this footage, mass numbers of people getting run over by trucks or stampeding. What you see is them coming, clambering onto these trucks, rushing to try and get this desperately needed aid, but it doesn't show what learner suggested there. And it's also just important to keep in mind that this all comes in the context of about a half a million people in northern Gaza who are currently on the brink of famine. It is that desperation. It is the fact that so few aid trucks have been able to get into northern Gaza. That has led us to this very deadly -- very sad situation that we are witnessing today. Dana?",
