NIKKI HALEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  If you're tired of losing, put your trust in a new generation. P. BROWN:  Who is next? (END VIDEOTAPE) P. BROWN:  Hello. I'm Pamela Brown in Washington, where the state of our union is trying to keep our friends close, and you know the rest. Tensions between the U.S. and China on high this morning after a blunt meeting between the two nations' top diplomats, the first since the U.S. shot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon earlier this month. In a -- quote -- \"very direct and candid meeting\" on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, Secretary of State Antony Blinken told his counterpart, Wang Yi, the balloon was an unacceptable violation of U.S. sovereignty that must never occur again. The State Department said a senior official said that Blinken also criticized China for not engaging in military-to-military dialogue over the incident when Chinese military officials -- quote -- \"refused to pick up the phone.\" And underlying a concern raised in earlier remarks by the vice president, Blinken warned China there would be consequences if they provide military aid to Russia in its war against Ukraine. The informal meeting came hours after China's top diplomat criticized the U.S. response to the balloon and a speech to the leaders attending the conference, including a bipartisan group of top U.S. lawmakers. And joining me now from the Munich Security Conference, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee Michael McCaul and Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee Mike Turner. Thank you both for coming on. REP. MICHAEL MCCAUL (R-TX):  Thanks, Pamela. REP. MIKE TURNER (R-OH):  Thank you, Pamela. P. BROWN:  So, Congressman McCaul, I want to start with you here. The U.S.-China relationship is a key topic of discussion at the Munich summit, where you are. China's foreign minister addressed the gathering and mocked the U.S. response to the Chinese surveillance balloon, calling it -- quote -- \"absurd and hysterical\" and an effort to -- quote -- \"divert attention\" from its domestic problems. What is your response to him?",

And then it wasn't taken out of the game until the game was over in the Atlantic. The reality is, is that the administration admitted then, after it had shot down the balloon, that it should have been more proactive in the three subsequent shoot-downs that it did have of what appears to be harmless objects over North America. So, the administration does have a shift that it needs to take in taking all of this a lot more serious, being more forward also with the American public and with China as to what we're facing and what their espionage plans were. But, here, I do think that there is an opportunity to get back to a normal dialogue with China. No one, of course, wants a cold war, but that isn't the issue. What we want is a China that is not going to be an aggressor state, that's not going to be building up its military and threatening the United States, and certainly not making the negative comments that it's making, instead of just openly apologizing for sending a spy balloon over our most sensitive military sites. P. BROWN:  So, as we just heard, you both have been critical of President Biden's response to China here at home, but politics traditionally stops at the water's edge. Are you and the Biden administration on the same page in presenting a united message to the world when it comes to countering China, where you are right now, in Munich?

So when we talk about particularly export controls, this balloon, by the way, had a lot of American parts in it. We know that the hypersonic missile that went around the world with precision was built on the backbone of American technology. So there's a lot of discussion here at this summit about, how can we -- they steal a lot of this from us. But we don't have to sell them the very technology they can put in their advanced weapons systems to then turn against either Taiwan in the Pacific or eventually possibly the United States of America. I think there's great bipartisanship on this issue, and, by the way, as well as Ukraine. I think our delegation has been very unified in our support for Ukraine and putting everything we can from a weapons perspective into Ukraine, so they can defeat the Russians. P. BROWN:  All right, let's turn to Ukraine. As you mentioned, Congressman McCaul, it is a big talker there at the summit. I remember, last year, everyone was talking about Russia getting ready to invade. Now it's been nearly a year, and nearly a dozen members in your party have introduced a so-called Ukraine fatigue resolution to end U.S. support for Ukraine. And a new poll is showing support among Americans for arming Ukraine is dropping. How concerned, Congressman McCaul, are foreign leaders you're speaking to that American support for Ukraine, particularly within your own party, is weakening?",

And this delegation, it's bipartisan, very strong support for Ukraine. I think where you're seeing a split from the administration, though -- and I have to say that, Pamela, this is bipartisan as well -- is that, for the past year, we have been very slow at getting these weapons in, in the name of it being too provocative, whether it be Stingers, Javelins, these short-range artillery Now, longer-range artillery, ATACMS, they can take out the Iranian drones in Crimea, and also aviation like F-16. If we put the stuff in from the very beginning of this conflict, a year from now may have been very different, as we look at the anniversary on February 24. The longer they drag this out, they play into Putin's hands. He wants us this to be a long, protracted war, because he knows that, potentially, he will lose -- we could lose the will of the American people, and therefore the Congress. And we're seeing the same dynamic in the European parliaments, strong support now, but they're worried that, if this doesn't end with a resolution sooner, rather than later, this will be an issue for us. P. BROWN:  Yes. And you mentioned the need for Ukraine to have more weapons to fight Russia. A bipartisan group in Congress, including some members on your own committee, wrote to President Biden, urging him to give Ukraine F-16 fighter jets. You said the U.S. should give Ukraine -- quote -- \"everything they need to win this thing.\" Congressman McCaul, do you believe the administration is considering taking that step?",

You have a handful on both sides, both sides, Pamela, who have been cautious or who have said that they don't support or they want support to come to an end. That's not the over 400 -- there are 435 members of Congress. There are probably 400 that are for continuing this direction and this path. P. BROWN:  All right, well, that's good to know.

What Nikki Haley is doing, speaking with her campaign and people thathave been out there and seeing her campaign in New Hampshire, she's not focusing on Donald Trump. She is not punching to the side. She's punching forward to Joe Biden. And she has had really large events in New Hampshire, planning to go to Ohio, focusing on what she says is a positive vision for the future, looking for a new generation of leadership within the GOP. And I think we can all agree we need a new generation, not just of age, but of attitude.

We sat beside each other, not at the same desk, but our desks were beside each other in the legislature.And I have seen the rise of Nikki Haley to what she's become today. And, in 2010, you had somebody who was running third or fourth in the gubernatorial primary who just came through and beat all the boys. She beat Gresham Barrett. She beat Henry McMaster. She beat Andre Bauer. And she showed that strength. She showed that savvy. She showed somebody who stood for something. The Nikki Haley today is not that Nikki Haley. And I think that's her problem. You can't be sometimes this and sometimes that. You can't put your finger in the wind. You can't be adiaphorous or fence-sitting. You actually have to show that you stand for something. And the Nikki Haley that we see today, the Nikki Haley that worked for Donald Trump stands for nothing. And that's the problem. And that's what we're going to see. It's decently transparent throughout this political process. And one thing Donald Trump will show you when you stand on stage with him, people will be able to see your true colors and what you stand for. And either you stand with Donald Trump and his racism, bigotry, xenophobia, and pure ignorance, and anti-intellectualism, or you're against him. You can't say -- it's not a buffet. P. BROWN:  Well, and it's interesting. And I want you to weigh in on what we just heard. But there's the Nikki Haley strategy. And then there is what's going on in Michigan, where Republican officials rejected Donald Trump's candidate for state party chair in favor of someone more extreme, Kristina Karamo. She had run for secretary of state. She is a true election denier -- Karamo -- I'm sorry -- a true election denier who refused to concede her own race. She said that abortion is -- quote -- \"child sacrifice\" and a satanic practice. She's spoken at a QAnon conference and has made anti-vaxxer comments. I mean, can someone who sticks to traditional party values win? Or do you have to embrace the more extreme views to -- for some in the GOP?",

But I think, as you mentioned the situation arriving in Michigan, it's happening all over the country. There's never been a bigger divide from state party politics and the average Republican that's worried about their job, worried about inflation, worried about crime. And so we're watching this play out. And a few hundred people can determine who wins these party races in these states. And there's just this continued gravitational pull to the far right. It hurts our efforts. It gives us a bad press. And it continues to remind us of all the things that went wrong during the Trump administration, right? We talked about Nikki Haley is going to have to be accountable for some of the things that she attached herself to. But Donald Trump got worse every day he was in office, and it ultimately came -- January 6 was probably the worst moment in his presidency. But we watched a series of really good conservative policies that played out during that four-year administration, but the antics that are around it and this gravitational pull to the far right is not helping us. P. BROWN:  And you just heard him say, Alice, this is going on across the country, what's happening in Michigan. So, where is the GOP now? Are they more in that camp?
