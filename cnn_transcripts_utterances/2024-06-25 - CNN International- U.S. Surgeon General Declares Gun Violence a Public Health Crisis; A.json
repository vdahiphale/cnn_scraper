First, a U.S. military video showing an Apache helicopter mistakenly gunning down two journalists and several Iraqi civilians in 2007. Next was the release of tens of thousands of classified military documents related to the war in Afghanistan, revealing more previously unreported civilian deaths. Documents on the Iraq war followed, suggesting widespread abuse and torture by Iraqi security forces, then the leak of cables from U.S. embassies and diplomatic missions around the world.

Assange denied the allegations, claiming it was retribution for his political work and orchestrated to pave the way for his extradition to the U.S. over the leaks. He turned himself in to London police and was later released on strict bail conditions.

We've received a document from British high court in the last couple of hours that indicates a timeline for when this deal came into being, the middle of last week, the 19th of June was when this arrangement was agreed. By the terms of the arrangement, by the end of this week, both parties, both Assange and his lawyers and the U.S. Department of Justice need to write back to the U.K. court to say that the terms of the bail conditions to go and appear in this U.S. district court, all the way in the Pacific.These bail conditions have been met and they expect this to go ahead without a hitch on Wednesday. That's the timeline that we have. But clearly, the fact that it was agreed last week, I think belies the fact that there's been a lot of maneuver and discussions and legal conversations that have been going on in the background to that moment. But in terms of the sort of diplomatic moves that have happened here, I don't think we are going to know a lot about them until perhaps Assange is safely back home and he may be able to then reveal some of the nature of what has happened. But I think we have certainly witnessed in the past few months, increasing pressure by the Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albinis, when you saw him there in the report essentially saying that, you know, enough was enough. There was nothing more to be gained by Assange being kept in jail and that he should be allowed to return back to Australia. So I think there's been a level of diplomatic, political pressure that's come from Australia during this period at a time when it perhaps feels its relationship with the United States, that the terms of that relationship are perhaps give Australia a little leverage because the United States, of course, is very keen right now to build up a very strong alliance of support and allies in the Pacific because of tensions with China.",

Clearly, he had some level of leverage in this plea deal because he absolutely does not trust the U.S. justice system and that's the reason it appears that he didn't want to appear in a U.S. court (inaudible) is obviously on his way home to Australia. But, I think there will have been another thing at the back of Julian Assange's mind and that is as the U.S. presidential election coming up in November and President Biden, although we've heard from the White House, said it has had no hand in this at all. This is entirely the work of the U.S. Department of Justice, that if present -- that if Donald Trump became president, then Assange's fate and room for maneuver of an independent judiciary, the Department of Justice in the United States might look different and Assange will have been aware that perhaps his window for coming to the terms of a deal was closing and that perhaps persuaded him now is the time as well.",

We have heard many aid groups, including the United Nations, saying that not enough is getting in negating what the IDF says. But the fact is the security on the ground has become dire, the lawlessness, the lack of law and order, desperate people trying to get food and water for their families as well. So this combined makes it very difficult for these aid groups to be able to distribute the food to where it's needed most. Now, the IDF did announce just a week ago that they had a transit route which was going to be from the Kerem Shalom crossing in the south and up the Salah al-Din Road, which is effectively the north- south artery in Gaza. But, there weren't necessarily going to be security guarantees along the way, security guarantees from the Israeli airstrikes we heard from the IDF, but not necessarily from gangs who were on the ground trying to get to some of this aid to be able to sell it and as I say, desperate residents. The U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres called for more to be done by Israel as the occupying power to be able to give security to those humanitarian aid groups and the United Nations to be able to deliver this aid. And this IPC Report that has just come out today as well, points to areas where things are getting worse. For example, the south of Gaza, which is where one of the key land crossings has been closed, the Rafah crossing has been closed since early May and also many of the humanitarian aid groups have been moved on. So, that has a very direct knock-on effect to people as to their inability to access food, clean water, and shelter. Rahel?",

      "sentences": "Well, Rahel, the Biden campaign has signaled that there are really three areas where they want to draw a contrast with Trump on, that includes abortion, democracy, and importantly the economy. And it comes at a time when CNN has learned that outside Democratic advisers have urged the president and his team to focus less on taking a victory lap over President Biden's record and accomplishments, and focus more on drawing that contrast, going on offense to attack Trump for his economic vision.These advisers have said that they believe that Biden should really tried to tie Trump to corporate America, while also highlighting the inflationary nature of his economic proposals. Part of the concern as that President Biden has this tendency to go out to list some of the bright spots in the economy, some of the accomplishments that he has made in office when it relates to increasing the number of jobs, also avoiding an economic recession, but it all comes at a time when voters are still harboring deep reservations about Biden's handling of the economy with many polls showing that voters tend to trust Trump more on economic issues than Biden. Now, the Biden campaign today is really leaning in to trying to make this economic contrast with Trump. They released a new television ad today that will run in battleground states, really trying to portray Trump as someone who is looking out for himself rather than the concerns of the American people. They tried to present this contrast, pointing to Trump's pledges to lower taxes for wealthy Americans contrasting to some of the things Biden has achieved like lowering the cost of insulin, lowering the cost of prescription drugs. And it all comes at a time that the Biden campaign is also still continuing to hammer away at Trump over his recent criminal convictions, arguing that it once again shows he's looking out for himself, that he is unfit to serve in office. So, all of these arguments are things Biden could potentially lean into as he prepares for this first matchup against Trump on the debate stage in two days.",

And you can see that plastered all over the city and, of course, across cities here in Iran. It's been quite interesting because, today, the supreme leader of this country, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, he came out in his speech regarding the festivities for this religious holiday and he once again urged Iranians to come to the polls. He said that low voter turnout always leads to criticism of the Islamic Republic of Iran, while high turnout as he put it, would cut the tongues, as he said, of the enemies of the Islamic Republic of Iran. So, voter turnout definitely a big thing. The last election took place where Ebrahim Raisi was elected, that of course, the turnout was quite low. This time, there are six candidates that are still in the running, including a moderate candidate.

And once trucks get in, which are now happening less than in the previous month, so we are seeing again, whatever positive results we have, we had from this IPC Report that managed to avert famine.That progress is very fragile and we are seeing the deterioration again in the aid flow within the Gaza Strip, which in the north was not the case two months ago, in March and April. And that's why we saw some positive results as well and we managed to avert famine. But still, as I said, the humanitarian system is struggling because within the Gaza strip, there's no safety to operate. Humanitarian workers are being harassed or are risking their lives on a daily basis, and roads as you mentioned are destroyed or collapsed. So, there are fewer access points to reach those in need. There are less hospitals to treat children with severe malnutrition or other illnesses that are also increasing in the Gaza Strip.

BRAD TUCKER, ASTROPHYSICIST/COSMOLOGIST, AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL UNIVERSITY: So, the only country that's landed on the far side, that side facing away from us, is China. So the fact that they've landed now two missions on that side of the moon and one of which has actually returned stuff back to earth, is a pretty big deal. WATSON (voice-over): For Chinese leader Xi Jinping, this marks a giant leap towards what he calls his eternal dream, establishing China as a dominant space power. The probe collected up to two kilos of dust and rocks, which could help scientists better understand the origins of the solar system. Treasure drilled from the South Pole-Aitken basin, a four-billion-year-old moon crater not visible from earth.
