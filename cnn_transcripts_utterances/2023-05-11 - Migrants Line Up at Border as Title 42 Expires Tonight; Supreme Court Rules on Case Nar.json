Since 2020, a special policy has been in place, allowing the U.S. border officials to almost immediate expel the migrants trying to get into the United States. That policy is going away.For weeks, the Biden administration has been preparing for a tidal wave of migrants once the policy lifts. Rosa Flores is in El Paso once again for us. And Rosa, you were able to ride along with the National Guard to get a sense of what things are looking like. And what did you see?",

I talked to one family, who said that their daughter couldn't stop shaking.They were asking National Guard members if they could start a fire in this camp just to try to stay warm. It was also very dusty, so it is very difficult for the migrants trying to protect themselves from all of the elements, including the dust, which was very severe. And at the same time, there were migrants who were crossing the concertina wire and turning themselves in. As we watched the border, there were more individuals and a group, who appeared to be trying to figure out how to cross the border. Now from talking to some of the migrants, they were confused about the Title 42 and they didn't know what it was. And others said they wanted to cross before Title 42 ended, because they were told -- they believed -- and this is part of the misinformation that we have been reporting on -- that they believed they would have a better opportunity before Title 42 lifted. So a lot there. Just a lot of heartbreaking stories. A lot of the migrants are really hoping for opportunity in the United States. And they see this border wall and they see hope, because they believe they are that much closer to getting into the United States. Kate.",

If a customs official does not see enough there or they do not request asylum, they can be deported back to their country.People from certain countries, including Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, Venezuela, they can be deported to Mexico. This is a difference from Title 42. If you were sent back under Title 8 authority, you are subject to multi-year ban from the United States. Listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS, U.S. HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY:  Title 8 of the United States Code, our traditional immigration authorities actually deliver a consequence, because, when somebody is removed, someone does not qualify for relief and is removed from the United States, they face an at least five-year bar from admission into the United States. So the consequence is going to be more severe. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

One, the reasons that you heard from Rosa, the humanitarian concerns but also because of the logistics. This is not just going back to a decades' old protocol but it's processing people, an unprecedented number of people. And that going to be a severe bottleneck. Getting enough capacity, enough people and transportation to deal with that. That is also removing some, because of the legal consequences under Title 8 that you heard from Kate. For those who are not removed and are being processed, for families, for example, that could be putting them on what is an alternative to detention, a home curfew that we were talking about earlier or a GPS ankle monitor as they are working through the deportation process or asylum process. All of the measures taken together is what they are talking about in the building behind me and in the Department of Homeland Security to manage the flow. And of course, the politics of it all and that is what President Biden knows he has to navigate on an issue that is a political vulnerability. And he was asked about this just yesterday.
