      "sentences": "Good morning. You are live in the CNN Newsroom. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.And right now, House Republicans say they are going, quote, full steam ahead on their impeachment inquiry into President Biden. That's despite the fact that their case is largely based on discredited information tied to the Russians. Their previous star witness who prosecutors say admitted to having ties to Russian intelligence is in jail awaiting trial for lying to the FBI. So, today, a different GOP witness will testify again, not on Capitol Hill, but from federal prison, where he's serving time for unrelated fraud charges. Meantime former President Donald Trump, who actually was twice impeached, is searching for new ways to postpone his election subversion trial, asking the Supreme Court to delay the proceedings and doubling down on his claim of total immunity, arguing that rejecting it would be, quote, the end of the presidency as we know it. But we begin with this morning's House oversight hearing on the impeachment inquiry into President Biden. CNN's Melanie Zanona joins us live up on Capitol Hill for us. Melanie, what are Republicans trying to accomplish with this hearing?",

      "sentences": "Well, initially, this hearing was billed as a way to highlight discrepancies in Hunter Biden's closed door testimony. Remember, this is only the second public hearing that house Republicans have had related to their impeachment inquiry and Hunter Biden has been at the heart of their probe.But since Hunter decided to not show up today, Republicans are going to turn to other witnesses who claim that president Joe Biden was deeply involved in his son's foreign business deals. But those claims have yet to be verified. And, in fact, many of those claims have been undercut by other witnesses. So, Jim, there are signs that today's hearing is shipping up to be more of a spectacle than any substance. For starters, I am told that there's going to be an empty seat with Hunter Biden's name on it. There's also going to be a witness testifying remotely, as you mentioned, from federal prison. And just moments ago, a Democrat on the committee, Jared Moskowitz of Florida, showed up wearing a Putin mask. So, just giving you a flavor of how Democrats are planning to handle today's hearing. Meanwhile, we should also mention that Democrats are selecting Lev Parnas as their witness. He is a former Rudy Giuliani associate, someone who was tasked at one point with digging up dirt on the Biden family, but has since called those claims nonsense. So, just a really not ideal situation for House Oversight Chair Jim Comer, who is leading this hearing today and facing many questions about where his impeachment inquiry goes from here.",

So, that is the very high bar that they are still trying to achieve. And because they have not been able to meet that bar, many Republicans inside the House say they are not ready to support impeachment articles. So, there are a lot of questions about where this impeachment inquiry goes next.Comer has said that there's likely going to be criminal referrals and a final report at some point. But because there's not going to be impeachment articles, there is a serious debate inside the GOP about how and when they're going to wrap up this probe. There's some in the Republican Party who say they just need to finish this now and try to turn their attention to other issues and trying to deliver for the American people ahead of November. But there are some Republicans who say they should drag out this inquiry as long as possible and try to politically damage Biden ahead of the November election, Jim.",

You have to make sure you're meeting people's basic needs, that you're addressing humanitarian issues, that you are going to the root of terrorism, and that is hopelessness and fear. And right now, the strategy is not doing that.30,000 civilian casualties is untenable. It's a moral failure and a national security failure. So, we have to have a very different direction here.

But the bottom line is we didn't hear from any law enforcement agency that said that they would strictly be sending their officers out to enforce this law. And what essentially this immigration law does is it gives local law enforcement departments and agents the ability to arrest people that enter Texas illegally. And it gives judges the ability to deport people back to Mexico if that's where they cross from. But law enforcement departments, sheriffs and police officials are saying that they are not going to go out and specifically enforce just this. If the immigration status comes up in the course of another crime that is committed, they will enforce it then.

It would be, quote, the end of the presidency as we know it, if there's not immunity around the presidency. And his lawyers point out that when the D.C. Circuit, the appeals court before this ruled against Trump and said, no, you don't have immunity for breaking the law while you're president, his lawyers are now saying that's particularly bad for Trump and gerrymanders a situation where it would deprive him specifically of immunity because you shouldn't have immunity fall away if you break the law because you want to remain in power.
