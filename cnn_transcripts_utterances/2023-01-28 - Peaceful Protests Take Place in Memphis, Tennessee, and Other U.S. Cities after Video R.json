I'm in for Fredricka Whitfield today.And we begin with a city and a nation in shock just hours after Memphis police released videos of the brutal killing of Tyre Nichols. The full videos, released last night, show five former Memphis police officers repeatedly beating the 29-year-old. And I want to warn you, what you're about to watch is extremely graphic. The videos document Nichols being pulled over earlier this month for alleged reckless driving. Police are then seen yanking Nichols from his car, chasing, kicking him, using pepper spray and batons. Nichols, unarmed, cries out for his mother at one point. He died from his injuries three days later in the hospital. And those videos sparking largely peaceful protests all across the country. Earlier this week, the five officers involved were charged with second degree murder. And now after this video has come out, two officers from a different department who are also on scene that night have been put on leave pending an investigation into their conduct. CNN's Boris Sanchez breaks down these newly released videos. And again, a warning for you, they're very graphic. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)",

This shows officers hitting Nichols at least nine times without visible provocation. When the camera first turns towards the scene, an officer shoves Nichols hard to the pavement with a knee or leg. Nichols is pulled up by his shoulders and then kicked in the face twice. After being pulled up into a sitting position, Nichols is hit in the back with what appears to be a night stick. After being pulled to his knees Nichols is hit again.Once pulled to his feet, the video shows officers hitting Nichols in the face multiple times while his hands are restrained behind his body, after which he falls to his knees. Less than a minute later an officer appears to kick Nichols again. More than three minutes after the encounter is first seen on this camera, officers let go of Tyre Nichols and he rolls on his back. One minute later, Nichols is dragged along the pavement and propped up in a sitting position against the side of a car where he's largely ignored by officers for the next three-and-a-half minutes. Some 10 minutes into the video, a person who appears to be a paramedic finally engages with Nichols. The U.S. Department of Justice has said it is conducting a federal civil rights investigation of Tyre Nichols' death. (END VIDEO TAPE)",

There are also administrative, perhaps, charges against other officers, the police chief here in Memphis indicating that her investigation is still ongoing.I think there's just still a lot of questions, because when you look at this video, there were so many more officers present who didn't intervene, who didn't help Tyre Nichols. And so you have to ask questions about those officers. And then, of course, learning late last night that there are these two sheriff's deputies who were there and are now placed on leave. And the EMTs, the big question about the medics, why didn't they do more? It would be some 20 minutes before a stretcher would arrive and take Nichols to the hospital. So all of those questions, of course, still remain and the Department of Justice and their investigation and whether or not they come into this town and start asking some serious and hard questions about the culture of this police department and what's been going on here in this city.",

The president also says that he believes there needs to be a full and swift investigation into this matter, and that that is something that the family deserves. Now, President Biden yesterday actually had the opportunity to speak with the mother and stepfather of Tyre Nichols, and there is a very rare video.

He was quite vocal after the death of George Floyd as well.Now, in his statement yesterday the president said that the way to try to prevent these types of incidents from happening in the future is for meaningful reform. He has pointed to his desire for Congress to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. That is completely stalled up on Capitol Hill. The president has tried to take some limited actions where he can to address police reform. But as the Congress is currently divided, it remains to be seen whether anything could actually get done up on Capitol Hill. Now, President Biden as he was departing the White House yesterday for Camp David was also asked what's at stake for the country in this moment, and he said the image of the country is at stake.

Great to see both of you. Thanks for coming on with us.Mark, let's start with you. We know the five officers are facing charges including second degree murder, and given what we have seen in all of these videos, do you believe the charges will stand? And do you think even more, they could expand at this point? We know a couple other law enforcement officials have now been put on leave, that sort of thing. MARK O'MARA, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Well, you're right, it may actually expand because, although they're being charged right now with what they look at on that tape. But here is the thing about a first- degree murder charge. Even though we never charge our cops with first- degree murder, that type of premeditation, we now know since the George Floyd days we are now looking at cops through a different prism. And when cops don't act, when cops allow an event to happen over four, five, ten minutes, then maybe they should be held responsible to an even higher standard. And look, if they were not police officers who were doing that, the argument would be you had enough time to reflect, and the failure to act can be considered premeditation.

I'm going to assume that that is the officer who was speaking, said he reached for my gun. That was something that happened back then. That doesn't justify what went on down the line. And police officers deal with people who are high on intoxicants all the time on a regular basis. That does not justify the strikes to the face, the strikes to the head, the kicking, the strikes with the baton, the punches. And then the other thing that's remarkable to me is absolute incompetence, not being able to control this individual with multiple officers. They had him on the ground. To let him get up, unacceptable. Pepper spraying each other. It is hard for me to discern exactly which officers' pepper spray cross-contaminated into other officers, but utter incompetence that then led to what certainly appears at this point to be pretty serious criminality.",

O'MARA: Well, there are several of them where the officers obviously had a moment to reflect, a moment to catch their breath, a moment to think, OK, even if I just overreacted by hitting him in the face with his hands behind his back a minute ago, take a breath, act like the training -- supposedly the training that you had has taught you. And what we have seen is time and time again within these very videos is this ongoing anger and violence towards somebody who is basically under control three or four, five different times. And I think that's going to play very difficult in front of a jury, to sit back and try to give officers cover when they had a moment to reflect, when they had an opportunity to deescalate. They're supposed to be trained to deescalate. Even if you thought he was on drugs, even if you did reach for your gun -- and by the way, I think that was them setting up a defense on video.

That first wave out into the west, that's going to gradually make its way into the Midwest on the heels of the first system that's already there now. The bulk of the northern sidle is all going to be snow. The southern side is going to be rain. It is that area in between across portions of Missouri as well as Illinois where the concern is going to be for freezing rain. Not much of it is expected, but it doesn't take much.
