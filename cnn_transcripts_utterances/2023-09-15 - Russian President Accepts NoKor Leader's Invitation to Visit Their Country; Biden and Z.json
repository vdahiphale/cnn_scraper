Earlier today, the North Korean leader toured an aircraft plant that builds and develops fighter jets. He also expected to view Russia 's Pacific fleet in Vladivostok.Now this heavy military focus will do little to alleviate concerns about a possible weapons deal between these two heavily sanctioned states. And weapons were the gift of choice at the summit, according to the Kremlin, Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un both gave each other firearms. They were locally-made short barreled rifles. CNN's Steven Jiang is covering this live from Beijing. So, Steven, what reaction, if any, are we seeing from China about this meeting?",

Their friendly neighbors in Beijing maintain strong ties with both governments.But, of course, when you think about it, the three countries are very much bonded with the shared grievances against the U.S., where they see Washington and its allies have been trying to contain and suppress their interests and contain their rightful place or rise on the international stage. That's why the Chinese and the Russians, both permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, have been working together to block U.S.-led effort at the council to impose or strengthen sanctions against Pyongyang over its recent missile testing activities. But when it comes to this trip by Kim, I think Chinese officials are certainly keeping close tabs on what's happening in Russia 's Far East. But they are not really concerned as far as what Pyongyang and Moscow may say or do, at least publicly. Because of anything those to increasingly isolated regimes need Beijing's support and help politically and economically on the global stage as both countries are being sanctioned, as you said, very much heavily by the international community. But as far as Kim's activity is concerned, obviously he is very much focusing on the military aspect even during this latest leg in the aircraft plan where apparently his father also visited according to Russian officials accompanying him. They're stressing that lineage, that common bond both Russians and North Koreans share when it comes to fighting Japanese and then as in their words, U.S. imperialists. So Kim in the plan inspected and saw the most sophisticated Russian fighter jet, the SU-57, and also saw a demonstration flight of the SU- 35, another warplane of the Russian military made there. That's exactly what he needs most from Russia , that is sophisticated military technology could help him advance North Korea's military at a time he has devoted most of his resources to the country's nuclear program. But that's also another reason we may never find out officially that much talked about arms deal between Moscow and Pyongyang because obviously both sides have good reason to keep it secret, especially for Russia . As I mentioned, as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, they have signed up to all those sweeping sanctions against North Korea, at least publicly, Putin has said they are sticking to those measures. Kim?",

Thanks so much for being here with us. So building on what Steven was just talking about, I mean, military and weapons seems to be the common theme throughout this visit. Is that what this is all about? [03:04:53] NIGEL GOULD-DAVIES, SR. FELLOW FOR Russia AND EURASIA, INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR STRATEGIC STUDIES: Yes, an exchange of weapons for weapons so to speak. Russia on the one hand needs quite desperately needs sources of ammunition and in some cases artillery systems themselves it's seeking essentially support from North Korea to supply it with cold war stocks of those things. On the other hand North Korea itself is looking for more advanced post-Cold War technologies potentially fifth-generation fighters as your correspondent just mentioned satellite technology as well ballistic missile technologies very destabilizing. There are other things in the mix as well, North Korea needs food it always needs food. In addition, I think this is worth watching. Russia needs labor Russia is currently facing the most severe labor shortages since records began a consequence both of the large numbers of people who have fled Russia to escape from a conscription and those who have died in the fighting factories across Russia are complaining about shortages. Now there is a long tradition of North Korea, more or less covertly supplying labor to at least some agricultural enterprises was always a possibility it could send more to -- to help Russia meet this labor force shortage that now he sets it.",

Here at least to a degree the position is being reversed Russia needs again all the generation weapons to continue of fighting in Ukraine with a further point here as well who are Russia 's closest tactical supporters and allies and suppliers now. Iran and North Korea. Now if you'd ask a western diplomat before Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, why is Russia helpful, why diplomatic relations with Russia helpful? A big part of the answer to be, well we need Russia's help and support in order to constrain Iran's and North Korea's nuclear aspirations of Russia was part of the sanctions regimes on both of those countries and here in the case both of the Iran and of North Korea, it's now of Russia that is in effect enabling and helping those countries to acquire technologies that that the fundamentally undercut the wider security interests of international community.",

I think China is increasingly conflicted in this whole Russian war. On the other hand, China says and I think genuinely that wants the water end sooner rather than later because it fears the escalating and destabilizing consequences of it. On the other hand, I think, increasing we've seen signs that China wants to ensure that Russia does not moves and we saw Xi Jinping's own visit to Moscow, not the Far East in March of this year in a warming of relations there. So, while they may not be happy that North Korea has taken this step in visiting Russia rather than China and Kim Jong-un's first post- COVID visit, it's just possible that quietly they may not be unhappy that North Korea is providing it with support.

General Assembly in New York. Now sources tell CNN the two leaders will hold one-on-one talks at that time, though it's not clear if that meeting will take place in New York or Washington. In the Crimean port of Sevastopol, home of Russia's Black Sea Fleet, new video purports to show a damaged Russian warship hit early Wednesday by a Ukrainian strike. Ukrainian officials said the ship was destroyed along with a Russian sub. Now CNN can't independently verify that claim. And in one of its boldest attacks yet on the peninsula, Ukraine said it took out a Russian air defense system in Western Crimea early Thursday.

This has been the focus of part of Ukraine's counter-offensive. You mentioned the air defense system shot down overnight yesterday. Russia reported that there were 11 Ukrainian drones that they intercepted. The day before that was of course the attack on Sevastopol, that port, that Russian port by the Ukrainians, a major attack really resulted in 24 people injured and the videos we geolocated show considerable damage to that ship repair facility.Now, the Ukrainians are saying that as a result of this, they have wiped out Russia's ability to produce ships for this conflict. Now, of course, that isn't something we can independently confirm, but that is the level of ambition here that Ukraine are declaring that this is where they are taking the conflict. This is where the counteroffensive is going next. And it's worth putting this in the context of what we've been seeing in terms of diplomacy, not only with Russia and North Korea meeting, but also with the U.S. relationship with Ukraine. Of course, Secretary of State Blinken was in town in Ukraine last week, and now we're hearing reports that President Joe Biden and President Zelenskyy are going to be meeting next week in New York. This is significant for Zelenskyy. He rarely leaves Ukraine during this war, and this is part of shoring up Western support to show that the counteroffensive is worth investing in, is worth supporting. And these kinds of big moments, such as the attack on Sevastopol, such as the capture of that village of Robotyne just a few weeks ago near the southern front line, all of these show that Ukraine is making progress in a counteroffensive that really has had some marginal gains at points. All of this is showing that as we move into the winter months, when the fighting will get considerably more difficult, there may be a lot more challenges ahead. Clearly they want to show to their Western allies that there is still progress to be made and the Crimean attacks that you mention are clearly a very clear sign of that, that they are making this progress and they are making some quite considerable gains in this area.",

The U.N. says most of the deaths could have been avoided with proper warnings and evacuations.The mayor of the hardest hit city of Derna says the death toll could eventually reach 20,000. A group say a seven-meter wave swept through the city when two dams collapsed, washing every way, everything away in its path. Aid is pouring into the country, but authorities say they need volunteers to collect and bury the dead. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh arrived in Derna, Libya early today and filed this report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It took us more than seven hours to get from Benghazi to the city of Derna. And that is a drive that typically takes about three hours. And that is because so many roads, so many bridges around Derna have been destroyed. And you can imagine what that means for the aid, for the relief, for the support that would be coming into the city and how difficult it is at this time. And driving in at night, this felt like a ghost town. It is eerily quiet. And everywhere you look, you see damage and destruction. It's dark, it's nighttime, but we can still see so much destruction around here. It is just -- it feels like a war zone. It feels like a bomb had gone off here, a big bomb had gone off here. And it's very hard to stand here and not imagine what people in this city went through. Thousands of people lost their lives. More than 10,000 right now unaccounted for and everyone you speak to here fear that dust hole is only going to rise in the coming days and all this destruction, the loss of life. Officials are telling us this all happened in less than two hours, perhaps an hour and a half, they believe, after those dams burst and the water came sweeping through the city, wiping out entire neighborhoods, they say, sweeping buildings, infrastructure, cities, homes, families into the sea. It is just unimaginable what has taken place in the city. And it is left so many people here in shock. Libyans tell us they're used to war, they're used to death, they're used to loss, but nothing could have prepared them for this. On our drive into Derna, we saw so many cars coming in from different parts of the country, from the far west, from the south. Libyans coming together, coming here to deliver aid, to volunteer, to support the people in this part of the country and the people of Derna.

The charges come after Hunter Biden's deal to avoid prosecution on the gun charge evaporated this summer. The Republicans criticized the deal and a plea deal involving late payments on taxes, calling them a sweetheart deal. Both then fell apart under a federal judge's scrutiny. And after failing to work out a new arrangement, U.S. Attorney David Weiss, a Trump appointee, asked to be elevated to special counsel status, resulting in the charges announced Thursday.

Hunter Biden possessing an unloaded gun for 11 days was not a threat to public safety, but a prosecutor with all the power imaginable bending to political pressure presents a grave threat to our system of justice.

That's after prosecutors submitted a complaint against him for sexual assault and coercion over his unwanted kiss on the lips of player Jennifer Hermoso at the Women's World Cup final last month.Joining me now is journalist Al Goodman who is in Madrid. Al, the story continues to reverberate both in the courtroom and on the pitch. What's the latest?",

      "sentences": "Hi Kim, well, Rubiales is due in this national court building behind me at noon local time for this hearing. It will be a closed-door hearing, no press. That's the press behind me. No press allowed inside, no other observers, just the judge, Rubiales, his defense lawyer, the prosecutor and possibly the lawyer for the star player, Jennifer Hermoso, who the kiss was planted on. She is the lawyer for that player may be in there. We're not expecting the player would be in there.These two charges that the prosecution has given over to the national court, one for sexual assault. Prosecution Service tells CNN that the language of the sexual assault charge, Kim, in the Spanish penal code has been there only since last year in this current format, and that's because of a new law that was passed last year by the leftist government to clamp down on sexual assault and sexual abuse, a sign of the changing times in Spain between the old traditional institutional sexism or macho culture and this new, current in Spain. That's been a big part of this story. So that's one of the charges. It carries a maximum prison sentence of up to four years. There is no trial, yet there is no sentence, of course. But that's just the maximum charge. The other is for coercion. And prosecutors say that Jennifer Hermoso, when she submitted her complaint, alleged that Rubiales' team pressured her after that kiss almost four weeks ago, right after the World Cup victory for the Spanish women's team in the stadium in front of a huge crowd televised globally. She says she was pressured by Rubiales' team to go off with his story, which he says it was a consensual kiss. She says it was not. So that's another charge that they will be dealing with. The interest here, there is media from, of course, from Spain, from around the world, and it's really been larger than just a sports story, as you mentioned, because of the ramifications of all this. Rubiales finally resigned under pressure last Sunday, days after the prosecution sent this case over to the national court. Now, it's here at this national court because it involves an alleged crime, the kiss, by a Spanish national, Rubiales, done outside of Spain. The final was played in Sydney, Australia. So this is the court that deals with those kinds of big issues, also money-laundering, a lot of serious cases coming through this court. And the alleged victim, the prosecution says, is also a Spanish national. So that's why it is at this court. It's not the only thing that's happening in this whole story today. Later this afternoon, the new coach of the women's team, the women's team that just won less than a month ago the World Cup and the coach, the male coach was fired as part of this whole shakeup. Now his, one of his chief assistants, a woman, Montse Tomei, is due to announce the new team for the next match next week against Sweden. Kim?",
