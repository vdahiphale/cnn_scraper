He is trying to convince a judge, there's no jury here, that he did not commit fraud. He should be focused. He should be disciplined. But we know this is personal for him. He's watched his children testify. This is about his business. He's already attacked the judge's clerk multiple times. He's gone after prosecutors.

The former president has tried to sell himself for decades now, to brand himself as a very successful businessman.

They said that they carried out over strikes on over 450 targets in just the last 24 hours. We were at this position last night watching those bright flashes and really loud booms as that intense bombardment continued. And we have also watched in recent weeks as many of those strikes have resulted in significant civilian casualties, particularly as Israel has targeted densely populated neighborhoods in Gaza. They say, these Israeli forces say that there are Hamas underground facilities below those targets.

Look, these are the Sunbelt battleground states, Arizona, Georgia, Nevada. Biden won all of these. He won all of these.Look at the 2023 polls. This is among likely voters. The numbers you showed earlier were among registered voters. Look at this, Joe Biden ahead -- excuse me, Donald Trump ahead by five in Arizona, five in Georgia, 11 in Nevada. You know, I went back and looked at the Nevada polls from 2020, you know how many of those polls that Joe Biden trailed to Donald Trump in? A great big zero. And now we're already just in 2023 and he trails in the one poll that meets CNN's standards for publication already. Look at the Great Lake battleground states, all right, again, Biden versus Trump, 2020 results. Biden won all of them. Here, we have a tie in Michigan. We look in Pennsylvania. Look at that, another state where Donald Trump is ahead, Wisconsin, perhaps the best number for Joe Biden in this particular polling data set.

Is just too old to be an effective president, the vast majority, 70 percent of likely voters across these six battleground states say that Joe Biden is just too old. It's a problem of age. Donald Trump, although he's only slightly younger than the current president of the United States, just 39 percent say he's too old to be an effective president.This number has been going higher and higher and higher in the words of Jackie Wilson. Four years ago, this number was in the 30s. Now, it's 70 percent. It's a matter of perception, even though the numbers on age aren't too different between the two of these. I think the question for Joe Biden is, how do you solve this particular problem given he's just getting older? Maybe it's to boost Donald Trump's numbers up a little bit, we'll have to wait and see, but age in another way as well. Look at voters, millennials, age 30 to 44, the 2020 recall vote in this poll across the six battleground states. Look, Joe Biden won these voters in 2020 by 14 points. Look at the 2023 poll across these six battleground states. Donald Trump is up by a point. There's been a lot of leakage among younger voters in particular. All their voters are basically staying the same, but younger voters moving towards the former president of the United States and away from the current president of the United States.",
