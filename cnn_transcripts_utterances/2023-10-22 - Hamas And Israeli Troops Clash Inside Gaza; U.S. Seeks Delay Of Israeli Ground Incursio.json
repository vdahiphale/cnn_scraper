We'll get back to you, Wolf, in a moment.So let's start with our continuing coverage of \"Israel at War.\" New fighting today inside Gaza. Israel Defense Forces say they clashed with Hamas fighters marking only the second confirmed Israeli operation in the enclave since the beginning of this war. But beyond that skirmish it has been another bloody day across the Gaza Strip. Israeli air strikes ripping through the enclave with deadly results. The grim reality of this war seen on some of its most vulnerable. Video obtained by CNN showing the lifeless bodies of a toddler and three children killed in overnight air strikes. Their parents had written the children's' names on their legs to identify them. And there was also a rare air strike in the West Bank. The IDF saying that it hit a mosque there to prevent an imminent terror attack but the Palestinian Authority calls the strike a dangerous escalation. The IDF is vowing to increase its aerial barrage in Gaza ahead of a potential ground incursion. And with the casualties and humanitarian crisis mounting this afternoon President Biden held phone calls with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Pope Francis, and leaders from Canada and across Europe. Those calls coming as more urgent aid has now made its way into Gaza. CNN has confirmed at least 14 relief aid trucks carrying vital supplies have entered the enclave today -- Wolf.",

There's been so much discussion about a full-scale incursion. This was not that. This, it appears, was a limited operation to prepare the ground for potentially for a larger incursion, and it seems to have run into a Hamas -- some Hamas operatives who we understand fired a grenade, a rocket propelled grenade missile at one of the tanks.Hamas is sort of claiming this as a limited victory that they hit a tank, damaged two of the mechanized bulldozers that were in with that advance unit as well. One soldier killed. Three injured. The IDF says they've informed the families but it does look as if this indicates that there could be a larger ground offensive coming. However, traveling around the border region today we can see those troops ready. It just doesn't appear as if they are being moved close to the border for an immediate incursion.

What we're hearing from the Biden administration is that they are simply giving advice, offering their best judgment about what Israel should do when they do undertake this ground invasion.But, Wolf, what I've been told by two different sources is that part of what the U.S. is telling Israel is pressing them to allow for more time to delay this ground incursion, to allow for more progress on both the hostages and the aid going into southern Gaza. There has been progress on that. We saw the two American women released on Friday. Part of the 200 or so hostages still being held by Hamas. We've also seen these trucks moving toward southern Gaza today. So there has been progress. We know that a major priority for Israel and for the United States is to get these hostages out, particularly the foreign nationals and the civilians, and to allow that aid to get in to Gaza. Israel does not want to be seen as being told what to do and certainly Hamas knows that pressure will build on Israel if they continue to sort of trickle out these hostages or if there is a sense that hostages may be released.

It is a level four, it's the highest level telling American citizens not to go to Iraq, and also saying that the families of U.S. diplomats are coming home, that nonessential personnel are leaving Iraq.This comes after a strike on the U.S. diplomatic facility in Baghdad on Friday, Wolf. We've also seen this in Lebanon, a very similar advisory. And so this really does speak to the growing concern that the Iranian proxies may be ratcheting up their efforts to target U.S. interests.

I think that the hostages issue is an issue but when I spoke to several Israeli officials today what they told me is that they're not looking for another gesture like the one we've seen a few days ago with two hostages that were released. They are saying that they are willing to give more time if we are talking about a big deal, meaning all the hostages, all the women, all the children, all the elderly in one tranche.It doesn't seem at the moment that such a deal might be possible, so I think a ground operation in Gaza is just a matter of when and not if but there is another reason for the delay that doesn't have to do with the hostages. It has to do with the threat for U.S. forces in the region. And what I heard from Israeli officials is that the U.S. asked for more time in order to get more forces in the region to protect U.S. troops and take preparedness measures in U.S. bases in the region because I think the Pentagon and the White House are concerned that once an Israeli ground operation in Gaza starts, the threat for U.S. forces in the region will increase dramatically.",

It's just a matter of time until it happens. And when I asked Israeli officials, are they in a rush, they say no, we're not in a rush, because Hamas -- the time is not on Hamas' side.Hamas officials, Hamas leaders, Hamas commanders are in the tunnels and the bunkers. The situation is not getting better each day that passes. So they say, you know, if not today then tomorrow. If not tomorrow the next day. We're not in a rush.

So in the Israeli government right now there are two or three different teams that are talking or thinking about the day after but it is very low level and the political echelon still did not have a serious discussion about it.And no one, when both President Biden and Secretary of State Blinken asked directly both Netanyahu and the members of his war cabinet they said, OK, what's your plan for the day after, they heard the same answer and the answer was we don't have one.

Those candidates will try to make their pitch to the conference. They'll answer questions from their members. They'll do that one by one and we'll see how that ultimately goes. Then Tuesday morning is the significant vote. Behind closed doors, Republicans will have a secret ballot leadership election. That means a majority of their conference will vote to nominate the next speaker candidate. That person, it will be a secret ballot election so it's unclear exactly who's the frontrunner and who might emerge here, but we'll see how close that that person who gets the nomination is to the magic number on the House floor. 217 votes to be elected speaker.This is challenging for any Republican candidate because in the narrowly divided House, there are only 221 Republicans. Democrats are going to vote for Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic leader. That means that person, the candidate, the Republican nominee, must limit defections in the ranks and it is unclear if any of them will be able to do that after we have seen just Republicans going after each other after McCarthy was pushed out, unable to get behind anyone, unable to do the nation's business and much business is waiting. Dealing with aid to Israel, calls for aid to Ukraine, avoiding a government shutdown by mid-November. None of that can be dealt with. The Republican agenda is completely stalled amid this GOP leadership infighting. Can they get it resolved this coming week? That remains a huge question but a possibility it could still be unresolved and slip into another week if they can't get their act together behind a nominee. Manu Raju, CNN Capitol Hill.",
