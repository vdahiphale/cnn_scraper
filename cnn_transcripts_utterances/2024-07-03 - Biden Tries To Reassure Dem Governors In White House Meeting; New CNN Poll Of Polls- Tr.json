New details however, on what sources say Biden's privately telling his allies. And there is brand-new sound of the President admitting that he quote, screwed up, on debate night. Plus, pressure continuing to build, as a second House Democrat now publicly calling for the embattled incumbent, to abandon his reelection bid. And is a succession plan taking shape, as we are speaking here, tonight? Well, a senior campaign aide says the President is keeping his Vice President Kamala Harris, intentionally close today, to send a clear message. Here's what it is. He's with her. Tonight on LAURA COATES LIVE. So, a crisis meeting, in our nation's capital, on this Independence Day Eve. Instead of firing up their barbecues, preparing for some hometown parades, a group of Democratic governors has paraded themselves, to the White House, this evening. Many others joined the huddle on Zoom. And there were 25 in total online and in-person. Yes, that's governors from half the entire country. Why? For some straight talk with the President of United States, on whether he can really lead the party to victory, in November, up and down the ballot, and govern another four years. Now, several governors took to the microphones, after that meeting, and standing by the President. Yet Governor Tim Walz, from my home state of Minnesota, insisting that Biden is fit for office. You have Governor Wes Moore of Maryland, a Biden surrogate, also maintaining his support. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. TIM WALZ (D-MN): Had a great conversation with the President. He has had our backs through COVID, through all of the recovery, all the things that have happened. The governors have his back. GOV. WES MOORE (D-MD): We always believe that when you -- when you love someone, you tell them the truth. And I think we came in, and we were honest about the feedback that we were getting. We said that we would stand with him. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But it places her in the same room, as some of the very men and women, who could become her challenger, should Biden end his bid.A senior campaign adviser tells CNN that the President is keeping Harris intentionally close by, inviting her to join the meeting with governors, about his future, sharing lunch, in his private dining room today, and taking part in a call with campaign staff. Now, the overarching message, according to that adviser, he's with her, should he step aside. Now, several party officials and advisers say that plans are already underway, somehow, for Biden to immediately throw his support behind the Vice President, release his Democratic delegates, that's the key here, and maybe the war-chest money, and ask them to do the same, in the hopes of avoiding a contentious fight to leave that Democratic ticket. But in the meantime, Biden was defiant, in that all-staff call today, with his entire campaign team, trying to rally the troops, saying \"No one is pushing me out. I'm not leaving. I'm in this race to the end.\" Despite acknowledging privately that dropping out of the race is not out of the question, a source says that he's clear-eyed, not oblivious to a scenario, in the next stretch of days, where if polls are plummeting, and fundraising is drying up, and interviews are going badly, it might prompt him to accept it's just not working, unquote. Now, this is all coming after the debate that upended everything. And tonight, there is brand-new sound of Biden talking about his performance, on that stage, in a brand-new radio interview. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: I had a bad night. And the fact of the matter is, that, you know, it was -- I screwed up. I made a mistake. That's 90 minutes on stage. Look at what I've done in 3.5 years. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So, it was a pretty clear-eyed conversation, it sounds like.There were three governors, who came out afterwards. And Walz of Minnesota said, we have his back, he had ours. The President wants to win in November. We all agree that winning, and finding a path to victory is the most important thing. So, that sounds to me, like the tenor of that meeting was them, supporting him now, and wanting to know more from him about what specifically he will do to stay on the ticket, and win.",

I have to tell you, I think that one of the things she's done, over the last three-and-a-half years, that has been important to this White House, has been staying close to him.

I don't care how well he plays golf. I don't care how well he can do an unhinged rally, for three hours, like Fidel Castro. But what it did is give, an opportunity, for the White House, and Democrats, to talk about the fact that if Donald Trump was allowed back in the White House, the Supreme Court has effectively taken off the guardrails from him, to be able to do everything that he's already said he's going to do. Whether it was threatening to open fire, on protesters, as the Secretary of Defense said he wanted to do, the last time he was in office, whether it's to lock up Liz Cheney, whether it's to build quote-unquote, camps, to detain people, all of these things are things that he has said he's going to do. And the Supreme Court has allowed him to do it. For the life of me, I don't understand why the White House is not out there, pounding the drum, on a daily basis, to try to change the subject, and to say that what is at stake here is the difference between a decent man, who may not be the guy that you want to have there, he may not be your first choice, and an Armageddon, which is what's going to happen with Donald Trump, if he gets back in again, and that's what's going to happen to this country. You want to talk about NATO? Gone. You want to talk about Zelenskyy, who you just had a clip of? Ukraine, gone. You want to talk about him praising China's Xi Jinping? He just did it. So, there's a messaging problem that I -- that I plead with the White House, and I plead with Democrats, at the national level, to please understand. You have to explain what the stakes are. The President needs to get out there and explain what the stakes are. Because it's not just about whether Joe Biden has lost a step. It is about the fact that the alternative is so much worse.",

And, I mean, the thing about that song is that there's still people today that hear it, and they hear those big drums, and they hear the chorus, and they think it's just like this patriotic song. But it's actually much more nuanced than that.And I think Bruce Springsteen was an artist, who really tried to capture the totality of America and its music, the great parts, and also the not so great parts.",

And I wonder if people know the full story, as you've described it, a really important thing to go through, and think about what the music and the story is telling us.And \"Born in the U.S.A.,\" it might be one of the most widely-used songs, in American politics, over the last, what, four decades. But it is quite misunderstood, as you talk about it. It may sound patriotic. But the way that it's being used, I mean, it really is a commentary about what it's like, on issues that are of such consequence to politicians, to voters, to this very day. And actually, shortly after the song was released, President Ronald Reagan said this. America's future rests in a -- well here, listen to him. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RONALD REAGAN, 40TH U.S. PRESIDENT: America's future rests in a thousand dreams inside your hearts. It rests in the message of hope in songs of a man so many young Americans admire. New Jersey's own, Bruce Springsteen. (AUDIENCE CHEERS &amp; APPLAUSE) (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I mean, I think Bruce Springsteen is someone, who has always been, especially in the last 20 years, has been pretty upfront on where he stands politically, and endorsing candidates from the Democrat Party, and speaking on certain issues.But there's always been an element too, where people on the right look at Bruce Springsteen, and they take what they feel like he represents about America. This hardworking guy, playing three-hour shows, every night, sort of someone who is, again, critical of America, but still believes in the American Dream, and the American sort of ideal. So, it really goes back to the beginning, with Reagan making that speech, I think in a probably like a pretty cynical way, trying to exploit this very popular star. But we still see that today.
