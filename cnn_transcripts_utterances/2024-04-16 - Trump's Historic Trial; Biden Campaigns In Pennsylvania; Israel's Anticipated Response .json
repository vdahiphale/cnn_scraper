Now, 18 people are in the jury box for a total of 18 people, including potentially 12 jurors, potentially six alternates. They're being asked questions at this time. Now, because they're in that box, it does not mean they're actually going to stay there for the duration of the trial.And, you know, just moments ago, we were also sitting here, Kara, when Mayor Adams came out onto the street outside of this courthouse to actually check on security issues. He was asked a number of questions by reporters who pressed him about why he was present. He talked about wondering if the footprint of law enforcement was sufficient at a historic time like this. He feels that it has been. It's also been lessened from yesterday, keeping protesters under control. He was also asked whether he thinks that Trump can get a, you know, a fair trial in Manhattan. He said that was above his pay grade, but that was a fair city, and that we should look ahead to this trial as an opportunity to test what we know about our jury system. But what we do know about our jury system here, Kara, is really striking, because you've got jurors inside of that courtroom in the presence of a former president of the United States.",

But at the end of the day, Boris, you've got equal parts art, intuition, gut here, and experience all playing in to figure out who ought to sit on this jury pool.

I would be shocked if this happened within a few weeks, only because you have to find people who are equally palatable to all sides. Once those 10 strikes that Laura and Kara talked about for each side, the attorneys have to sort of, these tofu people who are mushy and palatable to everybody, you've got to find where they are.

If the judge could find that, getting back to this race and gender question, that prosecutors were striking jurors on the basis of their race or used some other factor, that could throw away a whole conviction.

      "sentences": "Well, Boris, President Biden is expected to make a sharp economic contrast with former President Donald Trump as he kicks off this three-day swing through Pennsylvania. He will not be just trying to draw a contrast when it comes to policy, but also how the two men are spending their time at this point in the election, with the president probably needing to spend the next three days here in Pennsylvania, while former President Donald Trump is in New York City in a courtroom facing criminal trial. Now, the president really is expected to deliver an economic populist message as he tries to draw this stark contrast with Trump when it comes to the issues of taxes. And you see right over my shoulder, the banner for this event is tax fairness for all Americans. That is something that the president's expected to stress in his remarks today as he is criticizing Trump's plan to extend the 2017 tax cuts, tax cuts that were given to all Americans, but really favored the wealthy much more than others.The president, for his part, has been campaigning in the middle of the campaign to raise taxes on the wealthy, as well as corporations, while vowing to keep, to not have any tax hikes for those families who are making $400,000 or less. Now, I want to read you a little bit of the excerpts that the campaign released ahead of this speech. The president will say, quote, no billionaire should pay a lower tax rate than a teacher, a sanitation worker, a nurse. He will also say, under my plan, nobody earning less than $400,000 will pay an additional penny in federal taxes. Nobody, not one penny. I want to cut taxes for hardworking folks here in Scranton and across the country. The president has often turned to Scranton to really vouch for his working class roots. Back in 2020, I traveled here many times with him when he tried to make that argument that it was a campaign between Scranton versus Park Avenue. Heading into this trip, campaign officials really tweaked that a little bit, saying that it's a campaign where the president is focused on those kitchen tables issues facing Scranton voters, while the former president has a Mar-a-Lago vision for the country. But this all does come at a time when the President is trying to move the needles with voters who disapprove of his handling of the economy. And of course, Pennsylvania will be critical to Biden's re-election if he were to win here as they're trying to keep that so-called blue wall intact, looking at states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin heading into November.",

And that's the question about how quickly Democrats plan to dispense of this effort. This of course is historic, it is in a lot of ways unprecedented. It has been one other cabinet secretary that has been impeached before but that was during some of the Civil War era. Well something that has not happened really in modern times, the cabinet secretary being charged with high crimes or misdemeanors and Republicans do not have the votes to convict Alejandro Mayorkas. That would require 67 votes. A United States Senate that has controlled 51-49 for the Democrats and the question will be how some of the Democrats and whether some Republicans will join this effort to dismiss these charges. One Democrat that I caught up with, Senator Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, he's a vulnerable Democrat in a difficult race but he made clear that he is not concerned about being attacked by Republicans by voting to essentially dismiss these charges as soon as tomorrow contending this is all political.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN.

Then there may be some votes on the Senate floor sometime tomorrow, maybe some efforts by Republicans to try to force a full-blown trial. But with a simple majority of senators, that will be enough for Democrats to essentially dismiss this outright, assuming they can keep all their members in line. And what you heard from there, one vulnerable Democrat, Bob Casey, saying he's running to dismiss.But also watch for some Republicans in the center, some of the other Republicans like Susan Collins or Lisa Murkowski or even Mick Romney; a retiring Republican senator who has criticized this effort as well.
