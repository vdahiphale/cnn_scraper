Nearly all of them. But non-AT&amp;T customers, they're impacted too, because the company says that people who interacted with AT&amp;T customers, they had their data exposed here, as well as customers of other wireless providers that use the AT&amp;T network. Now it's important to note that AT&amp;T says, right now, they don't believe that this data is publicly available. Emphasis on \"right now,\" because obviously that could change. As far as what kinds of data was taken here, AT&amp;T says the actual content of the calls and text messages, that was not exposed.

And it's also important and significant that AT&amp;T says that, in some cases, these cell site I.D. numbers were exposed. Now that's interesting because that could potentially expose where someone lives or where someone works, maybe even at a sensitive location, like the White House or the Pentagon. Now the FCC says it is investigating. The company, AT&amp;T, says they are going to reach out to former and current customers who were impacted.

But what the defense says is that that was not properly handed over to their team and shared, as court rules actually dictate. I'll play some sound here in court. Again, what the defense is claiming is that there was wrongdoing on the part of the state. The prosecution saying these items of evidence had actually no evidentiary value at all. Have a listen.

She hasn't made a ruling yet. She says she wants to hear from additional witnesses. The hearing will kick off here in just a short amount of time. We'll wait to see how she rules on this motion. It's finally worth pointing out that, you know, I've been watching Actor Alec Baldwin -- we've all seen him on camera -- but in moments when he's not on camera and down the hall, it is clear that this trial is taking a toll on him. He's been moving around very slowly. He looks simply exhausted. There was a moment, as all this argument was taking place, and the judge was conferring with the lawyers that Baldwin actually got up and was kind of walking around the court and just sat down, kind of slumped down into a seat next to his wife and they embraced in this long, long hug. You could tell, on the Baldwin side, this trial certainly taking its toll. And of course, on the other side of this equation is the family of Halyna Hutchins. She was the cinematographer that was killed. Her family is not here. They are in the Ukraine. They're in Ukraine. They can't travel here. Their representative, Gloria Allred, has been in court.
