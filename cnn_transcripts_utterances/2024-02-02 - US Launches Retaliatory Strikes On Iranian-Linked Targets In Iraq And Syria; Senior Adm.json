Caskets bearing those three -- the remains of those three returned home today. The president also signaled the United States will not strike targets inside Iranian territory and does not seek a wider conflict in the region in what has already one at war. Reporting for us tonight from all across the map, MJ Lee at the White House, Natasha Bertrand at the Pentagon, CNN's Jeremy Diamond in Israel, Ben Wedeman in Jordan. Let's begin though at the Pentagon with Natasha Bertrand. Natasha, tell us what the Pentagon is saying tonight about exactly which targets were struck, what kind, and over what period of time?",

And so this is a very significant response, we have not seen before, at least not in recent months, the US strike Iraq and Syria at the same time, but this is clearly meant to show a very -- or send a very serious message to the Iranians and their proxy militias that these attacks on US and coalition forces will not be tolerated. Now, we also got some information about what potential casualties may have resulted from this operation. A US military official, the director of the Joint Chiefs of Staff here at the Pentagon, he said earlier today in a briefing that the military does expect there to be casualties because the facilities that they struck are known to have IRGC, Iran Revolutionary Guard Corps, as well as proxy militia groups operating inside of them. And so they struck these targets knowing that there were likely personnel inside and likely going to be casualties, but it's going to take a little bit of time here to get a full battle damage assessment. So likely in the coming days, we will know a little bit better about just how well the US hit its targets and if they actually degraded these capabilities to a large degree.",

They wanted to make sure that they could avoid any unnecessary casualties.Though, as Natasha mentioned, there are expected to be some, and they wanted to avoid if possible cloud cover. In other words, they wanted to choose night, a time when there was better weather to have a better chance of successfully targeting these places, these seven facilities spread out in Iraq and Syria. Clearly, Jim, there was also just a lot of different sort of laying of the groundwork leading into tonight. The choice of the seven facilities in particular, the decision to use these B-1 bombers, which flew we were told directly nonstop from the US to Iraq and Syria for these strikes, and then even just informing the Iraqi government in advance that the strikes were coming. Now, just one note that's important about the timing question, we are told that there was no sort of orchestration by the US to make sure that these strikes took place just hours after that dignified transfer of the three Americans we saw earlier this afternoon, that those two things were completely separate in terms of timing. They were, of course, completely linked in terms of the US' response and why they decided to respond, that had everything to do with the fact that three Americans have been killed last weekend.",

And, Jim, you know, this very well, that is not really surprising, given to what extent the US has gone in recent days in saying striking inside Iran is starting a war with Iran and that is something that the US doesn't want. But it is notable, of course, the president in his statement, saying very clearly that this is just the beginning. He said: \"Our response began tonight, but there will be more coming at a time of our choosing, in the manner of our choosing.\" So again, just very much an emphasis here on the fact that there are going to be more strikes coming but again, not giving any sort of detailed information of what exactly that will look like.

And it -- we'll see what happens.I mean, it's unlikely that Iran will retaliate for retaliation. So let's see what happens, and of course, whether it will deter the Houthis inside, you know, in Yemen and what they're doing in the Red Sea. But also this takes part in the bigger context of current apparent negotiations, which are not yet conclusive for the release of hostages, prisoners swap between Hamas and Israel, and some kind of bigger political solution to this.

We've heard that kind of statement before from the Iraqis who nonetheless are hosting US forces on their soil.But generally, I think we can fairly assume that the US-supported autocracies in the Middle East, there is no love lost between them and Iran, and perhaps, quietly, they may be applauding the US strikes, even though they may not come out and condemn them. On the other hand, on the popular level, I think we need to keep in mind what's going on. This war in Gaza has been going on for almost four months, the death toll is tens of thousands. The destruction -- everybody watches it here every day, and many people who, in the past perhaps had a negative opinion of the Houthis, of Iran, of the Iranian-affiliated militias, of Hezbollah, have in a sense, had a change of heart, because they see these groups are trying to hit the Americans trying to hit the Israelis, trying in some way to affect the ongoing war in Gaza. And therefore, on the street, I don't think you're going to have much in the way of praise for this and it really just does raise the level of tension to an extent that, I mean, most people had already assumed that there is actually a low intensity regional war going on across the Middle East between the United States and Israel on one hand and Iran and its allies on another. Now, we've gone to another level, it is well beyond low intensity. The worry is, of course, that one side or the other is going to misstep and then you could really find the situation far worse than it is at the moment and it is already pretty bad -- Jim.",

In fact, just earlier today, there was a report in Iranian state media that an IRGC adviser was killed in Syria by an Israeli strike.So the Israelis will no doubt be happy to see their American allies striking Iranian forces and their proxies inside of Iraq and Syria. But it certainly doesn't lower the temperature in a region that has really felt at times like it could really explode beyond what we are already seeing right now, which Ben so succinctly described. I mean, Israel is surrounded by Iranian proxies, not only Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah to the north in Lebanon, but there are, of course, those proxies in Iraq and Syria. And in fact, that proxy group is the Islamic resistance in Iraq has actually claimed responsibility for several smaller scale attacks on Israel itself. And so while these strikes are certainly intended to try and reestablish US deterrence to try and deter those proxy forces from attacking US forces further, a big question mark as to whether or not that was achieved. It certainly doesn't necessarily do anything to deter those forces from attacking Israel further. And so does Israel become more of a target? That could also be a question here? But also, of course, what will the actual impact of these strikes be? Will it actually have reduced the capabilities of some of these groups, which not only want to attack the United States, but also at times want to attack Israel?",

And therefore, as I said before, there's a certain amount of  -- I mean, as Christiane mentioned, the Houthis, for instance, they are seen as preventing even something worse happening in Gaza by directly impacting the Israelis. The militias in Syria and Iraq are a little bit different, because they are identified very closely with Iran, which isn't necessarily popular in the Middle East, but when it comes to sort of stopping or preventing US policies from succeeding in the Middle East, certainly, the Iranians have been more successful than all of the Arab regimes in the region, which speak out of both sides of their mouth.

But this is where we're attacking and that is important to understand is that the United States clearly does not want to expand the war into Iran. There is no desire on the part of this administration to do that, and bear in mind, Iran has robust infrastructure. The IRGC, the Quds Force, are incredibly robust. And the thing that the Iranians like to do is to export their terror and to get their proxies to do all the heavy lifting, and to do all the dirty laundry. Iran, and specifically the leadership in Tehran do not want to do that. Therefore, the United States is going after very robustly, and I think it's about time along this axis of resistance.",

It also is heavily armed, 24 cruise missiles to include some gravity munitions, some gravity bombs that exist as well. So this is -- and this aircraft, this capability has got about 40 years' worth of experience on it, and it has legs out to another 10 or 15 years.

You can strike Iranian forces outside of Iran, inside Iran, even President Trump, a bridge too far.But in terms of what we saw tonight, we don't know if or how many Iranian personnel could force fighters were killed in these strikes.

Your photos show, you know, some results of the attacks tonight, secondary explosions.But what we don't know is, did we kill the people we wanted to kill? The IRGC Quds Force commanders that were maybe there. Of course, Iran had a few days to not just move its people, but maybe to move sets of equipment as well. So, I would hope that we would pursue those things and continue the campaign beyond just a day or two. And, of course, the Pentagon and the White House have said as much. With regard to Iranian responses, look, it could be it, of course, localized attacks, again, against United States bases through their proxies. It could be missile attacks, as we saw during my tenure in early 2020. I think that's less likely, but you don't know yet to be prepared for all that. I think that might also explain why there was some of some delay. You want to give your forces in the region, particularly in partner states like the UAE, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia, the chance to prepare and defend themselves, maybe relocate our own assets as well.",

A major test for this president? ESPERYou had the Russian invasion of Ukraine would be another. October 17th, the invasion -- I'm sorry, the brutal attack by Hamas on Israel. And now another step, another milestone in U.S.-Iranian relations. And look, depending on what happens tonight and in the coming days, how Iran responds, how the president responds again, this is also going to have a political impact here back home with an election 10 months away. People are going to look at this and make another judgment, another assessment about President Biden at a time when he's getting heat from all Americans with regard to the economy. There's dissatisfaction with regard to how he's handling the border. And now the question will be foreign policy once again. Is how do Americans size him up?
