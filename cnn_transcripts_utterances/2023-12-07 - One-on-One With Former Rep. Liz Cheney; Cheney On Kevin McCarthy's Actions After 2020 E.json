Vivek Ramaswamy, the Republican candidate with a predilection for conspiracy theories said at last night's presidential debate that, quote, \"January 6 now does look like it was an inside job, unquote. To that, former Republican congresswoman Liz Cheney says he's right, but not in the way he means. Cheney says, yes, it was an inside job, it was Trump and then Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy and Mike Johnson, who is now House speaker.It was a whole host of cowards and enablers and coconspirators in the House and the Senate Cheney says. Many of whom had an epiphany on January 7, 2021, after they saw the hate and the destruction and the death, their lives rot, and who just as quickly lost their clarity and their principles when Trump phoenix like rose from the ashes. Cheney has a brand new book that has quickly become a bestseller. It's a stark warning to the nation and she says ignore it and her as our democracies peril. And joining me now is former Republican congresswoman Liz Cheney. Her new book is \"Oath and Honor, A Memoir and a Warning.\" It's very briskly written and a great historical record. But it's a good read -- LIZ CHENEY, AUTHOR, \"OATH AND HONOR, A MEMOIR AND A WARNING\": Thank you.",

Now, there were people that were very certainly willing to go with them. But you know, it's situations for example, like when, when the issue of objecting to electoral votes came up, and you had these freshmen members who had just been elected, they hadn't been in office more than a couple of days and they were being asked to cast this crucially important vote, are you going to object to electoral votes? It was clear, there was no basis in the constitution for them to do so.And I had a couple of them tell me that Kevin was meeting with him privately telling them this isn't that big a deal. Really? You know, the easy political vote is just to go ahead and object. And when you think about the damage that does when it's the leader, and he's actually telling people don't worry, essentially, about your constitutional obligations, here's the political expedient path to take. And of course, you know, we saw where that led Republicans through the course of, you know, the months leading up to January 6 and afterwards.",
