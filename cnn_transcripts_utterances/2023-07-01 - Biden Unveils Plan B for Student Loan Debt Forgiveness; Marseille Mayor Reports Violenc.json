He said, of all the people arrested on Thursday night, a third of them, he said, were young children, some very young. We have accounts from French authorities of children young as 13 detained by the police. So it's an appeal to families to take responsibility for their younger children. But by and large, the message seems to miss its target. It doesn't address the underlying core issue. There is a sense of, as the U.N. is putting it, of racism within the police, that the communities here are unfairly treated, unfairly singled out. Violent actions against the police against them are higher than against other French citizens.

Apple has been here before. It first hit but failed to close at the milestone in January of 2022. Then the company ran into issues like China supply chain challenges and a softer macro environment. But if 2022 is remembered by the tech wreck, when tech shares tumbled and the Nasdaq was lowered by more than 30 percent, 2023 ushered in a very different picture. The Nasdaq is up 31 percent this year; U.S. based chipmaker Nvidia is up 181 percent. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, is up 137 percent. Apple stock is up almost 46 percent this year. Web analyst writing Friday, Apple breaking the $3 trillion market cap level was a, quote, \"historic\" moment for tech. What's behind the rally in tech? Well, part of it is the artificial intelligence frenzy that's largely driving the performance of critical chipmakers like Nvidia. But another part is growing confidence in the U.S. economy, despite more than a year of interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve and inflation that, at one point, was at 40 year highs. Friday was last trading day of the first half of 2023 and, according to an investment group, marks the third best first half of a year in Nasdaq history -- Rahel Solomon, CNN, New York.

The so- called ghost particles or neutrinos are tiny high energy cosmic particles.They can pass through stars, planets and entire galaxies without changing their structure. An observatory in Antarctica showcased a new portrait of the Milky Way. Scientists tested the particles with a telescope embedded in ice. The research was published in the journal, \"Science.\" The United Arab Emirates has made numerous forays into space in recent years, from the first satellite launch in 2009 to the Mars probe Hope in 2021. And in April, an Emirati astronaut became the first Arab to walk in space. Our Becky Anderson spoke with him from his post on the International Space Station. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
