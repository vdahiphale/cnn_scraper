Those -- the views that we saw in the polling in those early states really matter for 2024. And what we saw in both states was a sizable chunk of the Republican electorate, 20, 30 percent depending on the way you look at it, who were unenthusiastic about ever supporting Trump, that if he had been -- if it was known that he was a criminal or that, you know, the -- all the problems that he's had. I mean, in Iowa, Nikki Haley's voters -- more Nikki Haley voters, which was 20 percent of the electorate, said they would back Biden than Trump. We've never had polling like that in generations in America, where one set of voters in one party were so willing to support the voter -- you know, the candidate of the other party. Trump has demonstrated a lot of very early weakness. The turnout in Iowa was anemic, far less than they expected. There was not a lot of enthusiasm for him there. In New Hampshire, he came in 10 to 15 points below public polling and underperformed dramatically in New Hampshire. He's had two very weak performances so far. And this goes back to my basic take, which is that when people are actually voting in election after election all across the U.S. since the spring of 2022, we've done better than expected and Republicans have struggled. And I think there is -- I think that Donald Trump is a far weaker candidate today than he was in 2016 or 2020 for a whole host of reasons, right? His performance is diminished. But importantly, getting to what you were asking, Christiane, I'll do this quickly, is that there's going to be six things that voters know about him in this election that they didn't know about him in 2020. One, that he raped a woman in a department store dressing room. That's been litigated and decided by a jury of his peers. Second is he committed massive financial fraud, which is about to be, you know, finalized here in the next few days. Third is that he led an insurrection and he's promised now to end American democracy for all time. Fourth, that he stole America's secrets, lied about it to the FBI and shared those secrets with other people. Fifth, that his family's taken more money from foreign governments than any political family in American history. And finally, he singularly was responsible for ending Roe. We have six disqualifying events that have happened that we're going to be able to use as people in politics to be able to push him further and further away from the electorate, which is why I'm so optimistic that we can win this election this year.",

And I think the Biden campaign is slowly, you know, getting to the point where it needs to be. I don't think they're going to be fully up and running for another six to eight weeks, which in our system is a long time. I know for many countries, the entire-election is six to eight weeks. But I think you're going to start to see -- by March, you're going to start to see really the full general election campaign. And it's -- and I think - - you know, look, I think that Biden has a very strong case for reelection. I think we -- I assume that we're going to hear the beginnings of the second term agenda in the State of the Union in early March. And you put Biden up the slow and steady leadership, workhorse, not a show horse, clearly made the country better against this wild, unfit, you know, crazy party. I think we should -- you know, my view is having done this now for more than 30 years, we should win this election in 2024. We should flip the House.

Now, we turn to wider regional tensions. Yemen's Houthi leader vows further escalation if the war on Gaza doesn't stop. They claim their attacks on Red Sea shipping are in solidarity with the Palestinian people there. And continued U.S. and U.K. strikes have not deterred them. The Houthis certainly have experienced in weathering these strikes under years of a Saudi-led campaign against them. Hisham Al-Omeisy knows this group very well, because in 2017, they detained him in the capitol Sana'a and held him for months. He's joining us now with some analysis from Washington D.C. Welcome to the program. Before I ask you about your particular, you know, encounter with them, tell us a little bit about who the Houthis are and why, after now weeks of attacks against -- you know, against their military emplacements, it hasn't deterred them? HISHAM AL-OMEISY, SENIOR ADVISER, EUROPEAN INSTITUTE OF PEACE AND YEMEN CONFLICT EXPERT ONCE HELD CAPTIVE BY HOUTHIS:  Thank you. Well, to begin with, the Houthis are a rebel group. They're a theocratic police state. And they've been hoping for this opportunity, for this confrontation with the U.S. for a while now, for almost 30 years. They've been claiming that they've been fighting the colonial imperialist powers in the region. So, this actually provided them with a golden opportunity. And the strikes are not that effective against them. If anything, it's actually fueling their anger. It's actually galvanizing them. But also, because their weaponry is very dispersed across mountainous ranges. And they're also locally producing some of those missiles. Yes, components are coming from Iran. Components are coming from elsewhere. The trainers are coming from Hezbollah. But again, they have the local capacity to rebuild and restock those piles.

How on earth did that happen from one of the most impoverished and, you know -- I mean, it's just, Yemen has been through so much. It's been bombarded. It's terribly poor. It has -- you know, its people survive on international assistance. How does that develop one of the most sophisticated propaganda machines in this war? AL-OMEISY:  Because, you have to remember, you're talking about Yemen. And as you mentioned, we're going through a humanitarian crisis where almost 80 percent of the population is in need of aid. There's a high level of illiteracy. But also, it's a very tribal area. And on top of that, people have went through a devastating nine-year war. Grievances are deep. Emotions are high. Houthis are actually really good at weaponizing those grievances. At basically pinning every Yemeni issue, Yemen's woes, against external foes. And where, in a country, people are not big fans of foreign interventions, it is very easy to make them coalesce around and fight against the local -- the foreign invader, if you will, the colonial imperialists. And this is why the Houthis were very good at basically painting the U.S., the U.K., as they call it, the greatest Satan. And pitching themselves as the vanguards of the Muslim and the Arab nation. The events in Gaza actually kind of fueled also that narrative, because now, to Yemenis being bombarded with these images that are coming out of Gaza with women, children suffering, dying, the Houthis turn around and tell the Yemenis, see what the West is doing. This is the real face of the West. Come and fight with us against these imperialists, against these colonials. And of course, they kind of add some religious text, some Quranic verses to it as well, to kind of heighten those emotions and galvanize support. And also recruit, enhance their recruitment drives.

And all of a sudden, one of those angry people decides to light himself on fire in Central Tunisia, Mohamed Bouazizi. And this spark creates a conflagration that basically consumes the entire Middle East, leads to several regimes collapsing, and then also, the Syrian civil war, which hundreds of thousands of people died in. And so, when you think about this, you think about, you know, would this have happened but for this trigger in Tunisia? And I think this is the sort of way that our world works, is partly between order and disorder, where you have these trends and these sorts of aspects where you get towards what's called the tipping point or the edge of chaos, and then a single thing can tip you over that edge and create an extremely consequential event that shifts how the world works.",

Because, you know, if you have somebody like themselves on fire in Norway tomorrow,it's not going to cause a revolution, because the system has slack and people are happy, right? Now, in the Middle East, there are people who are unhappy with their dictatorships for a very long time, and there weren't mass protests and there weren't large-scale civil wars, and then all of a sudden, they happened all at once. I go through an example in the book of something similar to explain this dynamic of the onset of World War 1, which many historians have debated. And I talk about the sort of, you know, the standard story is the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, where he sputters to a stop right next to his assassin. And that's the fluke that triggers the war. Now, of course, you had to have all sorts of other things in place for that to actually happen. This series of alliances that made it more likely that a single death could actually create a world conflict. But I also talk about in the book how he almost died in a hunting accident many months before that when he was in England. And if that had happened, I don't know if World War I would have started. But I certainly know that it would not have happened in the same way. And I think what we often do is we have this sort of binary categories. The war starts or it doesn't. And actually, what I'm arguing through chaos theory is that the way the war starts is also important. So, if it's triggered by an assassination or if the guy gets killed in an accident, in a hunting accident, that will affect world history. And I think instead what we try to do is impose these really, you know, sort of storybook narratives on how the world works.

      "sentences": "Yes. So, I agree with your highlighting there, because I think that one of the things that we do need to be aware of is how high the sand pileis, to go back to the previous analogy, right? So, we have an obligation to explain our world with what I think are two things. One is that sometimes there is much more arbitrary and accidental forces that do matter, right? And we're constantly told to focus on the signal and ignore the noise. And the argument I'm making is that the noise actually has some pretty profound consequences for the way the world works. But it's also thinking about why are we more prone to flukes than we are in the past, right? I think we've upended the way the situation in in sort of global affairs has used to work compared to how it works today. So, for example, when you think about, like, the vast stretch of human history, most people dealt with uncertainty in their daily life. They had to deal with the question of, you know, how you find food, or whether you're going to be eaten by a saber-tooth tiger, but the world didn't change that much year to year. And what we have now is we have a world where, you know, Starbucks is always the same, but democracies are collapsing and rivers are drying up. And I think that to your point -- to your question is suggesting that we've created a world with less slack So that you have these long-term trends that create worlds in which flukes can actually have high, high consequences. So, if we had dealt with the problem of the lingering resentment in the American public, then Trump might have had a joke told about him. He might have run for office and he would have gotten 0 percent of the vote. So, I think that the combination of order and disorder or flukes on these long- term trends, they're the way that the world actually works. And I think what we do instead is we tend to focus on the sort of big explanations, the long-term explanations for social change, and I think these pivot points that can start with a joke do actually change the world.",

And so, I think this is a danger that does exacerbate the problem when elites or people who are in politics start to peddle conspiracy theories as a way to win votes, and that is a uniquely American phenomenon.

So, when you think about the internet, I thinkthere's a really profound shift that the internet has produced, which has never happened before. So, every other form of technological revolution around information has expanded the number of people who can consume information, right? So, the printing press, the radio, the television, et cetera, all of that created a larger audience. But the people who could produce information and theories about the way the world works was still pretty small. And you had to actually seek out conspiracism in -- you know, in the distant past. It was harder to get. Whereas now, because anyone can produce information and it can spread really, really fast on the internet, you have the proliferation of conspiracy theories that were exposed to more often, and algorithms that often amplify them. So, a person who would not have sought out a conspiracy theory in the past is now being shown one by design from, you know, tech algorithms and so on. And so, I don't think it's that we've changed, I think it's the way that our information pipelines operate has shifted. And that's made them more influential in modern politics.",

He basically raised this problem of how can you know that the past -- the patterns of the past are going to be predictive of the patterns of the future? And that was already something people were worried about with reason in the past. Now, I think they have even more reason to be worried about it because our world is changing so quickly. And yet, A.I. is still trained on past patterns, right? I mean, this is the kind of stuff where machine learning is derived from training data and it says, this is how the world works. The problem is, you can start to get into trouble, A, if you think that you have certainty in an uncertain world, which I think we do, and A.I. doesn't solve that problem. And B, if you think that the past patterns will be predictive of the future, and then the world shifts, right? And all of us understand this idea intuitively because, you know, meteorologists will tell us, oh, there was 100-year flood. And we say, OK, why is there 100-year flood every three years now? It's because the underlying cause and effect patterns have shifted. And so, if A.I., you know, development is not careful to this problem, I think we can engineer a world of false certainty of hubris around these new tools that gets us into serious danger that's avoidable. So, I'm -- I think A.I. is going to be exceptionally good at solving problems in what I call closed systems. You know, medical diagnoses, for example. But it might have some dangers embedded in it with open systems where the past and the future are not aligned. And the training data of the past is actually very misaligned with the underlying cause and effect dynamics in a different world that's unfolding as we speak.",

And the reason for that is because I think I - - you know, I grew up in the U.S. where I was sort of told you have to sort of just make your own path. This sort of individualist mindset, the American dream and so on. And it's a culture that is extremely focused on control, right? And I describe in the book how I was living, you know, what I described as a checklist existence. And I think when you start to think about the role of these forces that are sometimes arbitrary, accidental, and random, and also the chaos theory, the ripple effects of our decisions, it starts to liberate you a little bit, right? It starts to make you feel like, you know what, it's maybe OK if I don't have so much top-down control. And that's what I've internalized as a lesson from the book. In terms of society, I think the main lesson is resilience. I think that we have the tools to give us the illusion of control more than ever before. Because we have so much predictability and stability in our daily lives that we start to think that our world is also stable. And in fact, it's the opposite. The stability in our daily lives is happening at the same time as the world is changing faster and more profoundly than ever before in human history. So, in my view, this is something where politicians, economists, et cetera, need to understand that they are creating a world without slack, and the flukes are always going to be there. So, instead of imagining that we can have this top-down control, I think we have to have a little bit less hubris and also accept the limits of what humans can and cannot control.
