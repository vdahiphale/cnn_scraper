President Joe Biden and congressional Republicans are inching closer to a deal on immigration policy changes, and to do that -- in order to get aid for Ukraine and Israel. But the president does face an uphill battle to get his own party on board, as do Republican leaders getting their right flank on board.CNN's Priscilla Alvarez joins me now. Priscilla, what are you hearing about negotiations right now?",

      "sentences": "Well, all indications right now is that there has been some progress, but exactly what that is still unclear. What has been clear though, Dana, is that the president has said repeatedly that he's open to compromise, but that means compromising on one of the most delicate political issues for this White House, which is the handling of the U.S.-Mexico border.And the growing urgency by this White House to get money to Ukraine and Israel is putting Democrats in a very difficult position. One telling me that it is putting them in a box because they're having to embrace and support some of these concessions that are very similar to the Trump administration and ones that, not very long ago, Democrats were criticizing. Now, sources tell me that some of these concessions by the White House include, for example, expelling migrants without giving them the chance to seek asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border. That's reminiscent of the COVID era restriction known as Title 42. As well as raising the credible fear standard for asylum seekers, more deportations, and also expanding detention. Again, these are all difficult pills to swallow for progressives who, for years, have slammed the Trump administration for taking a similar path when it came to the U.S.-Mexico go border. And now it's the White House, the president, who seems to be open to all of these to get that Ukraine aid to the finish line.",

But, I mean, how many offices have we stood outside for years, for almost two decades, as they negotiate some grand bargain on immigration? And these issues are so tricky, so complicated, so political that it falls through. I talked to somebody involved in these talks this morning who said that they are actually making real progress. I know you've been doing reporting on this. CARL HULSE, CHIEF WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\": Yes. Look, I was in the capital this morning, and Chuck Schumer was over in Mitch McConnell's office. Not a place he hangs out a lot, by the way. And they seem to be seriously trying to get a deal. There's a lot of reasons for this seriousness, both Senator McConnell and Chuck Schumer, for once, want the same thing, and they want it very badly. Some of this is optics. They need to be seen to be really working on this. And so, if they don't get a deal, at least they'll have tried really hard when they leave and they get hammered for not finishing this. On the counter to what she said, there's a lot of Democrats who think this is good politics for them, right? And that taking some action on the border would help people in tough races like Jon Tester in Montana, Sherrod Brown in Ohio. So, there are some Republicans who run around and say, why should we even help the Democrats on this? I think -- but in terms of -- it is kind of hard to think of doing a back of the envelope immigration deal. The key here is it's not the big immigration deal.",

When he campaigned in 2020, he campaigned like a moderate, and he's been governing a lot like a progressive because there's a lot of progressive Democrats in -- on Congress. There's a lot of progressive Democrats who have made it into the White House and different agencies, and he's having to listen to that wing. And now, we're kind of starting to see deeper cracks in what happens when you make those swings.So, again, we're talking about what we're going to do for this policy this time and how that's going to pan out for the general election.

For him to win the White House, for us to win the Senate, and for us to take back the House. And that coalition involves a lot of young voters. It involves a lot of immigrant voters. It involves a lot of folks of color. And this issue of immigration is critically important to them. (END VIDEO CLIP) AMY WALTER, PUBLISHER AND EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, \"COOK POLITICAL REPORT\": I just don't know that I think this is the issue that's going to be the main factor here in energizing or not energizing that coalition to get out to the polls. I think the issue of the border is a real problem for Democrats and for Biden, and voters are seeing it, whether you're an independent voter or a Democratic voter, the sense of competence is a real question rather than just the issues around asylum and other issues around immigration broadly. And look, the contrast between a Biden who can say, I worked in a bipartisan measure to get things that even Republicans agree with. Donald Trump wants to go even further. And as we know, there's reporting on talks of mass deportations, putting people in camps around the border. I think that contrast is pretty strong. And so, for progressives, I do think that may be the bigger issue than whatever comes out of that the House and Senate if it can get past the House --",

But as Amy was saying, yes, progressives are not going to like this, but add it to the list. There are -- the Biden campaign is hoping that those Trump policies that you were talking about are actually the motivating factor for young progressives, and they may or may not be. I mean, that is a big challenge for the Biden administration. But issue one is if they can get something on the deal on the border. It's not just a border issue anymore.

And it's -- it -- the case does not challenge the core year 2000 approval of the drug, but rather restrictions, Dana.How easy is it to get the drug? Can you get it through telemedicine? Can you pick it up? Must you put it up in person, or can get you -- get it through the mail after you've been approved? Can you get it at 10 weeks into your pregnancy or just seven weeks? Those are the crucial questions in this case. And it also involves, Dana, the authority of the Food and Drug Administration to decide what drugs, all sorts of drugs, cancer drugs, diabetes drugs, epileptic drugs.

Even back in 1992, there was a crucial -- a big election year, there was a crucial abortion case. The justices have decided Bush v.
