We continue tracking breaking news out of the Middle East this hour, where a major earthquake has killed dozens of people in Syria and Turkey.Syrian state media report at least 111 people have died in Syria and more than 500 are injured. An unknown number could be trapped under rebel. The White Helmets Rescue Group, also known as the Civil Defense, has declared the northwestern part of Syria a disaster area. Multiple buildings have collapsed in both countries. At least 76 people reported dead in Turkey and more than 400 are injured. The Governor of Istanbul says nearly 1,000 search and rescue volunteers are heading to the impacted region. In Turkey's, a disaster and emergency management agency is calling for international support. Meanwhile, the U.S. Geological Survey says the epicenter of the 7.8 magnitude quake was in Turkey's Gaziantep Province. An aftershock with a magnitude of 6.7 struck northwest of the initial quake about eleven minutes later. Multiple aftershocks have been reported. I want to turn now to CNN's Scott McLean. He is following developments for you from London. What more can you tell us? Scott?",

And, you know, we've been obviously paying attention to Ukraine for the last year and a half. I was just there last month and you've seen plenty of scenes there where you have the aftermath of a missile strike.But remember, this is one concentrate, relatively concentrated area where all of the rescue workers can go and try to pull anyone out from the rubble, and not only are you trying to get to people in what's a chaotic scene, but you also have to be quiet to try to hear if there may be anyone trapped. So trying to get all of the other people on the site, trying to get all of the cars to stop honking or to turn off the engines, to try to see if there's anyone who may be trapped inside. I mean, these are the kind of things that people are up against. In fact, the natural instinct for a lot of people in this case is obviously if you have a car, to get inside of it and to drive into a less densely populated areas, but at least in the early hours, we had local officials saying, please be calm, please don't move your cars, because in some areas they're actually experiencing traffic jams, which means that emergency workers can't get into those areas. So I think what really struck me about that video is you don't see a whole lot of flashing lights, you don't see tons and tons of ambulances and emergency workers because remember, this is an area where it's not one building that's down. You have a lot of buildings that may have collapsed. You have a lot of buildings that's going to be damaged. And so it's very difficult for first responders to figure out where exactly to put their resources.",

      "sentences": "Yes, well, I mean, just from my own family, my husband saying that he felt the earthquake in the 3And at least from Israeli authorities they say that there was something like nearly 4,000 reports into them about this earthquake. So far no injuries have been reported. We also are not hearing of any major injuries or damages across the Palestinian territories, just that people have reported that they were able to feel these tremors lent everything was shaking, but not to the point quite of major damage. I should remind you that just like in Turkey, only a few hundred kilometers away, this region has been anticipating a major earthquake. They say an earthquake should happen here about every hundred years or so and it's about the time for that major earthquake to happen. In fact, Israel recently just in the last year put out a new early warning system about earthquakes and is reminding people but what to do in the situation of an earthquake or even aftershocks affecting this region. They tell people right now on the radio to and on TV to go outside if you can, and if not go into a sheltered room. In Israel there are often bomb shelters in apartments and in buildings and they call on people to go into those sheltered areas. But just in the last couple of minutes or so we did receive word from Israeli officials, from the Minister of Defense and from the Foreign Affairs ministers that Israel is going to be sending aid rescue, search and rescue teams to Turkey to help. It's only about a couple hours flight from here directly to where the earthquake took place. Israel also did this in the aftermath of that major 1999 earthquake and Israel is pretty well versed in search and rescue teams. They were at for example, the condo collapse in Florida in the last couple of years. And the Defense Minister says that security forces are ready to offer whatever assistance is required and that they are immediately preparing to take off to go to Turkey and to assist in any way they can. So we expect it will be members of the Israeli military, another search and rescue who will be heading out that way to try and help in whatever search and rescue they can. I also wouldn't be surprised if we also start seeing at some point, for example victims and others being airlifted to Israel for medical assistance in any way. Right now we're just starting to see the gear start and motion of the Israeli government and other governments around the world starting to try and organize this assistance that likely Turkey will so desperately need.",

We don't have a full picture yet, but it is the case that people have felt the earthquake from the Black Sea all the way to Damascus. And that tells you that a very condensely populated, ancient part of the world is hit by earthquake once again. Turkey is historically at the crossroads of various fault lines and there has been an expectation for a big earthquake for a number of years, for at least two decades. But that was thought to be the expectation was that would happen take place in Istanbul. This is certainly the other fault line and is going to be equally, I think, devastating.",

There you can see some buildings on the street in the distance there look like they are completely intact, and then you have others that are -- well while it is actually hard to tell that there was a building there because they have been absolutely flattened.They look like they have just been knocked over and so you can imagine the challenge of actually attempting to find anyone who might be alive in this kind of a situation. And remember, these look like residential buildings so this happened around 20 after 4:00 in the morning, where virtually the entire city would've been asleep. And so it is difficult to imagine a lot of people surviving in this case. It is also difficult to imagine a lot of people would've been outside of their homes. And look at the weather as well. It does not look like it is warm and so you had people running outside the buildings that are still intact, likely in their pajamas to try to get to some safety and then quickly realizing that the temperatures are very cold. In fact in Malatya, another city which is nearby the area, which has also been impacted by the earthquake with buildings damaged, some of them and leveled. You actually have rescue efforts that are ongoing there and it is snowing. So just one more thing to add to the absolute misery that we are seeing there in Turkey and also the northwestern part of Syria, a place where, frankly, the infrastructure and the services had been decimated after years and years of war and things are extremely difficult in that area in the best of times. Now you add on top of this, one of the most devastating earthquakes in decades and decades, maybe longer than that. And this is a real recipe for disaster and you can understand why the Turkish authorities are asking for help from outside of the country. They're also asking people not to get in their cars and move them and drive them because they are seeing traffic jams in some areas where emergency services are not able to get into those areas. We are also hearing officials asking for people across Turkey to donate blood which gives you a sense of just how much need there is going to be inside of these hospitals. I've also just viewed video from Gaziantep, where our freelance colleague (INAUDIBLE) is there taking video of some of the damage. And we don't have it up for you just yet, but I can tell you from seeing this video one of the buildings that he was at looks like it has been flattened like a pancake and all of the floors sort of collapsing on to one another. So in cases like that, Laila, it is sort of difficult to imagine how on earth you would expect to find anyone alive underneath the rubble. But obviously we are hoping and praying.",

And among the 47 you have highly recognizable figures like Joshua Wong, the pro democracy activist, also Benny Tai (ph) the law professor, Claudia Mo, a former elected official opposition lawmaker here in Hong Kong. They earlier had pled guilty and among the 16 or so whop are pleading for the innocence is a former journalist, her name Gwyneth Ho. Again, what are they accused of? They're accused of participating and organizing an unofficial primary vote in July of 2020. Previously, a similar event took place without incident in 2018, but when this vote took place, the Beijing liaison office said it contravenes the law. And as we look at the videos of that primary vote that took place in 2020 -- want to bring up the statement to remind you what China's top representative said about that vote, about this exercise at the time. They said this, quote, \"With the support of external forces, opposition groups and leaders have deliberately devised plans to hold the so-called primary election, which is a serious provocation to the current electoral system and caused serious damage to the fairness and justice of the legislative council elections,\" unquote. Earlier today there was a small group of protesters who are gathering outside the courtroom. One individual was holding up a banner that said crackdown is shameless. Critics all over the world have said that the national security law here in Hong Kong is being used to stifle and to crush dissent and opposition. This statement was released last year by Human Rights Watch. And we will bring it up for you. This is from a senior China researcher, who said this, quote, \"Hong Kong's biggest national security case is wrapped in legal language but it is just part of the Chinese government's relentless efforts to smother Hong Kong's democracy movements. The very real threat of life in prison for peaceful activism shows Beijing's utter contempt for both democratic political processes and the rule of law,\" Now this is a landmark trial.
