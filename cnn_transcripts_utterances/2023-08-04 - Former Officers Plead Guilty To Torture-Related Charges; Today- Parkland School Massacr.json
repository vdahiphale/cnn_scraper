These men sexually abused their victims, repeatedly tased them, tortured them, all under the authority of the badge which they disgraced. (END VIDEO CLIP) VALENCIA:  During the incident, which lasted two hours, these men were repeatedly beaten. One of them was shot in the mouth during a mock execution. They were doused with milk, with grease, alcohol, and then told to shower off evidence of the abuse so the officers could get their stories straight.

Ballistics experts will fire up to 139 shots as part of a civil lawsuit investigation against Scot Peterson, the then-school resource officer who remained outside as a shooter killed 17 people on Valentine's Day in 2018.The plaintiffs, several of the victims' families, and a survivor, want to record the sound of the gunfire to show that Peterson would have heard the shots and known where they were coming from. Peterson's defense team has argued he didn't enter the building because he couldn't tell where the shots were coming from due to echoes. Now, Peterson was found not guilty earlier this summer of criminal charges. Before the reenactment, in just moments, a bipartisan congressional delegation will tour the building before it's demolished later this month. The building has been sealed since the massacre. Blood of the victims still stains the classroom floors, bullet holes mark the walls, and Valentine's Day gifts and cards are strewn about. Our next guest, Democratic Congressman Jared Moskowitz, will lead that congressional tour with a Republican colleague. He's a graduate of Marjory Stoneman Douglas and he was a state representative for Parkland at the time of the tragedy, which spurred him to help push for anti-gun violence legislation. Congressman, I appreciate your time. I want to start with you've been, I believe, inside the school. You're one of the few people that's actually been in. What should people expect when they walk in today? What are they going to see? REP. JARED MOSKOWITZ (D-FL):  Well, first of all, thanks for having me. Thanks for talking about this five years after the Marjory Stoneman Douglas school shooting at the building right behind me where I went to high school. I mean, listen, what they're going to see is a unique experience -- a horrific experience. The building behind us is a time capsule. Other than the victims obviously no longer being there, the building is exactly as it was on February 15, the day after the shooting. And so, we're going to be walking through that building -- a bipartisan delegation with law enforcement, with folks from the state attorney's office, folks from the school board, and with family members -- family members -- some of them going into the building for the first time. And so, this is important. It's important for folks in Congress -- my colleagues -- to see what happens when a school shooting comes to your neighborhood and how it affects families. And so -- but it's going to be a very emotional day.",

I'm not expecting we're going to walk out of the building and start working on legislation, but the idea is to continue to have the conversation. I mean, there's a lot we can do when it comes to school safety and gun violence prevention. There's not one thing that we have to do. And we have to find where we have common ground. That bill that we passed -- the Marjory Stoneman Douglas School Safety Act after -- three weeks after the shooting in the Florida Legislature was a bipartisan piece of legislation. It did school safety. It did mental health. It did SROs. It raised the age to 21 to buy a gun in Florida. Red flag laws. Hundreds of millions of dollars for school safety around the state. And so, it was a comprehensive piece of legislation. I don't know that D.C. can -- is going to do that.
