MCCONNELL: So, I actually feel pretty good about the way the meeting played out yesterday. I was concerned they were going to come out and like actively attack each other. They weren't. We had a -- you know, we had a good meeting. Everyone restated their opening positions. That's not surprising. In every Oval Office meeting I attended, the first meeting, all you get is the public speeches given in private. And that's apparently what happened. The good news is -- and this is getting less attention -- is they said, well, A, we're going to meet again Friday. And B, in between, the staffs are going to start having a conversation. Now the White House is saying this is a separate conversation about the budget process for something related to September 30th when the government funding expires. Republicans are clearly saying, oh, this is a part of the transaction. Look, in the real world, if they get an agreement on something around the budget, spending caps, rescinding of unspent COVID money, that's going to be part of this transaction.

Because I think it would be difficult for the president to leave if we're still kind of barreling -- the public narrative is, we're barreling towards a default.As important as that G7 meeting is -- and I don't want to understate the importance of it -- I think the optics of leaving the country in the middle of this get a little bit challenging. So, they'll have this meeting on Friday. They will continue to work through the weekend. And at some point, we're going to start getting some sense of, OK, a deal is looking like it's going to come together. The other thing that will be important that will happen I think in the next couple weeks is, the last communication from the Treasury Secretary said, we can get to June 1. It might be a little bit more, but being conservative, it's June 1. That little bit of wiggle room is actually not helpful at the end of the day. So, I think need some additional communication from Treasury, either firming up the June 1 deadline or saying, no, it slipped. It's the 2nd, it's the 5th, whatever it is. So that the negotiators know we have a hard deadline. This is what we're working up against.",
