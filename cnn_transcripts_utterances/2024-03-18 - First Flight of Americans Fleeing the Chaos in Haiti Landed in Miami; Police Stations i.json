Many of times, reinforcements have been built up, not only because of the police, but because of the community. They've built barricades all around here.For the police station to function properly, they need to rely on the community and to have these almost vigilantes building a lot of the barricades to keep out any gang members.

This current stage is a voluntary process in which people have to make their way north to Cap-Haitien, in the north, to fly to Miami. This is tough getting to the north because of the lack of control and security on the roads out of Port- au-Prince. But it appears to be working, but we may have to do more.To the larger question, the opportunity here is, first of all, it's a terrible tragedy. A long running cycle of dysfunction and violence, of course, which the United States has been drawn into many times before. The difference is now we have an opportunity through this transitional council and somebody called the Montana Accords of Haitians themselves coming together. Women, church leaders, civil society leaders to try to shape and imagine a government, a consensus leader that could emerge. They could provide this kind of stability and unifying force that has been lacking. As you know, one of the biggest frustrations from the Haitian people, and that led to this gang violence, was the fact that the Prime Minister who came into office after the assassination of President Moise, was not elected. He was going to call for elections, but he never did. A lot of frustration about that. So, they need to move forward.",

It is absolutely essential -- you know, there are 4,000 prisoners have been released from maximum security prisons.That's why the security situation is really the number one priority, and hopefully act with speed to get this multinational force in, particularly to the airport and the port.

Of course, in '94 when President Aristide was ousted, we sent a, you know, contingent of marines, major U.N. peacekeeping force.I don't anticipate that. I see the United States in supporting with logistics intelligence. Perhaps air cover, if necessary, around the airport. But the Caribbean community, the CARICOM, and the United Nations recognize the failures of the past. Whether it's the issues with the peacekeepers and cholera, you know, several years ago. That there's a lot here to complain about. But there's no alternative than to look for a better way forward and to continue to engage. But really try to forge this political consensus among this transitional council. That will be key, a consensus candidate. The other thing that will be key is we have Guy Philippe, the gang members -- this is the former coup plotter against Aristide. He's now been released from U.S. prison last fall.",

And I think that's obviously what led to him cancelling that partnership with X.Toward the end of the interview, Jim, you can really see that Elon is no fan of Don.

Because you know, it's always fun filling this bracket out and trying to pick some upsets in the first couple of rounds.But if you really want to win your bracket pool, it's all about picking that winner because more than likely the person who wins is going to end up picking the champion correctly. And there's a stat that can help you do so. It's called KenPom. It measures the team's offensive and defensive efficiency. And every team that has won since 2002 has been in the top 40 in offense and top 22 in defense. So, who qualifies right now? You got Houston, UConn, Purdue, Auburn, Arizona, Tennessee, North Carolina, and Marquette. Some good teams did not qualify. You got Creighton there, just missed out. Iowa State, you see they won the Big 12, but they are not good enough offensively according to KenPom to win. Kentucky, defensively not good enough. Duke, just missing out too. But according to the last 22 years of data, Duke is not going to win this year's national championship. Another trend to look at, so the last 19 champions have been in the top 12 of the week six AP Poll. What team is not here that I just mentioned? Auburn is not there. Now, UConn is the defending champs and the favorite to win it all. But since 1974, only Duke in the '90s and Florida in the mid-2000s were able to pull off back-to-back titles. It's very hard to do in men's college basketball. Can Dan Hurley and the Huskies do it? They could, but you know, you might not want to pick them for this very reason. Now, if you lost your first conference tournament game like Tennessee did in the SEC tournament, you're not going to win the national championship. No one's ever done that. So, you can cross them off. Now, I like to show this map every year. See this red line right down the middle of the country. Every champion since 1997, Jim, has been east of that line. So, you see Arizona, they're on the wrong side. So, let's pull up the graphic I had up before. We got Arizona crossed off because they're on the wrong side of the line. Tennessee lost their first conference tournament game, they're crossed off. Auburn was not in that week six poll, we crossed them off. I'm crossing off UConn just because it is so hard to win back-to-back titles.",
