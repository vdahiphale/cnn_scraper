I want to warn you that these videos we're about to show you are disturbing.That video released earlier shows what happened moments before that man was dragged out of the cell when Jared Hobbs was beaten and then dragged into the hallway. Additional footage released today shows deputies patting each other on the back, calmly walking away. Joining us now is Jared Hobbs' attorney, Harry Daniels. Harry, good to see you again. First, let me start with how is your client doing, Mr. Hobbs? How's he doing?",

He just wanted everybody to know that he appreciates your support, has been shown his way. And he also has this message that he did not would help should be considered. I'm been with mental health or people who have mental health distress when it comes to the jail, they should not be subject to beatings and look at the way he was treated.
