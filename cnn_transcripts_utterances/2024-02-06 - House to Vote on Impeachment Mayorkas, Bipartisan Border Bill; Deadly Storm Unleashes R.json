But we are watching really closely, because you have people like Representative Ken Buck, who are opposed to moving forward with impeaching Secretary Mayorkas.One thing is sure: Senate Democrats are going to have to make a decision, if the decision is made in the House to impeach Mayorkas, as to what they're going to do in their chamber. Specifically, are they going to try to move to dismiss this very quickly? Are they going to try to hold a quick trial in the Senate? Are they going to try to move this to a Senate committee in order to try to clear the deck and not take much time on the Senate floor, which is very precious, to deal with this impeachment? A lot of Senate Democrats that I talked to last night said, you know, they think that this is blatantly political. But at the same time, there are constitutional considerations, procedural considerations that they have to make. So, we expect that this will be approved in the House tonight. Where it goes from there, I think, is still a very open question. Senate Democratic aides are still reviewing past impeachments of non- presidents to try to make a decision to look at the precedent and see whether or not they have any maneuvering, any room to really try and move this along pretty quickly.",

The answer is going to be dependent on how long this appeal takes. I still think there's a chance. If this appeal ruling comes within the next few weeks, depending how quickly things move through, potentially, the Supreme Court, I still think they could get this trial in over the summer, maybe starting in May or June, carrying through July or August.

And I went back to it and thought, wait, that's not great that I think that's obvious.The idea that people were asked if Trump would concede if he loses. And 75 -- 74 percent said no. And 25 percent said yes. And I'm kind of questioning where they were in 2020. But the idea that 75 percent of Americans think the guy who's almost certain to be the Republican nominee, if he loses, is not going to concede; and you kind of read by it, because you're almost numb to it at this point. That seems bad.",

And this is-- people hate him for who he is, too.But, you know, this idea that he is defiant, that he is a fighter, that he is not going to go down without a fight is something that is really appealing to his base. And so the same thing that repels so many people is the very same thing that people love about him. And I think that's really, really confusing to understand. There are so many things about this poll that I find fascinating. When you look at only half of Americans are saying -- only half of Americans are saying it's very important we understand if a verdict is reached in this case before I vote for the guy. I mean, it's unbelievable. And when you look at the polling shifts, there are other polls that came out this week, Trump is ahead by Biden by five points. If he's convicted, he only loses by two points. That's within the margin of error. You can't imagine, if he is convicted, we're not -- he's not losing that much support, which is absolutely astounding. It speaks to the strength of his support. It speaks to how people trust the Supreme Court, trust the system. So many people believe the system is system is rigged, and his message has really taken hold.",
