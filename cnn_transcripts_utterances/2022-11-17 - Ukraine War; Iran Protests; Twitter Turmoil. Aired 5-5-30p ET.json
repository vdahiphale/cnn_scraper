This is THE GLOBAL BRIEF.A born survivor, as strikes continue across Ukraine, we'll introduce you to Olga who is preparing for the winter with no power or water. Then, two months of revolt. The latest from Iran, where five protesters have been sentenced to death. And commit or leave. It's just struck 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time, marking in on Musk's deadline ultimatum to Twitter employees. Russia is bombarding Ukraine with a fresh, punishing round of airstrikes as the first snow of winter falls on Kyiv and temperatures plunge below freezing. Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelenskyy says Moscow fired dozens of missiles and drone attacks Thursday. And now, 10 million people are without electricity. He says, it's further proof that Russia simply wants the Ukrainian people to suffer. At least four people were killed in Zaporizhzhia and 23 were wounded in the city of Dnipro. Well, all of the damage, the carnage, the fear, the darkness, caused by Russia's war is why NATO, the U.S., and E.U. say Ukraine is not to blame for the missile incident in Poland. Investigators say, all the evidence so far indicates the missile that fell in Eastern Poland came from Ukrainian air defenses and that it was entirely unintentional. Let's go straight out our Sam Kiley, who's joining me now live from Kryvyi Rih. Ten million people without electricity today, Sam. Talk us through the latest wave of missile strikes and what the situation currently is for Ukraine's energy system.",

And that is as temperatures begin to plummet, almost on a daily basis. It's not just above freezing here in Kryvyi Rih. But out in the recently liberated areas, it'll be a much colder night.

The problem for those who remain behind, the villages here, is that their war is not over because the Russians are easily within range and hit this place on an almost daily basis. In the next village, the few locals left were too anxious about a Russian return to speak on camera. And we were told to stay out of sight. Five Russian rockets landed here this morning, we were told. Liberated roads and tracks are still heavily mined, slowing efforts to rebuild. Russia has retreated from here, but it shifted much of its effort to attacking Ukraine's power grid and infrastructure. Civilian targets are a priority for long-range Russian missiles. VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  Dozens of missiles, civilian sites are the main target. Russia is waging war on electricity and heat for people by blowing up power plants and other energy facilities.",

Well, in the Netherlands, guilty verdicts of mass murder today in the shoot-down of the Malaysian airliner eight years ago. A Dutch court found two former Russian operatives and Ukrainian separatists guilty of firing the missile that destroyed the passenger plane of a Russian patrol Donetsk in 2014. It sentenced the three men to life in prison and awarded more than $60 million to the families of the 298 victims. But the men were tried in absentia, so they never have to face that sentence. CNN's Nic Robertson is following the verdicts and the reaction from the Ukrainian capital. So, Nic, as we say, these three men have been tried and in absentia. So what are the chances of them ever serving time for this horrendous attack?",

Unless there's some deal in the future that would involve Russia handing them over. But that's so far in the distance, it's impossible to imagine. But President Zelenskyy is looking into that distance and looking at this verdict, and he has said that this shows that the Russians perpetrating these acts, these criminal acts, can be brought to justice. He said, it's important that their bosses, in this case, this attack in 2019, that political -- who created the environment to allow this to happen, that would be President Putin and those in his government, should be brought to justice as well. And he extrapolates that forward to all the war crimes that are being committed in Ukraine today, saying all those responsible should therefore be brought to justice. This is proof that it can be done, accumulate the information, accumulate the evidence, find the names, match it to the acts. They also can stand trial, as well as just as these three mended trial in absentia, of course. But the his greater point is, and I think this is one that's very apropos of the moment, where there is increasing pressure on president Zelenskyy, particularly coming from the United States and the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Miley, saying this is a good time to try to get peace with Russia. What President Zelenskyy sent was a lasting peace or the foundation for a lasting peace can come if you have that level of accountability that was witnessed today in the court -- over MH 17, albeit it took eight years. He says, bring those in charge to justice as well. Do that for the crimes being committed now. And that is the path to a lasting peace.",

Nic Robertson, thank you for now.Well, Brittney Griner's agent tells CNN that the basketball star has been moved to a penal colony in Russia's Moldova region. The agent says, Griner's attorneys saw her there. She began serving her nine-year prison sentence. She was convicted in august of smuggling drugs into Russia and her appeal was rejected last month. She has repeatedly apologized for bringing a small amount of cannabis into the country. Former U.S. marine, Paul Whelan, is being held in the same region. Now, it's been two full months since thousands of people across Iran had taken to the streets to demand regime change. More than 14,000 people have reportedly been arrested and CNN understands that at least five people have been sentenced to death. On Wednesday, at least seven people killed in the shooting in the southwestern city of Issa, including a nine year old boy. Religious school was also set on fire and authorities are blaming the deaths on terrorists. Let's bring in our CNN's Jomana Karadsheh, who's been covering this war for almost two months from Istanbul.

Myanmar state media has announced that hundreds of prisoners have been pardoned by the ruling military junta.

Pardons were granted on humanitarian grounds to mark the country's national day on Thursday. A U.S. federal judge has given authorities five weeks to stop using a controversial policy known as Title 42 that allows the expulsion of migrants at the Mexican border. The policy allows authorities to turn away migrants if they determine it could stop the spread of contagious diseases. British finance minister Jeremy Hunt announced a new fiscal plan to tackle the cost of living prices and rebuild what he calls trust in the U.K. economy. The plan involves higher taxes and cuts on public spending, aimed at saving 55 billion pounds. Twitter's new owner and CEO Elon Musk had given employees a choice, to click on a link at the end of an email to stay at the company or be let go. Well, that deadline passed about 20 minutes ago. Silicon Valley has cut tens of thousands of jobs in recent weeks, and that is not easing recession fears. Vanessa Yurkevich has the story.
