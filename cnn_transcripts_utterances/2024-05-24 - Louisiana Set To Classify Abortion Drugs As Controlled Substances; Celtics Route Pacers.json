      "sentences": "Louisiana is on the verge of becoming the first state to classify abortion drugs as controlled dangerous substances. The bill passed by the Louisiana State Legislature. We classify drugs like Mifepristone as schedule for drugs. So, that puts them in the same category of controlled substances like Xanax, Valium, and Ambien.Now, the amendment has added to a bill that would make it a crime to give abortion medication to a person without their consent. And the bill now goes to the Republican Governor, Jeff Landry, who is expected to sign it into law. Abortion is already banned in Louisiana with no exceptions for rape or incest. CNN's Dianne Gallagher is joining me now with more. Dianne, so, what does this mean that for the women who are already in possession of Mifepristone?",

Remember, back in 2016, a lot of people, Donald Trump is reflexive. He is visceral, he's instinctive. He won't take -- he won't study all the data.When he picked Mike Pence in 2016, that was to stop a revolt at the convention. They said, you pick a good solid Christian conservative from the middle of America. And you'll stop Ted Cruz's plans to disrupt and try to steal the nomination, take the nomination at the convention. So, this would be a more traditional pick. Now, it's an interesting pick, right, Tom Cotton military service, that would help, good on television, that would help, a discipline campaigner, that would help, would it help Donald Trump in the suburbs on the abortion issue? He just turned Diane Gallagher. He's giving evidence of how Biden hopes to make this a big issue in the suburbs. So, you have to swing the balances of what is Trump looking for. But, if you're looking for a solid conservative with a disciplined campaigner with some things on his resume that Donald Trump doesn't have, Cotton makes sense.",

He sent out the text during the convention. It's hard to do in this day and age to keep it under wraps that long. It is hard to do, but you can keep it under wraps if you actually haven't made a final decision. So, that's the question. When do they get Trump to make the final decision. We do know this, especially, if you're going to make a more traditional pick, like a Tom Cotton. Trump's a showman. Trump likes suspense. Trump likes the drama of television. So, can he do it? Does he have the discipline to hold it that long if he's actually made a decision? It would be interesting, it would add excitement. I'm skeptical.",

And so, Donald Trump got more votes in 2020. They didn't 2016 even though he lost in 2020.So, let's be careful here, right, he can -- we know he can turn out voters. I do think it is a key point in the sense that the way I look at the election now and the election still in November, not now is, if I can tell you from my travels, John, the American people of all stripes want change. They want change. They're frustrated after COVID, with inflation, even talking just yesterday, to Trump voters in 16, Biden voters and 2020 who are doing this, like, what do I do right here. So, part of the challenge here is to motivate people to turn out. For the President, the Democratic coalition is a lot more complicated. So, if you lose a tiny percentage of Black voters who stay home, a tiny percentage of Latino voters who either switch to Trump or stay home, young voters who are mad about Israel, Hamas, for example, the Democratic coalition is more complicated. He needs to try to recreate the 2020 electorate. Trump is trying to get people who may have not shown up before, but are disenchanted, want something new to come out. That's the big competition, who can motivate, especially again, it's a pretty narrow slice that's willing to go either way. We'll see.",

But, the main thing is that Hunter Biden's lawyers in court in Wilmington, Delaware are saying to a federal judge, you know, the law isn't set here.The judge needs to figure this out. The law that they're talking about is the law that Hunter Biden is charged with violating that prosecutors say that when he signed a form to buy a gun in October of 2018. He was filling out background forms, and said, he was not an addict or a user of a controlled substance. But, Hunter Biden's legal team is now saying, you know, the terms user and addict, it wasn't fully understandable what that meant. At that time, he might not have known he was in attic then, they say someone like Mr. Biden, who had just completed an 11-day rehabilitation program at that time, and lived with a sober companion after that could surely believe he was not a present tense user or addict. Even on the eve of trial, we still do not know the constitutionally adequate elements of the charges in this case. So, that is what we are going to be hearing arguing from Hunter Biden's defense lawyer. The trial is on June 3, so not long from now, prosecutors say, this is not something that they need to be disputing right now, because Hunter Biden, even in his own memoir, was saying he was an addict for four years, up until 2019. So, he knew he was an addict. That's something that doesn't need to be defined further. There are other things that issue at this hearing, too, that are going to be pretty interesting, things that Hunter Biden's defense team wants to cut out. They don't want the jury to hear about his other set of criminal federal charges out in California related to tax issues that he led a lavish or extravagant lifestyle or that he had a child support dispute with a woman in Arkansas. So, all of that is going to be before the federal judge in Delaware today, and we'll see how this all shakes out, and exactly how juicy this trial might be.",

The hospital where patients are being treated in Bangkok says more than 20 people are suffering from spinal injuries.Joining me now is, Dr. Todd Albert, a spine surgeon at the Hospital for Special Surgery. Dr. thank you so much for your time this morning. We also understand the six passengers have skull and brain injuries. A total of 20 are in the intensive care unit. I mean, what is your reaction hearing about these types of very serious injuries? I mean, what kind of violent thrusting or shaking causes these types of injuries? TODD ALBERT, SURGEON-IN-CHIEF EMERITUS AT HOSPITAL FOR SPECIAL SURGERY: Well, thank you for having me. Amara. You need a significant -- significant force and different kinds of force. Like, when I hear skull injuries and head injuries, I'm thinking those patients didn't have their seatbelt on, and probably got the plane dropped. And their head went right very hard against the ceiling in some form or another that would give them the skull injury or went forward with a giant, a very violent jerking motion. In terms of spinal injuries, there's lots of ways those can happen. That can happen with a belt on, if there's such a thing called a seatbelt injury. That's a typical spinal injury, where the body flexes very hard forward against a braking motion, or a collision. But also, if they're rotating or violently shaking back and forth, you could get a spinal injury, there's a difference between a bony spinal injury and an injury that would cause a neurologic injury, or an injury to the spinal cord. So, there's different types of injuries, some as benign as a muscle strain that's significant, and/or, a little fracture that needs to heal with a brace over time, or others that injured the neural elements, or what's inside the spinal canal, that can be increasingly serious.",
