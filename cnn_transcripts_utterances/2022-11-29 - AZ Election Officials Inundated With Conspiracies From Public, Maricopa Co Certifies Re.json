President Biden gave this speech just a few days before the election, sort of imploring people to accept the results. So it's -- it didn't play out at the scale, some people feared.But still, you know, Kari Lake, ultimately, she did not win her race, but it was narrow. So there are still a lot of people who believe sort of the election denying conspiracy theory mongering candidates, and a lot of these races, although these Republicans didn't necessarily prevail, it was by very small margin. So I think the country still needs to contend with the fact that there are a lot of people who still believe this, who still don't trust election systems. And it's going to be an ongoing challenge. Then, of course, you have former President Trump launching another campaign and still spewing all of this. So this problem has not gone away by any means. The midterms played out better than people feared. But I think there's still a lot of work the country has to do, and they're still very much the threat of violence and people listening to their leaders and really distressing and acting on what their leaders are telling them to do.",

You mentioned Georgia, the state where the governor and the Secretary of State stood up to Donald Trump, both Republicans stood up to Donald Trump in 2020.They did a good job counting their votes again here in 2022. And they have a Senate runoff. There'll be a week from today to settle the Senate race and this is what we want in the democracy, people voting. Whether these are Democrats or Republicans, we don't know the answer to this. But look at this. 502,000 people have cast early ballots in the runoff since Saturday. More than 300,000 voted yesterday, a single day record for early voting in the state of Georgia. So yes, the good side of democracy is when people participate and a week from tonight -- a week from today we will count those votes. So we hope you join us right here when we do.

In their first World Cup match, the Iranian teen stood silent as the Iranian national anthem played.In their next match on November 25th, they did sing during the national anthem and a source tells CNN that in between those matches, the Iranian players were called into a meeting and warned behavior the regime back home viewed as out of line could bring severe repercussions on their families, members of the U.S. team expressing sympathy and solidarity with the off field pressures their opponents are facing.
