Markets clawed back some losses earlier in the day with the Dow closinglower, while as you can see there, the NASDAQ and the S&amp;P posting gains. So those are the markets. These are the main events: US officials say Ukraine hit a Russian weapons arsenal with American made missiles. The first time Ukraine has used longer range weapons across the border. Donald Trump is joining Elon Musk in Texas for today's SpaceX launch. And a conceptual artwork featuring a banana and duct tape could fetch up to $1.5 million at auction this week. Live from New York. It is Tuesday, November 19th. I am Erica Hill, in for Richard Quest. This is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. Good evening from New York. Ukraine has fired longer range US missiles into Russia just two days after President Biden lifted restrictions on their use. Moscow says Ukraine fired the missiles into the Bryansk Region. US officials say Kyiv used them to strike a weapons arsenal. In apparent response, Vladimir Putin updated Russia's Nuclear Doctrine. The Kremlin says Russia now has the right to use nuclear weapons in response to conventional attacks. All of this coming as we mark 1,000 days now since Russia launched its full scale invasion of Ukraine. US officials say they were unsurprised that Putin changed Russia's Nuclear Doctrine. They say Moscow had signaled the move for weeks. Fred Pleitgen reports now on the shift and how Russian citizens are reacting. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Ukraine not wasting any time striking deep into Russian territory using US supplied ATACMS surface-to-surface missiles only days after getting the go ahead from the Biden administration, the US confirms. Ukraine's president coy when asked about the strikes. \"We now have ATACMS and we will use them,\" he said. Moscow up in arms claiming Ukraine targeted military installations in Southwestern Russia overnight. The foreign minister ripping into the Biden administration. (SERGEY LAVROV speaking in foreign language.) PLEITGEN (voice over): \"The fact that ATACMS were used repeatedly tonight in the Bryansk Region is, of course, a signal that they want escalation and it is impossible to use these high tech missiles without the Americans and Putin has spoken about this many times.\" And now Putin has reacted. Breaking news on Kremlin controlled-TV after the Russian president signed an order changing the country's nuclear doctrine. The use of western missiles for strikes into the strategic depths of Russia means direct involvement of NATO in the war, the host says, and now Moscow's hands are untied. Among the changes, the Russians now consider attacks by non-nuclear nations like Ukraine with the help of nuclear nations, like the US, worthy of a nuclear response, at least on paper. PLEITGEN (on camera): The spokesman for the Kremlin says the reason why the Russians decided to update their Nuclear Doctrine is so potential adversaries of Russia know that retaliation will be inevitable if Russia is attacked.

What we had expected to see and we appear to be seeing, is the possible escalation, as both sides seek to take as much territory as they can ahead of possible peace negotiations which are inevitably ahead given President- elect Donald Trump's views on the matter. For Europeans, that, of course, has caused a great deal of alarm. There are concerns in the European continent about what the negotiated peace will look like. The question for many European countries now whether they will follow the American lead and allowing their long range missiles to be used by Kyiv in those precious weeks that remain of 2024. We heard from President Zelenskyy today, speaking to European lawmakers, describing himself, 2025 as he believe the year for peace. He also, apparently aware of these imperatives that are likely to bring everyone around a negotiating table. As to the long range missiles, London and Paris, the United Kingdom and France have signaled that they could follow suit. Berlin very determined that it will not. But certainly a lot of anxiety that's also been caused by what we heard today from European leaders. More acts of sabotage, they believe, carried out by Russia involving subterranean internet cables that have impacted a bunch of countries over the course of the day. The United States had been warning that there would be increased pressure from Russia for all the reasons I just described in the next few weeks that appears to be happening. It is not new here in the European continent. There have been such acts of sabotage before. There have been efforts on the part of Russia, it is believed, by European leaders to cause trouble, to add to tension and that is likely to increase as well. All eyes very much now on what the actual response from Moscow will be to these launches of these ATACMS. Moscow says that five of them were taken down, only one made it through and certainly what we expect is more pressure from North Korean troops, of which President Zelenskyy says there are now 100,000 inside that Kursk Region where the Ukrainians have managed to hold those positions for so many weeks now. What is expected by Kyiv and the backers -- its western backers, is that there should be fresh pressure on that front as Russia and its North Korean ally seek to retake the ground that they lost, pushing Ukrainian forces back within the borders of their own country.",

Ukraine's economy, of course, facing major long term challenges at this point. And keep in mind, part of that involves people, 3.7 million, as you see displaced inside the country as of August, some 6.7 million refugees seeking safety beyond Ukraine's borders and that upheaval of course, could impact rebuilding efforts. Oleg Ustenko is the former economic adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and joins me from Kyiv at this hour. It is good to have you here.

First of all, it is extremely important to make sure that the funds will be available for Ukraine at a certain time. It is not like, you know you can get an agreement, you can have this agreement and then you are waiting for these funds for a longer period of time compared with what you were expecting. It is really necessary to make sure that the funds are available for the country at a certain date. Otherwise, you are not able to manage your public finance. So from this point of view, I see certain risks. Also, I see certain risk in terms of the level of this financing because as far as we know, IMF is going to provide next year roughly around $2 billion. We have an agreement with the EU that is going to be 12.5 billion euro from them, but the deficit is on the level of 40 billion. And here, we have open questions in terms of financing, which will be available for Ukraine from the side of the United States of America. And that's why from this point of view, I think that it is critically important eventually to make a decision in terms of in the frozen Russian assets and using only profit out of these assets, but to use these assets per se in order to finance Ukraine under these, you know terrible scenario of war, which we are experiencing now.",

You see of course, the President-elect Donald Trump there with Elon Musk therein Brownsville, Texas for a planned launch of SpaceX's Starship. Musk of course, the CEO of SpaceX, now also a strong ally to the president. That launch expected in the next hour. We are going to continue to monitor that for you. Also, take a closer look at what this means, not just the relationship that Musk's company, SpaceX has with the US at this point, but his influence on the president, some of his top picks, including just announcing Commerce Secretary, his pick for Commerce Secretary today, Howard Lutnick, who has been co-chairing the transition for the former president, now president- elect, all of that still ahead. We also just learned a few moments ago that Donald Trump has picked Dr. Mehmet Oz to serve as the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. If confirmed by the Senate, the well-known TV personality would oversee those two programs along with the Children's Insurance Program and the Affordable Care Act Insurance Marketplace. Trump, of course backed Oz during his unsuccessful 2022 bid for a seat on the US Senate. Donald Trump, it turns out, is getting a temporary reprieve in the hush money case against him. The Manhattan District Attorney's Office has agreed to postpone sentencing in the case, it had been scheduled for next week. In a letter to the judge, though, the DA's Office said the felony conviction against the now president-elect should stand, but acknowledged he was unlikely to face punishment until after the end of his upcoming presidential term. Zachary Cohen joins me now. So we are still waiting to hear from the judge on this. But they also said, oh, sure, you could just post a sentencing until he is done with his term, 2029.

And look, the Manhattan DA's Office has the only case that actually went to trial and these prosecutors are the only ones to secure a conviction of Donald Trump. Donald Trump's team is really claiming victory. They actually called this a total and a complete victory today in a statement reacting to the DA's agreement, but as you mentioned, the judge still has to weigh in and formally issue an order postponing that sentencing. But look, this case is not going away. As you mentioned, over the next four years, we are going to see Donald Trump's team repeatedly try to get this case dismissed. And then also undoubtedly try to appeal any verdict that doesn't go in their favor. That's what the prosecutors in this case are really anticipating, and why they are okay with pushing sentencing, even if it takes four years for that day to eventually come.",

The defendants, the judges ruled if their scheme had been carried out to the end, the adverse consequences would have been no less serious than, \"overthrowing the government.\" Now the defendants, they organized an unofficial primary election back in 2020 to prepare candidates to compete in elections for the city legislature and that is essentially their crime, their plot, that they were convicted of. This has all but killed off the once vibrant pro-democracy movement that thrived in this city until a crackdown that began four to five years ago with the imposition of a controversial national security law, part of a broader crackdown that has killed off independent newspapers in the city and the protests and demonstrations that were once tolerated and in fact allowed to participate in the streets of this city. Outside the courtroom on Tuesday, a single woman tried to hold up a protest sign, and she was quickly carried away by police to a police van, that is symbolic of how dramatic the shift in political culture has been over the last four to five years. Critics of the crackdown and of the sentencing include human rights groups as well as the US Consulate here, which has condemned the sentencing and added a statement: \"We call on China and the Hong Kong authorities to cease politically motivated prosecutions of Hong Kong citizens and to immediately release all political prisoners.\" The Hong Kong government and the Chinese National government have rejected this kind of criticism, arguing that this is meddling in Hong Kong's internal affairs. They contest that this court case has helped bring back stability to Hong Kong, which went through nearly a year of anti-government protests in 2019 that had grown increasingly violent.

About an hour ago, Mr. Trump picked Howard Lutnick, the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, as his Commerce Secretary. Lutnick had been serving as well as co-chair of Trump's transition team and was angling, of course, for the role of Treasury Secretary. Musk had thrown some weight behind that idea.

So we are looking at this, I mean, this is a huge deal. I believe it was October 13th, the last time we saw this SpaceX activity.

How concerning is that to you, given these numbers, some 13 percent of workers in manufacturing are in fact undocumented immigrants?",

I think that perhaps that is.you know that is a rare case, but having said that, obviously issue is where do we find the workers to be able to grow the manufacturing sector in the United States. Today we have almost a half a million unfilled jobs in manufacturing, a half a million. And we're not were not cranking folks out of the trade schools and the technical colleges that we really need to do. That was something I worked on with the first Trump administration. Ivanka Trump headed up the workforce policy commission for the administration. And our hope is that that will be a focus to train more young people in, you know, get them in the career path for manufacturing jobs in the future.",

I mean we're having Donald -- we know Donald Trump is calling senators directly as he's trying to build his case for Gaetz to be his attorney general nominee. And Gaetz is starting to make the rounds himself. He met with a group of House Republicans last night where he talked about this ethics report and started to downplay it according to sources in the room. And we know that Republicans on the House Ethics Committee are weighing what to do here. And sources tell us that they're also looking at ways to potentially delay or suppress this report from ever coming out. The ethics panel is supposed to meet tomorrow. We are waiting to see if that meeting happens because Republicans have already delayed this meeting once. And then you also have House Speaker Mike Johnson, who's saying publicly that this report should not see the light of day. So while this effort to keep this report from coming out is underway, there are also a number of Republican senators who are saying, we need to see this report. It's a huge part of the confirmation process. Senator Chuck Grassley, who's going to be leading the Judiciary Committee in the next Congress, said the report should come out. It will help speed up Gaetz's confirmation process. You had, meanwhile, 100 Democrats in the House sending a letter to the committee, pushing them to release the report. So the pressure campaign on all sides is mounting and all eyes are on this ethics committee which is really a black box. No one knows what they're going to do.",

Taking a closer look at some of the business headlines for today. Walmart stock hitting an all-time high, closing around 8660. That's just off its high. Walmart raised its annual forecast when it reported earnings earlier today. And that is basically the cherry on top for Walmart's more than 60 percent stock jump so far this year. Take a look at that. The store chain says it has gained more market share from higher end customers, but it did warn tariffs could lead to higher costs, which of course will be passed on to customers. Nathaniel Meyersohn is covering all of this from New York. So overall a very strong earnings report with a little bit of caution. Walk us through what we heard.",

Youknow, five, 10 years ago people were counting out wondering, how is Walmart going to respond to the rise of Amazon and online shopping, and Walmart, quite frankly, has never been in a stronger position. I think what's so remarkable about what the company has been able to do is that they've added online shopping to this really strong in-store business that they have. They've added -- you know, their strength right now, Erica, is in groceries. They're the largest grocery seller in in the country. But then they've added clothing, electronics, home goods, and really been able to kind of mix this assortment and get customers from all income demographics. Typically, Walmart's shoppers have been lower income, but they've been really strong the past few quarters and past few years with higher income customers, customers making more than $100,000 a year. Typically Amazon's base. So Walmart, it's cutting into Amazon's base and it's expanding it online in store. So just really strong performance right now from Walmart.",

What is going to be the impact of president --incoming President Trump's tariffs on the industry? I think you'll have some companies like Walmart. We also heard Lowe's today. Big companies are going to be able to handle increased tariffs. Now they're going to have to pass on some of those costs to consumers. So customers will be paying higher prices, particularly for imported goods from China. But you know, Walmart has the size and the scale and the buying power to be able to drive down costs from suppliers and kind of diversify its supply chain but, Erica, the big challenge is going to be for smaller companies, for mom and pops, for independent stores that just don't have the scale of a Walmart or an Amazon or a Costco to be able to kind of leverage its supply chain. So the big impact is going to be from tariffs is going to be on certainly consumers, but also smaller businesses that just cannot compete in a type of environment. And those are the companies of course that have been squeezed, you know, the past several years and even decades from the rise of the big box chains and Amazon.",
