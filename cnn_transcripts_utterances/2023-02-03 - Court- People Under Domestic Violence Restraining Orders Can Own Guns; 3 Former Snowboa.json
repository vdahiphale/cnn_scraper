      "sentences": "It's worth noting this appeals court is one of the most conservative appeals courts in the country. And that's, in part, because of President Donald Trump's appointees.But as you say, the court invalidated this federal law that says that a person who is under a restraining order for domestic violence is prohibited from owning or possessing a firearm. And what is critical about this appeals court decision, it was rooted in a Supreme Court landmark decision that came down last term. In that decision, the justices changed the framework that lower courts across the country can use now when they are looking at or reviewing these gun laws. Going forward now, they have to look at the gun law and see if it was rooted in American history or America's tradition. And basically, here, the appeals court looked at it and said the government didn't prove that. So they invalidated it. It triggered a sharp response last night from Attorney General Merrick Garland. He said, in part, \"Nearly 30 years ago, congress determined that a person who is subject to a court order that restrains him or her from threatening an intimate partner or child cannot lawfully possess a firearm.\" \"Whether analyzed through the lens of the Supreme Court precedence or the text and history of the Second Amendment, that statute is constitutional.\" Now he has a couple of options. Garland can appeal this to a bigger panel of judges on the Fifth Circuit. But that court is already so conservative, he might have better luck going straight to the Supreme Court. That puts the justices in this interesting quandary. Because right now, as you said, not only are numbers for domestic violence skyrocketing across the country but also lower courts are really invalidating a lot of different kinds of gun restrictions because of that Supreme Court opinion. So now, the justices, who usually like to have an issue percolate for years before they take it up again, this might force their hand to once again get involved and take up another Second Amendment case. So it's a really interesting development.",

Here we go again.We're talking about athletes abused while they're competing, while they're representing the country. In this case, these stories go back to the '90s. These three athletes all exemplary Americans, one being an Olympic medal. All three of them were competing in the '90s in the early part of this century. These stories go back a long way. Their allegations incredibly troubling. Peter Foley, the coach, is now gone. He denied all this. But is banned right now temporarily by the U.S. Center for Safe Sport, which is investigating. All this came to light a year ago. ESPN's reporting, among others. It's one of those stories that happened a long time. People wonder, why didn't they speak out then? The power dynamic, you're competing for your country, you don't want to say anything and risk losing your Olympic spot. Just like gymnastics. Now we're hearing from these women. And now they're, of course, suing. And it's the next step in a very troubling story.",

BRENNAN: Well, that's it, Kasie, is that when you've got young people, and parents are invested and they want their kids to be the winning lottery ticket, get the scholarship, go to the Olympics, at what cost? That's what we're starting to hear. The good news, if there is good news in this horrible, appalling situation, we are hearing from the women now. They found their voice. We're with in the \"Me Too\" movement and that era is here. We're looking back in time. They couldn't speak out then. We want to make sure, in all cases, young men and women, the power dynamic being so difficult for them, that dream of an Olympic medal or making a team is so strong, that they're being told that they can speak out now and that they can get answers. And we saw that with the U.S. soccer story, again, a few years ago. But those women are speaking out now. Again and again, these sports that Americans cheer for, we're finding out about this netherworld, this deep underbelly that is just appalling.
