And as a result of that, letting him out on bail presented too much of a risk to the United States. He said the following, he said, \"Records show a profound breach of the defendant's word that he would protect information and the security of the United States.\"The judge in this case, David Hennessy, also went on to talk about who this defendant had hurt by releasing those troves of classified documents online, saying, \"Who did he put at risk? You can make a list as long as a phone book, soldiers, medical personnel, Ukrainian personnel, Ukrainian soldiers. We don't know how many people he put at risk.\" He went on to say, \"The government has said if you disclose this information, you put the United States at serious risk. And the defendant's response was, I don't give a\" expletive. You can fill in the blank there.

He's got roots in the community. He's got a mom and dad who love him, who live in the neighborhood, they're going to watch him at home. He would wear ankle monitor. They would be responsible for him. He's actually not a bad case for bail, as Magistrate Hennessy said, but we all know the story of Edward Snowden, who you know, when he had the chance to escape, escaped to a hostile foreign power, Russia, with all the secrets he had and those in his head, which all could be shared with them.

We are falling short and so that means that they need to get people on board faster than maybe a more rigorous review will allow. So you just have that tension between recruitment and then, of course, radicalization. But I will say, looking at this case, and in many of these cases, this is a, you know, command staff problem. You know, one mistake maybe I'm just looking at the wrong stuff. Two reprimands, as we know he's already had, is something weird is going on with this guy.

And for anyone who doesn't know, the Proud Boys are a self-professed Western chauvinist group and Lamond is a 24-year veteran of the police, and as you noted at the time, he was head of the intelligence division of the police department. And according to this indictment, Lamond was in touch with Tarrio, dating all the way back to July 2019, sharing information with him about law enforcement activities related to the Proud Boys and even about Tarrio himself. They communicated approximately 500 times.Now, in December 2020, shortly after the 2020 election, Tarrio stole and burned a Black Lives Matter flag from a church. Now, he was eventually arrested and charged with that offense. But this indictment reveals that Lamond was sharing information about that ongoing investigation with Tarrio as it was happening, including apparently tipping him off about his imminent arrest. Now, after January 6, the two continued communicating and according to this indictment, he would text him, for example, Lamond said, quote, \"How are you holding up? I checked on your charges and the possession of high-capacity mags is a felony.\" That went on January 7. Later that day, Tarrio texted him saying, \"Hey, I have someone you guys might be looking for. She had Maryland police go to her house yesterday. She thinks they came because of capital stuff.\" \"Copy? Not that I'm aware offhand, but I will check. I know you are working on identifying a number of people.\" \"Let me know if she's on your list, I'll have her turn herself in.\" Later, Tarrio, he wrote Tarrio and said, \"Nope. Not on our list.\" But obviously didn't ask who it was or follow up to get any additional information about how this person could have been involved. Now, again, this is pretty incredible. I mean, this is a law enforcement official sharing this with someone who has been at that point, arrested and charged for another offense and then is involved in one of the most high-profile criminal investigations in the country. Now, Lamont has been charged with one count of obstruction of justice and three counts of making false statements because eventually, Jake, when he was asked about all this by investigators, he misled them.",

Another questions I have are why was he suggesting to Tarrio to switch to encrypted apps rather than continue the exchange on a platform that would allow for the documentation of those communications?

Because what he's charged with is actually, as far as I know, not tipping off Enrique Tarrio, he's charged with obstruction of justice and lying to investigators, three counts of lying. So, wouldn't investigators, wouldn't people in the FBI or the Justice Department be sophisticated enough to know if this is, in fact, him doing what you're giving him the benefit of the doubt, theoretically, if you're saying it's a possibility, if he's just doing that, why not just say that to investigators who certainly understand the idea of building trust with bad guys?",

But it also sort of indicates that his endorsement was more transactional as opposed to ideological. But if he can do that, good for South Carolina.",

Iran state news media says three men who took part in the country's recent protests were executed today. Amnesty International says their convictions were rushed and based on confessions obtained through torture also very, very easy to believe. Iran claims that these three men who were executed took part in a deadly attack on security guards during last year's nationwide protests.Iran has spent months stamping out protests. Protest over the death of Mahsa Jina Amini, a young woman who died in the custody of the so called morality police after being picked up for not wearing her headscarf correctly. Also in our World Lead, a jarring contrast at today's Arab League summit in Saudi Arabia. Even though they welcomed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Arab League, 22 Arab countries in the Middle East and Africa also welcomed back into their bosom, brutal, ruthless dictator Bashar al-Assad of Syria, who has been an unwelcome global pariah since Assad began slaughtering his own people in 2011. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh spoke with Syrian refugees who are, frankly, just sick and discouraged by the Arab League's attempt to normalize a man that they see as a monster. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Assad or we burn the country, vowed his supporters, and the country burned. It was a regime's existential battle where no holds were barred, hundreds of thousands of lives lost, maybe many more. And millions forced into a miserable existence far from home, victims of a civil war. Their pain was the world's to see atrocities so shocking, yet the world did little. Twelve years on Assad still denies attacking civilians and claims he was fighting terrorism. Now the ruthless president who unleashed hell on his people with the help of his ally Russia, is not only a free man, he's now welcomed in some world capitals with red carpets and handshakes. WAFA MOSTAFA, SYRIAN ACTIVIST/FATHER MISSING IN SYRIA: This is about the man who is responsible for the pain and for the suffering that I've been going through in the past 10 years. KARADSHEH (voice-over): Wafa Mostafa counts the days since she last saw her father, more than 3,600 days of searching, waiting, campaigning. Ali Mustafa vanished into the black hole of the regime's prison system. One of more than 130,000 forcibly disappeared by the regime.",

Those who survived his brutal battle for survival now face a new Middle East, a new reality, where they fear they may be forced back to the horrors of Assad's regime. NABIL AL OTHMAN, SYRIAN ACTIVIST/REFUGEE IN TURKEY (through translator): It's a monstrous regime in every sense of the word. I'm from Idlib where he used chemical weapons and banned weaponry against us. KARADSHEH (voice-over): Twenty-seven-year-old Nabil Al Othman is a former rebel, now an activist. Like millions of other Syrians, he found safety in Turkey. But with anti-immigrant sentiments on the rise and the fate of Syrian refugees now at the heart of the country's political debate, Syrians feel their safe space is shrinking. AL OTHMAN (through translator): Even if the whole world normalizes this regime, Syrians will never trust it. For me, going back to this monstrous criminal is impossible. If I return, I'll be sent straight to jail, torture, and to my death. KARADSHEH (voice-over): For more than a decade, they begged the world to end their nightmare, but they were left to face it all alone, and now face a world where their oppressor got away with it.",
