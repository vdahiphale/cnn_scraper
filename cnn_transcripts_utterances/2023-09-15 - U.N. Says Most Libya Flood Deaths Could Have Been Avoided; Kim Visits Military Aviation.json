It's 7:00 am in eastern Libya, where authorities are demanding an investigation into this week's catastrophic flooding, which killed more than 5,000 people. The U.N. says most of the deaths could have been avoided with proper warnings and evacuations. The mayor of the hardest hit city your Derna said the death toll could eventually reach 20,000. Aid group say a seven meter wave swept through the city went to downs collapsed, washing away everything in its path that they discharged.

It was like a nightmare. I don't know how to describe it. The water went up to the second floor then to the third floor. I went up to the roof. My neighbors screaming and asking for help. I went down to help them and I saw one of my neighbors dead and being taken by the flood. I took the kids up and went back up again. The building fence was destroyed.

And we can argue whether President Biden's eventual release of the F- 16 fighter planes, had that happened earlier, that the air cover would've been there to allow the Ukrainians to make greater progress. But that aircraft don't look as if they're going to be available until next year at the earliest.

And going through those things is tough going, and we've all seen that in our television screens -- multiple concrete emplacements, multiple minefields, multiple tank ditches and so on and so forth. And to bridge that depth, up to 30 kilometers of defenses, to breach that in the face of enemy resistance is a major undertaking, which would be challenging for any western army, including the U.S., the U.K. and France, and Germany.

She fears reprisals from Russia for speaking to the media and asked us not to show her face and use a pseudonym. \"He has seen what you see in a war,\" she says. He said he has seen the wounded, at the hospitals people arrive missing arms and legs. He isn't used to seeing that. But Cubans traveling to Russia are running a risk back home. Cuban prosecutors said in September that police had arrested 17 people for alleged human trafficking and planning to fight as mercenaries for Russia. In Santa Clara, this Cuban father tells me he hasn't heard from one of his son since he left for Russia over a month ago. Another son contacted by shadowy online recruiters was arrested by Cuban police in September on suspicions he was also about to fly to Russia. He was deceived, he says. I hope they take that into account and evaluate that because like him, there are many more. Cuba has not accused its ally Russia of being directly involved. It is not clear who these recruiters work for. Russia's ministry of defense did not respond to CNN's request for comment on allegations that Russia is using Cuban mercenaries to fight in Ukraine. But families of Cuban recruits tells CNN hundreds more were enticed by promises of high payouts and fast-tracked Russian citizenship into taking up arms in a war on the other side of the world. Small cities and towns on Cuba's economically hard-hit provinces have proven to be fertile recruiting grounds for Russia's war in Ukraine. A Cuban soldier fighting the war there can make more in a month than a doctor makes here in an entire year. But the families of the Cuban soldiers tell us they're not only worried about the relatives getting out of the war alive, but what charges they could face if they return home. A week after news of the arrest, an apparent reversal, perhaps indicative of the enormous influence Russia still wields in Cuba. Havana's ambassador to Russia now saying that Cubans have to first sign a contract to quote, legally take part in its operations with the Russian army. It's unclear where that leaves Cubans already on the battlefield or those who want to return home. This mother says her son's fate may already be sealed. He said \"Mama, I'm on the front line in Ukraine.\" He's there, where it's dangerous, she says. They're there to shield the Russian troops. They are cannon fodder. Instead of improving their lives, the fate of the Cuban recruits now appears to be tied to the evermore bloody struggle for Ukraine. Patrick Oppmann, CNN -- Santa Clara, Cuba. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Both then fell apart under a federal judge's scrutiny. And after failing to work out a new arrangement, U.S. attorney David Weiss, a Trump appointee, asked to be elevated to special counsel status resulting in the charges announced Thursday. Hunter Biden's attorney Abby Lowell, slammed the indictment saying \"The evidence in this matter has not changed but the law has and so has MAGA Republicans improper and partisan interference in this process. Hunter Biden possessing an unloaded gun for 11 days was not a threat to public safety.
