And at that cemetery yesterday, they were calling out for recruitment for the IRA. Now the police went in there earlier today and said they found a suspicious device. But by the nature, that they're in this cemetery that's very close to this community, it is a potential recipe for more confrontation with youths and the police. But that is ongoing. The president won't see any of that. These sorts of police operations in Derry are not unusual. The police have -- or rather the government's raised their  terror threat level because they're afraid that this particular organization is trying to draw them into a confrontation for what they call a spectacular. This group would like nothing better than to let off a big explosion or come into confrontation with the police while President Biden is here. So the police are very aware of that. The security operation here in Belfast very big; an additional 300 police officers brought over from mainland U.K. But the president here arriving late, meet with -- will meet with prime minister Rishi Sunak. Tomorrow, a ribbon cutting ceremony at a Belfast university here in the center of Belfast. And we can expect the president to speak about the economic opportunities for Northern Ireland.",

The Pentagon has set up an interagency effort to look into how this leak is potentiallygoing to damage U.S. national security, including whether any sensitive sources and methods have been compromised as a result of this leak of classified documents, which have been online for at least a month. There do appear to be dozens and dozens of these documents. And the Pentagon still doesn't know at this point just how many documents there actually are, kind of floating out there on the internet. They have not managed to tell us whether they have actually contained the leak at this point or if there are more documents out there that they just don't know about. So that is also going to be a part of the Pentagon investigation that is going to be coordinated across the entire government. So multiple different agencies, along with the Pentagon, will be looking at the impact that this leak, this disclosure, this unauthorized breach has had on U.S. national security. In addition to that the Pentagon is going to be reviewing who gets this information right. So whether or not and everyone who receives these kinds of classified daily updates  are actually supposed to be receiving them, whether these distribution lists should actually be smaller and, of course, looking at who could have had access to these documents. The Justice Department, meanwhile, is focusing on a criminal investigation, which is going to be centered around who leaked this information, because, of course, whoever leaked it is likely in a world of trouble, because these documents are so highly classified as Oren laid out in his piece there. Some of them are actually top secret, which is among the highest classification levels that the U.S. government has. So the Justice Department, Pentagon investigations are separate but complementary. And of course, it could take months. We are told before the Pentagon really has a good idea of just how damaging this leak could be, not only to U.S. national security but also to the national security of our allies, many of whom have classified and sensitive information included in a lot of these documents that have been leaked online -- Becky.",

O'SULLIVAN:  Yes, I mean, look, some of the cousins that we spoke to there, they may be relatively distant cousins but he does have a genuine connection with them. You know, many of them have been going to the White House; they were there recently for St. Patrick's Day. And they seem to have that genuine connection with him. Of course, obviously, before he does go south of the border here, he will be here in Belfast to -- on the anniversary of the Good Friday agreement, which is, you know, a celebration of the peace accords here. But also it is quite still an uneasy peace. And things have not quite settled here. And of course, the power sharing government that was set up under that agreement is not functioning at the moment. So you know, touching on some serious issues here. But I think once he goes to the Republic of Ireland, it's very much going to become a very personal trip for him.",
