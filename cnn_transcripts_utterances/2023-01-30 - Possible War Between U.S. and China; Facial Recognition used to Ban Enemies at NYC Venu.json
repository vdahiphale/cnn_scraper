MICHAEL MCCAUL (R-TX): I hope he's wrong, as well. I think he's right, though. We have to be prepared for this. And it could happen, I think, as long as Biden is in office, projecting weakness, as he did with Afghanistan, that led to Putin invading Ukraine, that the odds are very high we could see a conflict with China and Taiwan and the Indo- Pacific.

I think just, first, the obvious question is, what did you make of that memo when you saw it? MAJ. GEN. DANA PITTARD, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, good morning, Kaitlan. What I thought of that memo from General Minihan, and his candor throughout the military is well known, is that it was really designed for his subordinate commanders and the men and women in his command. As any good commander, he's got to prepare for war. He's got to make sure that his command is prepared. I think the last thing he wanted was for a memo like that to get out and go viral. But I think it was really about preparation. COLLINS: Preparation, sure, but putting this blunt warning in a memo that, of course, as you noted, is now out there. It was something certainly that could be. He was also, you know, pretty blunt, telling them to get their personal affairs no order, making these comments about this. We've seen some Democrats disagree with this. Adam Smith, who's on the Armed Services Committee, said, not only is war with China not inevitable, he said he doesn't think it's likely.",

And all potential adversaries are certainly on the table, especially China. And so we must be prepared. Is war imminent for 2025? Well, I think the senior leadership of the Department of Defense would probably disagree. Because if war was imminent, there would be things that we would be doing to specifically prepare for that if it was 2025. So, I think in some ways he's gotten ahead of his skis a little bit on that, but he's trying to motivate and preparing his supporting command. Again, he is not a combatant commander. What his command does, air mobility command, is fly in troops, equipment, ammunition, and things like that. He's a supporting commander.",

And I think that that is not right.What you have to begin to look at is, if the overwhelming number of victims of police abuse are black in Memphis, as they are, and disproportionate, as they are, then racial bias is a factor. And how could that possibly be? It's because the culture of policing. There are certain neighborhoods where there -- they are - it's a warrior mentality. This is a war (ph) zone. You've got to do what you've got to do. You've got to jump out. And in other neighborhoods, the same police department treats with a servant mentality, with a protector mentality. And if those two mind- sets line up with, this is a poor black community, we're in a war zone, we're going to be warriors, we're going to do whatever we've got to do, and the affluent white communities, we're going to protect people, then you wind up with racial profiling, racial violence, even when the cops are black.",

But we're kind of looking at it the same way.Listen, this is only a discussion at a high level. At the community level, people know. Cops, a lot of times they're not black, they're blue. They're often trying to show and prove to other white officers that they can be just as tuff and just as brutal, or even more brutal than the white cops. Ice Cube talked about that in a very famous hip hop song, which I can't quote the name of it, but he says, don't let it be a white and a black cop because they'll slam you down to the street top, black police showing out for the white cop. James Baldwin talked about this phenomenon of black police officers actually being more brutal than the white cops. So, the idea that some people had, well, if you integrate the police force, if you have a bunch of black police, everybody's going to be safe. Black faces in high places don't make you safe if there are not checks and balances and systems of accountability. Any system without checks and balances will tend toward corruption and abuse. That's why you have meat inspectors, not because we hate butchers. That's why you have building inspectors, not because you hate construction workers, but because if you don't have adequate oversight and everybody in the department knows in that neighborhood you can do whatever you want, people will begin to act terribly. And all too often, even with majority black departments, it's the black communities where unlawful police violence takes place. There is no accountability, there is no punishment and it gets worse and worse and worse. Thankfully, in Memphis, this police chief has stepped up.

People -- these messages that black people are violent, black people are unworthy, black people are suspect, they hit everybody. It's not just, you know, a few white guys listening to this, it's pervasive. And so all too often -- all too often even a black store owner might see a black kid come in and be suspicious, see a white kid come in and be solicitous, and not even realize that he or she is playing out these same racial stereotypes that they otherwise would oppose. It's not as simple. It's the race of the victim you have to track. If you have an overwhelming number of black victims, you have a problem with racism, even if there are black cops doing it.
