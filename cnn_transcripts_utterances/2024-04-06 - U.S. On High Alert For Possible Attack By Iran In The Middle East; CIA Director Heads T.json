And we're following new developments in the crisis in the Middle East. CNN learned a short time ago that House Republicans plan to hold a vote next week on a pro-Israel resolution that would oppose calls for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, the very thing the Biden administration has been working toward. The symbolic vote will put Republicans at odds with not just the White House, but much of the world. And it will come one week after an Israeli strike killed seven aid workers in Gaza, including a dual U.S. citizen and at a time when the U.S. is on high alert. A senior Biden administration official tells CNN the U.S. is actively preparing for significant attack by Iran on U.S. and Israeli targets in the Middle East as soon as next week. Meantime, Iran blames Israel for an airstrike in Syria this week that killed at least seven Iranian officials, including two top military commanders. Priscilla Alvarez is at the White House for us and Nic Robertson is at the Israel-Gaza border. Priscilla, you first. U.S. officials believe an attack is inevitable. What is the administration preparing for?",

And to be clear, this could be targeting Israeli and U.S. assets in the region, but all the same, U.S. and Israeli governments in close touch over what they see as an inevitable attack, retaliation by Iran after an Israeli airstrike that killed several Iranian commanders.Now at the time, Iran vowed revenge and in an exchange, the U.S. made clear they did not know about the airstrike ahead of time nor were they involved. In fact, they warned Iran not to use this airstrike as a pretext to attack U.S. personnel and facilities. But this is expected perhaps as soon as next week, though it's still unclear when it would happen or what it might look like, but it was a key topic of discussion between President Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during their phone call earlier this week. And we should also note that one of the concerns here in the worst- case scenarios would be a direct strike by Iran on Israel because that could spark a broader regional conflict. That is something that the White House has wanted to avoid and warned against. And so that is what they are watching very closely as they prepare for this potential attack by Iran in the region. Again, the big concern here is that if it is to happen in the way it could happen could spark that broader regional conflict that up until this point, the United States has been trying to avoid -- Fred.",

But at the same time, he just delivered to Bibi Netanyahu on justabout the six-month anniversary of the attack the harshest message I think I have seen an American president give an Israeli prime minister, which is basically Israel's conduct of the war has to change or the United States will reconsider its policy. And by that it means conditioning that arms aid. So you've got a lot of moving parts.
