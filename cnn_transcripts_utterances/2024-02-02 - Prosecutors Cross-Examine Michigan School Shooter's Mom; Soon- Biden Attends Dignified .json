And one time it was about something actually that didn't have any significance to Ethan. And so they're really focusing in on that.But one thing, they're going to try to show that she's a liar. And those four phones, when they were in the industrial building, that were the tracking phones that they had gotten because their own cell phones were taken away. What we've heard is that they were turned off. But she testified yesterday they had their alarm set for 6:00 a.m. Saturday morning because they were going to go turn themselves in. And he made her admit, I believe, just minutes ago, that the cell phones were turned off. But she testified the alarm was set for 6:00 a.m., so trying to catch her in lies that she's not being honest in the stand.",

I, you know, I would have spent a lot more time as the prosecutor. This was the prosecution team's opportunity to make sure that jury does not like her because of the deceit, because of the lack of parenting, because of everything that she didn't do that they want to say she should have done. It almost seemed like he just stopped without having another question. And look, just tactically, you always had on a crescendo. The idea of you could have been with him this day just didn't really fall very well in the jury. You really want to hit that last thing, you know, that recency and primacy that we talk about, that jurors carry. And quite honestly, I thought it fell flat. Generally speaking, the prosecution done a good job, but this was their opportunity to really sink home the fact that this lady is such a bad parent, not only bad parenting, but so bad that she should be held criminally responsible.

But really for President Biden, this is the most somber and solemn of duties he has as commander-in-chief, as he will be on hand for the dignified transfer of their remains. Now President Biden and First Lady Jill Biden are making their way to Dover, Delaware right now and he will spend, according to his schedule, a little over an hour with the families of those three service members Sergeant William Rivers, as well as two army specialists, Kennedy Sanders and Breonna Moffett. Both were posthumously promoted to the rank of sergeants. That is something that President Biden himself shared with the family of Kennedy Sanders.In a phone call he made on Tuesday, the president spoke by phone with each of the families of the fallen soldiers, and the White House says that in those conversations, he gauged whether they would want him to be on hand for the dignified transfer, and each of the families said that they would like him to be there. This will be the second time President Biden, in his role as commander in chief, has attended a dignified transfer. You'll remember back in 2021, he was on hand at Dover Air Force Base when those -- the remains of the 13 servicemen and women who were killed in a terrorist attack outside of the gates of the Kabul airport in Afghanistan when they returned during their dignified transfer. That was a moment that was filled with a lot of raw emotion and anger from some of the families who met with President Biden. There were some who weren't even sure if they wanted to meet with the president at that time because they were so frustrated over how that Afghanistan withdrawal had unfolded. But President Biden today will have some time to meet one-on-one with the families, really giving him a chance to hear the stories about their loved ones, hear their concerns. Of course, President Biden has often used these moments to talk about his own experience with grief, talking about the death of his young baby daughter and wife in a car accident, and then also the death of his son, Beau Biden, who had served in Iraq and later had brain cancer, which he ultimately succumbed to when he was back in the United States. So this is also an opportunity for the President to play that role of comforter-in-chief, a role that he has played all too often. But he will have that personal time with these families ahead of the dignified transfer as they are there to mourn the loss of their loved ones.",

And, you know, there's an undeniable political element to all this, right?Jim Jordan is a very close ally to former President Donald Trump. He has used his chairmanship in part as chairman of House Judiciary Committee to pursue investigations that are politically advantageous to Donald Trump.
