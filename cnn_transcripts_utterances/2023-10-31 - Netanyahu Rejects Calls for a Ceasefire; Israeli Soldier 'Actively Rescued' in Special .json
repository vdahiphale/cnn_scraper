In a televised address, the Israeli prime minister said that calls for a ceasefire are calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas, to surrender to terrorists, he said; surrender to barbarism. That will not happen. Netanyahu also drew parallels, as we just heard before, not in Hebrew but in English, parallels to the United States position after Pearl Harbor in 1941 and the September 11th attacks in 2001, implying that, just as the U.S. went after its attackers, Israel also has the right to go after the terrorists who attacked his country on October 7th. This is a time for war, he said. And Netanyahu also addressed the criticism that Israel is inflicting punishment on the Palestinian people by pursuing Hamas, saying the militant Islamic organization is the one preventing civilians from moving to a safe zone, he said -- Poppy, Phil.",

The fact that we know that Israel used special forces on the ground, that they have this intelligence to get her out, does that mean she's the first of what may be many more rescued this way? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, one can certainly hope, Poppy. And good morning to you. But, yes, when it comes to Private Ori Megidish, she was, as you said, actively rescued in a special operation. And what that means is the Israelis went in deliberately looking for her. They had the intelligence that they needed in order to prosecute this target, as we would say in the military. They went into Northern Gaza. Apparently, she was there, based on what we know. The other thing that's interesting about this, Poppy, is this was a joint operation between the Israeli Defense Forces and ISA, or Israeli Security Agency, otherwise known as Shin Bet, which is the domestic intelligence agency for Israel.",

She may have been moved between the 7th of October, when the Hamas attacks occurred and she was captured, to the time that she was reunited with her family and taken, of course, by the IDF and the ISA. So this is one of those areas where it becomes really critical to prepare that battle space and go in and actually find these people, exactly where they are at that moment in time. And that's one of the most difficult tactical intelligence tasks that the Israeli forces have at this point. But it could mean that they can do this again.

So here's the video. You see the car making a turn. And then all of a sudden, there's a blast from the tank that has actually fired at -- at the vehicle. One of the key problems that soldiers have in a situation like this is they don't know who is in that car. And when you see this kind of a situation, a soldier has about a second or less to make a decision as to whether or not they're going to shoot at a vehicle that is perhaps not following orders or they just don't know what it's doing. If the vehicle were approaching at a high rate of speed, it would make it less questionable. In this case, the car is going -- moving very slowly, so there are a lot of questions as to whether or not it posed a threat to the soldiers that were -- that were dealing with this at that moment in time at that junction.",
