Just ahead, Hezbollah's leader will be speaking in two hours after another wave of deadly blasts across Lebanon. First it was exploding pagers, then walkie talkies. What happens next?Closing the gap will have new polling in the U.S. on the presidential race and the battle in swing states. Plus, a new legal loss for Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, why prosecutors claim he is too dangerous to be out of jail before his trial. Just hours from now, Hassan Nasrallah, the Leader of Hezbollah is set to give a speech. It comes as tensions are rising, with Israel launching air strikes on Southern Lebanon overnight and signaling what the Israeli Defense Minister called a new year of war. Lebanon, meanwhile, is reeling after a second day of attacks targeting members of the militant group. Scores of walkie talkies exploded across the country on Wednesday, after hundreds of pagers blew up on Tuesday. Lebanon's health ministry says at least 37 people have been killed in both attacks thousands are injured. The twin attacks are causing panic, fear, confusion and chaos across Lebanon.

And of course, this is causing a great deal of concern among ordinary Lebanese. The Ministry of Transport here, for instance, has banned walkie talkies and pagers from all flights leaving out of Beirut. And the government, the army, has been busy essentially detonating suspicious devices. Just last night, right next to where we are at the American University of Beirut Hospital, the army blew up some suspicious devices, and many people are essentially putting their phones and other communication devices as far away as possible, given the fear that perhaps the third day of these attacks will take place.",

He has not given the impression that Hezbollah wants to have a full-blown war with Israel. It will be very interesting to hear what he says in the coming hours.Because, of course, this is a devastating blow to Hezbollah, the fact that thousands, potentially of their fighters and their reservists have been injured. The fact that they do not really have a communication ability at this point, the pagers have been taken out the walkie talkies, there is a concern and a fear of using any other wireless devices to try and communicate with each other. So, what we will be listening for is whether Nasrallah can actually ease concerns and reassure not just those within Hezbollah, but also those within Lebanon. Because this is an attack on Hezbollah, but it is an attack that has affected the entire country. Civilians who have no affiliation whatsoever with Hezbollah are feeling just as paranoid and fearful as others. So, it will be a very interesting speech to listen to. Hezbollah, obviously has, has said that there will be retribution. There will be a retaliation for what Israel has done. Now CNN has learned that Mossad and the IDF was behind at least Tuesday's attack. Of course, the question is, what would that retaliation look like, Fredricka?",

Now this Zoom is an outgrowth of what was the win with black women's Zoom that happened shortly after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race this summer, that garnered tens of thousands of participants. So, this is going to be piling onto that. And again, the idea here is to have this moment with the vice president, alongside Oprah, and also get these women excited, to get them out to help influence and organize and mobilize voters, because it is also something Democratic strategists often talk about, which is that black women play a really critical role in their communities to get people to come out to vote. So, all of this is an effort to do exactly that. It also comes as part of the broader push that we've seen over the course of the last week by the Harris campaign to focus on voter registration, not only with this live stream event tonight, but also earlier this week with young voters and trying to meet them where they are, online and on college campuses. So clearly, as you mentioned there with the poll, it's a tight race.

I mean, one thing that the judge homed in on was the video that CNN had obtained. It was a hotel surveillance video from 2016 that showed Combs kicking and dragging a woman, one of the women that the prosecutors say was trying to leave the freak off party that is part of these allegations, in this case, the central sex trafficking allegation. And the judge went back to that, pointing to the physical violence on that video, and raising that at multiple points during the hearing. He also highlighted several contacts that prosecutors had told him that Combs had made with witnesses who had received Grand Jury subpoenas. Specifically, there was a witness who was subpoenaed in June and July, and the prosecution said that Combs had reached out to that witness after having not been in touch for years. That was something that the judge highlighted to Combs' his attorney as one of these as the high bar that he would have to achieve. And Combs' lawyers were saying that they would hire a private security firm to be in Combs' Miami home to monitor him. They wouldn't allow Combs access to a cell phone or to the internet. But the judge saying that that was just not enough to ensure that there would not be obstruction activities that would take place because what the prosecution had laid out were multiple points of contacts between Combs and either alleged victims or witnesses in this case. The prosecutor also telling the judge that Combs' influence has made it difficult for witnesses to share their experiences with the government and to trust that the government can keep them safe. So, there was a real concern here about Combs' outreach to witnesses, and that is the main reason why the judge has said that he will be detained. Now Combs' attorney said that they are going to fight this. They are going to appeal. He spoke outside of court to reporters. Take a listen.

I would very, very quickly add that if on October 7th -- you know the Israeli intelligence services looked like Johnny English, better known as Mr. Bean, to many viewers, it very much looks like James Bond now, after these operations.

CNN's Evan Perez explains.EVAN PEREZ, CNN SENIOR U.S. JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: The U.S. government says that Iranian hackers sent unsolicited emails with information that they stole from Donald Trump's presidential campaign to people who were affiliated with Joe Biden's campaign over the summer. There's no indication that the people who received the information replied to the unsolicited emails. And the Kamala Harris campaign says that the campaign itself did not receive any information and that the personal email accounts of campaign staffers were targeted with what looked like spam or phishing campaigns. The latest update from the FBI, the Director of National Intelligence and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, says this is all part of an Iranian effort to try to influence the U.S. Presidential Election. The agency said in a statement on Wednesday that the hackers sent unsolicited emails to individuals that they were then associated with President Biden's campaign that contained an excerpt taken from stolen and non-public material from Former President Trump's campaign as text in those emails. Now the hackers also sent the Trump campaign documents to news organizations. The Trump campaign says that the incident is an indication that Iran is trying to interfere in the election to help Harris. A spokesperson for Harris says that we condemn in the strongest terms any effort by foreign actors to interfere in the U.S. elections, including this unwelcome and unacceptable malicious activity.
