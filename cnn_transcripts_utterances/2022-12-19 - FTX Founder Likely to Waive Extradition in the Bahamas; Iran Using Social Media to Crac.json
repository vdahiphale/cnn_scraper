The same tactic may have been used with Nika's Telegram account. Weeks after her death, two of her friends noticed her account was back online. It disappeared shortly after.POLGLASE (voice-over): Nika's family are still reeling from her death. One close family member told CNN authorities are still refusing to return her phone. The Iranian authorities have not responded to CNN's request for comment. While Meta said they couldn't share specifics on her account, but they confirmed they did not originally disable it. Telegram told CNN in every case they had investigated the device had been confiscated or the user unwittingly made some access possible by not setting a two-step verification password or using a malicious app impersonating Telegram. Still, questions remain as to whether Meta, Telegram and other tech companies are doing all they can to protect their users as the world wakes up to the increasingly tech savvy ways regimes such as Iran are using to monitor and hunt down activists.

This is just one that you found out about and publicized and probably got a quicker reaction from Facebook as a result. But what more have you learned about how they did it?POLGLASE (on camera): Well, I think that it shows just how sophisticated this is now becoming. This is not just what they're currently doing remotely but still using the old fashion methods as well in terms of forcing people in person to hand over their devices -- confiscating devices as well. It just means they're adding more to their playbook effectively in terms of how they may be accessing not only your phone but your social media accounts. And let's not forget that some of these platforms are encrypted. Users feel secure. They feel safe using them, particularly Telegram. It's been widely used by activists throughout Iran during these protests. And so, I think it does call into question whether tech companies are doing all they can and whether they're well I quipped enough given how sophisticated the technological apparatus is that the Iranian government are using.",

      "sentences": "Time is running out as lawmakers race against the clock to try to pass a government funding bill before Friday at midnight. That is when the current funding legislation is set to expire and could trigger a government shutdown here in the United States.However, lawmakers have expressed optimism that they'll be able to bake that deadline and pass a bill before then with them announcing Republican and Democratic appropriators just last week that they have reached a top line number for government funding. $1.7 trillion to fund the United States government, starting December 24th. That was negotiated for weeks. They were not able to reach agreement on domestic spending here in the United States. But now that they reached that top line number, they're just writing the bill text. Which we expect to come out in the next 24 hours. Once that bill text comes out, then starts the whole process to pass the bill here on Capitol Hill. We expect that the Senate to take it up first. There will be some delays as some Republicans, a handful are expected to oppose this bill, but we do expect it to pass. Then go to the House for passage with just a simple majority before it goes to President Joe Biden's desk by Friday for signature. Now, while there still is no bill text, we do not expect a government shutdown should negotiators be able to really meet that deadline, which they have expressed to us time and time again in the last couple of days they will be able to do that and prevent a government shutdown.

      "sentences": "Well, I mean, part of this is that there's been a lot of research on the COVID pandemic and all the other countries around the world. China has succeeded in holding off just uncontrolled spreading of the virus through these very severe lockdowns and quarantine camps that it created over the course of nearly three years now. And it has announced in just the last month that it is doing away with very many of those measures. As omicron has basically burst China's zero-COVID bubble.So now it is going to face the kind of infections and illness that every other country in the world has basically faced. And that's where these projections are coming. The report that you cited coming out from Hong Kong University has yet to be peer reviewed. It's projecting that if China stays with the current status quo, if it doesn't manage to ramp up its vaccination levels or get more anti-viral medication out, that it could face up to 1 million people dying as a result of the illness. Other projections put that even higher at 2 million or lower. But at the end of the day, it's going to be in the hundreds of thousands of people who are likely going to die. The most vulnerable people are senior citizens. And that's where China is at its weakest point right now, where you only have about 42 percent of Chinese people over the age of 80 who have gotten all three necessary doses of the locally- made vaccine to protect them. So that's a huge, very vulnerable portion of the population where you could see those high mortality figures. The other part that is kind of so bewildering, is it was just last month, Max, that the Chinese government was almost talking about a crusade against COVID, where if you were in contact with somebody who had COVID, you could get sent away to a quarantine camp. And now we're getting messages from local governments -- like the central city of Chungking, that, hey, if you're a public sector worker and you've an asymptomatic case of COVID or mild symptoms you can still go to work as usual. So that's a big, sharp U-turn, some serious whiplash for a population that's been told for the better part of three years that COVID is a deadly, deadly disease that should be avoided at all costs -- Max.",

And the people behind me that have taken over the streets, all from Buenos Aries, clearly have no sign, no intention of going back home.It's a moment that Argentina has been waiting for, for more than 36 years. Since the late, great Diego Maradona won it in 1986. And it's a moment that comes at perhaps a very dire time for Argentina. The country is in deep financial trouble, with over 90 percent of annual inflation rate and also, a deep political polarization. But all of these troubles have, frankly, been swept away this Sunday by a triumph of Lionel Messi and his teammates in Qatar, giving back a trophy that have been waiting, and longed for so long. It's also a moment to rejoice for Messi himself, long called the greatest player of his time but actually never winning a World Cup until Sunday when he finally achieved the only trophy that was still missing from his cabinet. And from Buenos Aires, as soon as the penalties were over, people just simply took over the streets. There were signs of celebration and joy. There are thousands of people now really just singing and celebrating together. For CNN, this is Stefano Pozzebon, Buenos Aires. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
