This meeting, coming with the deteriorating situation, of course, on the ground in Gaza. The Hamas-controlled Palestinian health ministry says the death toll in Gaza has surpassed 19,600 people. A doctor in Jabalya in northern Gaza reports another 16 people killed and 70 injured, just in airstrikes today. Another doctor at one of Gaza's few partially functioning hospitals says the facility is under siege by Israeli troops for a second straight day. Israel has maintained Hamas operates out of hospitals, which of course, the group has denied. The United Nations says Gaza is now the world's most dangerous place for journalists, making it extraordinarily difficult to document the suffering there. The U.N.'s coordinator for the Middle East peace process has left the Palestinian Territories after Israel refused to renew her visa. The Israeli foreign minister earlier cited what he called the bias of the U.N., quote, \"for the decision to expel Lynn Hastings.\" Will Ripley is watching developments in Tel Aviv. As you can see, the pressure mounting on the Israeli government and continues to do so, particularly with the Defense Secretary in the region, of course, having talks there. And we continue to see violence on an hourly basis in Gaza. The suffering continues.",

That number, 19,600, so close to 20,000, of course,from the Hamas-controlled health ministry in Gaza, just paints a very disturbing picture of the mass number of civilians who are dying here. And in some instances, not just Palestinians. You had, over the weekend, those three Israeli hostages, who were killed when troops opened fire from a distance, despite reports that they were shirtless, waving a white cloth and even had written an SOS message in Hebrew, asking for help, on a white sheet. Scattered leftover food was used to paint that message. Just a dire situation for those Israeli hostages, for the Palestinians on the ground, for the patients at hospitals that are barely functional. Some 150 patients reportedly having to evacuate to the courtyard of the hospital. Their companions, the people who were with them, like their family members, perhaps mothers and fathers, taken away, stripped, interrogated, reportedly, according to a doctor at the hospital. So the humanitarian situation in Gaza is extremely grave at this stage. But Israel, claiming that these steps are necessary to root out and get rid of the Hamas leadership, something that they say must happen to bring about the end of this war. Now Hamas, still holding well over 120 Israeli hostages. They are saying that none of those people will be released until the war ends. So you have these two sides that deeply distrust each other; you have a fighting raging on; the death toll, ticking up. And even though the United States and many others, a real chorus here, calling for a cease-fire to end hostilities, it's hard to see that happening in the short term, Julia, even as all sides are looking and trying to figure out what path forward, what path to peace there could possibly be at this stage.",

But it does come asintense negotiations were still ongoing this morning over that resolution, relating to halting hostilities in Gaza. It comes amid international pressure from the community about Israel's tactics being used in Gaza and the influence it has had on civilians there. Now we are told that there's actually supposed to be a vote on this matter yesterday. But that vote was delayed, to try to get the negotiations going a bit further. There's particular interest in trying to get the United States in a place to either support the measure or abstain from it and allow it to pass. And it appears that that conversation has centered around some of the specific language in that initial draft, which called for a cessation of hostilities, to get further aid into Gaza. Diplomats were hoping that potentially just changing that language to suspension of its hostilities might be one factor to get the U.S. to either support or abstain it and allow it to pass. This does come as the U.S. in the past has vetoed resolutions relating to cease-fires or calling for cease-fires in Gaza. So if the U.S. were to allow such a measure to pass, it would send an important signal to Israel, as there has been this mounting international outcry about their tactics being used in Gaza. So we are still waiting to hear what the final language of this text will be, whether the U.S. will sign onto it or simply abstain or potentially veto it. Many are closely watching to see where these talks will land when it comes for calling for a cease-fire, as they are trying to get further aid into Gaza at this time, to ease some of the suffering happening there at this moment.",

However, in this ruling, the Vatican says that it is possible to offer informal blessings to same-sex couples and unmarried couples, provided that they take place outside of formal church services and do not confuse the church's traditional teaching that marriage is between a man and a woman. This ruling is part of the pope's long-running attempt to offer a more pastoral and more sensitive and more compassionate approach by the church to same-sex couples.
