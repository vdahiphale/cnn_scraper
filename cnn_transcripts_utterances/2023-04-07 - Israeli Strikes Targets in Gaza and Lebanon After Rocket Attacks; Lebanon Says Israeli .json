Those are the words of a Lebanese security source talking to CNN, as Israel orders the mobilization of some of its reserves after it launched airstrikes into Southern Lebanon and Gaza. Israeli forces said they struck targets belonging to the Palestinian militant group Hamas. They blame Hamas for a barrage of rockets launched into Israel on Thursday. Lebanon says it will complain to the U.N. Security Council calling Israel's action a, quote, \"flagrant violation of Lebanon's sovereignty.\" Well, this all comes just days after Israeli police stormed the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem where fresh protest took place earlier. Well, our CNN correspondents covering every angle of this story. Hadas Gold has been reporting on the escalating tensions for weeks. Tonight she's near the Israeli border with Lebanon. Fred Pleitgen standing by for us at the Israel-Gaza border, and Scott McLean is in the Lebanese capital of Beirut. Let's start with the very latest from northern Israel on that border with Lebanon with Hadas Gold. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "Here near the border with Lebanon and you can see on the hill behind me there has been a tense quiet over the lastfew hours ever since those early morning Israel airstrikes in Southern Lebanon the Israeli military said was striking Palestinian militant targets. Now from what we see from images posted online as well as from a Lebanese security source speaking to CNN these strikes hit mostly open areas including places where militants were or storing weapons. And as far as we understand no injuries were reported and there was no response of any sort of rocket fire launched from Lebanon towards after it these striking. And we're hearing words from the Lebanese government as well as from the Israeli military that neither side has any interest in any sort of escalation, but the airspace here is still closed to civilian aircrafts. So that still goes to show you that there is some sort of concern that something could still develop. Most of the action, though, has been down south in Gaza where the Israeli military overnight striking several what it called Hamas and militant targets including tunnels and weapons manufacturing sites. Militants there responding with more than 40 rockets towards Israeli targets. Again no injuries reported on neither side, although there have been damages to buildings, residential homes on the Israeli side as well as damage to a pediatric hospital in Gaza. Meanwhile, in the occupied West Bank, two Israeli women were shot and killed, a third critically wounded in what Israeli police are calling a Palestinian terror attack on an Israeli car that was driving in the occupied West Bank. So many fronts ongoing all at the same time. The Israeli military calling up air force reservist but right now it seems to be more of a precautionary measure. There are lots of calls in the international community to try and calm the situation down. It has been calm but eyes are still open to see if things will develop further.

The IDF was saying that they were hitting some tunnels. They hit what they called some research and development facilities. Obviously the Israelis are saying that Hamas and other organizations there are building those rockets as well. Obviously people there on the ground are concerned as well. They have seen in the past what some of these escalations can bring specifically for people inside the Gaza Strip. So certainly it seems as though from our vantage point, and what we're hearing from inside there, it doesn't seem as though any side right now wants an escalation to happen, but of course you do feel that there is this tension in the air and that things could boil over very, very quickly, and go wrong very quickly if there is an escalation from either side -- Becky.",

      "sentences": "Yes, so obviously, Becky, this all started when rockets, some three dozen of them almost, were launched from Lebanesesoil towards Israel. Obviously most of them were shot down but some of them did manage to strike places like a gas station, a bank, things like that. And so there were civilian areas of Israel that were affected. And obviously the Israelis had promised to respond, and they did. And while overnight last night the targets that they actually hit, when you look at them, they seemed kind of benign almost. We're talking about, you know, electrical transformer, we're talking about a huge crater in an open field, some buildings, some cars in rural area about 10 miles or so north of the Lebanese border were affected, but again these don't strike you as targets that are obviously linked to a militia or a military of any kind. But speaking to a Lebanese security source who spoke to my team here in Beirut earlier today, those were in fact sites linked to Palestinian militia, militant groups, and that there were weapons there prior, too. That same source said that, look, the Lebanese military is now working to try to prevent this kind of attacks from being launched from Lebanese soil. And so in some ways this is an internal Lebanese problem to try to not invite another round of Israeli bombing if they actually can do that. Of course there's plenty of concern that this could escalate, a view that is shared by the United Nations as well. The Prime Minister Najib Mikati says that, look, he doesn't want his country to be used as a launching pad for strikes on Israel, and the Lebanese military has already found launchpads. They have already found rockets that they're now working to dismantle. And yet through all, Becky, no one has actually claimed responsibility. Obviously the Israelis have pointed the finger, not of Hezbollah, the Lebanese militia group. They have pointed the fingers at these Palestinian groups that are very active especially in Southern Lebanon, especially around Palestinian refugee camps there, but you have Hamas, didn't confirm, didn't deny that they had any involvement with this. Their statement earlier said that Palestinians should confront Israeli occupation. You also had Hezbollah putting out a statement, also not confirming or denying, but a senior figure in that group was quoted earlier today saying that Zionists' attempts to threaten and frighten people are ineffective. The deterrent power balance remains in place. In other words, Hezbollah is not a fight that Israeli likely wants to get involved with right now considering that the Israelis are well aware of how much of a real threat Hezbollah is compared to some of these smaller groups inside of a country. We have also recently just heard from the Iranian foreign minister who called Israeli strikes overnight a violation of sovereignty and territorial integrity. Yet through all that Israel says that they're blaming Hezbollah for these strikes but they are saying that they do shoulder some blame even if they weren't the ones firing the rockets themselves, for allowing them to happen because Hezbollah has such a tight grip on Southern Lebanon that it is difficult to imagine that they would not have known or perhaps would not have given their tacit approval at least. That's the Israeli view of this -- Becky.",

The Pentagon have not publicly said that these are authenticdocuments, and there are certainly a lot of people wondering why on earth if this was, as one narrative suggests, confidential information obtained by Russia, why would they tweak it, as appears to have been the case and then post it up on various social media channels? Completely belie the point of having that confidential advantage of knowing what your enemy's assessment of your capabilities or Ukraine's capabilities indeed are. So that's also odd, too. We've heard from Ukrainian officials who were saying this is all part of standard Russian misinformation operation, and Moscow haven't directly commented on this at all. So it's an odd piece of information to see out there. There are suggestions perhaps some of this information may have been doctored or maybe old. But it really isn't clear where it originated from. But it adds to one thing and that's the general sense of anticipation here certainly about when this counteroffensive may begin. We've had so much misinformation over the past months particularly when it came to the previous Ukrainian counteroffensive back in the summer, suggesting where they may or may not choose to begin that fight. But I think we should look at these documents whatever they really are in that particular perspective. And it remains to be seen quite what they genuinely are, but it does add to that broad sense that something is certainly coming. And it's Ukraine's turn on the battlefield to make a move forward -- Becky.",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Zenya (PH) prepares his 50-caliber machine gun. He didn't fire this time but he needs to be always on alert. Russian forces are nearby. This position on the northern edge of the Kharkiv region hasn't seen much action of late, but the men here have seen plenty elsewhere. In January Zenya was in a frontline foxhole in Donbas. From early in the morning they would shell us with artillery and right afterwards their infantry would try to take our positions, he recalls. You could see them. Much of the area south of here saw vicious combat. Last September Ukrainian forces routed the Russians for much of the Kharkiv region. Before retreating they toppled this Soviet era communications tower, scorched earth their tactic of choice. This position manned by the 290th battalion of the Ukrainian Army's 113th Brigade is holding steady. Defense not offense is the order of the day.

Let's first talk about diplomacy, because all attention has been focused on China's influence in Russia and the war in Ukraine. We just got some remarks reported by Chinese state media within the last few hours in which President Xi is quoted as saying the war should not drag on and that there should be a ceasefire. But as we have witnessed during this visit, both sides, being France and China, really have not wavered from their positions. France really blaming Russia for this war and China not necessarily condemning Russia for its involvement in this war. So things in many ways are still status quo despite these remarks. No one really is making any kind of wholesale shift in position. However, according to French diplomatic sources, President Xi has agreed to take a call with Volodymyr Zelenskyy when the time is right, at the right moment is the wording that we have been reporting. So that's the diplomatic front. And then another big part of his visit is deal making. The business front. President Macron did not travel to China by himself. He was with a delegation of about 50 business people. As we saw into these pictures he was in Guangzhou earlier which is a big commercial center for China. We also have been reporting tonight that they have -- there's been a billion plus dollar deal between France and a Chinese ship maker. So in that regard that could be seen as a success especially at a time when both economies, the French economy and the Chinese economy, are trying to reboot, trying to gain their footing after the pandemic. But, Becky, as far as any wholesale shift in these diplomatic discussions, that just has not happened.",

They wereon the ages of 16 and 20, shot and killed alongside their mother while they were driving in the occupied West Bank. Israeli police calling this a Palestinian terror attack. And as far as we know, no suspects have been captured in this shooting attack. Meanwhile, here along the northern border with Lebanon, things have been relatively quiet, although the air space here is still closed to civilian aircraft, we've seen no retaliatory rockets after those Israeli airstrikes in southern Lebanon, I mean, we should be clear that the Israeli military has taken pains to say they were targeting Hamas and they're targeting Palestinian militants and not Hezbollah. We heard from the Israeli Defense Force spokesperson Richard Hecht in the last couple of hours saying they don't want an escalation and there is very much a sense here that they are trying to keep the situation here along the border with Lebanon as calm as possible. Most of the action has been in Gaza where we saw Israeli military airstrikes overnight. We saw more than 40 rockets fired back towards Israel. No injuries, though, reported on either side. And in the last few hours, although there has been one report of mortar shelling from Gaza towards Israel, there has again been no further reports of Israeli military strikes or rockets being launched. So the question will be, will this calm stay? The Friday prayers at Al-Aqsa, they passed peacefully for the most part, although there were demonstrations, there were demonstrators who were hoisting things like Hamas flags, but relatively peaceful compared to the beginning of this week. So a lot of hopes that hopefully this will lead into a peaceful weekend but still, as you noted, the military calling up its reservists.
