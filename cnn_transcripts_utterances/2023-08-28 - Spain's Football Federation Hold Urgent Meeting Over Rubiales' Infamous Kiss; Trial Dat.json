Tonight, we wait to hear the outcome of anextraordinary and urgent meeting held by the Spanish Football Federation over the fate of this man, Luis Rubiales. We'll have more on that story as it happens this very hour. Then, a trial date is set for Donald Trump's federal election interference case. We'll have more on that and the developments from his Georgia trial, that's coming up. Plus, thousands of migrants land in Italy in a record- breaking weekend. I'll speak to the Red Cross who are on the ground in the island of Lampedusa. But first, right now, the Spanish Football Federation are locked in a closed-door meeting to discuss the fate of disgraced Spanish Football Chief Luis Rubiales. He's already been suspended by FIFA, if you remember, for his actions immediately after the Women's World Cup final. And you can see that moment, if you haven't yet, right here when Rubiales grasped the head of Spanish star player, Jennifer Hermoso and kisses her. The incident has sparked a huge backlash in Spain and beyond. And it's set the federation at war with its players, both female and male. Well, last hour, we heard from the president of Spain's Football Council who called it very serious and personally criticized the response of the football federation. Have a listen to what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VICTOR FRANCOS, PRESIDENT, SPANISH SPORTS COUNCIL (through translator): When they talk about feminism, I don't like what they've said, and I don't like the way it was applauded. I think the consequences is what the federation have to decide, I don't like applause. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But suddenly, in this moment of triumph, they have also to deal in a very public way again with this kind of gestures that reflect a bigger problem of a culture. But they were so admired in that moment and so courageous in coming together and being united, that I think it became sort of an inspiration because we never had maybe so many powerful women together, famous women, these set of very famous players. Alexia Putellas is the player who for the first time using the word, SeAcabo, it's over. And she's probably the best player in the world. So, that really helped, I think.

Mr. Zelenskyy says he discussed elections with Senator Lindsey Graham who recently visited Kyiv. You can see there with other U.S. lawmakers. The president wants troops and Ukrainians living abroad to cast ballots, but elections will be expensive and he hopes Europe and the U.S. will help financially. Meanwhile, fierce fighting continues as Ukrainian forces tries to advance deeper into Russian-held areas in the south. For the latest, CNN's Melissa Bell is live for us this hour in Zaporizhzhia.

If he said, logistically, it could be organized and mostly as you say, if they could get help in funding it, because he doesn't want any of the war efforts money to go towards that. But I think what he was just trying to show was that he's not going to be clinging on to power because of the war, that he wants to be an example of democracy, simply that Ukraine can't fund it itself, and given the logistical challenge that is understandable. You're talking about the many Ukrainian men and women currently on the frontlines of the country.

In Washington first of all, a federal judge has just set March 4, 2024, as a date former President Trump will go on trial on charges he conspired to overturn the 2020 election in an attempt to stay in power. That is one day before their Super Tuesday primaries, one of the biggest dates of course, on the presidential campaign season. And then in Georgia, a judge has ruled that Trump and his 18 co-defendants will be arraigned next week on state charges. One of those defendants, Trump's former Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, he's trying to get his trial moved to a federal court. Today's hearing in Atlanta is giving us our first real look at the substance of the prosecutor's case. I want to bring in CNN's Zachary Cohen, he's been following both of these hearings today from us in Washington, and Zachary, great to see you. Let's first start then with the case in Washington. The judge rejecting both proposals, January in the 2026, and now we have much more. What more can you tell us about this? Because I know it was a very heated hearing?",

Butit's more than two years earlier than what Trump's team had wanted, and had originally proposed in this hearing. And things did get heated inside the courtroom as Trump's lawyers were effectively saying, look, this trial date is coming up so soon, does not give us enough time to prepare and appropriately defend our client. The judge was not buying that argument. She said very clearly that, look, you should have been preparing this whole time, and that this is more than enough time in advance for you to appropriately represent Donald Trump at a trial. Now, things are going to start moving here pretty quickly. You know, there will be a bunch of pre-trial motions and pre-trial events leading up to March 4, 2024. But we can also probably expect Trump's legal team to file an appeal at some point, using probably some variation of the argument that this does not provide them enough of an opportunity to represent their client in court. And then there is a politics of it all. As you mentioned, March 4 is one day before Super Tuesday, that's when the majority of states here in the U.S. will gather and vote for their primary pick in Democrats and Republicans. So, Donald Trump, one day before Republicans in this country go to the polls and vote potentially for him to   represent them as the Republican candidate for president, he will have to potentially sit in a courtroom as his trial begins in this case.",

He is under oath and he is answering questions from prosecutors and his own attorney about his role primarily in setting up this phone call with Brad Raffensperger; the Secretary of State in Georgia and the former president. You know, Meadows' lawyer was essentially trying to get Meadows to explain how this was all being done within the context of his role as chief of staff. Donald Trump's chief of staff at the time, he's saying, look, my job was challenging and I had to do a lot of different things for the then president, including you know, people would come to me and ask me to tell the former president things, and I would try to set up meetings and calls on his behalf. Now, prosecutors are painting a very different picture. They're saying that Meadows was operating outside the bounds of what would be expected from a White House chief of staff at the time. The he was engaging in campaign activities and therefore, this case should not be moved to federal court. That's Meadows' ultimate objective here. He wants to get this case moved to federal court, and then he argues that it should be thrown out because he has immunity as a government official at the time. So, a lot of moving pieces here, but really, a high-profile witness taking the stand in Georgia really just days after turning himself in to authorities in Georgia.",
