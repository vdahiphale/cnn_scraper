The reality is Democrats view this as blatantly political, but at the same time, they have acknowledged that there are actual constitutional and procedural issues that they are going to have to deal with. You know, Senator Chris Murphy, who's been very busy trying to negotiate that bipartisan Senate deal, he told me that he really views this as just a political exercise, but at the same time, Senate Democrats are likely not going to be able to just ignore it. Their options really are to move to quickly dismiss this if it comes over to their chamber, to go ahead and refer it to a committee, either a standing committee or create a special committee to go ahead and investigate it, but that does take resources, or their third option, have a very quick Senate trial. They are going over past precedent, trying to decide what their next steps are going to be, but we obviously aren't going to hear from them until this is signed, sealed and delivered from the House.",

In the face of challenges from the People's Republic of China and threats from an increasingly aggressive North Korea, we will stand firm in our support to our friends.Joining us now is one of the ambassadors who penned that letter, the U.S. ambassador to Japan, Rahm Emanuel. He also served as President Obama's chief of staff. We just read through the letter. So glad you're with us this morning. Why the urgency and the need to write this? RAHM EMANUEL, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO JAPAN:  Well, look, our allies are force multiplier. And this is one of the most challenging regions of the world. And very specifically, while the legislation deals with, obviously, Ukraine, the border funding to Israel, also Taiwan, it also is a sign right now as the Senate takes up this legislation, our allies and our foes in this region are going to take our measure. When the chips are down, does the United States stand by its word? And we thought, all of us who are at the conference, and you have, myself as an ambassador to Japan, you have Nick Burns, ambassador to China, and countries between from Republic of Korea, India, Philippines, Vietnam, all spoke with one voice, that this is a crucial time that the friend and foe in this region are going to take our measure. And we think it's very important, obviously, to be able to be followed through on our word and our commitment to our friend, and then to also follow through on our word and our commitment to making sure that our enemies know we're serious when we're serious. And that's why this was so important to all of us coming back from the INDOPACOM conference, decided to speak with one voice about this.",

And McConnell, who used to have a total grip on his conference, doesn't seem to have that anymore.

All eyes are to see whether America, when it makes a commitment, will live up to that commitment. That is why every ambassador across different countries, some political, some not political, some are career, decided to speak up and sign something that they don't often do, because this vote is not just another vote.

But at the same time, maybe this is something that was found on some follow-up imaging or some lab work. So, there's a lot of speculation on, hey, what kind of cancer is it?
