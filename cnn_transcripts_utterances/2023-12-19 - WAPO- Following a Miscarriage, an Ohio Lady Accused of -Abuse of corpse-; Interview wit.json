So, in this particular case, the statute that she is being charged under is abuse of a corpse. And we had a lot of insight as to what the prosecution was looking at when bringing these charges because there was a preliminary hearing.And at the preliminary hearing, prosecutors essentially said it was irrelevant whether or not the fetus was -- whether or not there was a live birth, whether or not the fetus died in utero, which was confirmed by those very medical reports that you spoke of. They were focused on everything that happened after and the -- and what happened with that fetus after the fact. Now, the defense on the other hand, focused on everything that happened. The totality of his circumstances. That this woman had gone for medical treatment. She ultimately did not get the medical treatment. She, for three days, she'd waited eight hours, ended up going home, had a miscarriage like many others have experienced and is now being charged with abuse of a corpse, which seems to be something that this would not be the legislative intent of that statute.

And so, there is a lot of uncertainty about the way these statutes are going to be used and there is less constitutional barriers that were in place under Roe.So, this is certainly a case to watch. And again, they are going to be looking at this state statute. And some of the primary issues will be the legislative intent. This statute, the intention, is for grave robbing, you know, all the way to mistreatment of a corpse. So, does this situation fall into it? A lot of people are going to say, no.

Appreciate it.KATE BOLDUAN, CNN NEWS CENTRAL CO-ANCHOR:  Coming up still for us, a class action lawsuit alleging racial discrimination filed against the largest U.S. credit union following in a CNN exclusive report. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [10:40:00] BOLDUAN:  The largest credit union in the country, Navy Federal Credit Union, is facing a class action lawsuit after an exclusive CNN investigation which published last week. The complaint alleges the company, which lends to military service members, defense personnel, veterans, and their families, discriminated against black and Latino applicants. The credit union approved conventional home mortgages for white applicants more than 75 percent of the time. And less than half of black applicants were approved for the same type of loan. CNN's report found the credit union had the widest disparity in conventional mortgage approvals between white and black borrowers of any major lender last year, but it did not prove discrimination. CNN's Rene Marsh and her team is behind this new reporting. She joins us now. Rene, what is in this lawsuit?",

      "sentences": "Kate, good morning. This is a lawsuit filed by three law firms, including Civil Rights Attorney Ben Crump's law firm. They filed it in federal court in Virginia this weekend, and it accuses Navy Federal of violating federal housing discrimination laws.This class action seeks to represent a broad range of potential plaintiffs, including minority applicants who applied for Navy Federal residential loans from 2018 to present and had their applications denied, approved at higher interest rates or subject to less favorable terms compared to non-minority applicants. As well as those who may have had their application process dragged on and take unusually long. One of the attorneys behind the suit says that the goal is to obtain economic justice for black and Latino borrowers who were denied their piece of the American dream. And I do want to note since our report, CNN has learned that Navy Federal has hired a civil rights attorney to review its mortgage lending practices. And coming out of Washington, D.C. HERE, Congresswoman Maxine Waters, who -- she -- who is the ranking Democratic member of the House Financial Services Committee. Yesterday, she called on Navy Federal to explain both to Congress and their members how such practices took place. And she's also calling on federal regulators to investigate, Kate.",
