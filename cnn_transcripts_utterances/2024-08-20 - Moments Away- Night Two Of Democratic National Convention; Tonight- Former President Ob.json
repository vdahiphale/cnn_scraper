Former President Barack Obama will be laying out his case for why he believes Democrats, entities, Americans at large, should elect Vice President Kamala Harris. But I am told the Obama to watch tonight is Michelle Obama. The Harris campaign believes that her message will resonate louder outside this convention hall. She, of course, very seldom talks about politics.She often does not want to get in the fray. It's been several years since she's delivered a big political speech like this. We all remember back to the 2016 convention in Philadelphia, she famously said, \"when they go low, we go high.\" An advisor said she will deliver an updated version of that. The bottom line to this is both Obama's believe that this race is not over. That sounds obvious. But you know, given the sense of jubilation and exuberance among Democrats here and the dramatic turnaround in the race just one month after Vice President Harris became the nominee, they believe that message is important to convey to Democrats. This is a very close race with former President Donald Trump, who's campaigning, of course, in Pennsylvania. But Wolf, we're also going to hear from Doug Emhoff, as you and Kaitlan were saying there. That is also a critical part of this evening's program, as well as the roll call vote. It's symbolic, but that is going to be a state by state roll call standing up with delegates affirming their support for Kamala Harris. Wolf, that underscores one critical point. This is a party united. The 2016 campaign, of course, hangs over all of this, a divided Democratic Party at that point where the Democratic nominee was not campaigning, Kamala Harris tonight is 90 miles north at a rally in battleground Wisconsin. That tells you all you need to know about how seriously they're taking this race. Wolf.",

CHRIS WALLACE, CNN ANCHOR, \"THE CHRIS WALLACE SHOW\": I think -- first of all, I have to say, I'm personally excited. I think that Barack Obama and Michelle Obama are probably the two best speakers, not only the Democratic Party, but in American politics. And I'm really looking forward to tonight. I think Obama is, you know, he's going to talk about their friendship, their relationship, but I think one of the things he wants to do is what happened to him in 2008 to turn this from a campaign into a movement. And I'm told that one of the things he's going to talk about is hope and change, and the idea that just as he represented that back in 2008 Kamala Harris represents that. Now, Michelle Obama, whose books sold better than Barack Obama's, and gives speeches to, you know, when she's doing her books to jam stadiums, really is less a political figure than a cultural figure. And I agree with something that was just said earlier. I suspect that her speech may have more impact than his, not necessarily in this hall, but around the country.

And Michelle Obama's ability to kind of penetrate into people's phones and the social media ecosphere, I think is different, honestly, than even President Obama in a cultural way, and I think that that potentially has significant impact.And I also think, to Chris's earlier point, one of the biggest shifts that we saw with President Biden stepping aside was a sort of dark, a shift from the from the dark portrayal of the way that Biden was talking about how Donald Trump is a threat to democracy was almost a fear based argument as to why Democrats should get out and vote. They were made to feel afraid by that. They were afraid constantly he was going to make a mistake to a forward looking, hopeful, joyful, not quite movement yet necessarily, but something approaching that, I think, is really the fundamental shift we've seen, and that's going to be on display tonight as well.",
