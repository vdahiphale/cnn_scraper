It has now been 24 hours since that stark warning from Israel's military, the warning for more than a million people living in Northern Gaza to leave their homes, essentially get out or else. Well, we don't actually know how the people can really get out, and we don't actually exactly know what the what else or else will really mean.But that means 24 hours now of desperation, of terror, of fear, people who are caught in the middle with nowhere else to go. And then to complicate and confuse this even further, Hamas is telling the people to stay where they are. So, how do the people in the region even know who to listen to? Well, here's what we do know right now. Gaza is bracing for a potential large-scale ground operation against Hamas in the wake of the deadly terror attacks in Israel just last week. Now, it's not clear, sitting here today, how many hostages may be held captive in Gaza. President Joe Biden said this with the missing American hostages. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They're here tonight. And here with me is James Clapper, the former director of National Intelligence who can tell us what's likely happening behind the scenes and what could happen next. Also, CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen, who has been writing about and reporting from the region for literally decades. And Dr. Guy Ziv, who is from American University School of International Service, who work at the State Department and on Capitol Hill, and brings his expertise as well. I want to start, though, with CNN's Nada Bashir, who has been digging very deeply into what is happening in Gaza. Nada, I mean, this time yesterday, we were reporting that the U.N. was told they had 24 hours to evacuate Northern Gaza. So, what do we know about where the evacuations stand now?",

I'm going to rely on him to really show us what could happen next in Gaza. As we just described, there are desperate people who are trying to flee a potential ground invasion.Let me ask you this, major general. I mean, we already heard more than a million people are told to evacuate, are told to leave. No clear direction of where they will go, where they might be welcomed, where they could stay, if they could even return. So, is it even possible to have this evacuation occur in time, let alone at all? JAMES \"SPIDER\" MARKS, CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Well, we certainly don't know, Laura, when the -- when the ground assault is going to begin. If it were to begin in the next couple of hours and it is daylight now in Israel, I think the short answer would be no, there'd be movement of humanity from the northern part. Let me move to the map right here. The northern part of Gaza, and there would be along these two major avenues, steady stream of humanity trying to get out of harm's way. So, can they do it? Not really sure. But what the Israelis did do is they said, look, we're about to begin a ground assault. We want you to get out of harm's way because we are going to do as best as we can, this is Israelis, to precisely target command and control facilities that belong to and supporting facilities that belong to Hamas. There is no fight against the Palestinian civilians. It's against Hamas. But what Hamas has done is they've violated the international humanitarian law, which prohibits the use of civilians as human shields. And that's exactly what they are demanding. Hamas has said, don't move, we want you to stay in place, which complicates the issue for Israel and certainly puts civilians at risk.",

Is it for other reasons? We are still learning all this.But we all are saying -- I want you to help me explain or help explain to the public really about the process of these raids. There have been raids into Gaza by the IDF after days of bombardment. There appears to be a chronology that's important here and a choreography that might lead to a military advantage.

And I think what that means is the IDF probably had high level of confidence on some intelligence of where some hostages might be located.And so, they probably took some very limited assaults into the area, going after targets that they felt were going to be locations where they could strike and potentially get some hostages out. It was not intended exclusively to be an intelligence preparation task. But what happens when you conduct operations like that is you always expand the amount of intelligence that you have. So, they clarified a number of things about the area that they went into. But this was not the beginning. This was not the harbinger. This was not necessarily the first step of a ground assault. This was an opportunity to go after hostages and potentially to go after some known targets. But these were limited strikes, limited in scope, limited in distance. And then probably, they returned into Israel. Now, they've improved their intelligence, hopefully. Maybe they've retrieved some hostages. We don't know that yet.",

If they do, that's amazing at this point to know where the hostages are.

And so, if you go in without assumption, you're not going to interpret intelligence that might be useful because you're just going to discount it. By the way, the Israelis did this during the Yom Kippur War 50 years ago, which is the Egyptian army and the Syrian army were moving, and they were interpreted as troop movements that just were regular troop movements rather than a preparation for an invasion.

And every time, it gets worse.So, you know, history doesn't tell us -- it's going repeat itself for sure, but we can assume that it's just going to be the same. I mean, what's going to change? What is going to change after this? So -- I mean, you have very intelligent people in the studio right now. And I want to thank Mr. Clapper for his very poignant points about putting things to -- you know, really kind of describing what it is on the ground. What does it mean when they say, you know, 1.1 million people need to evacuate? Just imagine telling 80% of the residents of the Bronx, you need to leave in 24 hours. Even the U.S. can't do it.

So, the answer is not going to be Jim Jordan.And particularly from all those -- you know, there are 18 Republicans who were elected in Biden districts, districts where Biden won the presidency, and they won as Republicans. They're never going to vote for Jim Jordan. So, listen, I think it's going to take a lot more happening. And I think ultimately, it may fall to somebody like Patrick McHenry or somebody that's just -- you know, he's just not controversial. He's just a nice guy.
