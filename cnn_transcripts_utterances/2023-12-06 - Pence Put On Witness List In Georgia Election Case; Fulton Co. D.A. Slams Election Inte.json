      "sentences": "Now to a CNN exclusive in the Georgia 2020 election subversion case against Donald Trump. CNN has learned that Fulton County prosecutors have submitted their secret list of witnesses for trial. And one name among the roughly 150 stands out, former Vice President Mike Pence.Let's get some analysis now with white collar defense attorney and Columbia Law School lecturer, Caroline Polisi. Caroline, thanks for sharing part of your afternoon with us. So Pence has already appeared as a witness before a federal grand jury, part of the federal election subversion case. How could his testimony impact the case in Fulton County, Georgia, specifically? CAROLINE POLISI, WHITE COLLAR DEFENSE ATTORNEY &amp; LECTURER, COLUMBIA LAW SCHOOL: That's right, Boris. We've known for a while that he was called by Jack Smith's special grand jury in D.C. for the federal case. As it pertains specifically to Georgia, I think Fani Willis could use Mike Pence to her advantage. Remember, he was sort of the focus point of that pressure campaign that Trump placed on him not to certify the election and to facilitate the false state electors. It's not surprising that Fani Willis would like his testimony in her state RICO case.",

      "sentences": "Yes. The question of whether Trump could even be on the ballot in Colorado is actually in court today. There's an appeals court looking at a decision recently made by a judge there that essentially said that Trump did commit insurrection.But the way that Section III of the 14th Amendment, as written, it doesn't specify that a president wouldn't be able to run for office having been found to commit insurrection. I'm wondering how you see that case stacking up.",

      "sentences": "Yes, this was a shocking decision, to be sure. This was kind of a sleeper case on the sidelines.It's a wonkish constitutional law argument that basically says, you know, Section III of the 14th Amendment, which was ratified post-Civil War, it says that any person that has taken an oath of office and commits an insurrection cannot thereafter hold office. And what is surprising that the Colorado judge did is she held that while Trump did engage in insurrection, that it doesn't apply to the office of the presidency, which is odd because sort of put the harder hurdle to meet there is that insurrection portion. And today, it's going to this Colorado Supreme Court. So we'll see what they have to say. Both sides have appealed on a number of issues. But I don't think, Boris, ultimately, that this is going to be the same argument, the case that wins the day for keeping Trump off the ballot.",

That's what you described there. And then the shooting continued. Four other shootings across Austin over several hours yesterday afternoon. There was another man and woman who were killed in their home. There was a shooting at a school where a school police officer was wounded in the leg. A man who was riding a bike was also shot. And the last shooting scene was in a neighborhood at a home where there was a reported burglary. When police arrived there, Boris, they discovered the suspect in the backyard. They exchanged gunfire and then there was a short chase and that's when they took the suspect into custody. And then, all of these events started getting pieced together that they were all possibly, according to investigators in Austin and San Antonio, linked together. What exactly the motivation behind all of this, we do not know at this point. But this suspect, 34-year-old Shane James, is now facing capital murder charges here in Texas, which could make him eligible for the death penalty -- Boris?",
