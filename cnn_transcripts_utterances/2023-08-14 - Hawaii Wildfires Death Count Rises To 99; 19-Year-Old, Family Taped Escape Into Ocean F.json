Just after 8:00 PM Eastern, and they are still at work right now. According to one Trump adviser, they expect charges to be filed \"imminently.\" A short time ago, former lieutenant governor, Geoff Duncan, who is now a CNN contributor testified, that's a video of him on his way out; he and journalist, George Chidi are thought to be among the final witnesses.

So all indications are that Fani Willis is looking at and really important to know, Anderson, if there is a racketeering charge that carries a mandatory minimum of five years in prison.

And like my colleague, Zach Cohen and I have been reporting on are these strings of messages that make their way to attorneys who were working with Donald Trump on his post-election legal challenges, with researchers who were helping Rudy Giuliani try to cobble together evidence of election fraud.

But there's a potential peril there if they don't coordinate, because they could be stepping on each other's toes. They could be looking at the same witnesses. It could be that somebody who Fani Willis indicts could be cooperating secretly with Jack Smith's team, which would cause a big problem.

I mean, she's had people all over the country watching and waiting for the last few hours and it wouldn't surprise me if she walked downstairs and gave a press conference.

I mean, three of them already, one here in New York, and, of course, the two federal charges.But if he does -- if he gets indicted here tonight, potentially or this week, or whatever the grand jury makes their decision here. It's a fundamentally different case for him. And I also think it's important. I mean, Georgia was at the core of his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. When you look at the efforts that he went to, that people who worked inside the White House, his attorneys, all of these other allies of his, the great lengths that they went to, to try to pressure the state officials, some of the ones that you've seen testifying there today. I mean, this was at the center of his efforts to undo this. And I think this is why the Trump team is viewing it so seriously here, and you've heard from his attorneys here now facing several other indictments is that this is different because it would be state charges, and he would not, even if he does win the 2024 election have that legal protection here afforded to him with the federal cases where he could either have an attorney general who fires Jack Smith, or who makes the cases go away, or he could potentially pardon himself.

And that in the coming days, that number could potentially double. Also tonight, there are now questions about how well prepared the island was for a major disaster. State officials confirmed that none of the 80 outdoor warning alarms that are supposed to deliver a loud, piercing sound to residents in a tsunami were activated. And that the New York Times, quote, firefighters who say that fire hydrants ran dry. According to one firefighter, there was just no water in the hydrants. Tonight, we're also hearing more stories of what it took to survive a fire that, according to the governor, traveled at an incredible speed of 1 mile every minute. 19-year-old Noah -- excuse me -- 19-year-old Noah Tompkinson and his younger brother Milo and his mom raced to their car as the fire spread. They were caught in traffic, and they did the one thing they thought would save their lives, escaped into the ocean. They were there for hours. It was recorded on video.

Some judges will do it in open court. The grand jury foreperson will literally hand up the indictment. That's why we use the phrase hand up an indictment. The judge will review them quickly. There's no substantive review. It's just a formality. And then sometimes the judge will announce the case names and numbers. Other times that will happen behind closed doors in chambers. And the way we would then find out is when these documents hit the public docket, which would be nearly instantaneously. So it does look like there's some security moving through this area here.
