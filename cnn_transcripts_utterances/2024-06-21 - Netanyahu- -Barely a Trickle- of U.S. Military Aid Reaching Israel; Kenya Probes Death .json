It's 5 pm here in Abu Dhabi. I'm Becky Anderson. Welcome to the show. This is \"Connect the World\" also happening over the next two hours. A new report from CNN, U.S. officials expressing concern over the limitations of Israel's famed Iron Dome, this coming as Israel and Hezbollah trade threats in what is fast becoming psychological warfare. We'll take a closer look at that and if a draw can be devastating England word devastated in Germany while Spain dazzled defending against the defending champions Italy we are talking, the Euros, more on that later. Well as the prospects of an all-out war between Israel and Hezbollah grow, there is increasing concern in Washington about the effectiveness of Israel's Iron Dome defense system. Multiple U.S. officials tell CNN there are fears that the Iron Dome could be overwhelmed by Hezbollah's arsenal of missiles and drones much larger and much more sophisticated than the weapons that Hamas has been using in Gaza. One senior U.S. official says quote, we are entering a very dangerous period. Well, these concerns surfacing as Israel's Prime Minister again, criticize the Biden Administration over its military support. Benjamin Netanyahu saying in an interview published today, that quote, barely a trickle of military aid is making it into Israel. And in Gaza, more reports of fierce fighting and civilian deaths in Rafah. This is -- telling CNN earlier Israel's military is intent on completely destroying Rafah, he says. Well, the IDF says in turn its operation there is precise and intelligence based. We've got a lot to talk about here. Paula Hancocks connect us from Jerusalem today. And Kylie Atwood is at the State Department standby Kylie. Paula, we have just seen the very latest from Benjamin Netanyahu in a published interview. What's he had to say?",

      "sentences": "Well, Becky, this is really continuing this very public spat we've seen between Benjamin Netanyahu and the BidenAdministration. This is an interview that was done on Thursday. It was published today this Friday, and he has said that quote, barely a trickle of American military aid is getting through to Israel. Now, it's already been rebuffed a number of times by Biden Administration officials on Tuesday night, Netanyahu had a Twitter video that he posted. He was speaking in English and said it was inconceivable that there were delays in ammunition and other things coming through to Israel, to which we had the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken say very clearly. He didn't know what he was talking about saying there are no bottlenecks at this point. And we've heard the same from a number of Biden Administration officials. The only thing that is being held up at this point is the heavier bombs, the 2000 pound bombs, for example, which U.S. President Biden said he didn't want to be sending to the U.S. at this point in case they were used in densely populated areas, like Rafah. So this is really a spat, that is very much being pushed from the Israeli Prime Minister's side at this point. We know on Tuesday, there was the U.S. envoy, Amos Hochstein, who's been here trying to calm things down on the northern border between Israel and Lebanon. And according to U.S. officials, he told Netanyahu, that what he was saying was unproductive and also completely wrong, Becky.",

They are talking about targeting Hamas operatives in that southern city but the Mayor of Rafah pushing back to CNN saying that the IDF are destroying the city and that the operation is no different to that in the north of Gaza based on the rising death toll and the images that we are seeing.

He's really challenging that premise, saying what's happening in Rafah is exactly what happened in her newness where there was significant damage to the city. And also in the northern part of Gaza and he said that anyone who sets foot in the City of Rafah is killed instantly, at this point, pointing out that it's practically deserted. There are some people left in Mawasi that parts that certainly close to the humanitarian zone, as the Israeli military calls it. But in the City of Rafah itself, he says that it is being completely destroyed. Now Israel and its military as just today as repeated once again that this is a precise operation. They call it an intelligence led precise military operation, but that is being very much rejected on the ground by the mayor there. And also we heard from the Biden Administration just last month as well the State Department Spokesperson Matt Miller, saying that this limited operation, quote, looks like a prelude of a major military operation. And just yesterday was we were talking we heard and saw satellite imagery and footage of the Rafah border crossing which is significantly damaged and burned, Becky.",

And just like to yesterday, and just like it's going to benext week, we have all this suspense because we actually do not know what rulings are coming, we will not know until the very last day of the session, when there's only you know, a couple left and we can narrow it down. But they have, they still have about 18 major cases to be decided, essentially over like four or five days, scattered through this weekend next. And, you know, we don't know when I go into that courtroom at 10 am today, Becky, you know, though, it could be any of the ones that you just mentioned, having to do with Former President Donald Trump, or, you know, abortion, gun rights. So we know the drill, and we'll be ready. So let me just at least mention a couple that folks in our audience are especially watching. The main one of Donald Trump will involve whether he is subject to a criminal prosecution trial for election subversion from the 2020 election before the November contest of this year. And right now, Becky, I have to say the window of opportunity for that kind of trial is really closing, even if the justices say that he can be subject to a trial on some of the actions that he took after the 2020 election results. It takes about you know, three months to sort of get all the trial proceedings, the jury selection, underway before an actual trial can occur. So we're really down to the wire on that one. But also, we have a major abortion case that we're waiting to see what the justice do in a gun rights case. And both of those Becky stem from action that the justices took two years ago, at this time when they first of all, eliminated all of constitutional abortion rights. Nearly 50 years of constitutional abortion rights to protect a woman's choice to end a pregnancy. And then I gun rights. The justices two years ago greatly expanded gun rights under the Second Amendment. And we have two cases that will test the contours of, you know, the next generation of cases from that. And then finally, we have cases that test regulation of the environment and social media. So Becky, I'm sure I'll be talking to you next week. But today, I believe at 10 am Eastern, we will at least start to see answers in some of these, Becky.",

      "sentences": "Becky, I don't think it could overwhelm the system, but it definitely could punch some seriousholes in it. I mean, for one thing, what we've seen since October, is that Hezbollah has been focusing specifically on knocking out Israel's surveillance equipment that keeps an eye on what's going on the other side of the border. And for instance, we saw that nine minute video of a drone over Haifa, collecting all sorts of intelligence on sensitive military positions. We saw also recently, a video put out by his bullish showing them knocking out in an Iron Dome battery. Just last night, Hezbollah on its -- telegram program, to channel put out a video of some sort of projectile knocking down what's called the drone dome and anti-drone system. So clearly, Hezbollah has the capability to really knock holes in that critical defense for Israel. You know, back in May of last year, I covered a brief war between Islamic Jihad in Gaza and Israel and I saw firsthand how effective the Iron Dome was in taking down almost every missile fired out of Gaza, the Israeli say the efficiency rate is 95.5 percent. But Islamic Jihad and Hamas are completely different creatures than Hezbollah. Now, earlier, Becky, you were talking about the numbers perhaps 40, 50, 100,000 fighters Hezbollah has, but it's not necessarily the numbers that count. Lots of non-state actors have lots of fighters. Lots of countries have lots of soldiers. But what I've seen over the years, going back to the 1990s, when Hezbollah was fighting Israel in the South of Lebanon, trying to drive the Israelis out. What was clear is that these fighters were for one dedicated to the cause. And another very well trained and highly disciplined as well. I've come in contact with, you know, ragtag militias in Africa, the Middle East elsewhere. But in terms of just organization and discipline, there's really nothing that compares with Hezbollah. So their ability to use high technology to use laser guided missiles and other sophisticated systems could easily knock out a variety of Israel's defense systems, parts of it. I doubt the entirety of it, but certainly enough to expose a large part of the population of Northern Israel to Hezbollah's weaponry, Becky.",

But in reality, it'sreally something that is being adopted by some companies right now, right. This survey found that 61 percent of large U.S. companies plan to automate some tasks that had been done by humans with artificial intelligence. And they're not saying they're going to do this, a decade from now, or five years from now they're saying one year from now. So this really is rapid adoption. And they say they're going to do this for a number of reasons, including trying to boost the quality of the products, boost output, cut costs, and yes, sometimes substitute for workers. And listen, we are seeing this in a number of forms, including using AI to automate financial reporting, and doing invoices and paying suppliers. Now, we thought it would be instructive to sort of demonstrate some of this. So we're going to ask for some help from our friends in the control room who have loaded up ChatGPT with some instructions, and this is going to be for crafting a job post. This is just for fun. But we're asking ChatGPT to craft a job posting for a CNN Business Correspondent based in Hawaii, who must love business writing, and the beach. Not to name anyone in particular.
