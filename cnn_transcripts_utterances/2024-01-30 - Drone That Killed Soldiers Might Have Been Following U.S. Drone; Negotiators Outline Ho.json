      "sentences": "Hey, good morning, Kasie.Yeah. So according to an official familiar with these talks happening in Paris, this is a very broad framework that has been agreed on, but even they say that the precise details of this will be very difficult to work out. The framework, again, broadly speaking, would call for a six-week long pause. There would be three Palestinian prisoners in exchange for every one civilian hostage. This is the same ratio that we saw it with the hostage exchanges back in November. But the ratio of prisoners to be exchanged for IDF soldiers that are currently being held hostage would be higher, how much higher? We don't know. There could also be a longer pause than six weeks for more phases of exchanges to actually take place, but again, a lot of details still to be worked out, but some level of optimism. The Qatari prime minister for his part said that this represents good progress. Again, at things back in shape, and at least lays a foundation for the way forward. This is being presented to Hamas right now by the Egyptians. But even the Qatari prime minister said that he could not predict how Hamas might react to this. This was a collaboration between the Qataris, the Egyptians, the Americans, and be as rallies, all of them had different ideas on how long the pause should be, what the exchange ratio should be between prisoners and hostages. But this is the sort of framework that they arrived upon. But, look, it's not even necessarily clear that the Israelis are 100 percent on board with this because the Israeli prime ministers office is already signaling that they have concerns about some of the conditions that they don't find acceptable. So the reality is that there are still a lot to be worked out here. And then we know from prior experience as well but nothing on this happens quickly because of some of the difficulties in actually communicating with Hamas leadership given what's happening right now in Gaza.",

It's only resulted in injuries until now. But obviously, this is the first time that us service members have been killed.You mentioned already, the reasons why this drone got lucky and actually hit the target. Perhaps it was flying low. Another American drone was coming back to base at the same time, can cause confusion, caused some delay, things like that. But the question right now that the Biden administration is deciding is what to do that at how to respond to this without escalating things further. We know that look, some Republican lawmakers are calling on Biden to strike Iran itself, something that officials say is not like I believe because they know full well, that that would likely cause a broader conflict, maybe you all out war. The Iranians are also distancing themselves from this attack, saying that look, resistance groups that's what they call these Iran-backed militias that they have operating in Iraq and Syria, don't answer directly to Tehran. And in this particular case, it seems like the Americans are on the same page. They say that there's no direct evidence to suggest that are on ordered this or wanted specifically to escalate the war. And so that's why there's some caution around actually striking -- striking Iran directly in response. But the White House has said that, look, the response here is going to be bigger, more powerful than we've seen in previous responses, which were more targeted, more limited. This one could be in several countries, could be across several days, could even be a cyber attack. They also aren't saying much about who specifically was responsible for this because they want to leave if some element of surprise and their response, Kasie.",

The president met yesterday with a large group of his national security team, and we assume that came out of that needing some sort of direction in terms of what they're going.But they're not letting that be made known at this time. They have to be very careful here because obviously some lawmakers, especially Republican lawmakers, are pressuring (AUDIO GAP) specifically, but they seem to throw cold water on that yesterday. Basically saying they do not want a direct conflict with Iran. They do not want a war with Iran. And so, I think that is something that they're ruling off the table right now.

But that is pretty significant because right now, we're seeing encounters up to 10,000 migrants a day. So that could be a very significant measure if it were to come to pass it.

Federal prosecutors have charged three men in a murder for hire plot against two Iranian dissidents who live in Maryland. Officials say that one man is the leader of an Iranian criminal network.

But this plume of moisture is very directed, it's very purposeful in where it directs that moisture. And so, it's going to start out first across the Pacific Northwest late tonight, and then start to slide further south into the California Central Valley, for instance, the coastal regions into bay area. And then as you head into Thursday, we're going to focus our attention more towards southern California. In fact, you can see that progression moving from north to south over the next, let's say 48 hours. So depending on where that plume of moisture sets up, that's where well see the heaviest rainfall. That's why we have flood watches in advance of this plume of atmospheric river. This is that river in the sky that's going to direct the moisture all the way into the West Coast of the U.S. And there it is. We put on a front just to kind of show you the somewhat subtle cooling that'll happen behind but generally, this is a warmer storm system, so high elevations, snowfall, only the tops of the Sierra Nevada will receive snow. And then you look towards the coastal regions. We have the potential here for four to upwards of locally eight to ten inches of rain with lesser amounts of further south you travel. There's a lot of wind associated with this well. We could see hurricane-force gusts in some of those higher elevations, and then again, the highest of elevations of mountains particularly between Reno and Sacramento. That's where we have the potential for foot or more of snowfall. Now this is interesting to the Sierra Nevada snowpack right now, only sitting at 52 percent of average. So what we need is snow and we need it desperately. But this again is going to be a very warm storm. You can see it in the record highs that were broken yesterday. Look at downtown San Francisco, 73. Their previous record for the date was 71. There's a lot of red on this map. That means more warm weather as we get this plume of kind of Pacific air into the central U.S. 130 record highs and minimum record lows expected over the next several days across the country.
