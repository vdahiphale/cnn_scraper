And it has gone on for two years already. It has gone on for two years in the past.And so this was not seen as particularly problematic by the Air Force. And actually, Air Force leaders did give it the go ahead. But then when Pentagon leaders found out that it was scheduled to be performed today, they actually intervened this week, we're told. And told them that it could not move forward. Now, according to the Defense Department, the reason for this is because, quote, \"'Hosting these types of events in federally funded facilities is not a suitable use of DOD resources. Our service members are diverse and are allowed to have personal outlets\". But as you see, John, from that testimony that Austin gave and that grilling kind of that Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz gave him there, as well as the Joint Chief's chairman, Mark Milley, this has obviously become a very politically contentious issue. And a lot of Republicans are asking why these kinds of events are taking place on military bases across the country. Well, now it seems like the Pentagon is telling military installations and facilities across the country that they do not want these bases to be used to host these kinds of events. Even though it is unclear, right, whether any kind of taxpayer funded -- whether any taxpayer money would be going towards it. These are private events that are hosted on these bases.
