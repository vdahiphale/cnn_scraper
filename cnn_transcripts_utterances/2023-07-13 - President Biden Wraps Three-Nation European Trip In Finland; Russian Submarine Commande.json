U.S. President Joe Biden is wrapping up his three- nation European trip in Finland, where he welcomed NATO's newest member. Earlier, Mr. Biden attended a Nordic Leaders' Summit, meant to highlight the Alliance's growing influence. The addition of Finland to NATO more than doubles. Russia's border with the world's most powerful military bloc in a strategic blow to Vladimir Putin. During a joint press conference with the Finnish leader, the U.S. President pledged rock-solid support for NATO's new ally and said the latest addition to the alliance makes the world a safer place. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) We discussed, Mr. President, where we stand at an inflection point in history, where the decisions we make now are going to determine the course of the history for the next four, five, six decades. And this week, we affirmed how Finland and the United States, together, together with allies and partners, are working in lockstep to set us on a stronger, safer, and more secure path not just for Europe, not just for NATO, but for the world.

Finland, on the other hand, fought World War II against the Soviet Union. We lost eight percent of our land, including Karelia, where my grandparents and my dad was born. Then we were kind of neutral because of necessity, not free will. But we dropped that doctrine in 1990, 1991, when the Cold War ended. And we forged a very close relationship with NATO, as did actually Sweden. And I think the basic thinking for both countries was that, let's be as NATO-compatible as possible so that on a rainy day, if necessary, we can join. And that certainly now happened. Finland becoming the fastest ever member. Sweden will be the second fastest. So, it is significant. But for us, you know, security policy is basically existential. So, we're quite quick at turning the tide when need be. And that's what we did basically on the 24th of February last year.",

He wanted to Russify Ukraine and became European. He wanted to split Europe, never seen it more united. He wanted to split NATO. Well, it has new -- rejuvenated its course. And the icing on the cake, of course, is that Finland and Sweden join NATO as the 31st and 32nd members. And I think, especially for your American audience, it's very important to understand that there's a steadfast and strong belief in the alliance that we have with the United States. We are now signing and working on a so- called DCA agreement with the U.S. which is a defense corporation agreement. So, I think it's pretty much a two-way street.

Here, former Russian submarine commander Stanislav Rzhevsky runs his usual route at the usual time, but with a new unnoticed companion on a bicycle. Moments later, he was gunned down. Ukrainian defense intelligence said they had noting to do with it, but they knew a lot about it, saying he had been shot seven times with a Makarov pistol, and heavy rain meant no witnesses. Brzezinski commanded a Russian submarine accused of many attacks on civilians, Ukraine also said, although his family reportedly denied that. Ukraine added later, perhaps sarcastically, that he had been killed by his own men, who refused to kill Ukrainian civilians. Russia was quick to respond with their own propaganda, claiming to have captured the gunman within hours. Video, we can't verify. But it was a crude bid to show they are in control of the fate of their top brass after now, weeks of chaos. Russian media said the killing hinged on a clumsy detail, that Rzhevsky (ph) had made his daily run public on the running app Strava, which has a long history of accidentally exposing the location of people who don't want to be found, revealing U.S. military bases in Syria and Yemen five years ago.

What are your thoughts? NATASHA CHEN, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Zain, that's certainly what SAG-AFTRA says happened. Their negotiations went on for quite some time. This was actually an extension of the original deadline, and even a federal mediator was brought in yesterday, but that did not seem to work. Now, the Actors Guild, 160,000 members, had previously overwhelmingly authorized a strike if there was no deal reached, and so now we are waiting for the union's national board to vote on that strike to begin. We expect that announcement noon in Los Angeles. I want to read you a little bit of what the guild said in their statement that studios and streamers have implemented massive unilateral changes in our industry's business model, while at the same time insisting on keeping our contracts frozen and amber. The studios and streamers have underestimated our members' resolve as they are about to fully discover. Now, while the actors and the writers, who, by the way, have been on strike for more than 70 days, are definitely in lockstep here with what they are asking for, better residual pay, better compensation protections when it comes to A.I. threatening their work, there are executives and members of the studios who say that their demands are not realistic, and that includes Disney CEO Bob Iger.

You know, the Nigerian constitution doespromote gender equality on paper, but of course women still suffer so much in terms of marginalization and bias. And completely, they're completely left out of the political conversation, if you will. There's a disproportionate effect of poverty on women as well. Change is slow in Nigeria. And even though you have, you know, politicians who can change laws, implicit bias. Implicit bias and stereotyping is so much harder to combat. Where do you begin on that front?",

I think we actually showed pictures of you in Borno State.Just to sort of remind our viewers, Borno State is where Chibok is. That is where that kidnapping, the famous kidnapping in Chibok took place back in 2014. We know that there are at least 98 girls, just under 100 girls that are still in captivity. And since the Chibok kidnappings, several, many more countless abductions have taken place since then. You've got so many parents who are in anguish. So, when you list out all the things that need to change, is security, pretty much the most important, especially in northern Nigeria, is security the most important building block in terms of eventually reaching equity between both genders?",

And it's really important for girls especially because we have heard about these cases,these incidents have happened where conflicts and insurgencies have impacted girls. Girls have been kidnapped, as well. I came to Nigeria back in 2014 when I heard about the Chibok girls. And, you know, we are happy that some girls have returned, as well. And, you know, just hearing their stories, how they have made it universities and they're following their career path, as well. So, that gives you a lot of hope that, you know, what a girl is able to do when she's -- when she gets the opportunity to complete her education. And when I hear like the stories of four or five girls, I -- it gives me a lot of hope. But I also want to remind everyone that there's nothing that can stop a girl. We just need to make sure that she gets this equal opportunity to get her education, to be able to complete her studies and choose a path for herself. This is the right of every girl, whether she's out of Nigeria, south of Nigeria, whether she's in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Brazil, U.K., in any part of the world. We need to live in a world where every girl gets this chance. Right now, there are up to 120 million girls who do not have access to education, and there are millions of boys, as well. But at the same time, we know that gender plays a critical role for why girls are out of school. We have issues like child marriage. We also have issues like the menstrual hygiene and safety. So, there are specific issues that girls are facing because of which they are seeing either less involvement into schools or drop out, as well, later on. So, we need to address the issues that girls face. We also need to make sure that there is on the supply side, we are providing schools and infrastructure and the facilities to them so that they're able to learn and lead. And so, that's the dream that I have.",

I think Afghanistanwill be collapsing if they leave half of the population from their basic right to work and to education. So, it has been up to two years now, this year, that girls' education has been banned. Women cannot go to universities anymore. Women are banned from work, as well. And just this fundamental right of education is taken away, and they're adding more to it, like including now salons and other things, as well. So, I think, just looking at what the women are going through, we can call it a gender apartheid, as well, because women are completely isolated, segregated, and they're completely left behind just because of their gender. And there is no justification for these acts under culture or under Islam. I have the same faith and I come from the same culture, as well. And I am, you know, I want to say that, that is what -- that is not what defines us. That's not who we are. And I want to say that within our culture, within our religion, a girl is able to complete her education, follow her dreams, do take a job. And we look at other Muslim countries as well, like no other Muslim country would ban education for girls. Of course, there are challenges. Of course, there are other issues, as well. But it's, you know, we can, with time, we can address those. But in Afghanistan, it's a complete reversal. I hope that leaders and people will speak out. And what gives me a little bit of hope in this time is the bravery and courage of Afghan women and girls who are not remaining silent and who are speaking out. I think it's time that we listen to them and we make no compromise on their rights. It should be a non-negotiable condition in any conversations that the rights of girls and women are protected.",

Thousands of businesses and homes were destroyed. While in northern India, an estimated 30,000 people have left their homes, forced to flee rising water. At least 67 people there have died from flash floods and landslides this week. And Europe is bracing for a sweltering July with the islands of Sicily and Sardinia possibly hitting the hottest temperatures ever recorded on the continent. And the sizzling temperatures in China caused the country to break a record in its electricity use earlier this week. The NOAA just released its global report saying the earth saw its warmest June on record. Meteorologist Derek Van Dam is in Miami, Florida, where they've been experiencing a heat dome. Normally, I love Miami, Derek, but I'm guessing it's a little bit too hot even for me. How brutal is it right now?",

We actually had someone within our crew this morning that had heat stress issues, as well, and had to go to the emergency room. So, we are feeling the effects. People here are trying to beat the heat as best as possible. We're at the beach in Miami, but you know, we're here because records are being shattered across the globe from Florida where I'm located all the way to California. In Miami -- in Miami Beach, in particular, we have had, get this, 33 days of a heat index, that's what it feels like on your skin when you factor in air temperature and humidity, over 32 degrees Celsius for the past 33 days. That's the longest streak that has ever, ever occurred to me. So, that's saying something. And you know, when we start talking about these records, this isn't a new phenomenon but what's interesting is that it's becoming more of the norm, right? So, the climate emergency is here, it is now. And I want to bring your attention to these water temperatures that we are feeling here in the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. Record-high temperatures that, hey, you know what? This isn't even bath water, this is hot tub water. We're talking about water temperatures at 37 degrees Celsius or 97 degrees Fahrenheit. That is rivaling some of the hottest temperatures in our oceans across the entire globe. And this has serious ramifications for the marine life and the coral reefs that protect our coastline. So, we went and talked to an expert on coral restoration, Dr. Andrew Baker, and asked him what he thinks is coming our way. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANDREW BAKER, PHD., PROFESSOR, MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY, UM ROSENSTIEL SCHOOL:  Certain parts of the Caribbean like Belize are already bleaching and bleaching pretty severely. And Florida is where Belize was about a month ago. So, all things being equal, this bleaching event will develop and it's beginning to encompass Florida, too, and that's what we're worried about.
