Including ballots from U.S. service members serving abroad as well as their family members. The Washington Post spoke with veteran and active-duty service members after reporting on this initially to get reaction.And Iraq War veteran Allison Jaslow, who's the head of the nonprofit Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America said, quote, Literally, these are the people who are putting it all on the line for what we have in America. And we're going to compromise their ability to have a say in how they vote for who sends them to war? It's just beyond the pale. Democratic congressman and army veteran, Pat Ryan, whose district includes West Point calls it: An attempt to disenfranchise literal active-duty military members who are overseas, risking their life for our country. And retired four-star Army General, Joseph Votel, reportedly: Compared it to a hostage-taking of the votes of men and women who have taken an oath to protect the U.S. Constitution. Joining us now is Amy Gardner. She is one of the journalists behind that article. She is a national reporter for The Washington Post and covers voting on the Post's democracy team. Amy, first, let's start with the premise of these challenges here. Has there been fraud within this population?",

The population overseas is dominated by non-military, and those do skew Democratic.

I don't think there's any question that there is a political motive here.But the other thing is that even if they don't succeed, I think that these series of lawsuits do the same thing that a lot of the activities of the RNC and the Trump campaign around the integrity of the election are doing. And that is sowing chaos, sowing mistrust in our elections, which, you know, potentially plants the seeds for civil unrest, even violence, after the election should Donald Trump lose.",

She's also an Air Force veteran. She is quoted in this story of Amy's. [15:35:00] Congresswoman, it is worth noting that Pennsylvania does not require overseas voters to provide identification like a passport or driver's license. There isn't a record of fraud when it comes to this population of voters. But what do you say to your Republican colleagues who see a problem with that ID issue? REP. CHRISSY HOULAHAN (D-PA): What I say or what I see is that they're running scared and that they are so scared that they are not going to be winning in the next 20 or so days, that they are literally disenfranchising the very people who have raised their hand and sworn an oath to the Constitution to serve us, to allow us to be able to have this right to vote. I am appalled and offended that six of my Republican colleagues in Pennsylvania have authored this legislation in Pennsylvania. And to me, the biggest indication of them being scared of the results of this election is the disenfranchisement of tens of thousands of voters.",

This is about creating roadblocks and obstacles to validating this election. Of those six people who authored this piece of legislation -- this lawsuit, all six of them voted against certifying the last election. But all six of them are sitting in Congress right now in seats that those votes allowed them to win their office with. And so it's horrific what they're trying to accomplish.

And I know that my dad and my mom had to mail in ballots at that point in time. And I know they took their responsibility very seriously as residents of Florida at the time. And so I guess I'm embarrassed. I have no other way of explaining this other than the fact that those same people were the people on the very wee hours of January 7th who were explaining that they were going to vote to not certify the election and instead to not certify it, but again, to take the oath of office, to take their seat in the House of Representatives, which is just crazy.",

And that's exactly what they'd like to accomplish. And that's exactly why they're filing this suit right now. And I'll share with you that I have a daughter who lives overseas, and one of my dearest friends and his wife live overseas, all American citizens, all voting from overseas in this way.

Frazier told me that DEI is really about finding opportunities to identify hidden talent and disadvantaged talent in a world where not everybody has the same chance for opportunities.So companies that roll back on their commitment to diversity are going to limit equal opportunities for people who face barriers because of their skin color or the neighborhood they grew up in or the school they went to. And there's also, guys, there's also significant business risk for companies that pull back on DEI. DEI is good for the bottom line, research shows. So it boosts financial performance. It attracts talent. It makes employees more motivated. So companies that are reversing themselves on their commitments to diversity are taking big challenges here.",
