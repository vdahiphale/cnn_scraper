Every one of you talked about what you have to do, every one I talked to about having to reach out, talked about, whether or not they were a Jew or a Muslim, reach out. And, you know, I've often said I remember the first time that I was in Israel with Golda Meir. She was just before the Six-Day War. And she was telling me how terrible everything was, which it was. She kept flipping the maps up and down behind her. And all of the sudden, she looked at me, and she said, would you like a photograph? And I thought, that's unusual. And she just got up and walked out that door outside her office. And we're standing there having a photograph taken like you and I are standing, looking at the press. And she -- without looking at me, she turned and she -- like this, and she said, you look worried, Senator. I said, I am. She said, don't worry, we Jews have a secret weapon in our fight, we have no place else to go. Well, the truth of the matter is, if there weren't an Israel, we'd have to invent one. The truth of the matter is that I believe that -- as I went home and said, I got in trouble at the time, but it was true, you don't have to be a Jew to be a Zionist. You don't have to be a Jew to be a Zionist. And I think the security and safety of Jews worldwide is anchored in the re -- the continued vibrance of the State of Israel. That's what I think it's about at its core. And so, I've admired you all, this country for so long. And I'm convinced that the more people know the -- your responses to what's happening as opposed to just what war and peace is about, the more they're going to be inclined embrace Israel. And -- but I have a lot more to say. But I'd like to talk to you in private, if I can. (CROSSTALK)",

He is here to also try and have conversations to try and figure out a humanitarian corridor for those who are in Gaza suffering from the airstrikes and the dire consequences of the Israeli blockade there were -- they don't have enough water, food, or fuel.

With us now CNN military analyst retired Lieutenant General Mark Hertling. General, thank you. This is the location of the hospital in Gaza right now just so people get a sense of what it looked like before. This is the overall campus.And as I said, the IDF released what they call evidence that this was caused by Islamic Jihad what the U.S. calls a terror group operating inside Gaza. And one of the pieces of evidence that they provided was this radar trajectory of rockets they say launched from Gaza. Explain what we're seeing here. LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: What we're seeing is the lines of several rockets coming from a launcher. This is called a point of origin in military speak. They normally go to a point of impact. And this is what the Iron Dome uses to intercept rockets. They see where they're going. And then they intercept them if they're going into a populated area. But what happens, John, and a lot of time with some of these rockets, because they're not real technologically advanced, they will just fall out of the sky. And what I mean by that is the engine will stop. And as soon as they do that a rocket has the trajectory of a brick. So it immediately goes a little bit further and then just drops down. But an important factor to consider when that happens, it still has rocket fuel inside the rocket. So it not only has the explosive warhead, it has fuel behind it. What happened, the indicators are or what the Israelis are saying is one of those rockets came out, lost its engine, lost its forward propulsion and just dropped out of the sky and it dropped near this Al-Ahli Hospital, which is on the southwest side of the city of Gaza.",

But we're always going to confirm or deny within the Defense Department. And I said this earlier today, that there has to be more to this. And I think the U.S. government has what we call, Mason (ph), intelligence from satellites, from signals that show launches.We have that capability. So as much as you're going to get a tactical approach to this point of origin point of aim, which is pretty significant, you're going to have an overhead platform that sees a missile burn when it takes off, or when something explodes and comes out of the sky that reinforces.",

They don't hit the targets. These are not precision weapons, these are aerial weapons. So you're not saying, hey, I'm going to hit that particular point on the ground.

In 2014 when Israel went into Gaza, the war stopped basically because of the amount of civilian casualties. But it's also Hamas's approach. It's their strategic objectives. Number one, kill a lot of Jews. Number two, embarrassed the nation of Israel.This is a factor in embarrassing the nation of Israel early on. The Hamas Ministry of Health last night immediately said that this was an Israeli attack. Israel, you know, kind of hemmed and hawed for a little while, but then they said early last night, we have information. We're going to send it out shortly, as soon as we get it translated and compiled. They did that later. There's a lot of compelling facts. And again, it's a back and forth not just facts but emotions.

There were no injuries there. And it is not clear who exactly launched the drones. But such attacks, they say are frequently attributed to Iran or Iranian-backed militants in the region. The news comes of course, as American embassies have been facing protests in a number of Middle East countries because of the war in Gaza.Right now in Beirut, the capital of Lebanon, hundreds of protesters are gathered in the streets as they were overnight. This is video I think of overnight, they tried to break through security barriers near the U.S. Embassy. And these are live. OK, so I can't -- it's difficult for me to see where I'm -- from my vantage point. But yes, these are live pictures happening right now. You see lots of smoke, you see people in the streets. They are clearly, clearly terribly upset about what is happening next door to Lebanon in Gaza. In particular you can hear the chants, hundreds of people. Let's bring in CNN's Ben Wedeman who is in South Lebanon live for us. Ben, can you just give us a sense of what you've been seeing on the ground? And what you've been hearing from your sources about these protests?",
