If you're celebrating at home, we begin with this brutal weather storm keeping its grip on most of the country. At least 22 deaths are blamed on the storm and more than a quarter of a million people are without electricity.The weather is causing travel headaches across the country. More than 3,400 flights were canceled yesterday and another 1,200 have been canceled so far today. New York Governor Kathy Hochul is sending more help -- to help hard-hit Buffalo. Hochul says she will ask the federal government for a declaration of emergency. CNN's Polo Sandoval has more. POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Here in Buffalo, New York, what is widely considered as ground zero of this massive winter storm driving around is not only treacherous, itis still prohibited, especially for nonessential reasons. And this is one of the reasons why. This is a scene that repeats itself. According to officials, not only here in Buffalo, but throughout the region, you have vehicles that have basically been abandoned. And so what authorities are going to do through the evening and also into Christmas Day, they will continue working around the clock, making sure that anybody that needs rescuing gets the attention they need. The mayor of the city of Buffalo on Saturday afternoon estimating that there could be as many as 200 people still stranded in and around the city. On Friday night, they rescued roughly 65 individuals. And sadly, on Saturday, the mayor confirming the death of an individual who was found unconscious on a sidewalk here in Buffalo. And he says he shared with CNN what is a grim prediction that when everything is said and done, that that death toll could potentially rise. And that's what's feeling concerns and a call for people to wake up Christmas morning at home. Sheltering in place, since any potential relief insight may not come for quite some time.

The ruling marks a major defeat for Lake, who built her candidacy on her support for former PresidentTrump's, lies about fraud in the 2020 presidential election. And finally, hundreds of surfing Santas hit the waves in Cocoa Beach, Florida, on Saturday. They braved the water despite unseasonably cold temperatures on Christmas Eve. The Santas hold this event to raise money for two charities. They have it every year. One of these charities helps people with transportation costs when they're trying to go to these cancer treatments. And another helps preserve the history of surfing on the East Coast.

CNN Business Reporter Nathaniel Meyersohn joining us now to talk about this.Nathaniel, good to see you. So, start off by telling us about dollar store profits and what's driving their strong sales. NATHANIEL MEYERSOHN, CNN Right So America is really a nation of dollar stores. Dollar General Sales last quarter increased 6.8 percent. While Dollar Tree its rival sales were up 6.5 percent. So, really strong numbers last quarter from the dollar stores. And it's a continuation of trends we've seen really over the past decade. More recently, inflation is driving more shoppers to dollar stores. Wealthier customers are trading down to try to save on groceries and essentials while dollar -- while the dollar stores core lower-income shoppers are relying on them more as well.

And how is it trying to win back customers on tight budgets as we're talking about? MEYERSOHNAnd it has a new strategy to win back shoppers. It's going to start lowering prices about five percent, which is not something that most companies are doing right now. Most are raising prices. They're also adding new merchandise into stores.
