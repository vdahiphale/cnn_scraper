      "sentences": "We have some breaking news right now, the judge in Donald Trump's hush money cover up trial is considering several motions for the defense and will rule at any moment on Mr. Trump's motion for mistrial. The judge has also just denied Mr. Trump's request to modify his gag order. CNN Chief Legal Affairs Correspondent Paula Reid is here along with Jeremy Saland, a former prosecutor for the Manhattan DA's office.While we watch for these defense motions to play out, here's one of the things going on. Merchan is saying of Susan Necheles, why on earth she wouldn't object to the mention of a condom. I don't understand. This is because Susan Necheles said that it was a dog whistle to mention that Donald Trump had sex with Stormy Daniels, allegedly, although he disputes it, without a condom, a dog whistle for rape. Some of the headlines coming in from the courtroom right now as the judge discusses this motion for mistrial. The judge said in going back to the very opening statements, Mr. Blanche, the defense attorney, in your opening statement, you denied there was ever a sexual encounter between Stormy Daniels and the defendant. And that is the point that he's raising there, Paula Reid and Jeremy, is that by denying it, you put her credibility at issue. And by doing that, you opened the door for the prosecution to ask her to tell the story. Is that right?",

And it's interesting, the judge revealed that he's going back and actually reviewing the transcript. He looked at the whole transcript from Tuesday and he said he was satisfied with what came in. He admonished them for not making more objections.So it doesn't appear that they're going to win on this motion for a mistrial. We didn't expect that. It's something they have to do, but it doesn't look good for them right now. JEREMY SALAND, FORMER PROSECUTOR, MANHATTAN DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE: Yes, they're not winning. And I think to your point, Paula, he's going back, he's reading the transcript, he's certainly on top of his game. He knows what they said and didn't say. And again, why didn't you object to this point? You didn't object to it. And then you open the door to start out of the gate, that's on you.",

These are some of the details that Trump's team was -- is now objecting to, that they slept in separate rooms, that he didn't wear a condom, that he didn't ask her at the time to keep it confidential.

Cabinet secretaries would call her, they would reach out to her, but also her proximity physically to the resolute desk where the president would take his meetings throughout the day. She could see him.She could likely hear conversations if the door was open. She's somebody who was well liked in Trump world. I don't have a bad thing to say about Maddie. She also -- I think she's somebody who presents very well. That came through in what were hearing, she's smiling to the jury. She's, you know, acknowledging the former president.

The closure of the crossings means no fuel, it means no trucks, no generators, no water, no electricity and no movement of people or goods. It means no aid. Our supplies are stuck.

He lived for taking care of her and his 10-year- old sister, Harmony, and his 16-year-old brother, Andre. He got injured when he was on a tour in Kuwait, serving our country from trying to load stuff on a plane accident. He said, mom, I thought I was going to die. But he told her I couldn't die because I had to live for you and my little sister and my little brother, I got to be there for you all. That's the kind of person he was.
