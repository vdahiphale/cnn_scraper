With just 16 days remaining, campaigns are starting to make their final pitches to voters, especially in key battleground states that will decide and who wins the White House. Today, former president Donald Trump is in Pennsylvania. He is set to hold a town hall there next hour, but earlier today, he stopped by a McDonald's outside Philadelphia to work the fry cooker, as you see you right there, getting some one-on-one. His visit comes on the heels of a campaign rally in the Keystone State last night, where his love of legendary golfer Arnold Palmer came up in a very odd kind of way. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: But Arnold Palmer was all man. And I say that in all due respect to women. And I love women. But this guy, this guy, this is a guy that was all man. When he took showers with the other pros, they came out of there. They said, oh, my god. That's unbelievable. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, Fred, we're expecting former president Trump to continue the focus that he and his campaign wants to emphasize in these final weeks of the campaign, call Vice President Harris a failure when it comes to her and the Biden administration, but also trying to hit home on issues like inflation, the economy.But what we saw today in this, as you said, final sprint really until election day is also a blanketing of Pennsylvania. Earlier former president Trump stopped in purple Bucks County, that's an all- important Philadelphia suburb, to go to a McDonald's and cook some fries. We saw him don an apron, put fried in the fryer. The reason that former president Trump is making this stop not only to try and appeal to working class voters, which will be key to former president Trump's coalition if he hopes to win the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, but also to needle the Harris campaign because he has been saying without proof that Harris never actually worked at McDonalds, even know Vice President Harris has previously said that she worked for McDonald's back when she was younger. The campaign emphasizing that she worked specifically in a McDonald's in Alameda, California, back in 1983 over the summer when she was a college student. So that's why we're seeing the former president Trump in that particular environment today. But I want to point to last night. You mentioned it. It was a rambling rally in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, in western -- the western part of the state. There was that strange digression about Arnold Palmer, but then there was also vulgarity when it came to referring to his opponent, Vice President Harris. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

These are scattering of events of Vice President Harris, two of them, that aim to mobilize black voters. Democrats are routinely criticized for taking black voters for granted. They are the base of the Democratic Party, but the campaign they really don't engage in that. They argue that black voters are persuadable voters and they have to do all that they can to convince them just like any other part of the Democratic coalition. So take a listen to what she told congregants. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS (D), VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It is constantly about berating people and belittling people and name calling. And I think we of faith, we who believe in our country and love our country, know that we each as individuals and as a community have the power to make decisions through these next 16 days that will be about a statement about what kind of country do we want to live in.

And so that really is key to her argument here, that the president, the former president rather is unfit for the presidency.And Fred, I see it as a message trying to appeal to a broad swath of the electorate because there are going to be some voters that don't agree with her on every policy matter, but they may agree with this argument that the former president is just unhinged -- Fred. WHITFIELD: All right. Eva McKend, thank you so much. All right. So both campaigns are encouraging supporters to turn out for early voting.

So we have been razor-focused in making sure that we're getting the message out about the importance to vote and we're a bipartisan organization. We work with both sides, but the reality, we want to make sure that our students are prepared. So we've started this campaign with our national black alumni foundation in 2021.We've also partnered with the Eastern Area Links Incorporated to help again students to understand their rights as it relates to voting and importance of getting out and vote. We're not telling people who to vote for. But we're encouraging them to go and learn about the rules, especially some of the rules that have changed since the Supreme Court allows some of the rules to be changed because, you know, students died fighting for the right for our students. HBCU students have led the way in that arena in the early '60s. We actually started campaigning, you'll remember that sit-in on North Carolina A&amp;T campus in 1960 that kind of sparked the Civil Rights Movement. So HBCU students have played a critical role in helping this country move forward. So therefore our responsibility at the Thurgood Marshall College Fund has continued that legacy of pushing and encouraging and educating our students.",

It wasn't something that was handed to African-Americans in this country. We actually had to fight for it. We have to fight for it in many, many ways through the Civil Rights Movement. So it's important for the next generation to understand that.You know, at the Thurgood Marshall College Fund, we have a slogan. It says education pays off. And part of our mission is to make sure that we're educating not only the HBCU community, but the whole entire nation about responsibilities and what historically black colleges have done for this country. You know, without HBCUs, it wouldn't be the black middle-class as we know it today. So we know that HBCU students are leaders. We know that HBCUs are located in some of the most, you know, challenging communities and it's our responsibility to get in there and help continue to educate people on responsibility to get out and vote because -- not only at the national level, but also in the local elections. So we want to make sure that our students understand all the rules that are out there. We don't want anyone to get there and say, I didn't know they switched it. Some states are requiring that you have a voter I.D. Want to make sure they know this. So this campaign that we're working with our HBCUs, we represent about 80 percent of all historically black colleges and universities which is about 300,000 students. So we believe in getting out and encouraging and educating and making sure that we are leading in this effort in a positive way.",

And what we heard from our students, this is, you know, we all want to know how it's going to benefit us in the long run. So these duties are a large percentage of our students. Students in America, they have a lot of debt. And that debt to go to college, and they take out loans.And they want to make sure there's a process in place that we can forgive some of these loans because a lot of our students are first in their family to go to college, first in their family to experience corporate America, and the financial burden that sometimes its placed on students when they take out loans can prohibit them from competing and participate in American way of life, like buying a home. They want to make sure that the candidates are talking about what they're going to do to support how to reduce the college debt, provide opportunities for maybe scholarships to support students to continue their education. So they are listening. But another piece of the puzzle that they are interested in is infrastructure resources to support not only historically black college and universities, but all universities at the federal level. So those some of the things that some of our students are talking about. They are and listening. I can tell you this. They are engaged, they are fully engaged in this process.",

According to Walter Rabon, the commissioner of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, the gangway that led from the dock to the ferry collapsed when about 40 people were on it.
