SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: So, first, this is a bad season for RSV. People are hearing this. It's 10 times the hospitalizations as compared to the two years pre-COVID. Just to give you some scale here, that is really significant. They've been testing this particular vaccine in pregnant women, 7,400 pregnant women. The idea is that a pregnant woman, while they themselves may not be vulnerable to this, they can pass the antibodies they get as a result of the vaccine onto their newborn. And what they're finding is pretty impressive. They're trying to figure out how likely is this vaccine going to protect the newborn babies. They find, within the first few months of life about, 82 percent effective. Keep in mind, there's no vaccine right now. So this is 82 percent against no other alternative right now. And 70 percent effective for the first six months of life. That's what they're finding so far. Again, 7,400 women. The company, Pfizer, believes it is strong enough to apply for approval. We're only getting this data from the company so far. This has to be independently vetted. But it seems pretty promising. There are a few other vaccines out there in development. A couple are designed to target older people who are also vulnerable to this disease and to young people. But this is the one specifically for moms to pass on to the babies.",

In HIV/AIDS, 40 years, we still don't have a vaccine. It can take a while.They tried to make a vaccine for this in the '60s and the vaccine failed. They found was that vaccinated children were more likely to get sick because of certain things, the way the vaccine was working. Now they've been able to isolate what is called the F-protein. Think about that the way we had about the spike protein for an mRNA vaccine for COVID. That has been sort of the key breakthrough here. So again, if the data holds up, again, which sounds promising, that same sort of technology has allowed them to do this now.",

Congresswoman Debbie Dingell represents a district there in Michigan. She is with us now. Good to have you. Let's start here with the message the president is taking to Floridians. His first event is about Social Security and Medicare. But when he gets to the rally, to the big stage, he's focusing on the mega MAGA Republicans, as he calls them. Is that the message he should be driving home with just seven days left? REP. DEBBIE DINGELL (D-MI): Well, I think what he's trying to drive home, what I know he's driving home, is the contrast. And it's good to be with you, by the way. The contrast between Republicans and Democrats. Not only on substance, about what they are, how they have voted against lowering the cost of insulin, lowering the cost of drug to many people. We can go through a list of that. I think that, while I am very strong that all of us have to stand up wherever we see it, there are noticeable things in the last 72 hours that I find deeply disturbing in the way that people are framing what happened to Paul Pelosi. What is framing, how it is being framed across this country of what is OK and what is not OK. I don't want to see any person hurt, period. Republican, Democrat, far left, far right. But I think that some of the inflammatory language over the last 72 hours is deeply disturbing as well.",

I think it is inappropriate and particularly maybe he thought it was funny last week when you put a gun out there protecting your Second Amendment. But then do a switch and says fire Pelosi. Look, there's a line. I think we are normalizing unacceptable behavior. It has been seeping into our communities.

I think our Capitol Police are trying very hard to keep us safe every day and they do need more resources. But what we are seeing is not just happening at our level. At the federal level. My school board members and school board members across the country are wearing bullet-proof vests. My state legislators are wearing bulletproof vests at the state capitol, which was before January 6th occurred with assault weapons.
