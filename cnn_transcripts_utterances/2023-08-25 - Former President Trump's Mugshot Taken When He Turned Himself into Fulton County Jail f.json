He turned himself in on those 13 felony charges for trying to overturn his election loss in Georgia. This is Trump's fourth arrest in just five months, but it's the first time he's had his mugshot taken.

He believes that it is beneath him, and that is what multiple Trump sources have told me.But when it comes to that mugshot, it is no surprise that this was somewhat staged, that he had several conversations with advisors about how exactly to make himself look. Would it be smiling? Should it be, as you said, defiant. And that is what they landed on. And just a reminder here, when he was arraigned in New York and they talked about him into that courthouse, they spent a long time talking about what exactly his facial expressions would be then. Donald Trump cares about the perception of Donald Trump. And one thing that I thought was very interesting is we normally hear him talking about, saying this is election interference, saying that he is defiant. But he did talk openly about the experience at the Fulton County jail, saying it wasn't a good one. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT:  Terrible experience.

And I'll tell you that in Georgia on the ground, there are elected Republicans who are pushing that narrative every day.

I think each defendant is really going to take stock of where they stand, what kind of pressure they are on, and how they see the evidence and how it holds up against them, because they are all going to be not similarly situated. But I think it's a really strategic choice. Going quickly has its down sides. That's less time to consider the evidence, perhaps less time for making pretrial motions. You really don't have the same amount of time to structure your case and build the best defense possible. But taking his time has its downside as well. It makes it more likely you're going to end up at trial potentially with former President Trump, which I think is the worst-case scenario if you are one of those other defendants, because that means the full scope of this case is going to be on display for a jury, and you are going to be right there next to the former president, and that's always tough.

Whatever happens in this first trial, assuming it goes as expected, that doesn't have any binding presidential value. Every jury trial stands on its own. But you can bet they're going to be watching.And as a prosecutor, I was borderline obsessed with trying everyone at once. I wanted to get it over with, I wanted to show the jury the whole scope, I didn't want to chop up the case into little bits.
