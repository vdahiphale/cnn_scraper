Trump with conspiring to defraud the United States, conspiring to disenfranchise voters, and conspiring and attempting to obstruct an official proceeding.The indictment was issued by a grand jury of citizens here in the District of Columbia. And it sets forth the crimes charged in detail. I encourage everyone to read it in full. The attack on our nation's Capitol on January 6, 2021, was an unprecedented assault on the seat of American democracy. As described in the indictment, it was fueled by lies, lies by the defendant targeted at obstructing a bedrock function of the US government, the nation's process of collecting, counting and certifying the results of the presidential election. The men and women of law enforcement who defended the US Capitol on January 6 are heroes. There are patriots and they are the very best of us. They did not just defend a building or the people sheltering in it. They put their lives on the line to defend who we are as a country and as a people. They defended the very institutions and principles that define the United States. Since the attack on our Capitol, the Department of Justice has remained committed to ensuring accountability for those criminally responsible for what happened that day. This case is brought consistent with that commitment. And our investigation of other individuals continues. In this case, my office will seek a speedy trial, so that our evidence can be tested in court and judged by a jury of citizens. In the meantime, I must emphasize that the indictment is only an allegation and that the defendant must be presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law. I would like to thank the members of the Federal Bureau of Investigation who are working on this investigation with my office, as well as the many career prosecutors and law enforcement agents from around the country who have worked on previous January 6 investigations. These women and men are public servants of the very highest order, and it is a privilege to work alongside them. Thank you. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That was not a surprise.What was a surprise, especially because three of these are conspiracy charges, is the fact that under his name, there's about six inches, and it's blank. The fact that no one else was charged, while they did list six co-conspirators, it was still somewhat surprising that no one else was charged today, but of course, we know the investigation continues. And lastly, there's not a lot of new information here. This has been this issue, this day, the lead up to January 6 has been exhaustively investigated, and there are not many new details. And unlike the Mar-a-Lago indictment where you have the sensational pictures, you had a pretty, at times just shocking and somewhat entertaining story, really supporting some very serious criminal charges.

Obviously, we will be asking him those questions of what exactly that looks like because we know John Laura, his new attorney who has only been added to the team in recent weeks, he and Todd Blanche are going to be the ones who are handling this case now that it has become actual charges that have been brought down. And so I think it's a question of what Thursday actually looks like, but we've already seen what Trump has been saying online, if you want to guess what he is going to be saying over the next 48 hours or so. I will note the what's different here about this indictment, these federal charges that he's facing, is that the indictment was unsealed almost immediately. You've got to read through it yourself and see what is laid out here in detail by Jack Smith and his team. Anderson, that wasn't the case the last time Trump was indicted. I mean, of course, you and I were on air that night when he told us about the indictment in the documents investigation. There was a kind of a vacuum where we had not seen the indictment yet. And so it was Trump's legal team who were kind of filling the void there making their argument before we saw the government's argument.

So let's just talk about some of what's in this indictment. First of all, we should note, Dana. What is being alleged is no short of a criminal conspiracy. And in fact, it really resembles in many ways that closing statement we heard from then Congresswoman Liz Cheney, about the degree to which this was not just happenstance and it wasn't just chaos. It was a concerted effort with many conspiracists coming up with various ways to try to overturn the results of a free and fair election.",

That, for example, that Georgia, that there were dead voters or that the votes were not being brought in from nowhere. His own chief-of-staff telling him that a specific claim about Georgia votes was not true, and then the very next day, he goes out and amplifies or spreads those false claims, or in some cases, very shortly after something has been told to people, Trump or co- conspirators in this case, that they that those things were untrue. You know, you know, Rudy Giuliani, who is sort of unnamed as a co- conspirator here, picks up the phone and calls state lawmakers and says, I need you to do this, I need you to cast more doubt on the election results. So they're really detailing, not just words, I think what we are already hearing from Trump's lawyers is that how are they going to prove that Trump didn't just genuinely believe that, that he wasn't just using his First Amendment rights, so to speak. What the what the special counsel does in the indictment is say, he was told first of all, by people close to him who he trusted and then he went out and did things, not just said things, but did things that are alleged here to be violations of the law.",

In between, of course, he did sell a book in which he did give some of his for profit, his version of events.Pence today issued a statement and I'd like to read some of it. I'm not sure if we have the full screen ready. He said: \"Today's indictment serves an important reminder. Anyone who puts himself over the Constitution should never be president of the United States. Our country is more important than one man. Our Constitution is more important than any one man's career. On January 6, former President Trump demanded that I choose between him and the Constitution, I chose the Constitution and I always will.\" Now look, Trump and his minions will note that Mike Pence might not even make the debate in August. He might not have enough support, but his statement is accurate. I mean, this is not a matter of opinion. I mean, the first part is, but the idea that the Constitution is supposed to be more important than any one man's career, that is empirically true.",

He has -- this is a narrow indictment of things where he thinks he can get a conviction, but Donald Trump is front and center from the very first page, just the way it's phrased that Trump \"enlisted co-conspirators.\" He is the boss of this, he is the one in charge.",

They organized and it said that the strategy, \"included causing the fraudulent electors to meet on the day appointed by federal law in which legitimate electors were to gather and cast their votes, cast fraudulent votes for Trump, signed certificates, falsely representing that they were legitimate electors.\" And then it says, \"Some of these fake electors,\" and I'm just quoting here, \"were tricked into participating based on the understanding that their votes would be used only if Trump succeeded in the lawsuits within their state, which he never did.
