      "sentences": "All right, there was a remarkable moment in a New York courtroom yesterday as Steve Bannon's attorney, David Schoen, pleaded with a Manhattan judge to relieve him from representing Bannon in his charity fraud case. As you know, that is Bannon facing charges for allegedly defrauding donors who gave money to a non-profit that said it wanted to build a wall on a southern border, but prosecutors say actually Bannon pocketed the money. He has pleaded not guilty to that. But he may now be without an attorney.David Schoen told the judge yesterday there was a complete breakdown of communication, and he can no longer defend Bannon in the case, saying that Bannon and his legal team have, quote, irreconcilable differences. The judge has granted Bannon until February 28th to find a new attorney and reportedly told Schoen that once the lawyer was found, quote, you never need to come back. So, joining us now to discuss this remarkable moment that played out is Steve Bannon's attorney, David Schoen. Maybe not his attorney for much longer in this case. He was also, we should note, former President Trump's defense lawyer during that second impeachment trial. Good morning, David, and thanks for being here. I guess the first question that I have for you is, when was the last time that you and Steve Bannon spoke?",

And when I take on a case, I need to be able to handle it in the way that I see appropriate.Frankly, you know, there was a bit of a breakdown in the D.C. trial. I disagreed with the trial strategy in the case. And so when the trial came, I refused to participate in the examination of witnesses and argument. I just handled the legal issues in that case, even though I had been hired to be the lead lawyer. But I, you know, I have to be sort of -- follow what I believe to be the appropriate defense in a case. And a lawyer has to be in sync with the client, frankly, for it to work effectively. And that's part of the rules of professional conduct as well.",

But I can't go into those details, of course, as I know you know. And Steve Bannon may well be right and I might be wrong in how the case should be approached, but it's his case and his life after all and he deserves to be able to proceed with a defense that he thinks is appropriate.",

      "sentences": "No, it's not a delay tactic. That's where the thing blew up yesterday, frankly. You know, the prosecutor in this case, they investigated the case for two years. They had, by their own account, 47 employees working on the case. They told us a trial -- we set a schedule based on representations they made in September and October. Then in November they produced a 20 terabyte hard drive which they produced secretly under a protective order without having ever reviewed it. And, you know, that's -- they characterized it as twice the print collection of the Library of Congress. So they asked for a 90-day extension.Yesterday, the prosecutor stood up and said, this is a delay tactic, judge. We already gave them 90 days. That's when I went emotional, let's say. And I said, judge, they've just omitted a major fact. They asked for the 90-day extension. And I said, and you know what you told them, judge, when they asked for it? You said, oh, you need 90 days, you've got it. So, that's what set the judge off. He called us up to the bench and he said, you know, something like, I don't approve of this conduct in my courtroom and you've insinuated I'm unfair. And I said, judge, let me say, you know, frankly, I think you're unfair. And so then I said, there was no point in dragging us up here. All you had us do was restate what I said in my letters to you. That was the problem going into the hearing. He had said - he issued an order saying he needed details showing good cause for the withdrawal. He's just wrong on the law. And when I saw in the newspaper they quoted him as saying I was wrong, he was just mimicking what I said. I said, judge,  you're absolutely wrong about the case. I've litigated right to counsel of choice cases for many, many years in different courts around the country. There's not a lot I know about many issues. That's an issue I've just done a lot of work on. And he wasn't correct on the law. Anyway.",

      "sentences": "Yes. So, this morning's number is, if we can get this to roll, zero. That's the number of NFL conference championship games at neutral sites in years past before a possible Chiefs versus Bills one in two weeks in Atlanta. It wouldn't take place in Kansas City or in Buffalo.Why is that? OK, why would a Chiefs/Bills game take place at a neutral site? The Bills would have hosted if the teams had the same record. They held the tie breaker because they beat the Chiefs in regular season. But the Chiefs have one more win and the same number of losses and the Bills couldn't lie the Chiefs because of the canceled games a few weeks ago between the Bengals and the Bills. So, essentially we're in unknown territory. This is very unique that's going on. Now, the question I have, is this neutral site of Atlanta truly neutral? I think the answer to that is yes. Why is that? Because both teams' home cities are 11 to 13 hours away by car, so the fans could drive down to Atlanta. Both cities have airports that have flights directly to Atlanta. Southwest, I believe, flies from Kansas City. Delta flies from Buffalo. So the fact is, the fans can get to the game. But I think is real question, Don, here is, what's the chance that this actually happens? OK. It's about a 52 percent chance of happening, so there's a better chance than not that we could actually have history. The Bills have to win their two next games. The Chiefs must win their next game. They have a bye this week. The Bills are playing Miami. And we'll see what happens, Don. But, to me, I love history. I love football. The two of those have come together here. And we're maybe making history. And, hey, maybe you and I can go down to Atlanta and also go down to (INAUDIBLE).",
