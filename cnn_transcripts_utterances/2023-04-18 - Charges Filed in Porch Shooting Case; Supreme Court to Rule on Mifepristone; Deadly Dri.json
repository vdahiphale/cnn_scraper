And he's still waiting for a bail hearing, actually. The judge who was supposed to hear that case is actually his neighbor. So they're still waiting to get a new judge in that case. But as far as the circumstances of this case, you kind of laid it out there. Authorities say that this group of kids who were in a car went down the driveway of Kevin Monahan, and realized, because cell service is so terrible in that area in Hebron in New York, that they were in the wrong area, and decided to turn around. And that's when shots were fired, allegedly, by Monahan, one striking this 20-year-old victim, Kaylin Gillis. And, actually, authorities say they had to drive almost five miles just to get to an area where they could get cell phone reception and call 911. And when paramedics arrived, she died at the scene.

He is, as you point out, facing two charges, the first of which, armed criminal action, could earn him three to 15 years behind bars. The more serious charge, which is first-degree felony assault, could see him spend the rest of his life in prison. Now, the community here has been demanding justice. You showed those pictures of his classmates, Ralph Yarl's classmates, staging that peaceful march today outside of their classroom. They're describing this as a unity walk. He's been loved by fellow classmates and teachers. He played four instruments, classmates describing him as a kind, smart young man, a humble man who did not brag. The incident unfolded on the porch of this home behind me. The teen, as you point out, made a mistake. He was supposed to be picking up his younger siblings at 115 Terrace. That home was actually a block away, the gray home past the yard behind me. This is 115th Street. We know, according to court documents, that Ralph Yarl rang the doorbell -- this is according to Lester, what he told the police -- on the evening of April 14. Lester said that he had just laid down to go to bed. He heard the bell rang. He grabbed his .32 caliber revolver and shot this man because he said he thought it was somebody trying to break in and he was afraid for his size.

As a result of that, what the DA did, that is, the district attorney, is, they prosecuted for the first-degree assault. What does that mean? The assault charge in the first-degree indicates that you were either attempting to kill him or attempting to inflict serious bodily injury. As a result of that, you get to that charge. With respect to armed criminal action, if you commit any felony, and you have a weapon, then there it goes. That meets with that. And to the extent that he could face life in jail, we know that is significant.

You have to -- at some point, if you're a defendant in a case, andyou're arguing self-defense, you have to lay out what you were defending. Were you defending yourself? And, if so, were you in immediate fear of death or serious physical injury? Well, certainly, depending upon the actions of the person who was -- you ultimately shot, you want to know what that individual was doing. So, if they didn't cross that threshold, what were you fearful of? What was the immediate threat that would compel you to discharge a firearm, not once to the head, but another to the arm? And so that's a critical issue. The other issue, Brianna, of course, is stand your ground. I just should note that stand your ground is not a license to kill. It's not a license to shoot. It's not \"I will shoot because I feel like it and the law protect me.\" It enables a person who believes that they're in immediate fear of death or serious injury to protect themselves. In the event that Mr. Yarl -- I shouldn't even say Mr. -- he's a boy. He's 16 years old. The reality is, what specifically was he doing that led you to discharge your weapon? If that can't be established, stand your ground doesn't apply. And guess what? If it doesn't apply, how else are you going to justify your actions?

And I want to tell you a little bit about the demographics that we're talking about right here. We have first 12 jurors in that primary jury pool and then 12 alternates. The judge said that he wanted a large amount of alternates because this trial is going to last very long. So anything could happen in terms of people getting sick. And in terms of the specific makeup, we have six men and six women on that primary jury of 12. And then, according to our report and Marshall Cohen, who has been inside of that courtroom, at least nine of those people are people of color. And I should remind you that all of these jurors are coming from New Castle County, where we are right here in Wilmington. Now, it's interesting. The judge was trying to implore the jury to try to shut out the outside world as long as you can, as much as you can when you're in this case. The judge -- the judge even saying to the jurors, \"You should fight human nature and avoid talking about this case before deliberations,\" and added, \"Don't let rumors, suspicion or anything else influence you in any way.\" But, of course, this is a media trial about media with all of the media out here. So it's going to be hard, you can imagine, for those jurors to truly sequester their minds from any outside content. But that's what we have today. And, again, the jury is set.

Now, as you noted, these issues, childcare, home care, paid leave, to some degree, were central elements of his sweeping legislative agenda in his first two years, central elements that did not make the cut, did not get across the finish line in the bills that ended up getting passed. And now, with Republicans in control of the House, no clear pathway now at all for those to move through legislatively, so the president is going to act via executive order. And what he's doing today has a couple of different pieces. The primary one is directing every single federal agency to try and find programs within the current scope of government, using the current funding streams, where they can think of grant programs, things like that, Medicare, Medicaid, where they can divert some of that money into lowering the cost of childcare, into incentivizing home care workers, childcare workers, trying to address, at least on the areas where they have some control, where they have jurisdiction, particularly with federal workers or companies that work with the federal government, to try and at least implement some of these changes on a smaller scale. Now, the reality remains the case there's no clear pathway to the broad, wide-ranging efforts the president put into his initial proposals, but this serves two roles, one, to kind of lay out what they see as kind of the way this should work if they have legislative majorities that can pass things in the future. But it's also a political move. There's no question about that. The president is nearing an announcement for a reelection campaign. This has long been central to his economic agenda.
