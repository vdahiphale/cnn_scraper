This hour, wewill be reporting on the ground internal Libya after those devastating floods, but first your headlines this hour. North Korean Leader Kim Jong-Un is continuing his tour of Russia today visiting an aviation manufacturing facility. It comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin said the two leaders are considering some military co-operation. Ukraine says it has claimed a village south of Bakhmut destroying a Russian outpost in a lightning fast mission of fierce fighting continues along the eastern front. And a Spanish judge has issued a restraining order against the Former Spanish Football Chief. Luis Rubiales will not be allowed within 200 meters of the Spanish football player, Jenni Hermoso or he won't be able to contact her either. Welcome to our second hour of \"Connect the World\" and utter destruction the Liberian City of Derna has been left like a warzone by catastrophic flooding, the search for victims still ongoing, with thousands of people known to be dead, some tens of thousands of people reportedly missing. And a blame game has begun. Libyan authorities are demanding an investigation, while the United Nations says many of the deaths could have been avoided. Right now however, delivering aid to those who so desperately needed is the number one priority. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh and her team have made it to Derna a bit earlier. She described the devastation they've witnessed and the immense challenges facing rescue teams and survivors. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

And it really feels like you're walking through a war zone like massive bombs had gone off here. And this is what people here would tell you. You know, you've got several cities along the Libyan coast that were impacted by Storm Daniel by the flooding over the weekend. But nothing like this where people are describing here as this catastrophe. What happened in Derna, of course, as you know, is those two dams that burst and you have the floodwaters that swept through the -- of the city, washing out entire buildings, neighborhoods, homes, infrastructure families, and brought it all down here to the sea, to the Mediterranean. I mean, it's very difficult for us to really move the camera around because of the communication issues. The communications were disrupted in the city so our connection is not very stable. But looking into the sea, Poppy, what we see here is people's lives in there. You see homes, you see doorframes, windows, furniture, clothes, cars, everything. And they are still right now searching for dead bodies. Bodies that are still washing up on the shore six days after this tragedy happened. Right now, Libyan officials are saying about 5000 people have been killed. There are still 10,000 people unaccounted for U.N. officials that we've been speaking to say they don't expect to find any more. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Ukraine says a Russian brigade has been \"smashed to pieces\" after some of the fiercest fighting along the eastern front lines. Ukrainian forces claimed to have retaken the village of Andrivka, south of Bakhmut. Kyiv have described the operation as lightning fast as its troops surrounded and destroyed a Russian outpost. According to CNN sources, President Joe Biden is scheduled to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, one on one next week.

Cuba and conflicting messages from the country's leaders and its ambassador to Russia about whether Cubans should join Russia in its fight in Ukraine. The Cuban Foreign Minister says his government opposes it. But if -- envoy to Moscow says Cuba's government is OK with legal participation in the conflict, as CNN's Patrick Oppmann reports, families whose loved ones are fighting with Russia confused and caught in the middle. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): As Putin's invasion of Ukraine grinds on, the Russian war machine desperately needs to replace soldiers lost on the battlefield, and is increasingly casting a wider net. To places like Santa Clara, Cuba, with a stagnating economy drives young Cubans to enlist. This woman says her teenage son left in July to help Russia rebuilt infrastructure damaged by the war, but was instead sent to fight. She fears reprisals from Russia for speaking to the media, and asked us not to show her face and to use a pseudonym. He has seen what you see in a war she says. He said he has seen the wounded that the hospital, people arrived missing arms and legs. He isn't used to seeing that. But Cubans traveling to Russia or running a risk back home. Cuban prosecutor said in September the police had arrested 17 people for alleged human trafficking and planning to fight as mercenaries for Russia. In Santa Clara, this Cuban father tells me he hasn't heard from one of his sons since he left for Russia over a month ago. Another son contacted by shadowy online recruiters was arrested by Cuban police in September on suspicions he was also about to fly to Russia. He was deceived, he says I hope they take that into account and evaluate that because like him, there are many more. Cuba has not accused its ally Russia of being directly involved. And it's not clear who these recruiters work for. Russia's ministry of defense did not respond to CNN's requests for comment on allegations that Russia is using Cuban mercenaries to fight in Ukraine. But families of Cuban recruits tell CNN hundreds more were enticed by promises of high payouts, and fast tracked Russian citizenship into taking up arms and a war on the other side of the world.",

So effectively if Russia or if any other country is giving information or products that can help further these missile and nuclear programs, then that is against the U.N. sanctions and many of the sanctions that have been brought into place an arms deal with North Korea would certainly be against those sanctions. We're hearing that from the Kremlin that they have no intention of breaking any restrictions or violating any restriction saying that no agreements were signed between the two leaders, but we can see from what Kim Jong-Un is viewing at the moment that there is definitely a military focus to this visit. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) HANCOCKS (voice-over): There aren't many world leaders alive this close to Russian military secrets. North Korea's Kim Jong-Un has shown around the plant where Vladimir Putin's war planes are developed and built a close up look at the inside of a fighter jet, Kim asking plenty of questions. He was walking in his father's footsteps the late Kim Jong-Il toured here just over 20 years ago. It is a visit that may prove useful. Beyond the jet scene at Kim's public events, his Air Force is mostly built on old Soviet era jets in desperate need of an update analysts say. Putin and Kim made a very public show of unity on Wednesday, Kim pledging his full and unconditional support for Putin, whether in Ukraine or his fight against hegemonic forces, Putin has appeared willing to help him with his military ambitions. Although how far and how quickly is not clear. The United States, South Korea and Japan jointly warned there would be \"clear consequences\" if either country violated U.N. Security Council resolutions banning unregulated arms trade and military cooperation. The Kremlin says it has fully complied with the restrictions. Russia and North Korea are both already heavily sanctioned. NIGEL GOULD-DAVIES, SENIOR FELLOW AT INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR STRATEGIC STUDIES: -- sanctions are a long game. They're not a light switch. They're a dimmer switch, and we're seeing their erosive consequences steadily in community over time in the case of Russia. HANCOCKS (voice-over): Kim Jong-Un's Russian tour is not over his private limousine parks up in his special armored train ready for the next stop. It is a slow journey, but at least it means no photographer is left behind. (END VIDEOTAPE) HANCOCKS (on camera): Now going forward, what we're expecting in the next day or so is what we've actually heard from the Russian President Vladimir Putin. He effectively highlighted the agenda for Kim when they met back on that Wednesday. He said he will be going to Vladivostok there will be a military demonstration of the Russian fleet. He will also be visiting a couple of universities. So the tour at this point is not over, Lynda.",
