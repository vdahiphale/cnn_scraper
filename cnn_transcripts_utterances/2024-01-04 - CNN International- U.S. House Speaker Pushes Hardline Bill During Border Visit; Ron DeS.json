They're going to look at those transcripts that Brian Todd was talking about from air traffic control.They're also going to look at this runway light issue and see if the warnings there were sufficient. But a big piece of this pie, if you will, is going to be the black boxes of the different aircraft. So far, the black box of the Japan Coast Guard plane has been found, but the one from the Japan Airlines Airbus A350 still has not been located. And the black box will tell us two things. One, it will tell us exactly what was said in the cockpit moments up to the impact -- what was said in the moments and minutes really up to that moment of impact. It will also tell us things about how high each aircraft was flying and at the different speeds. So that's going to be critical. Even though we have seen this horrible scene of wreckage and destruction, these black boxes are made to withstand the most intense impact, the most intense flames. So that has been a priority today and will be into the future until it is located. I should also point out that even though the scene seems to be pretty calm right now, there is an investigation taking place that is having an impact on operations at Tokyo's Haneda Airport, which is the busiest airport in Tokyo. So, we are seeing some flight delays. We are seeing some cancellations. In addition, this is pretty extraordinary, but Japan Airlines has recognized that people may simply not want to fly at this time. They may feel very unsettled. So, they are offering passengers the chance to cancel their flights or delay their flights until they feel more comfortable. But if there's one thing to look for in the days and hours ahead, it's going to be the locating, the location of the black box from that Japan Airlines Airbus -- Max and Bianca.",
