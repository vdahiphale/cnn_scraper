He's been in federal custody overnight, and he will appear in court today to face these charges. Now, we are not going to see him walk through the front doors of the courtroom. He will be brought in by federal agents, likely through a garage. So, we won't see him actually walk in. But he will be in a courtroom today. Once he arrives and is processed. And then he will face those charges. We are expecting the indictment to be unsealed this morning. We'll learn the breadth of these charges. But this whole investigation stem from the lawsuit brought by \"Diddy's\" former girlfriend, recording artists from Bad Boy Records that - \"Diddy's\" label, Cassie Ventura. She alleged that \"Diddy\" had sexually trafficked her, that he raped her, that he forced her to have sex with other men. And after her lawsuit was filed last year, \"Diddy\" settled it within one day. He then faced several other civil lawsuits from other women, including one man who alleged much of the same, that \"Diddy\" had invited them to drug-fueled parties, so they were forced to have sex with \"Diddy\" and others. Now, \"Diddy\" has denied those allegations, but we will see exactly the scope of these criminal charges once they are unsealed. I believe that was \"Diddy's\" lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, arriving in court. He is going to be in court with \"Diddy\" today once these charges are unsealed. But they are also still waiting to see the breadth of the case that \"Diddy\" is facing. But it does stem from these sexual harassment - Diddy's lawyer's speaking.",

If you look at the history of assassins, you know, there's always a conspiracy theory. There is usually not a conspiracy with hidden, powerful hands in foreign countries. But, you know, we also have to look at recent history and put puzzle pieces together. There is the Iranian threat against Donald Trump. An individual was arrested a couple of weeks ago in the United States for trying to recruit a hit team.You also have to look at the individual who stabbed Salman Rushdie, who was the subject of an order by the Iranian ayatollah years ago to be killed. You have to look at the person that, when I was in the NYPD, our detectives and the FBI arrested with an AK-47 and a pile of money who was targeting a Russian - an Iranian dissident in Brooklyn. So, you've got to peel back the layers of this particular suspect and say, he's been out there living out loud online. Was he a recruitment opportunity for someone who told him, you know, you can do something big? It's possible, but it's unlikely. If you go by the stats, most of these people, and if you look at his - his developing profile, have it in their head that I'm going to do this big thing and I'm going to get notoriety and I'm going to change the world and have issues. But it's still, you've got to go through the motions and see who he's even talking to.",
