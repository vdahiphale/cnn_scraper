House Republicans scrambling to try to get the votes together on a bill that serves as the cornerstone of U.S. defense policy. For decades, it's been a pillar of bipartisan agreement. Now, it's firmly at the center of America's culture wars. The annual Defense Authorization Bill has become the latest battleground after Republicans narrowly passed a series of amendments late last night, including one that would eliminate all Pentagon diversity and inclusion programs. Hardliners also made changes to the bill that include restricting abortion access in the military, and ending health coverage for transition surgeries and hormone treatments for transgender troops. The controversial measures went through a long night of heated debate on the floor. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. LAUREN BOEBERT (R-CO): I don't send my boys to school to receive indoctrination from the woke mob or to be sexualized by groomers. And the same can be said for our service members, who are also parents sending their children to DODEA schools. REP. ADAM SMITH (D-WA): You are completely eliminating any consideration of this nation's history and how we're going to recruit and retain members of the military. These amendments are terrible ideas for the national security of this country. REP. MATT GAETZ (R-FL): We have spent more time ensuring that we can protect the homeland and less time on pronoun training and the rest of this nonsense. REP. STEVEN HORSFORD (D-NV): What are you so afraid of? Why do you keep bringing these divisive issues to the body of this floor? You are out of order. You are exhausting this. REP.

But when you connect this to what Tommy Tuberville is doing on abortion, holding up hundreds of promotions, just for normal flag officers, regular flag officers on account of an executive branch Pentagon policy decision. I guess my question is, defense policy was always kind of a third rail, to some degree. It's entitlement programs and defense. You don't mess around with defense.

It actually is beneficial. The notion that culture wars would infuse this conversation is really telling, but also, it's a notion of how powerful these issues really have become across the country. It would not be the sort of buy-in for the political officials and members of Congress to try to do this, for the reason you're talking about, the third rail. This would not have been politically palatable for many years ago. It is now front and center into the wee small hours of the morning trying to get this done, and it's successful.

They can change their intention to be truthful. And they might have a shift and change of heart.

So I have all these different factors going on, but also remember, it has to be credible to a jury that you don't believe that you won the election. It just doesn't come down to me being able to have to go in, do a pseudo-lobotomy of sorts and dissect your brain and say, aha, here's the lie that I can identify. It has to be reasonable to a jury to suggest, with all of the evidence out there, with everything that was told, all the contextual clues, you're telling me that the ostrich's head was remaining in a sand in a reasonable way.
