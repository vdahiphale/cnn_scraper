I'm Fredricka Whitfield.Armed and dangerous -- that's how police in Texas are describing a suspect in a horrific mass shooting. 38-year-old Francisco Oropeza has not been seen since Friday night's attack in Cleveland, Texas. Investigators say he opened fire on his neighbors when they asked him to stop shooting his rifle outside so that their baby could sleep. Five people were killed, including an 8-year-old. CNN's Ed Lavandera is there in Cleveland, Texas. Ed, where does this manhunt stand right now?",

The FBI has taken over this investigation and obviously multiple numbers of agencies, law enforcement agencies here in the state of Texas continuing the search for, as you mentioned, 32-year-old (SIC) Francisco Oropeza. There have been several pictures put out of him, as they are urging the public to call in if they have any sightings of him.At this point, it's not clear where he might be if he's in this area or if he's been able to get farther away. But this is the neighborhood where all of this happened. The house you see right here behind me, that's where ten people were inside and the five victims were killed. And this is the property line right here. This is where Oropeza lived. This is his house. And as we stood here this morning, there's a long chain link fence that kind of separates the two properties, as we've been reporting. This is the area where presumably Oropeza was firing off his guns on Friday night. And so it's not clear if he jumped the fence or if he came out here through his front gate and then made his way back towards where the family was at this house. Those kinds of details, we're not exactly clear on at this point. But right now, the main focus and the intensity of this investigation is trying to find out where this suspect might be. Officials here and investigators have said the trail went cold yesterday.",

I want to bring in now CNN contributor and writer for \"The Trace\", Jennifer Mascia. Jennifer, good to see you again. We were talking about that sweet 16 shooting not long ago. And now here it is in Texas, you know, yet another shooting. And the shooting of a teenager through a door in St. Louis. And the woman who went into the wrong driveway in New York.

And what we're seeing now is kind of a brazenness with guns where, you know, people aren't holding back.You know, like you said, we're firing on our neighbors now. And we're also -- people are carrying visible guns to intimidate people, whether that's groups of protesters or shoppers at your local Walmart. This self-defense has kind of congealed into paranoia. And guns are very easy to get in Texas and several of the states where there were mass shootings, there were nine mass shootings this weekend actually. It's very easy to get guns. There are no background checks for private gun sales in Texas. And it sounds like that this kind of behavior where you're firing guns in the neighborhood has become normalized. Police had actually visited the house several times to ask him not to do that. So, you know, this isn't something where in my neighborhood, New York City, it would only take one night of people firing guns for the police to, you know, nip that in the bud. This kind of gun culture in several states across our nation is becoming increasingly normalized and aggressive.",

So it's not -- or is it in your view, is it the case that it is happening more frequently?

It is happening more, though. We are seeing an accelerating pace of gun violence across this country. In 2021, we had more people killed from guns ever before, almost 49,000 -- more than car crashes. So at the same time, gun production has soared. Gun production is up 152 percent in the last 15 years. It's never been as high as it is now. We're pumping 20 million guns into the market place every year. And this is bound to happen with easily accessible weapons.",

And putting that amount of guns into people's hands, a lot of them first- time gun owners, will definitely have that effect. When you have more guns around, you're more apt to use them.But you know, we did experience a social upheaval. We have never in our lifetimes shut down the country for several months. A lot of people were siloed. They went down some mental rabbit holes. As we've seen, that has consequences throughout our society. But one of them, one of those, you know, consequences of being siloed and armed is that you're suspicious of everybody. And so I think that that definitely is a consequence of the pandemic.

A person familiar with the matter tells me that federal regulators are, in fact, running an auction right now for First Republic. That's this ailing San Francisco-based regional bank. Now, this auction is being run by the FDIC, the source says. The FDIC of course, is the agency that's in charge of seizing troubled banks. And final bids, according to this source, are due at 4:00 p.m. Eastern time today. Now, as you mentioned, the \"Wall Street Journal\" has previously reported that JPMorgan Chase and PNC are among the big banks that are vying to potentially buy First Republic. We have not heard from JPMorgan. PNC is declining to comment. The FDIC has not commented yet, either. Now, here's why this is a big deal. First Republic is not some tiny lender. This is a major regional bank. As of the end of March, it had $233 billion in assets. So that means that if the FDIC does step in to take over this bank, it would be the second largest bank failure in American history. Now, as you can see on your screen. That stock chart shows all of the concern about First Republic right now. It's down 97 percent since March, when this banking crisis began. And the stock took another hit last week after First Republic revealed that 41 percent of its deposits fled the bank last quarter. That worked out, Fredricka, to a stunning $72 billion in loss of deposits.",

And a decrease in fees for people with lower credit scores. Now, that does not mean that people who have lower credit scores are going to have less in fees. It's just an adjustment here. And these apply to loans that are backed by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae.Let me show you what this looks like. If you put down 20 percent down payment, the old fee was 3 percent of the loan. If you had a 640 credit score, which is on the lower side. On the new standards, the new fee is going to be 2.25 percent. Now if you have a higher credit score of around 740, the old fee was 0.5 percent of the loan, now it's almost 0.9 percent. So this is just another change that home buyers have to deal with right now. There's a lot of moving pieces in the housing market, right? Mortgage rates have gone up. Home prices were going down. Now they're starting to creep up again.

It's possible the opening stages of this counteroffensive are already underway. But we are really unclear as to exactly the extent and the target thereof. On the Russian side, well, public bickering, frankly. We've heard suggestions today that a key deputy defense minister has, in fact, been replaced, which is a stark thing for Moscow to do, literally days before it probably experiences one of the worst assaults that its military has had for decades. And from Yevgeny Prigozhin, as you were saying, the man known as Putin's chef, who has been behind the Wagner mercenary group, who'd done a lot of the fighting, a lot of the dying too for the strategically less important but symbolically now very important city of Bakhmut. But he came out this lengthy interview today to a sympathetic journalist, where he essentially said, look, we're getting about 2 percent of the shells that we need to defend Bakhmut, pointing the finger very squarely at the Russian defense ministry top brass. And said if we don't get them more, we don't get them, we're going to have to think about pulling back out of Bakhmut. Now, I should point out that Prigozhin has made these kind of warnings before. He doesn't supply evidence. He often revels in the mistruths that he's spoken. But it's odd, frankly, to hear him say this again right now, as Bakhmut is facing increased Ukrainian pressure. In fact, the entire Russian military is likely to experience significant Ukrainian pressure with western weapons, training, and financing backing them up. So it speaks again I think to a lack of readiness from the Russian armed forces, certainly they've had well over six months to prepare for and to also this climate of possibly a lack of transparency internally, that spills out into the open into these rare comments that essentially point the finger at other parts of Russia's military brass. So quite what Prigozhin is saying and how much that reflects the reality of the situation, we don't know but it sends very alarming signals as to Russia's readiness for this Ukrainian counter-offensive and Ukraine sending no signals really at all. Opaque comments occasionally about how ready they are. But no indication as to precisely their success so far, how far into this they've got, if it's even begun. And that's exactly where you want to be, as a military hedge of a large operation like this. So we're days, potentially, away from something more public, I would suggest.

But, you know, this is, I think, just the latest in a series of examples how the justices really are in a position to say things that we wouldn't think are above board, to act in ways that we wouldn't think are appropriate.The problem is that, you know, Justice Alito can say that, and \"The Wall Street Journal\" will pick it up and there will be no consequences and no pushback, and no suggestion that it's actually kind of inappropriate for a sitting justice to insinuate that kind of development when the official report of the full court was to the contrary.",

And I think we ought to take a step back and point out that the justices are the only actors in our entire federal system were basically their own police, or their own enforcers.There are mechanisms that can check executive branch misconduct. There are mechanisms that can check legislative misconduct. There are mechanisms that can check lower federal court misconduct. So, I think we're really past the point where the question is, ought the justices be bound by some system of rules and ethical procedures to follow in these cases? The really hard question is how to do it in a way that comports with the Constitution? You know, I think the chief justice in his letter to Senator Durbin last week suggested that there would always be a separation of powers problem with that kind of oversight. I'm not sure, Fredricka, that's true. I mean, Congress historically has controlled the court's budget, has controlled the court's docket, has controlled where the court sits until 1935, the court sat in the Capitol. And so, you know, Fredricka, I think the point is just how can Congress basically push the justices to create a set of rules that can then be enforced. This is where the bill introduced last week by Senators King and Murkowski, actually goes a pretty long way. It says, hey, court, you identify the rules you're going to follow. You hire someone who's going to enforce them, and that person then reports to us, the congress, when they find examples like the Thomas examples, of noncompliance.",
