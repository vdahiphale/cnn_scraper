Current estimates put the deadline for when the treasury department will exhaust the extraordinary measures that uses to pay the government's bills at some point early this summer. President Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy have yet to hold substantial negotiations on this something that has become a key point of anxiety for many members on Capitol Hill.House Republican leaders I'm told have begun informally putting together a debt limit package that they intend to socialize with their rank and file members next week. McCarthy is also slated to deliver a speech on this at the New York Stock Exchange on Monday. Another key priority on the Hill will be around receiving classified briefings. The Pentagon is scheduled to give an all senators briefing on Wednesday as they continue to investigate the massive leak of classified defense documents. The Gang of Eight, which includes the top four congressional leaders, as well as the chairman and ranking members of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees started receiving some of the classified documents found at the homes and offices of former President Donald Trump, President Biden and former Vice President Mike Pence in recent weeks. They're eager to review these documents more closely in a classified setting on the Hill. Another key focus for Congress is on the recent abortion ruling in Texas. There's little that Congress can do following the court's decision to suspend the use of medication, abortion drugs, but Democrats in particular are eager to weigh in on this in person and see what legislation including messaging bills they can put forward to force Republicans on the record. And lastly, House investigations are continuing to heat up. We're seeing more Republican chairman begin to issue subpoenas as they enter into the fourth month of being in the majority. On Monday, the house judiciary committee will hold a field hearing in New York city as they continue to escalate their investigation into Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

It's an emergency station. It's an emergency session to try and figure out a way out of this crisis. The regional body, the intergovernmental authority on development, has also convened. The emergency summit that will happen soon, and so far, all the leaders around the region here trying to talk to General Burhan, who leads the country, and his number two, General Hemitte, to abandon this violent streak that they have at least of the country this past two days and go back to the negotiating table. Right now, the two countries that are immediate neighbors of Sudan, Egypt to the North and South Sudan to the south are both offering to immediate yesterday. The president of Kenya, William Ruto, also offered immediate. Why is all this happening? Here is the background. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MADOWO (voice-over): Sudan's hopes for democracy once again shattered by the sounds of gunfire in Khartoum. Civilians have been told to take cover, while two of the country's main military factions, the army and a powerful paramilitary group called the Rapid Support Forces, or RSF, fight for supremacy. Fighter jets launched by the army, led by General Abdel Fattah al- Burhan, fly low over the Sudanese capital with fighting reported in key sites like the presidential palace and Khartoum International Airport. This video shows the chaos inside the terminal, with some people fearing for their lives as battles flared outside. And the gunshots in some parts of cartoons so loud, they could be heard during a live television broadcast. Clashes also erupting in other parts of the country, with RSF fighters in the northern city of Meroe claiming to control a military airbase there. It's unclear which side started the fighting. General Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, better known as Hemitte, heads the RSF, which analysts say is 100,000 strong and grew out of the country's bloody conflict in Darfur. Hemitte says the army instigated the battle, calling al-Burhan a criminal. The army accused the RSF of traitorous plotting and says there will be no dialogue until the group is dissolved. Tensions between the two factions have been festering since negotiations restarted to return to Sudan's civilian rule. Part of the deal requires the RSF to merge with the army, but there were strong disagreements over how long that should take and who would ultimately have more power. Both al-Burhan and Hemitte have worked together in the past when their interests aligned. The army and the RSF taking part in the coup four years ago to overthrow a longtime Sudanese leader, Omar al Bashir. And both were involved in another coup two years later, when the military seized control over transitional power sharing government, which is meant to lead to civilian rule. The country's former prime minister, now appealing for both sides to stop the fighting. ABDALLA HAMDOK, FORMER SUDANESE PRIME MINISTER (through translator): The exchange of fire must stop immediately, and the voice of reason must rule.

And part of changing that world order from China's view is to is to revive this -- this -- this -- this great Chinese revival, which would include, according to every communist leader for the last 70 plus years retaking this island of Taiwan because at the end of China's civil war, the losing side came here and after a period of decades they formed this young and vibrant democracy, which is now closely allied with the United States. That's a big problem for China, for their communist rulers, for their legitimacy because they believe that in order to -- for China to truly fulfill its potential, they need to retake control of Taiwan, which is strategically located in the middle of the first island chain and just a very short distance from Japan and of course, the United States beyond that. So Taiwan is crucial in the communist party's plan and no leader has ever had more determination to do this than Xi Jinping. And he's made it very clear he wants to do it while he's in power.

And these nuclear submarines, the United States naval fleet, they are perhaps the biggest deterrent right now that would prevent China from making a move on Taiwan because no other country has the underwater power of the United States.These submarines are virtually impossible to detect. Some of them carry nuclear-armed ballistic missiles, others carry missiles that could take out ships, targets on land and essentially can strike without being able to be detected. And so this would be a huge problem for China Even though they have the world's largest naval fleet. They don't come anywhere close to the U.S. when it comes to submarines and when it comes to the kind of technology that the U.S. has under the ocean. And this, particularly with the new office partnership that will put U.S. submarines in regular rotation in Australia, you know, bringing them into this part of the world with more frequency is certainly a major problem for Xi Jinping and his plans to take Taiwan because he knows that if the United States were to intervene and to start using its submarine fleet, along with its aircraft carrier strike groups, it could devastate a huge part of China's naval fleet. Unfortunately for the United States, U.S. involvement would also likely mean according to war games simulations, huge casualties on the U.S. side as well. You're talking about the potential for aircraft carriers to be sunk, and it would be the kind of catastrophic war in which there really would be no winners, despite whatever the outcome would be, which is why I would say again, it's crucial for the United States to work together with other democracies. And a lot of a lot of diplomats, a lot of experts have told me this to send a signal to China that taking Taiwan would be far more dangerous and costly than Xi Jinping should be willing to risk.

It's manufactured by a third party.Boeing has not said exactly how many Maxes are defective, though there are about a thousand flying worldwide and more than 300 in the U.S. In a statement, Boeing says this is not an immediate safety of flight issue and the in service fleet can continue operating safely. The Federal Aviation Administration, the FAA, which came down hard on Boeing after investigations into those two crashes, says it has validated what Boeing says is true and is monitoring next steps. The contractor responsible for building these parts is a company called Spirit AeroSystems. It said on Friday it was still working on an inspection and repair for affected airplanes. But for now, this is not impacting travelers simply airlines waiting on new airplanes, and they are waiting for a fix. Victor, Amara.",

And many of us were visited by veterans of an organization called the Simplifying America's Fund. And these veterans came to Boston on their own to visit with us in a peer to peer way. That allowed us to connect with others that have been through something similar. And coming from a process background seeing that happen and seeing the relationships that formed after those visits -- during those visits was really amazing, and it led to us forming a foundation several years later in 2018 that works with survivors here in this country, survivors in other countries, people that have been impacted in terrorist extremists and mass casualty events globally.
