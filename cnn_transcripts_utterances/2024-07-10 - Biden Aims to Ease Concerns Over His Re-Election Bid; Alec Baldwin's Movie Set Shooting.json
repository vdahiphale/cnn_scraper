They see Joe Biden's disastrous debate, and they're bracing, bracing for what may come.And look, if they believe, if you are to believe what President Trump says, he says he will not support Ukraine. He has threatened in the past to withdraw from NATO, and he can do any number of other things. And, of course, that's just our European allies. I'm sure our allies in South Korea and Japan recall what happened the first term, and some of the messaging he delivered there are concerned as well because they are facing off against a more ambitious and aggressive China as well.",

President Biden is right.This is an era where the democracies are facing off against the autocracies of the world, and the world requires American leadership. And if we don't lead, that vacuum will be filled by somebody else, and we don't want it filled by China or Russia. America needs to lead on the world stage. Bearing that leadership is a heavy burden, I know, but it's very important if we want to maintain a stable, prosperous, global order, one that is based on our values and interests, much like we have the last 75 years for the next 75 years going forward.",

      "sentences": "Well, the opening statements were certainly very compelling on both sides, but there was something in the defense opening statement, and we can expect to hear the same theme throughout the trial. So prosecutors said every actor is supposed to treat a gun, whether it's a prop gun, whether or not they're an actor, they should pretend that it is a loaded gun. And therefore, Alec Baldwin acted recklessly because he was holding that gun and pointing it at people, putting his finger on the trigger, recklessly using it as a pointer. That's the prosecution's argument.But the defense said none of that really matters because a live bullet was found on that set. And that never should have happened. Alec Baldwin could never have known that that would be the case. It was incomprehensible. Something else we heard in the opening statement. We know Alec Baldwin made a very public early on interview. He said, I never pulled the trigger. Well, the defense walking back a bit on that, saying it doesn't matter whether or not he pulled the trigger because that live bullet never could have been foreseen. So these are themes we're going to see from the defense throughout the course of the trial.",

      "sentences": "Yes, the police were called to their house when they heard women screaming and the police went in with medical services. They discovered the women, all three of them injured, but they died shortly afterwards. And the video of a man leaving the premises with a crossbow is what led the police to this cemetery here.Kyle Clifford was his name. He lived in this neighborhood of London, about 45 minutes away from where the women were discovered. And within 24 hours, the police had tracked him to this cemetery where they say they captured him. He was injured. They say no shots were fired, but he was medically evacuated, given medical treatment on the scene and been taken to hospital. Quite how he knew this family isn't clear. But by the nature of the fact that all three women, three women were killed by this man, that their injuries were such that they died shortly after the emergency services getting that does seem to indicate that he had that level of proximity and knowledge them to be -- to be in a house with them. So this is clearly part of the police investigation and questioning. The BBC's John Hunt, who was married to Carol and it's his -- who was killed and his daughter, daughter's Hannah, 28 years old and Louise, 25 years old. The BBC say they're utterly devastated for their colleague. But in any terms in the U.K., a triple murder is utterly out of the ordinary. And one that would involve a crossbow is beyond people's expectations here. And I spoke to people on this street who witnessed the fire service, the paramedics, the armed police show up here to catch Kyle Clifford. For them, clearly nothing like this had happened on their street before. So it's a case of I think the country being in somewhat of a shock over this.",

And so that's what they say this delay is all about, because the place on the spacecraft where these problems took place are on a part that's not going to survive reentry. So scientists on the ground and engineers on the ground are going to lose all that data once they undock for the International Space Station.
