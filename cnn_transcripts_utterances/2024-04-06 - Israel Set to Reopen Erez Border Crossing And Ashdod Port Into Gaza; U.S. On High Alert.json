This as the U.N. humanitarian aid chief calling that situation in Gaza, quote, \"a betrayal of humanity.\" It is now just hours before the Israel-Hamas war reaches its six-month mark with more than 33,000 people killed. Just this week a deadly Israeli strike killed seven humanitarian aid workers from World Central Kitchen. CNN's Nic Robertson is in Jerusalem.

It's not clear how many trucks, it's not clear what they'll be carrying. In fact, very few details at the moment about that possible aid mission into northern Gaza.It would be very significant if it does happen. The commitment from the Israeli government to open Erez is a significant commitment. The White House has said that they'll watch very closely. The difficulties that will exist, the roads that link that northern crossing into some of the northern towns there have been heavily damaged in the fighting. Some of them -- some of the road there are completely blown out. The tarmac gone. So that'll make heavy aid trucks navigating those roads particularly difficult. We were there today. We could hear a lot of heavy machine gunfire in the area of the Erez border crossing, and we could also here the detonation of heavier explosions not too far away. Again, this will present a problem for any humanitarian convoys that are going to move in there typically. In other areas in Gaza, there are organized safe routes, safe times, but often these are problematic. They divert particularly to the ground military realities. And if it's not safe for the convoy to go into a certain area, then it won't be able to get that. All of these details have been difficult for other convoys coming into the southern part of the Gaza Strip to get in. We know that the humanitarian need in the north is big. It's difficult. The U.N. says that many people there are close to starvation. There are estimated 300,000 people in the north. But of course, getting aid trucks directly into the north rather than the south where they get to now would be a very big change. But it is -- there are still many hurdles to actually getting these convoys in.",

Of course, the Houthis have continued their attacks on shipping and on other interests.So you have a very volatile situation and that's why it's so important that the Qataris and others who have influence with the different actors put pressure on Hamas and others to, you know, come to the table and have an immediate ceasefire in Israel, in Gaza, so that we can actually deal with the underlying issues.",

B, that they let a lot more humanitarian aid come into the Gaza Strip, and then C, as I said before, we need to get an immediate halt in hostilities.This is crucial so that hostages can be released, humanitarian aid can flow in, and then you create some political space for actual negotiations for a much more longer ceasefire, longer truce, a longer- term solution to actually occur. I have been helping to lead calls in Congress for this two-state solution. There has to be a light at the end of the tunnel. Otherwise, if you don't have it, you're going to have endless violence, but you can't have those types of negotiations or even a broader regional set of negotiations unless you have this immediate halt to hostilities, not only on the Israeli side, but on the Hamas side, where the Qataris, for instance, have tremendous leverage.",

KRISHNAMOORTHIand other matters, Speaker Johnson needs to bring these components to the floor. I think they will be probably split it up as separate bills. And very importantly, which I don't think has been mentioned, there's a $9 billion humanitarian aid component to what the Senate sent to the House that also requires immediate, immediate passage as well. I think that if you put all four of those components on the floor, whether together or separately, that they will each receive requisite support to pass the House but it needs to happen right away because we haven't gotten into this but, you know, Ukraine is in a desperate situation this point. They're getting outgun to maybe five or nine to one. Every time they fire one artillery shell, five to nine come back their way. And so if we are to have any hope of helping the Ukrainians preserve their position, let alone gain, we've got to pass the Ukraine bill ASAP along with those other component parts.",

They've said that they will do it again and again and again so when you have this type of situation, the U.S. must bring as much pressure to bear on the Egyptians and the Qataris to leverage what they have with Hamas to bring them to the table, even at the same time that we're trying to get Mr. Netanyahu and his government to get to a deal ASAP.",

Millions more pouring into towns and cities in the path of totality to get a firsthand view of the total solar eclipse. For more on the science behind it all and what scientists would be able to learn from it, CNN's aerospace analyst, Miles O'Brien, joins us now. Miles, great to have you with us. Let's just start with the basics for everyone. What happens during a total solar eclipse? MILES O'BRIEN, CNN AEROSPACE ANALYST: We'll, Jessica, we're taking advantage of a coincidence that we don't know of any other planet and moon combination has, which is the moon is 400 times smaller than the sun. And yet the sun is 400 times the distance away. So that cancels each other out. And so from where we sit on the surface of earth, they appear to be the same diameter. Now, the moon is on a tilted orbit, so this doesn't happen every month, whenever there's a new moon. But on occasion, relatively frequently, we get this occurrence where the moon passes right in front of the sun eclipsing the sun. And many times this happens over the oceans, so we don't know about it. In this case, what makes it extraordinary, is it's just going to rip across a huge population center, which is to say North America, from Mexico to the continental United States, exiting Newfoundland. Probably 30 to 40 million people just living under the so-called path of totality. So it's going to be a big event.",

      "speaker": "DEAN",
      "sentences": "Yes, it sounds like it.And it's also a chance for scientists to learn more about our universe. NASA is going to launch rockets into the path of the eclipse. What makes this a unique research opportunity? And what do you think they're hoping to learn? O'BRIEN: Well, we want to know about the sun's corona. Looking at the sun with most instruments -- there are some instruments which create artificial eclipses, but most instruments are unable to view the corona, which is like a million times fainter than the sun itself. When the moon is eclipsing the sun, you see that outer edge, that crown, the corona. Understanding its properties, what's in it, the chemical composition, that sort of thing just tells us more and more about the most important star we know of, which is to say, our sun. So NASA will fly some high-altitude aircraft to gather that kind of spectroscopy information, infrared photography. They'll take a look at how the eclipse affects the ionosphere, the upper atmosphere. When you take away the sun briefly, it gives them an opportunity to test what the sun does to the atmosphere. On the ground, there'll be testing some radars they use to predict so-called space weather to refine their accuracy. So it does -- it's nature's opportunity and natural experiment which scientists always loved to take advantage of.",

But in terms of safety, there's the thing, don't look directly at the sun, cover your eyes. Is that true? What do people need to know about -- about how to observe this safely? O'BRIEN: Well, as we all know, we should never look at the sun directly ever. And unfortunately, during an eclipse, we're kind of tempted, right? We want to see what's going on up there. So if you are in a situation where it is partial, a partial eclipse, either you're in a place where it's never going to become total or you're waiting for that four minutes or so, when there's a total eclipse, you need to wear some of these eclipse glasses, these mylar glasses, which block out enough of the sun's rays to safety look right at it. Now, if you're in the path of totality and you get to the point where the moon is completely covered over the sun, I would invite you to take those glasses off so you can see and marvel at the corona. The glasses are so dark that you might miss out. So be safe about it, but also don't forget to take them off when it's safe to do so because that's the real thrill.",

We all saw that foam strike. And I wasn't looking at that, the -- the closest most high-speed images. But when they played the laundry replays not long after the Columbia was safe in orbit. We all saw it and it looked like, you know, you're dropping a bag of flour. And it just it was a big piece of insulating foam from that fuel tank. We -- I reached out to several sources of mine inside NASA and they all downplayed the concern. And these were high-level people in the shuttle program. And so I let that story go, unfortunately. It was a story that I probably should have put on TV right away. Maybe that might have prompted NASA to do a little more to try to identify the problem and perhaps come up with a way to save that crew. So looking back on it, I feel a great deal of sadness. I feel a little bit of shared guilt for the fact that I didn't push that story on the air. And I'm also reminded of just how much I -- as much as I love the shuttle program, it was an inherently unsafe vehicle. We don't go to space like this anymore where the people are downstream of objects that can harm their vehicle. Putting them at the top of the of the ride is a good idea.

It lived up to the hype.But, yes, it did not come without some controversy. In the first half, Caitlin Clark was held to just six points. Incredible defense performance by UConn. Caitlin Clark would come out in the third quarter though and helped lead a surge, nailing two three-pointers to kind of set it off and they would take the lead. She finished with 21 points. But then, with just seconds to go and down by one, UConn had a chance to take the lead. But Aliyah Edwards was caught -- was caught with an illegal screen and that would be how it ended. LeBron James and many others posting how they did not like this call. But Iowa would go ahead and get the win. And they will now get a chance to face South Carolina in the final tomorrow night. And Dawn Staley's Gamecocks are undefeated this season. They have lost just three games in the past three seasons. They put a whooping on N.C. State in their final match up to get a chance to go and play it tomorrow night against the fighting Caitlin Clark and Iowa Hawkeyes.
