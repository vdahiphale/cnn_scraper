You melted all, down that's over a foot of water.Now, that's going to melt off and we're going to use it later in the spring for drinking water and groundwater and all of that. But the big story this morning is Denver, Colorado. There are hundreds of thousands of people stranded on I-70 west of Denver right now because of the snow storm that came through overnight. And there on Twitter, they're complaining about it as well. Nine point eight for Boulder right now. I-25 not any better as well. There is the snow across parts of Colorado, into Nebraska today. But this is just a precursor, this is just what's coming, this is the first one that hit California and Oregon a couple of days ago, there is more weather coming into California, northern California, higher elevations above 5,000 feet. You're going to see 305 feet, no question about it. And even in the places where the roads are like the interstate, so this is going to be a very dangerous couple of days to travel, possibly even all the way going to Tuesday. Here is Monday. The first storm is, gone but another one coming on short. These are like lined up like planes going to LaGuardia, one after another, after another. And, it doesn't stop. He melted all, down there's going to be a foot of rainfall in the snow, but some of the snowfall totals, on my map are over my legend. You don't even have colors that go the. Height that is how much snow will be coming down. Not focusing a little bit farther to the east or Buffalo, is because there's going to be snowball. There's going to be rainfall. In Ontario, Watertown, all of these areas are going to be well above 32 for the next seven days. And then you get a little bit of rain on top, that you have to watch that snow away. There is going to be some street flooding, maybe not major river flooding and such. But, if you have some pump in your basement, make sure that the drain that goes out of your house is cleared from snow, otherwise the water is just going to run right back down into your basement, again and it comes one after another, after another.

Since the pandemic began. The U.S. is just one of many countries around the world that is adding testing requirements for all travelers from China. You have Japan, India, Taiwan, Italy also adding restrictions that they had not, so long, ago given up on. Now, Italy is an interesting case because we heard from the health chief in the Lombardy region that's it, on Monday, almost 50 percent of all passengers who arrived at Milan airport from China tested positive for COVID-19. So, this, he was, saying is a reason why they believe that they have to put these extra restrictions in place, countries are concerned that this explosion of COVID cases within China is already starting to move beyond its borders. Many countries already coping with their own surges in COVID numbers as well. But the U.S. has specifically mentioned they're concerned about possible variants and they want to monitor that. We did hear from the global consortium, that provides a database of all the COVID sequences and they said that China has increased the amount of information that they are uploading and they said that this pointed appears that the variants in the genome sequences are similar to what has been circulating around the globe since July.
