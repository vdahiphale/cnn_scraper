But I think probably more than that, I was worried because the NOTAM system is part of what's called the System Wide Information Management system. The nickname is SWIM, sinker (ph) SWIM in the case of the FAA. And that system controls almost everything about your flight venture through the country, the dispatch, the air traffic control, separations, aviation weather, and so NOTAMs are part of that system.And that system came under criticism as early as -- before in 2011, my old office, the Office of Inspector General said it was a program that wasn't being managed well, it was out of control, that no one at the FAA was really buying, you know, responsibility for it or taking control of it, and that the cost overruns and continual problems would just increase. And so, the FAA was tasked to get this figured out because so much more than even the NOTAMs hangs on the system, and they were supposed to work it out. They've had update meetings with industry, et cetera, but clearly it isn't worked out yet, and it has greater implications for even more systems in the FAA.",

Ask your foreign carriers, foreign carriers can't come here without accessing this system.And also, by the way, literally hundreds of users are allowed to interface with this system to run their airlines. So really the miracle is it's amazing. It only took the NOTAM system down because so much depends on this computer architecture. And by the way, it's run by a whole host of different contractors, nongovernmental contractors. And so, the FAA is supposed to be coordinating them. So Congress has their job cut out for them.

You literally called up, you call up your flight service stations. You got an ADAS broadcast, you talked to the tower.But now the system is so complicated and so complex. And remember, a lot of these systems seamlessly interface electronically. So it may not even require a voice command to get this information relayed. And airlines around the world, if they're headed here, have to do it. And by the way, drones, unmanned air systems use this system as well.

One to be operating, one for computer maintenance and then one for backup.

Jr., that's Jair Bolsonaro's son, go to the U.S., take part in Mike Lindell's -- a security conference alongside Steve Bannon, where they basically spewed conspiracy theories.

Women who refuse to cover their heads in public, according to Islamic law, will be imprisoned for anywhere between 10 days and two months. Iranian courts have also been ordered to handout harsher sentences that could include travel bans or being denied access to public services.

He tried to liberate women to an extent by making the chador -- the opposite of mandatory removal of it. You know, not a lot of women like that. The very conservative, the very traditional women kept wearing the chador, and that was fine. But fast forward to 1978, '79 during the revolution, the Islamic revolution, and you had middle class, educated women donning a chador that they never would wear as a political symbol to support what they believed would be Khomeini's democratic revolution. Very soon they found out that it wasn't. They went into the streets again when he came back in 1979 against the chador, and then the Islamic Republic, as it was then, cracked down and made the chador an emblem of its very existence. So it's, you know, this control of women's bodies, the control of what women wear, is emblematic of their rule and of many such rules in the world.

But the regime has cracked down to such an extent that it has had a chilling effect. And we saw the very same thing. And I was there in Iran at the time, during 2009, the so called Green Revolution, that was about something else.
