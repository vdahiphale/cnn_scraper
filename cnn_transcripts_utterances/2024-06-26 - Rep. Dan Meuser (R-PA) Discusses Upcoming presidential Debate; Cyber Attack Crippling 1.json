      "sentences": "Well, Boris and Brianna, this has really been a mess, both for customers and for the car dealerships.It's about a week ago that CDK Global revealed that it was the victim of back-to-back cyberattacks. Now CDK may not be a household name, but it is very important in the auto industry. Its technology powers 15,000 dealerships across North America. And this outage has really caused some significant disruptions for customers. They face delays at some dealerships. Wait times have doubled or even tripled because the sales staff has had to resort to pen and paper to process the sale. That, of course, has really slow things down. Car shoppers, they've had fewer choices here, fewer car dealers to choose from. That means less leverage when they're trying to negotiate a deal on a new car. Even people who are just trying to get their cars fixed have been impacted because some of these repair shops at the car dealers, they rely on CDK's technology to book appointments and to track parts. One couple in San Diego told CNN that they we're just trying to get their Kia's air-conditioning unit fixed amid the heatwave, but they couldn't even get an appointment because of this cyber incident. There's a Mazda dealership in Massachusetts and the sales manager told CNN that the findings actual impact here will take months to correct if not years. Another problem, one that you might not even think about, is registration. CDK's technology normally allows the dealers to instantly register people. But because that has been down, they've had to send some car buyers to local DMVs to try to get their cars registered. And then the DMVs have been flooded with people and they're turning people away. Like I said, it's been a mess. There's also an economic impact here. Car dealerships have amounted for $120 billion of sales last month alone. And so, Boris and Brianna, the longer that this outage continues, the bigger the impact for car buyers and perhaps even for the economy at large.",

But to reinforce Tim's point, one of the fascinating things that's going on here, historically, of course, is how early this debate is. We have to remember that neither candidate is actually nominated officially by their parties yet. I mean, we're only in June. So there's a long time to go. And of course, these two people have debated before, but so both of them have a record to go on.

He thought he performed better in the second when he was more measured. But historically, has it ever helped a candidate to really just be out there during a debate?",

They don't want to spend all their time defending what they've done, and especially for President Biden, who, of course, has to be -- responsibility for the last four years. So I think we have -- time and again -- President Obama is a good example of this -- really came back in his second debate and hit Mitt Romney very hard with the idea that he was not acting presidential. George W. Bush came back and hit Al Gore in 2000, saying you're not acting presidential. I think this is a moment where people expect the leader to essentially rise to the station of the office, rise to the prestige of the office. And if we remember President Trump's first debate in 2020, he had a lot of trouble keeping himself quiet, essentially not acting like an adult, not acting like a president you should expect, which is mostly why must tended to believe he failed that test.",

I think President Biden will face the -- the age issue head on. He absolutely has to. Because in many, many interviews, voters are saying that that is Joe Biden's greatest weakness.
