      "sentences": "Yes, to be honest, what's most extraordinary about the presence of North Korean troops on the front line is how little we've known about what they're up to so far. Now, we did learn today from a Ukrainian security source that they have been spotted in Russian uniform in the southern port city of Mariupol, which is interesting.They don't appear to be infantry there, but they appear to be there in some sort of technical advisory capacity. And then also, too, there have been reports, most likely intercepts, indications from Ukrainian forces up in the Kharkiv region that North Korean troops have been spotted in that direction, too. But the vast preponderance of their 11000 strong force appears to be inside Russia in Kursk being involved in Russia's bid to push Ukrainian forces out of that part of the Russian border region. Now, the same Ukrainian security source said that that North Korean unit is operating quite separately from the rest of the Russian forces. They're sort of doing their own thing with their own food, their own accommodation. Obviously, Ukraine spending a lot of time trying to assess what this new comparatively small contribution from the Russian ally of North Korea is indeed doing to contribute towards that fight. But it certainly provides you a window as to how Russia is looking for extra manpower, as it has been from the beginning of this war, to try and bolster its ranks. With some reluctance, it's felt from the Russian elite to look towards the middle classes of Moscow and St. Petersburg to bolster their very sharply diminished numbers because of the huge casualty rate they seem to be absorbing on the front lines -- Brianna. KEILAR: And Nick, what can you tell us about Putin's new vow to continue testing this hypersonic ballistic missile that was used in yesterday's attack on Ukraine?",

Vladimir Putin has said it was hypersonic, non-nuclear. That's pretty much backed up by what the Ukrainians have said. They've also said it was about Mark 10, exceptionally fast. And they've also said that they believe, Ukrainian defense official here, that Russia was testing an experimental prototype, what they call the Kedr. And they believe that Russia, as of October, had two prototypes. And perhaps this one of those was tested over Dnipro. They hope they have less, but there are certain signs, potentially, this is Russia trying to flex its technological muscles, its prowess, and show the West that it has more in its toolkit to use in this increasing war of escalation -- Brianna.",

Any wind is going to bring trees down, probably bring that power outage number up. But snow into the higher elevations. And you know what next week is? It is Thanksgiving ski season and there will be fresh snow, man-made, yes, but also some fresh snow coming down here in the form of the powder that we'd love to see at least a foot, maybe two, in some of the higher elevations.
