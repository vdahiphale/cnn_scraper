Investigation into the fatal implosion of the Titan Submersible has been launched; a top objective for the search team to recover debris that might reveal some clues to the incident that claimed five lives. And later this hour Armenian Christians in Jerusalem's Old City in fear of losing their homes CNN reports from the ground. Welcome to our second hour of \"Connect the World\". Our top story today an insurrection that ended just as quickly as it started in Russia, Wagner Paramilitary Chief Yevgeny Prigozhin's forces halting their march to Moscow, averting what could have been a violent confrontation the bizarre incident leaves more questions than answers. Russia says Prigozhin has gone to Belarus, but there are no photos or viral videos of his arriving raising doubts on that now. So what next for President Vladimir Putin? Some analysts say his power is substantially diminished others saying it was all a grand plan to move troops around. And perhaps the biggest questions of all what effect will this have on Russia's fight in Ukraine? And experts are warning the brief and rare uprising will have consequences down the line with so much still uncertain. CNN's Matthew Chance reports from Moscow. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): For the Kremlin these are some of the most disturbing scenes from a weekend of shocking images. On the streets of a major Russian City, Rostov-on-Don in the south, residents cheered Wagner fighters as they withdrew. Many Russians see them as heroes. Not as the traitors the Kremlin paints them. And Wagner's Leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin has become a celebrity too. Watch his supporters hailed down his car just to shake hands. The Kremlin says he's now moving to Belarus next door, but it's unclear if this is the last we'll see him. What is definite though, is a sense of relief, at least here in the Russian capital. CHANCE (on camera): It's calm now. But in the mayhem of the weekend, Moscow was on high alert military checkpoints on the outskirts of the city, residents bracing for Wagner fighters to enter and for the confrontation that never came. CHANCE (voice over): It was really uneasy yesterday says Andre. But look now people are walking in the streets and it's all good. Let's hope it will stay peaceful he adds. But even here, this sympathy for Prigozhin's unprecedented challenge his tirades against the conduct of the war in Ukraine appear to have struck a popular chord. I think it was an expression of an opinion, says Alik (ph) another residents of Moscow an opinion of a powerful person who wants some justice and clarity. The belief Prigozhin should be listened to be widely shared here. But that's not what the Kremlin wants to hear. Vladimir Putin hasn't appeared in public since making his angry pledge on Saturday. The film behind the scenes by state television to punish those responsible for what he called an armed mutiny, the biggest challenge to his authority in 23 years of power. But now that challenge has been made, there are growing concerns about what a defensive President Putin stung by the events of this weekend. We'll do next to stay in power.

He begins it by saying he's received thousands of questions about his decision to turn round on the way to Moscow. And it is a long and a time sprawling 11 minutes audio message released. We don't know from where. And we don't exactly know when this was recorded. But it makes a lot of references to the events of the past 72 hours or so. Some of this information, according to Reuters, is a justification of what's gone on. He is important to point out though, that \"We did not march to overthrow Russia's leadership\". Now that echoes some of his initial phrasing before that what he calls a march of justice in the recording began. He has always maintained this was about righting the wrongs of military top brass in Russia and their disastrous conduct of the war. And he is clear in this message to point out that despite the fact his latest statements about marching on Moscow put in pretty much at loggerheads with Vladimir Putin, particularly a latest statement where he said the President was mistaken. He is sort of winding that back and saying no, we weren't looking to move Putin on. He goes on to say according to Reuters that the aim of the march was to avoid the destruction of Wagner his group. They had been asked to sign contracts with the Russian Ministry of Defense. And so part of this I think, is his bid to possibly slow the situation down although the fate of his mercenary group still remains unclear Christina.",

And that any threats to his leadership won't be tolerated. So U.S. officials were making calls over the weekend to the Russians, to try to assure them that the U.S. had no involvement. And NATO had no involvement in this Wagner military operation. And of course, to ensure that there were no problems and no threats to Russia's nuclear arsenal. And so that is something of course, that U.S. officials have been concerned about just in terms of how he will react. But then there's the more mundane aspect of this just in terms of what he does domestically. Is he going to clamp down even further on civil liberties inside Russia if those even exist? Is he going to clamp down further on opposition? And of course, what is this going to mean for Ukraine? Is he going to perhaps make his forces go in even harder against the Ukrainians? Because of course, now they don't have the Wagner forces to rely on? And of course, how is the Russian military actually going to absorb these Wagner fighters who they now say, are going to become part of the Russian Ministry of Defense? Will they even acquiesce to that knowing just how much Prigozhin has instilled in them that the Russian Ministry of Defense can't be trusted so all of these things, the U.S. are looking at to make sure that Russia doesn't deteriorate into the kind of instability that could reverberate out across the region, Christina?",

And this will shape Gulf Arab elite perceptions of Russia. However, there are other reasons for why Arab countries have maintained their relationship with Russia? If you're Saudi, this is your interlocutor when it comes to energy policy. If you're Turkey, you have a nuclear energy program going on your neighbor, there's trade and so on. So there are structural reasons for why the big players in the region will continue talking to Moscow regardless of that moment.

The sense is that this is a, an increasingly lose organization, and that the various Wagner Groups, you know, across Africa and the Middle East, run their own show, and it's not clear where that money goes to. And, you know, looking at obviously the size of the operations in Ukraine I mean, Wagner has had to, you know, build up its capabilities, by weaponry, pay salaries, take care of, you know, veterans and injured and so on. But whether this was subsidized internally because of Prigozhin and other you know Wagner linked people? Their activities inside Russia or inside Ukraine, or whether that comes from Wagner's international operations is not clear.

The weekend's general election also saw gains for the far right, including the anti-migrant Spartans party as well as a nationalist party and an anti-abortion party.

And the same goes for the health system as well. This is a prime minister that in the last four years has delivered growth. He's a Prime Minister who basically has kept his pledges. And this is why he was rewarded with another four years in office. It seems that it was very much the economy that was at the heart of this election. And this idea that Greeks wanted stability, they want growth. You have to remember that in 2019, when he first came to power, Greece was a very different country; it was just coming out of a long, protracted depression. And Mr. Mitsotakis managed to turn this around; he managed to bring Greece back into more mainstream politics as well. And this is why the Greeks have decided to give him a second chance. Having said that, this election has been quite surprising because apart from Mr. Mitsotakis's victory, we have seen a number of other things, the one is the rise of the far right. Again, this is something that we had seen during Greece's financial crisis. We have seen it through mostly a wave of nationalism; this is what we see again. And we see a strong rhetoric of anti-migrant voices as well in these three smaller right wing, far right wing parties that have come now into parliament. This is for a number of reasons. Greece feels that since the 2015, 2016 migration crisis, it did not get or at least the help that it was hoping for from the EU. It's a first reception country, over a million people cross through its borders. And then the court system, we're never quite capped. It also feels that this is an issue very much linked to territorial and sovereign issues, because it has Turkey next to it a much bigger military power that has been weaponizing migration along the way. And finally, along with the right wing parties, we will have some gains for the far left as well. These all together will probably create a very disruptive voice or noise, if you wish in Parliament, but certainly not enough really, with such a strong mandate that Mr. Mitsotakis has to really stop him from going ahead with the reforms that he has pledged, Christina.",

And any glimpse of political instability could spell disruption for huge global commodities markets and for all of the supply chains that involves that. So that's why we saw oil prices spike, they've come back down, as has natural gas, as has wheat. So I feel like investors are now slightly treading water. You mentioned the Russian ruble. And I think it's worth checking in on that, we did see the Russian ruble hit a 50 month low against the U.S. dollar. This is interesting. And nation's currency is where you look really for a story of political instability, to see what investor appetite is. And it moved, as you would expect, but it's a really tricky benchmark now. In terms of investor appetite, internationally, there aren't that many investors. This is now a fairly illiquid currency in many ways due to sanctions, due to an exodus of international firms from Russia and the fact that the Russian state can implement capital controls and restrictions at any given time. But what was interesting, I think over the weekend was reports of Russians trying to move rubles into U.S. dollars, a huge increase there. And we saw the ruble trading much higher than official rates. And that does perhaps paint a picture of what maybe not the investor appetite is.
