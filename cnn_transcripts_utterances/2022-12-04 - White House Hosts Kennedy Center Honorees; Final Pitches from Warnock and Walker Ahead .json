Andy Biggs says that there are 20 votes that are going to be hard no votes for Kevin McCarthy no matter what. And that does suggest that there would need to be another candidate to come in.My guess, however, is that there's going to be this negotiation that goes on. A potential speaker has a lot of goodies to give away, Pamela, as far as seniority on different committees, standing on various special committees that are created, leadership roles, federal money that goes to special projects back in their districts.

LOUISbecause one thing we know that the conservative caucus within the Republican conference, one thing that they're insisting on is the right to basically depose the speaker at any time. That's a really important fight. It's why John Boehner got deposed. It was the mechanism by which he got deposed. There's some real consideration about whether or not McCarthy can or should accept that. If he does they'll basically have a sword over his head every day of his speakership if he does become speaker. No speaker wants to have that and that's going to be the first and most meaningful fight, over rules, over whether or not with a very slim majority the speaker could be deposed at any time. If they can get past that hurdle I think it will be a lot smoother sailing but that's going to be the key test of whether or not it's too turbulent for Kevin McCarthy even though he is playing the role of a skinny Santa Claus in this holiday season, giving away whatever he can and trying to figure out who's naughty and nice.

And of course the Democratic primary electorate is not anywhere near that much white. And what you're essentially replacing with, right, is South Carolina going first where the majority of Democratic primary in that state, voters, are African- American.You can see black and Latino, 58 percent. White voters made up just 40 percent of the primary vote last time around in 2020. And Nevada which will go second, tied with New Hampshire, they have a very significant Latino population, right. The white population in Nevada is just 65 percent. Black and Latino voters there are 28 percent. So this is a move among Democrats to get the primary electorate in the early states to look a lot more like the party as a whole and of course New Hampshire doesn't necessarily like that but the Democrats seem to like it a lot.

It was the first primary he won, it launched him into Super Tuesday, allowed him to have all that success on Super Tuesday, and then ultimately win the Democrat nomination.Nevada, which we don't talk about nearly as much probably saved his candidacy a little bit too, right? He came in second there. Compared that to New Hampshire, where Biden came in fifth. Joe Biden has no love lost with the Democratic primary voters, and of course the Iowa caucuses, they had that count malfunction back in 2020 and Biden came in fourth there.

Are these changes designed to help him or is it some play about, you know, Biden supporting this because he wants to return the favor? What do you think? LOUIS: Well, it's a little bit of both. He's going to be the only person who really benefits from this, frankly in the Democratic Party. What was unique about the early caucuses in Iowa and the New Hampshire primaries that they're relatively small states, they're relatively cheap states, and because they were relatively isolated in the calendar, candidates who didn't have a lot of resources like Barack Obama in 2007 and 2008, could go there and could campaign and could hang out and could put something together and maybe surprise the world. It's what Jimmy Carter did back in 1976. This new schedule really eliminates that because it's designed to fit the convenience of Joe Biden, a sitting president of the United States, who will have all the resources he wants plus Air Force One, but you know, imagine trying -- just as reporter, Pamela, to keep up with simultaneous caucuses and primaries in New Hampshire and in Nevada.

That's about 90 miles to the east of Charlotte.It is a cold night in North Carolina. This is going to cost major headaches for residents there as well as for local authorities who are going to have to try to keep people off the roads, traffic signals are not working, and that is one of the reasons for that mandatory curfew that you mentioned there at the top. We have confirmed from that briefing with local officials earlier this evening that someone went into this power substation. In fact they managed to take off a gate completely off the hinges. You can see it on the screen there on the ground. Once they gained access to the property they appeared to have shot into these generators, these electric equipment, and that's what caused the power grid in the area to fail. This is going to be a massive repair operation and the sheriff telling us today that, although he has begun to gather the evidence that is available so far, there's not much he can tell us just yet about why this person or these people wanted to do this.

But if you get farther out, there are places in Ukraine where people maybe have electricity for two or three hours per day and the rest of time they're in the dark. Whether that affects their heating system or not just depends on the type of home that they live in but certainly being in the dark combined with the drastically cold temperatures, temperatures that are only going to plummet even further in the weeks and months ahead, means that this could be a very long and difficult winter for the people of Ukraine especially given the concerns raised to CNN exclusively in an interview with the foreign minister on Friday where essentially they said that they're bracing themselves for a major Russian attack at some point in the coming days, presumably on their power grid. They are saying that they believe that the goal of the Russians is to try to shut down electricity across as much of Ukraine as possible by launching a barrage of missile in a very short period of time. Last week they launched more than 70 missiles over a period of just a few hours including dummies. These are 1980s era nuclear capable missiles that didn't have warheads in them but can cause considerable damage if they hurdle into a target like a power plant or in some cases they're hitting, you know, apartment buildings and people's homes and businesses. But what the Ukrainians believe is that the reason why Russia is firing these dummies is not necessarily that they're running low on missiles, or that they don't have an adequate stockpile but that they're trying to exhaust the missile defense systems by firing a combination of rockets with warheads and dummy missiles. The reason for that is that Ukrainians are remarkably adept at shooting these things down. Out of the more than 70 that Russia fired last week, the Ukrainians say they shot down more than 50 of them. But that still leaves around 20 or so hitting their targets effectively, and just as they have now started to rebuild and repair the power grid, if there is another major Russian attack it would certainly be a devastating blow which is why the Ukrainian foreign minister is calling on the United States to make a decision as soon as possible on getting patriot missile defense systems into the country. They're also asking other nations including Germany for missile defense systems to try to get those systems in place, not in a matter of months but in a matter of weeks at the latest so that they can defend against these attacks and try to lower the cost, the tremendous cost both in terms of suffering but also in terms of rebuilding infrastructure each time that Russia decides to attack in this manner.
