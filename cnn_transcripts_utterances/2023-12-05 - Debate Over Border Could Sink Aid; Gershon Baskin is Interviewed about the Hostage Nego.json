And, obviously, this is a package that includes border security, the Israel aid, Indo- Pacific funding as well, along with the Ukraine funding. I don't know that there's a path right now as it currently stands. If it doesn't pass, what does that mean for a conflict going on into the second year? MAX BOOT, SENIOR FELLOW, COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS AND COLUMNIST, \"THE WASHINGTON POST\": If it doesn't pass, this is going to be a catastrophe for the people of Ukraine who are fighting for their freedom after this unprovoked aggression from Russia. And it would just be unconscionable to me to see the United States cut off the brave fighters of Ukraine who are every day out there trying to defend their country, defend their homes, defend their people from this enemy that commits these terrible, awful, brutal war crimes. I mean the aid to Ukraine has actually been one of the most successful U.S. foreign policies of the last half century. We are providing a very small portion of our defense budget to Ukraine. And they are devastating the Russian military, inflicting heavy losses on this force that threatens our NATO allies. And they are - they have been very successful in stopping the Russian onslaught. But Vladimir Putin is counting on waiting us out. He's expecting that our will to support Ukraine will waiver. And, unfortunately, I think he is right in the case of a lot of Republicans. So, if we don't get this aid right now, with the aid money running out for Ukraine by the end of the year, this is going to be a disaster for Ukraine.
