Mr. Zelenskyy said those strikes would be fair game because Ukraine is defending itself. And he said his country still doesn't have enough weapons to stop Russia's aerial attacks. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): This is a shortage of air defense systems that are actually available in the world.

Look, I mean, this is military propaganda. This is what the Chinese do. They've released this sort of material in the past, but it certainly illustrates what China says it is prepared to do, which is to take Taiwan by force.But look, these two day drills they began yesterday. They were anticipated they were expected. You know following the inauguration speech of Taiwan's new president Lai Ching-te on Monday, he upset the Chinese. He urged, you know, Beijing to stop its threats and said the two sides of the Taiwan Strait were quote, not subordinate to each other. Beijing immediately denounced Lai as a separatist. And then yesterday morning, the drills began in what, you know, China is calling strong punishment. They set out dozens of fighter jets and warships to conduct these mock strikes on what they say are high value military targets. And we should mention too these drills are not just happening around Taiwan but also Taiwan's islands. The Taiwan defense ministry said in total 15 Chinese navy ships, 16 Coast Guard's and 33 aircraft were involved in yesterday's drills. No live fire drills, however, were held in areas close to Taiwan. China views democratically governed Taiwan has its own territory and has never renounced the use of force to bring it back under its control. A Chinese leader Xi Jinping has said that reunification is inevitable. But look, whilst these drills were happening yesterday, President Lai was visiting military camps and he said that we will defend the values of democracy, protecting regional peace and stability. But Michael, we should note that the drills taking place are smaller than those back in August of 2022. And that's when U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taipei. That's when we did see live fire drills and these drills ran for days. That's when it really upset the Chinese. Certainly President Lai's comments have also angered Beijing.",

But the Israeli military saying that on Wednesday, only 27 aid trucks actually got into Gaza via that floating pier. They also say that 281 aid trucks in that same period came through the Kerem Shalom and Erez crossing into northern Gaza. But those figures are disputed by some of the humanitarian aid groups who say that while those trucks may be coming in through those security checkpoints and into Gaza, they're not able to actually collect them and bring them to their warehouses and ultimately distribute them through the Gaza Strip, because of the increased military activity around those crossings. The difficulty of distributing that aid of course, the areas that needed the most and this is all happening at a time when nearly a million Gazans have been displaced over the course of just the last couple of weeks, really skyrocketing the need for more aid to get in and that Rafah crossing has now been closed for three weeks now. Meanwhile, as all of this is happening in northern Gaza, where the Israeli military has been going deeper into that Jabalya refugee camp, they have now taken control of a hospital in Jabalya. The Al-Awda Hospital has now been evacuated under the control of Israeli forces. According to doctors at that hospital for four days, they say that the Israeli military surrounded that hospital and now they have ordered its evacuation something that doctors there say is going to have tremendous impact on the ability to provide medical services in northern Gaza.

And this is what we're actually looking right down the barrel at. El Nino is gone. La Nina is here. We're going to see less shear in the Atlantic, all of a sudden that less shear makes more storms. They could begin to spin, not get torn apart, and you get more storms when you get a La Nina year in a typical La Nina year. Who knows what this is going to be because the water is so warm already, three to five degrees warmer than it should be right now. In, fact by Copernicus standards, the warmest on record for this development region. That's where all the dark red is. This is where we're going to see the first name storm Alberto.
