And new tonight, Elon Musk mad at Apple over their deal with OpenAI, the threat he's now making.Good evening, I'm Jim Acosta, in for Laura Coates on this Monday night. For months, Donald Trump has repeatedly referred to January 6th rioters as hostages. There's obviously no truth to that. But Trump has spent much of his campaign constructing an alternate reality for his supporters so they can believe a different narrative when it comes to January 6th, one that paints the former president as the real victim of the 2020 race, the race he lost, the race he tried to overturn. But now Trump is road testing a new nickname for the people who attacked the Capitol. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Prosecutors said he used a riot shield, a police riot shield, to smash through one of the Capitol windows, allowing the mob to storm in. He, too, was convicted and sentenced to 10 years in prison for his actions. Now Trump is calling them warriors. Trump has openly mused about issuing pardons for January 6th defendants if he wins reelection. Advocating for their behalf has become a hallmark of his campaign. Trump isn't running from January 6th. In many ways, he's running on January 6th. As you heard in that sound a few moments ago, Trump said -- quote -- \"What a setup that was. What a horrible thing. And, you know, that goes two ways.

He faces three charges in all. Two charges are related to lying on a federal gun form and a third accusing Biden of possessing a gun while using or being addicted to drugs. Biden's attorney, Abbe Lowell, saying the prosecution failed to prove that Hunter Biden was using drugs when he bought that gun, saying their case is both based on -- quote -- \"suspicion and conjecture.\" But the prosecution says they don't have to prove drug use on a specific day, just that Biden was -- quote -- \"actively engaged in drug use around the time of the gun purchase.\" Back with me now, Tim Parlatore, a CNN legal commentator. Also, with me, Perry Stein, a reporter for \"The Washington Post\" who was in the courtroom today. Perry, let me start with you first. You were there. The prosecution focused on Hunter's drug use. The prosecutor, Leo Wise, saying someone who holds a crack pipe to their mouth every 15 minutes knows they're a drug user and a drug addict.
