What do you make of that? CHARLES RAMSEY, FORMER WASHINGTON, D.C. POLICE CHIEF: Well, I can't explain that. I would -- I thought actually the press conference they had late last night, we would have gotten more information. And we actually got confirming the type of weapon that was used, although we have a photograph, but that still should be confirmed how that individual came to possess that particular weapon. Did he buy it outright? Was it private sale? Was it straw purchase? What are the circumstances? And certainly knowing more about the individual himself. You know, you may not find a motive, sometimes you don't find a motive, but we should know more about him, you know, name, age, background, everything like that.

Is there a statement yet, you know. And you go through the same motions over and over again, and from a variety of perspectives. I think in terms of the politics of this, and in terms of what can actually be done, clearly, we know the dynamics in Congress still have not changed. House Republicans are not going to allow anything in terms of gun control reform, to go through. President Biden, meanwhile, every time after one of these mass shootings, we've yet to actually get a statement from him. But typically, he quickly calls for an assault weapons ban, high capacity magazine ban, et cetera. But we've heard President Biden say recently, he believes he has exhausted all of his executive action options. And yet at the same time, I think there is a strategic calculus that's been made. We don't hear him pounding this issue day in and day out. There is a calculus that's been made that it is so, you know, that there are no options in Congress.

And clearly, though, legislation isn't moving anywhere in Congress. And so it is on the state level. It is -- it's not an assault weapons ban, but it's talking about red flag laws and things like that. But a state like Texas, there's not going to be a lot of headway for gun safety.",

Obviously, it's not the case that you can't attack the intersection of these things. If you can better identify people who pose threats and who should particularly not have access to guns.

The short term, its capacity building, its transportation, it's making sure that they have agents in place to do the processing and arrests.
