It comes as he's faced harsh criticism for the way he pardoned his son, Hunter. Not just from members of both parties, but now from a former top adviser to the president. Anita Dunn, a deeply loyal communications adviser, departed the White House after Biden pulled out of the race. She made these remarks, and that's what makes them particularly painful.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And you saw basically that Hunter fired all the lawyers that Anita and her husband, Bob Bauer, hired for him after 2022 and sort of took a much more aggressive PR strategy.So, I'm not - there is some backstory here about the frustration between the two of them. I also think, you know, Anita is not as close in the inner circle - Biden's inner circle, in part because of that conflict. Because, at the end of the day, you know, the Biden family comes first.",

And the - particularly the communications strategy around Hunter over the last few years has been a point of conflict between Hunter's legal team, Hunter, Anita and Bob. So, I wasn't surprised either to see her criticize the - the communications rollout. You know, I think doing it in the way that they did, did leave Biden open to more criticism than he might have otherwise gotten had he done it at the very end of the term, or in conjunction with a number of other pardons. Doing it solo like that really kind of put a target on Hunter's back.I agree, I've said on our air, I agree that the pardon itself is defensible.

You know, it's been, for instance, among Democrats, it's a big thing to go after non- violent drug offenses that were administered decades ago but, you know, don't fit with America today.

I think the bigger question we need to ask, though, is, what is the pushback on this? Whether it's drones today, whether it's Chinese intrusion sets, which have hit our telecommunications and something called Salt Typhoon, that have really put the U.S. on the defensive edge? I think a lot of Americans are asking, when do we start pushing back? When do we start doing more than defense? But aggressive offense on making sure this doesn't show up on our shores.",

And they're not just targeting President Trump or J.D. Vance. They've crossed a threshold now where they're going after American citizens, taking their information and targeting them in the same way that spy craft would identify a target, cultivate it, and find things that it wants to about it to exploit it for later use.I believe, at this point, we need to be far more aggressive in knowing, what is our threshold, and then targeting, whether it's the Chinese ministry of state security, the MSS, their CIA, or whether we go after their People's Liberation Army top figures who are making these decisions. And at the top of that food chain is the Chinese premier. And so, President Xi has to be briefed on this, whether its balloons flying over the United States, drones off the coast or deep intrusions into American's personal information, I would expect that any leader be prepared to hold the Chinese accountable on day one. And if President Trump is going to invite, you know, President Xi to spend time here in the United States, I hope that that's a conversation - I know that will be a conversation that he wants to hold him accountable for.

Our governor from Iowa, Terry Branstad, became the ambassador there. And it was really about providing China with some on ramps on what they could do correctly. But it was also the first time we'd really pushed back on China's military development, their shipbuilding, their threats in cybersecurity, and then also their operations towards other allies in the region. And I think building a personal relationship with President Trump, we have seen time and time again, whether it's the Europeans, folks in Asia, is probably the best way for us to have a strong voice, because when the president picks up the phone and says, I'm going to do this, foreign leaders know he's going to follow through.",
