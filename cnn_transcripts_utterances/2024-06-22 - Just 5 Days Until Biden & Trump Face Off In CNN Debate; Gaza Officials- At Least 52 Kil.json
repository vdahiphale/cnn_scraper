And today, we're seeing a pretty stark difference between incumbent President Joe Biden and his Republican challenger, former President Donald Trump, as the two men prepare for this high-stakes faceoff. While Biden is holding intense meeting with a closed group of advisors at Camp David, Trump is skipping the traditional route for now and is instead hitting the campaign trail. Here he is just a few hours ago at an event in Washington, rallying his supporters for the big showdown with Biden.

It's been broken down by this: J.D. Vance has the support of some of the far right figures and influential figures in Trump's orbit such as Don Jr., his son, Steve Bannon, his former adviser, as well as Tucker Carlson. Whereas Rubio has support from some of the donor class and Sean Hannity, Kellyanne Conway, his former adviser. Meanwhile, Doug Burgum, he has a lot of fans in News Corp and Rupert Murdoch's kingdom.

But he is now on day two out of Camp David debate camp out in the mountains, and what we understand is that this was going to begin somewhat informally. Advisers have prepared these binders for the president to go through.What they're doing is trying to crystallize some of the policy differences between himself and President Trump, and really trying to hone how he's going to describe those on the debate stage. So they have some answers, they have some potential questions. They want to talk about how they're going to respond. But they are also preparing for attacks from President Trump, on president's policies, yes. But also on members of his family, on his fitness for office, basically, they want to be ready for anything that Trump can throw at them on the debate stage. This is eventually going to culminate into some mock debates that the president is going to undergo later in the week, and it's been interesting because we've heard from the person who actually played President Trump during President Biden's preparations back in 2020. His name is Bob Bauer. He's the president's personal attorney and what he's been saying is he doesn't necessarily do a full impersonation of Trump. It's more of a character study. And one of the things that he's really focused on is making sure that his attacks are credible, that he can go after President Biden in a way and sort of a ferocious way that they think that Trump is going to demonstrate on the debate stage as well. One of the things that I think that they're very likely to raise in this debate is the issue of abortion, which Steve was talking about as well and it's interesting because Monday is the anniversary of that Supreme Court decision, the Dobbs decision that overturned Roe versus Wade. While President Biden is at Camp David, the rest of his team, you know, the vice president, the first lady, are all going to be out sort of commemorating this anniversary, talking about this issue with voters, which is when the Biden camp really does believe is going to be a galvanizing one for them in November.",

He doesn't let new people in all that often and you are seeing this at his preparations Camp David is being led by Ron Klain, who is his former chief of staff, but probably more importantly, he is the most seasoned debate coach in the Democratic Party. He's been doing this for years. He did it for Biden in '20. He did it, you know, for Hillary Clinton in '16. He's been doing this for a long time.You also see some of his messaging gurus Anita Dunn, Mike Donilon, also, his current chief of staff, Jeff Zients, and Bruce Reed, who is his policy chief and helped sort of put these binders together. I do think it's interesting, Ron Klain back in 2012 worth this list of debate rules as he was preparing. So it does give you an idea of what they're doing. One of them is developing a list of three items you must say in the debate. Study what your opponent has been saying especially in the days just before the debate. And, luckily, Trump has given them ample tape to review. No practice is more effective than mocked debating. So, certainly, they're going to be doing that in the days leading up to Thursday. Make sure you get feedback from a prep team that is compact and candid. Well, he's got there that -- up there at Camp David. It's a pretty small group. It's people who feel like they know Joe Biden pretty well. And one of them is if in doubt, don't. Essentially, don't go rogue in a debate stage. That's not the place for it.

That's what he needs.Now again, that's not by going over the top. That's just by showing confidence, command. He's a commander in chief. If he can demonstrate that he can stand on that debate stage and take all the hits from Trump who clearly is not much of a commander in chief, then Joe Biden will come out ahead. And I think that a lot of this will then depend on what the press says, right? A lot of studies show that it's not about just who wins the debate, but what the press says about the debate afterwards. He needs another performance like the State of the Union. And if he gets that, I think it will set them ahead in the polls.

It's an issue not just on the southern border, but in communities like the ones I represent up here in Massachusetts. We have a real issue with migrants. But let's remember, Trump told the Republicans to sink the bipartisan deal in the Senate. He said, I want this to be an election issue. He said to America, I want to play politics with this issue.

Now it comes as there are increasingly concerns about the cross-border attacks and whether that will escalate into a full-on war.The reason this is significant is because this week, we have really seen the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu having a fairly public spat with Biden administration officials, saying earlier this week that they were withholding weapons from Israel. Now that was quickly rebuffed by Biden administration officials and they said they didn't really know what he was talking about. But then Netanyahu on Friday doubled down on that saying the barely a trickle of these weapons were actually coming through to Israel. So this has been a very public spat between the prime minister and the officials. And so, this is really been a reassurance from the U.S. side that the security assurances that Israel would have what it needed in the events of this war.

Now the U.S. is strongly disputing this, and we just reported that Democratic lawmakers have lifted holds on unexpected $18 billion sale of F-15 fighter jets.

It's certainly been, it shouldn't be happening at a time, not only when Israel is engaged in a desperate war with Gaza, but on the verge of a much, much broader war in the north with Hezbollah, a war in which even the Biden administration says, United States is liable to become involved, at least in a passive way of taking down the between 1,000 and 6,000 rockets, which Hezbollah is expected to fire at Israel in that -- in that conflict. And these are much bigger rockets, much longer range, and heavier rockets and they're very accurate. So the United States support in that way would be very much appreciated. But this type of open disagreement doesn't benefit either side, doesn't benefit the United States, doesn't benefit Israel. It only benefits Hamas and benefits ultimately Hezbollah. Hamas won't accept a ceasefire because the head of Hamas, Mr. Sinwar believes the times working on his side. And if you see Israel and the United States bickering with one another, he could conclude that pressure will increase on Israel, and eventually, Israel agree to a permanent ceasefire that will enable Hamas to come out of the tunnels and declare victory and re-conquer Gaza and stage the next attack against Israel. Hezbollah is saying it won't accept a ceasefire unless Hamas does. You see how this all holds together?

This is a look at the advisories in those warnings that Polo was talking about.We're looking at more than 80 percent of the lower 48. That's more than 250 million people with temperatures at 90 degrees or higher as we go through the next couple of days and that could drop more than 250 records both daytime highs and overnight lows will actually break more records for the overnight temperatures because we really get no relief at night.

Baltimore has already hit 101. So again, it's pretty hot. But in DC, we're watching that current temperature closely because if we hit 100 degrees today, that would be the first time since 2016, more than 208 -- 2000 rather 2,868 days since DC has hit 100 degrees and again, we're two degrees shy as of right now so we still have some time to squeeze that out. Temperatures up near 100 Saturday and Sunday from D.C. to Richmond, Virginia up in Philadelphia as well. You can see where these temperatures again do back off on Monday. As that cold front comes through, they get a little bit closer to average with those highs closer to the 80s. Now again, the temperatures on the overnight don't really give you too much relief middle and upper 70s we could be looking at 80 degree low temperatures around the D.C. area and this is the real killer because you just don't get any of that relief at night after sweltering all day. You don't even get those nighttime temperatures to help so really puts people without access to air conditioning at risk, right. So this extreme heat risk continues as we go through the day today. You can see it major across the I-95 Corridor from New York down to Baltimore and DC, some extreme in parts of Ohio and then as we go through the rest of the weekend, it continues to kind of sit and settle across the parts of the south east as temperature stay warm as we start the work week.

In California, dozens of convicted death penalty rates are now under review after a recently discovered case file from the 1990s revealed prosecutors private notes where they tracked whether potential jurors were black or Jewish.Now remember, by law, prosecutors are not allowed to decide a jury based on race, ethnicity or gender. Nick Watt reveals how old hand scribbled notes may end up freeing convicts on death row. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NICK WATT, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Lance Clark was nine years old when he was shot dead in Oakland, California. Ernest Dykes convicted of his murder sentenced to death, but Lance's family tells CNN that they've been told by the DA's office that Dykes will be out of prison in nine months to a year and they say, Lance has missed every day. He was robbed of a future. Why might Dykes get out because an assistant DA found and disclosed handwritten notes about potential jurors from the trial back in 1995.",
