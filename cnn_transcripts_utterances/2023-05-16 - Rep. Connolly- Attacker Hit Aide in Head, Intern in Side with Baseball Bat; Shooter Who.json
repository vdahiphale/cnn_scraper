One of which is that the last meeting they had one week ago, it didn't go smoothly. In fact, lawmakers came out; the president came out of that meeting basically holding dueling press conferences about their own plans moving forward. And that really showed you just how far apart they are. Staff has been working around the clock nearly every single day since that meeting to try and smooth over what the differences are right now, but what you're hearing from people who are watching these negotiations and getting read into them, like Republican Whip John Thune, is that time is running short. And in Thune's view, the right people are not in the room. They believe that having Biden and McCarthy in this room is going to be really important. Perhaps they'll be able to nail down some more specifics. But like you noted, Kaitlan, time is running short. And McCarthy has made clear he thinks they need to have a deal in hand by this weekend if they have any hope of moving this through both the House of Representatives, where he does need to give his members some time to review this legislation, and the U.S. Senate, where things just take a very long time on the Senate floor -- Kaitlan.",
