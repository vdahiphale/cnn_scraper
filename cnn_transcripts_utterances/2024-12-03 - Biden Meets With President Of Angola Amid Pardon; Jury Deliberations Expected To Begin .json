But the whole trip is largely being overshadowed by his decision back home to pardon his son Hunter Biden with backlash still growing over his decision to backtrack on his publicly stated promise to not issue a pardon -- backlash even among Democrats. With new reporting this morning his decision has left many Democrats on Capitol Hill simply fuming.CNN's Arlette Saenz is traveling with the president in Angola and she's joining us now. Arlette, the White House has to know how poorly and badly this is landing back at home. What are they saying?",

There were two occasions so far today here in Angola where reporters lobbed questions at the president, and in both instances he did not respond.But it does come as you are seeing this cascade of criticism from among his own party -- Democrats who are quite frustrated with the president's move. So far, Biden has really maintained his silence in the face of that criticism. We have heard from former White House and administration officials who have expressed frustration with the fact that many had anticipated this is a decision President Biden could have made, but then he went out and adamantly said that it's not a move he would take. It's that reversal that is frustrating many former White House aides. But at the same time you're also hearing from members up on Capitol Hill who have warned that the president has put his family over country, and also that the statement from the president on Sunday night announcing this pardon could further weaken faith in the justice system. Take a listen to a sample of some of those Democratic lawmakers. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. TIM KAINE (D-VA):  He didn't need to tell the American public I will not do this, and he did. And when you make a promise, you've got to keep it. SEN. MICHAEL BENNET (D-CO):  It just gives the American people a sense that there's one system for the rich and powerful and another system for everybody else.",

MAY MAILMAN, DIRECTOR, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S LAW CENTER, FORMER TRUMP WHITE HOUSE ASSOCIATE COUNSEL (via Webex by Cisco):  Well, I mean, there's still a long way to go and I think it's correct. Like, the Department of Defense is a very large and very important agency and there are questions that are very relevant to whether a nominee can fulfill that role. We have an audit where the Department of Defense is missing $220 billion in equipment. It missed its recruiting goals in its branches by 41,000 members. I think that Pete Hegseth really needs to address those types of things. These are relevant questions and senators can't give an answer until they investigate that. But we're so -- we're talking so much about personal failings that I think we're forgetting to focus on the real questions about the military. Sexual assault is important. It should be investigated, and it should be prosecuted where it happens. And in this case the police were involved in an accusation, and they decided to not do anything about it.

Fortunately the driver was able to get out unscathed -- no injuries. But that just shows you the depth of the snow that's in some locations over five feet, approaching six feet in some very localized areas. But here's the current situation and current radar. Again, a few scattered snow showers right along I-90. This is impacting downwind locations. That's eastern portions of Lake Erie. But also notice this into southwestern Michigan. This is an area that caused some pileups on Interstate 94 yesterday. And I want you to see that little curly Q within the snow band there. That is actually known as a vortex. So the difference between the wind over the lake and the wind over the land is causing that snow band to kind of spiral in on itself. So all in all, these snowfall totals -- they're impressive. They have been record-breaking daily snowfall totals for some locations. But this is incredible -- look at this. Castorland in northwestern New York, 65 inches of snow. That's nearly as tall as this meteorologist. So how much snow is still to come? Just a few inches. Again, those favored areas with lake-effect snow bands. [07:45:00] But look what happens as I advance this map into Thursday and Friday. We've got what is called an Alberta Clipper that is approaching. Alberta Clipper named because of where it forms -- the province of Alberta in Canada -- but a clipper because it moves very quickly across the Great Lakes. And you'll see that system as it traverses the Great Lakes from Thursday into Friday. So what's going to happen? It's going to pick up the wind. It is also going to drop temperatures. And it's also going to help bring in another round of lake-enhanced snowfall. This system will be moving too quick, and the winds will be too fast for this snowfall event to be as impressive as what we saw last week, but still something to keep in mind. Dangerous -- low visibilities, dangerous driving conditions in some of those areas. Check out these temperatures. There is it. Chicago to Cincinnati, New York City to D.C. You're next -- Friday.

Prosecutors are expected to wrap up their case today and after that his fate lies in the hands of the jury.Penny is charged in the fatal chokehold death of Jordan Neely in an incident on a New York City subway train last year. If he is convicted on the second-degree manslaughter charge Penny could face up to 15 years in prison. Now, in court yesterday, the defense wrapped their closing arguments saying in part -- arguing that Daniel Penny put his own life at risk to protect other riders. Also telling the jury that prosecutors -- this coming from the defense -- \"Prosecutors are scapegoating this man here, the only guy who was brave enough to stand up when he was needed. The government wasn't there. The police weren't there when the people needed help. Danny was. And when he was the one who needed help, no one was there.\" Joining us right now, trial and defense attorney Misty Marris. And the prosecution is now going to be picking up with their -- with their arguments -- closing arguments today. But let's stick on what we heard from the defense team yesterday. You heard that scapegoating argument that's part of their closing argument. They also made another argument in closings. I want to read you a quote from it, Misty, that -- basically that Penny's actions were justified because he was acting to protect other people. Here is what they told the jury. \"Daniel Penny was the one who moved to protect them. Why? Because he had something the others didn't, something unique to him, his training. Because Danny acted to save those people. And there's no dispute that when Danny acted, he didn't know whether Jordan Neely was armed.\" Added altogether, Misty, what do you make of the defense's closing argument? MISTY MARRIS, TRIAL AND DEFENSE ATTORNEY (via Webex by Cisco):  So the defense was focused on exactly what they needed to be. So part of the defense is that it's a self-defense argument -- not just self-defense for Daniel Penny, self-defense of the others on that train. And part of that argument has to reflect what we know is going to be on that jury verdict sheet. First, was there an imminent threat? The defense pointed to others on the train who had said that they were fearful. Then, was Penny's response justified and proportionate to that threat? And that's why we hear the defense talking about the fact that Daniel Penny stepped in when there was nobody else to do so and that his actions were justified because he did not know whether or not Neely was going to get back up and go back on the offensive. Now, couple that with another point that the defense pointed out that Neely's death is the product of a broken system. That's a quote from the closing arguments. And they looped that back into the testimony because the final defense witness was a court clerk who referenced that Neely -- there was actually an open bench warrant for his arrest. So essentially, the defense is arguing almost that the city -- the city of New York really failed Neely, and that Penny was there when the city of New York was not there -- when nobody was there to protect those other riders. So that's where the defense was focused because that's the standard of the self-defense statute.",

      "sentences": "So this was always going to be where the prosecution was focused right from the get-go -- even the opening statements, Kate. The prosecutors had to concede that that the initial restraint of Neely was justified, and that's because there were many others on the train who said they were fearful. It's a reasonable person standard. So if others were fearful, it's reasonable that Penny would ultimately step in.But the issue is whether or not it was justified to hold Neely down for that almost six-minute time period. And prosecutors focused on the fact that in less than a minute the train pulled into the next station. Most of the people got off the train. So basically, the threat at that point was over and that holding down Neely for the remainder of that time was actually a failure on Penny's part to recognize Neely's humanity and that he needed protection as well. So that was a large part of the prosecution's argument because the standard is reckless disregard for human life. Now, the prosecutors pointed to Daniel Penny's interrogation video -- which, by the way, he was there voluntarily, so the -- so he spoke to police voluntarily. And he called Neely a crackhead multiple times. So prosecutors are painting the picture that yes, Daniel Penny may have been justified at the get-go but at some point, his conduct turned criminal. And the next part of this, Kate, it's going to be a large focus today. It's going to be the medical aspect. The medical examiner's determination that Neely was killed by Penny's chokehold and his chokehold alone. No other causes.",
