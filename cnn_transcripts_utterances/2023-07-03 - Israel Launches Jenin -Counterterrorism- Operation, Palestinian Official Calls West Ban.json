The largestIsraeli military incursion in 20 years is ongoing in the West Bank; at least eight Palestinians have been killed in Jenin as Israel strikes what its Foreign Minister calls a terrorism hub. This comes two weeks after a raid in the same area erupted into a massive firefight. So tonight we ask why the escalating violence in that area of the occupied West Bank? And joining us now live Danny Danon is a member of Israel's Legislature, the Knesset from the Likud Party, and he served as Israel's Ambassador to the United Nations. Sir great to have you with us thank you so much for taking the time! This is the largest incursion that we've seen in 20 years.

The Russians have deployed thousands of fresh troops from other areas along the thousand long kilometer front to the Bakhmut area. So progress is difficult. We've heard it from multiple Ukrainian officials including Presidents Zelenskyy himself that expectations perhaps should be tamping down, that the going is very difficult. And from the Russians, we hear from Ukrainian troops themselves, that even during the disorder in Moscow during the Yevgeny Prigozhin's brief mutiny and afterwards, there hasn't been any really change in terms of the disposition of Russian forces in Bakhmut itself. Now they've made somewhat more progress in the area south of the City of Zaporizhzhia where they've taken approximately 29 or 28 square kilometers, also a fairly modest advance given for instance, if you take into account how much territory they were able to seize from the Russians back in September, in the Kharkiv area and later in Kherson in the south.

But in fact, have prevented over the years whenever there have been incidents like this, of police brutality, and allegations of systemic racism, have made it very difficult for them to investigate, it's very difficult even for politicians to speak about, since the culture also forbids it.

The French interior minister made the point that of the 2000 detained at one point over the last few days, the average age was just 17.

You ask what the sweet spot is, for Saudi Arabia is $81 a barrel in terms of being able to balance the budget that's according to the IMF. So you have to question why aren't these persistent cuts and hefty cuts, particularly from Saudi Arabia paying off. Why aren't they being rewarded with a higher oil price? Now part of that might just be the global outlook in terms of an economic slowdown. Part of it might be the market doesn't actually believe some of the cuts that are announced particularly from Russia, which also had an ounce of 500,000 barrels a day cut back in March. But in March and April, they overshot their target quite considerably, as well. So I think there will be some skepticism in the market as to whether all of the oil producers will actually deliver on the cuts that they have promised. And for Russia, you've got to remember given the number of bands restrictions, the g7 oil price cap in terms of trade. For them, there's perhaps less of an incentive to take oil off the market. Currently, euros oil, the Russian oil is trading at a hefty discount around $57 a barrel. However, to play nice and to keep tensions within the OPEC plus group where they need to be, I think Russia does need to have to have some sort of deliverance on the cuts that they are promising to ease potential tensions, I think with Saudi Arabia, Eleni.",

But now some scientists are saying thatthey can be part of the solution to combat climate change. Chief Climate Correspondent Bill Weir explains. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BILL WEIR, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): In the beginning was the buffalo. Tens of millions of them are wandering the land, munching wild grasses and using poop and hooves to create rich fertile soil up to 15 feet deep. Look at this. But since Americans replaced buffalo with cows, generations of fertilizers and pesticides, tilling and overgrazing have turned much of that nutrient rich soil into lifeless dirt. But not on farms, where they graze cows, just like wild buffalo. PETER BYCK, FILMMAKER/ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR: Well, so adaptive multi-paddock grazing amp grazing is a way that mimics the way bison have moved across the Great Plains. And so it's really about the animals hit an area really hard. And then they leave it for a long time. WEIR (voice over): Peter Byck is a Professor at Arizona State University. And he believes that if enough beef and dairy operations copy this simple hack, cattle could actually become an ally in the fight against climate change.",
