An investigation now into who could be behind these calls targeting judges, potentially putting their lives at risk. We're following these major developing stories and many more, all coming in right here to CNN News Central.We start this hour with a volatile situation in the Middle East taking another dangerous turn. Last night, the United States and United Kingdom, along with other nations, fired dozens of missiles at Houthi targets in Yemen. A Pentagon official says they destroyed a significant number of the Iran-backed group's military assets. The White House says the strikes were in self-defense. They were a response to a string of Houthi attacks on shipping vessels in the Red Sea in recent months. The Houthis, of course, are armed and backed by Iran. They control a large portion of Yemen after some two decades of brutal fighting, a war that's led to hundreds of thousands of deaths, and what the U.N. says is the worst humanitarian crisis in the world.",

They launched 80 Tomahawk missiles against targets across Yemen that are controlled by the Houthis, including command and control nodes, as well as some weapons depots that they were using to drones.And they also, even a U.S. submarine was involved in these attacks on these Houthi targets in Yemen. So just a very big, complicated attack here that the U.S. was hoping would significantly degrade the Houthis' abilities to continue launching these missile and drone attacks on commercial vessels in the Red Sea. We still don't know just to what extent those capabilities have been degraded and whether the Houthis will need time to regroup, for example. But we are actually already seeing signs that the Houthis are still able to launch these missiles. We saw just earlier today reports that they launched a missile into the Gulf of Aden near Yemen, targeting vessels that were operating there. So clearly they don't yet seem deterred. The question about whether they are going to have the capabilities to launch the kinds of attacks that they have in the past, that remains open. Now, the question now that the U.S. is getting is, well, how are you going to respond if the Houthis do continue to launch these attacks? Because obviously the big concern here is escalation, particularly given that the Houthis are backed by Iran. So, will Iran join this conflict to try to defend them? Here's what National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said about that earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And we were told that Secretary Austin basically followed everything and monitored all of this in real time from the hospital, where officials say he had sort of the full suite of communications access that he would have needed for all of this.We heard John Kirby earlier today, telling reporters that all of this had been executed seamlessly and that there was really nothing different here than any other day when Secretary Austin might have been involved in something like this, and that the key difference really was only the location that he was doing this from the hospital. And one senior administration official I spoke with earlier, who had spoken multiple times with Secretary Austin, told me that he had sounded normal, that he was very much in command of all of the issues. And they basically argued that they didn't have any concerns with the idea of Secretary Austin executing all of this from the hospital, that it's sort of no different than whether he, if he were doing this from the road, for example, when he was traveling. But there's no question, Brianna and Boris, that there are a lot of questions right now for the White House and obviously Secretary Austin just about the handling of his health situation, precisely the fact that he had been hospitalized. But for so many days, actually, officials, including President Biden himself, did not know about it. And that's why, of course, there is this ongoing government-wide review to try to figure out exactly what happened and also just to make sure that that doesn't happen again.

And then, second, the U.S. has an obligation to protect their U.S. personnel overseas and to protect the commercial routes that we are talking about, specifically in the Red Sea.And the White House has said that there were some congressional notifications that were made, particularly to the heads of some of these key congressional committees and some in congressional leadership. And they're also just sort of trying to make clear the urgency of the situation and the reason that we ended up seeing these airstrikes overnight. They said these attacks from the Houthis, of course, were very persistent. They laid out the U.S. vessels had been targeted, that there were some close calls that would have basically happened had it not been for this setup of this defensive coalition set up by the U.S. and its allies in the Red Sea.

You can see on the radar here where things are busy, we've got some of that snow that's packing from Omaha to Chicago.Some strong thunderstorms to the south where we've got some lightning still would have threatened me. Some damaging winds going into the afternoon. But that snow continues to pump across Iowa into the Great Lakes. And it also comes with some gusts of 245 miles per hour. That's why we have that blizzard warning in effect in the orange for most of Iowa through the day today for up to 8 inches of snow plus the 45 mile per hour wind gusts. Winter storm warnings stretch into Chicago. As all of this moves east and northeast, a flood watch is also in effect for a lot of the northeast here and even the mid-Atlantic.
