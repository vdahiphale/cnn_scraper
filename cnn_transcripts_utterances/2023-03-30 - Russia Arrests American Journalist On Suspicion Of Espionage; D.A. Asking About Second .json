Moscow escalating tensions with Washington in a way we haven't seen since the Cold War.Also tonight, we have breaking news on the New York grand jury investigating former President Trump. Sources now say the district attorney there has been asking questions about a second hush money case involving Trump and efforts to cover up his alleged affair with a Playboy model. And as Nashville mourns and prepares to bury six victims, new 911 calls from the school shooting were just released. Stand by for that breaking story. And I'll get reaction from the Nashville mayor, who's joining us this hour. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM. Tonight, another U.S. citizen is in custody in Russia. This time, a journalist for The Wall Street Journal accused of espionage. CNN's Alex Marquardt has details on the arrest and why this particular reporter may have been targeted by Moscow. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): This video from Russian media appears to show American Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich arriving at a Moscow court today. The Russian security services arrested Gershkovich while he was on a reporting trip for suspicions of espionage, something the White House called absolutely unacceptable. KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: This espionage charges are ridiculous. The targeting of American citizens by Russian government is unacceptable. We condemn the detention of Mr. Gershkovich in the strongest, in the strongest terms. MARQUARDT (voice-over): The court announced that the Moscow based journalist will be held until May 29. Detained in a pretrial center, his lawyer was not allowed to attend the hearing. I can only guess what position has been taken, his lawyer said. Evan was taken away from here with a decision to hold him in custody. The Wall Street Journal vehemently denied the espionage accusations and said the paper is \"Deeply concerned for the safety of Mr. Gershkovich\" and \"Seeks the immediate release of our trusted and dedicated reporter.\" Gershkovich is a U.S. citizen who grew up in Princeton, New Jersey, speaking Russian at home with parents who emigrated from the Soviet Union like journalist Julia Ioffe.",

A spokesperson for the foreign ministry said that what he was doing in Yekaterinburg was not journalism. Gershkovich recently published hard hitting stories on Russia's economy as Vladimir Putin wages war in Ukraine, artillery shortages, and the Wagner mercenary group. He's also appeared on CNN.",

But what White officials make clear is, at this point in time, there is simply not a lot that they know.They don't understand motivations. They don't understand whether this is connected to anything. They don't have any sense whether or not this signals some kind of escalation. What they do know, however, is their primary goal at this point in time is to try and get consular access to the journalists, making very clear throughout the course of the day that when they discovered this last night, the State Department started to engage with their counterparts in the Foreign Affairs in Moscow, trying to make clear that communication needed to start. And that's critical for a number of different reasons, not the least of which to try and get more information about what exactly happened here. Now, Wolf, the President was briefed this morning about what happened throughout the course of the day. White House officials again have repeatedly said that they reject what has been the charges that have been laid out, they condemn what has happened. But as you noted, they've also warned other Americans if they have not left the country at this point, as the State Department has suggested now for more than a year, that they need to do so. Now, they have not extended that warning to journalists, making clear they understand that the jobs that journalists do are critical and important, but more broadly saying American citizens are at risk and need to leave the country. As for how this plays out going forward, there is a process in place, as we've seen in other detentions of Americans in the past where they need to get more information before they can identify him as wrongfully detained or put a more intensive process from the top line in to try and negotiate some type of release here. But I think when you talk to officials, they underscore the fact that they need some kind of information to start that process. One thing they make clear, though, Wolf, is they are intensively engaged at this point. And their primary goal, their overarching goal, is just to make first contact.",

Their track record is frankly lousy for manufacturing charges, allegations, or trumping them up, as we saw with Brittney Griner, for instance, and then creating, in effect, leverage hostages. I spoke with Adam Schiff this morning, he described this as a hostage situation, which they then can use as bargaining chips for other exchanges of Russians held here in the U.S.And by the way, it's a tactic we see not just from Russia, but from other regimes such as China and Iran in the past. It puts those individuals in a very precarious situation. So, a herring one for him and for his family. Bigger picture, part of a broader deterioration in the relationship between Russia and the U.S. coming the same week that Russia backs off commitments in a nuclear agreement, of course, the ongoing war in Ukraine and that broader deterioration, it just speaks to, Wolf, where we stand in this superpower relationship right now.

He's 31 years old. And the challenges of reporting in Russia right now, particularly now with Putin trying to control the narrative on his war in Ukraine. DAVID SANGER, CNN POLITICAL &amp; NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Well, that has been a problem, Wolf, really, since the war started. You may remember that a few weeks after the war began, there was a new national security law that was passed in Russia that basically made it a crime to call the war in Ukraine an invasion. Even to call it a war was supposed to be the special military operation that Putin had named it. Most major news organizations, American news organizations, pulled a lot of their reporters or all of them at that time for fear that their own coverage would lead those reporters to be prosecuted. That didn't happen. And you've seen reporters begin to filter back in. I suspect that with this nightmare unfolding, a lot of news organizations are now going to be recalculating the risks that are involved with having reporters there. You know, there are a lot of echoes to the Cold War here. This is very different than the Cold War, this era, for the reasons that Jim described before. But this sounds a lot like the case of Nick Daniloff, who was a U.S. news reporter who was arrested in 1986 and basically had been handed some documents at the last minute, one of which appeared to be classified and was immediately arrested. It was a complete set up. [17:10:07] BLITZER: Yes, I remember that as well. Natasha Bertrand, I know you're covering this in depth for us. Russia seems to be ruling out the prospect of a prisoner swap, at least for now. So what's the next step for the United States?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Wolf. What we've heard all day from the State Department and the White House is that they are trying extremely hard at this point to get consular access to this journalist. That is their main priority at this point. They want to essentially make contact with him so that they can figure out what kind of condition he's in, what the arrest was like, what kind of charges he is actually being detained on, because all we have heard so far from the Russians, of course, is that this vague charge of espionage. So getting that access to him is going to be really key.And then as a next step, the administration will have to determine whether or not he is considered wrongfully detained. And that is a special designation that the State Department makes that once they do, it essentially opens up a whole lot of resources that the administration can then do to kind of make a plan, make a strategic plan to try to get him back. It then would go to the special presidential envoy for hostage affairs. Essentially, if they make this determination, then he would be considered a hostage who would be wrongfully detained in Russia. And that will open up a lot of avenues for the administration to pursue here. But ultimately, I think the Paul Whelan case, of course, he has been detained in Russia for over four years for espionage is really instructive here. Paul Whelan, of course, was detained for over a year before he even had his trial on espionage charges. It was held very much cloaked in secrecy and the whole process was extremely dragged out and extremely secret. So I think that it's likely here that the administration's options are very limited moving forward, but there are some steps that they can take to kind of get the ball rolling here, Wolf.",

Because once it is, then it becomes a question of, you know, returning spy for spy, which goes to your conversation just now with Jim about whether or not this is in response to the arrest of a Russian last week.The second thing I think you're going to see the State Department try to do is see if they could get it resolved quickly before it gets into the court process. That's what happened in the Daniloff case, they got them out in a number of weeks. But that has not been the recent experience, not with the Brittney Griner case, not with the Paul Whelan case.

I don't know what happened with the Karen McDougal payments in terms of perhaps being on the books and whether they were misrepresented. So they could be looking to expand to do another count of that same charge that we've been talking about. Or they could be exploring that, because if they do charge the misdemeanor that we've been talking about and turn it into a felony by using a campaign finance violation, they will need to prove that there was a benefit to the campaign as opposed to just something to cover up, something that we personally embarrassing.And the evidence around the catch and kill with Karen McDougal does establish that was done in connection with the election. So that suggests that the Stormy Daniels one was also pursuant to the election. So, it could be one of those two things.

That would definitely be a smart move.As Jennifer was just saying, it may shore up a potential weakness or counter a defense Trump might make that it was for personal reasons, not campaign reasons. And most importantly, when you show a pattern of conduct to a jury, that's very, very damning evidence against the defendant. So, the more that they bring here, the more pairings they may have to change that misdemeanor into a felony, but also the more damning the evidence becomes because it looks like a whole pattern of behavior on Trump's part.",

We've seen a parade of high profile witnesses, close associates of the former president going before the grand jury to testify. And there was anticipation that this investigation was finally coming to an end. As Kara and John just reported here's, the grand jury has voted to indict. Now, the district attorney has been under some pressure. He has been criticized by some for not pursuing this more aggressively. And then, when this investigation heated up again, some people questioned whether he should go ahead with this, arguing that this was not one of the more significant investigations the former president would face. Clearly today, they moved forward with the grand jury to get an indictment. As it has been explained to us by the DA's office, what will happen next is that is expected to be filed under seal. And then they will have to negotiate a self-surrender from the former president. Now, we've been told by his legal team that he is expected to fully cooperate.

He himself, of course, has been bracing for it ever since he said that he believed last Tuesday he was going to essentially be arrested. Obviously, it did not happen at that time.They didn't really have a window into what the timing here was going to look like. They obviously were operating under what we had heard as of yesterday, which was that there was potentially going to be a hiatus for this grand jury. But now, obviously this has happened. And so the question is, what happens next? Because his attorneys have said that he will surrender, that he will fly his plane here to New York to go through the -- fingerprinted and photographed for the next steps of what an indictment looks like. We don't know how soon that will happen. It could take several days. But they have been planning do a very delicate or intricate detail, I should note, level of what that is going to look like. Talking about the kind of facial expression he has as he's walking into the courthouse, if it is in front of the cameras, as typically is the case here in Manhattan. Because they know that is going to be an image that is broadcast around the world. They know it's going to be something they believe, as Paula was saying, to his political advantage that he can use as he is running this third campaign for president. But I think we have heard this refrain from some people in recent days that say he actually wants to be indicted. They think it'll be good for him. He does not want to be indicted, certainly not for this case. This is one of the most personally sensitive situations for him. It was ever when he was in the White House, and there was reporting on this on a daily basis on who made these payments and who knew about these payments. Because it involved allegations about an affair and it was something that greatly bothered the First Lady Melania Trump, at the time. And so, it is a very sensitive case, actually, for Trump. And I think the idea that he wanted to be indicted does not match with any of the reporting that I've had. But it is a historic nature that he is now the first US president, former US president to face criminal charges.",

They have not gotten the information yet in order to proceed, but we are waiting for a statement on that.And I do want to talk about what Kaitlan just mentioned, which is this intricate detail of what it looks like to bring Donald Trump to the courthouse. They are looking at how exactly this is going to play out. There is a huge security component. There is also an optics component. They are talking about, as Kaitlan said, facial expressions. They're also talking about when is he going to make a statement, who is he going to make that statement to, where is that going to be. And last week, we reported that in the heat of all of this, that Trump had really run the gamut of emotions, and he had resigned himself to the fact that he was likely to get indicted. However, some of that did shift in recent days. I talked to some people who are close to Trump, who had talked to the former president, who said, because of the fact that the grand jury wasn't meeting because of this reporting, that they were hearing another case, because all that came after Costello's testimony in front of the grand jury. There was some hope there that maybe this meant this wasn't going to happen. Again, as Kaitlan said, this is not something that the former president wants. And even though we hear spin all the time from Republicans, from the former president himself, who says that this is going to help him politically, which it does appear in some cases it might in a contested primary there, there are still a lot of Trump allies and advisers, people who are close to him, who want him to win the nomination and the presidency in 2024, who don't think that this will help him in the long run, or at least are very concerned about what this is going to do with his political career.",

I think this has a very significant effect.I also think that, you know, he was very, very horrified, for lack of a better word, watching Allen Weisselberg, his former chief financial officer at the Trump Organization, taken away by officers when he surrendered, when he was indicted in 2021.

That moment with Allen Weisselberg is something that Trump has brought up repeatedly in private, noting the fact that it was someone that he had known and worked with for such a long time, was part of his organization for such a long time. They had this storied history together.And to watch what happened to him, I think really shook Trump. I mean, he often brought it up, still brings it up to this day, not just publicly on Truth Social, but at dinners, at private dinners with friends and private conversations, it's often talking about his own investigation. So it is a moment that actually shook him. And I do think that is something that he has been considering and thinking about in recent weeks, as this has become a very reality for him, that this is also something that could likely tap into him, that this arrest, this indictment, is something that was in his future. And they were bracing for it last week. They kind of had been under this impression down at Mar-a-Lago that it could happen any moment. They were making the preparations for what that would look like. It seemed to hit a lull. And Trump has this idea sometimes that if he goes and speaks, or if he speaks publicly about something that he can bend things toward his will. I think you saw that at his rally in Waco, Texas as he spent a large chunk of time talking about these investigations and talking about how he believes he's been treated unfairly. He even briefly entertained the idea of going before the grand jury, something that no attorney would recommend for their client because he does have this idea that he can shape people's opinions and change their views on things. Obviously, that has not happened here. And there are big questions about what this case actually looks like going forward. It's not a slam dunk, as you've heard from many legal experts.

It's going to between the DA's, Secret Service, New York Police Department.I just want to say what Kaitlan was pointing out about him being so affected by Weisselberg. I just find it interesting he didn't seem to be so moved or pained by Michael Cohen actually going to jail for this very crime. And it's Cohen now. It's going to be a central witness against him. And he's going to have to be faced with the question of how does he prepare for this reality with his legal team? I mean, will they even consider a guilty plea if something is offered? We don't really know how much leverage the DA has on him. He's going to learn that when they get a copy of the indictment. The movement we've been hearing about, the possible second charge with McDougal, even what we've heard about possible pressure on Weisselberg. We don't know if that's already been charged, and even if it hasn't, of course, there's still the possibility of a superseding indictment.

And so, when you have somebody like a Michael Cohen who has some baggage, she has a conviction, always they are attacked. He's been quite consistent, although rather verbose, he's been quite consistent. There's also an inherent bias towards someone like Stormy Daniels. I mean, she's female, she's in the adult film industry. And so, the prosecutors will be worried about overcoming that bias too. But it's not a factually difficult case to put forth but there are some credibility humps they have to get over.

I was covering the White House, Trump's first year in office, and we would run into Michael Cohen on the White House grounds. He had just had lunch with Melania Trump, he had told us. And to see him go from that moment of how close he was to where he was in the residence of the White House, to now here he is, of course, after his testimony on Capitol Hill, after his own plea, after we've seen all of that, is just remarkable in and of itself.

A lot of Republicans do think it is going to be something that is helpful to him, that he's able to celebrate, basically to a degree. Alan Dershowitz, who is very close to Trump, is speculating right now that he could use his mug shot potentially for campaign purposes. That all remains to be seen.
