We heard earlier today that President Erdogan had declared a state of emergency for three months. We have been hearing up to 70 nations now pledging to send help. Is any of this help getting through?

Here in Turkiye on every TV station they are rolling live images, of course, of these rescue operations happening in multiple towns. The first thing you notice in those images is the families, the families that are standing there, watching these rescue workers, wishing, hoping, waiting, praying that one of their loved ones is found alive.

So you are looking at a country that has been in conflict now for nearly 12 years. The northwest of Syria, which has been struck by this earthquake, affected by this earthquake, was one of the hardest hit areas during the conflict, constantly bombarded. It was shelling. The critical infrastructure there is essentially damaged or destroyed. You are talking about a region, where hospitals, schools, clinics were targeted. Many people already had no humanitarian help, already had very limited health care. You had 4 million displaced people who relied entirely on international aid before this earthquake. Then you have multiple authorities, ruling groups on the ground, government controlled regions. There we are seeing President Bashar al-Assad's government turning to Iran and Russia, the supporters of the conflict. Then you have the rebel held areas, where they are absolutely stretched thin on resources. Look, for a very long time, Syrians have felt that their plight has been forgotten by the world. I think that this only compounds that fear, that isolation. I can't even imagine a more vulnerable population being struck by yet another catastrophe when they have so little left to even handle it.",

One is going to Syria, by land through Jordan. Another is flying to Turkiye. Those also will have search and rescue teams, about 10 people on each of those planes. In addition there will be humanitarian aid. It just goes to show you that, hopefully, in these situations, when there is a crisis and people's lives are on the line, that politics, borders, diplomacy, all those sorts of things can stand to the side, so people can get the help that they need. I think everyone is hoping it doesn't matter where the help is coming from, as long as it can get to the people on the ground as quickly and safely as possible.

The U.S. Navy is working torecover remnants from the suspected Chinese spy balloon. China's ministry of foreign affairs said the airship belongs to China and called the use of force in shooting down the balloon an overreaction. Meanwhile, CNN has exclusive new reporting that U.S. military officials did know about China's use of spy balloons under the Trump administration. Let's bring in White House reporter, Natasha Bertrand, for more on the story. Natasha, we now know these balloons are no longer isolated incidents. What more are you learning?",

      "sentences": "That is exactly right. What we are learning from this Air Force intelligence report, that wasobtained by my colleague, Zach Cohen, is that, in 2019, a Chinese spy balloon circumnavigated the globe and passed over Hawaii, passed over Florida, ultimately exited U.S. airspace kind of undeterred. At the same time, what we are learning is the U.S. did not actually realize that that had happened until much later, until the Biden administration actually took office and started investigating these unexplained aerial phenomenon (sic) more closely. So what we are learning is that the Trump administration actually did not know this happened. The balloon sightings we are seeing now, of course, the one that was shot down over U.S. waters on Saturday, that was not the first time that has happened. It actually has happened as many as three times, before, including during the Trump administration and once before during the Biden administration. All of this is very concerning to the administration and the U.S. military. What it shows is that there are gaps in the U.S.' ability to detect these surveillance balloons. These things can fly extremely high. The one that was detected from 2019, which was then included in this Air Force report, was only at about 65,000 feet. But they can fly as high as 328,000 feet. So it makes it really easy to understand how they can go undetected by the U.S. However, the U.S. military says that this is a problem that they are going to have to look into further because, obviously, without being able to detect these balloons, it is going to be increasingly difficult to minimize those balloons' ability to collect intelligence about the United States and about potentially sensitive sites that they may be passing over.",

Just in the coming hours we, of course, expect that group to put the finishing touches on that speech. Yesterday, we heard President Biden telling reporters that he really sees this as an opportunity to talk directly to the American people, to have a conversation with them. Of course, we do broadly expect that the president will look back on the past two years and talk about what he sees as the major accomplishments and the progress the country has made, whether it is on the economy or the COVID pandemic. We also expect him to have a forward-looking vision, an affirmative message, really trying to sell to the American people, as you said, why the country might be better off if he were to be in office for an additional four years. We, of course, expect a reelection announcement to come from the president in the coming weeks. But you are absolutely right that the suspected Chinese spy balloon incident has definitely loomed large ahead of this major speech. And U.S. officials have made clear that this was a breach, in their view, coming from Beijing. They have made their displeasure known about this. So this is certainly going to be an issue. We are told the president will directly address. As to what, exactly, the tone the president takes, whether he says this was a major breach and Beijing needs to back off, perhaps there is hostility or intensity and heat coming from the president. Or on the other hand maybe he says, yes, it was a breach. But we have gotten over it. The U.S. has handled it. I support the way my administration has handled this, taking the tone of, nothing more to see here. We don't know exactly what he will say about this incident. But no question that this will be a major part of the speech that we are watching very closely. Obviously, at every State of the Union speech, foreign policy ends up being such a major pillar. Again, we expect this to be something the president addresses. It is just a matter of exactly how he chooses to address this issue.",

And the story that the White House would like to tell about the past year and looking forward, just to name a few, we know that, sitting with the first lady, Jill Biden, will be Paul Pelosi. He is, of course, the spouse of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who was violently attacked in his home. Political extremism and battling political extremism has been a major theme for this president. So not surprising, in some ways, that he wanted to demonstrate that continued effort by inviting Paul Pelosi. There is also Tyre Nichols' parents. Nichols, of course, was killed in a brutal beating by police officers. This is an incident that has really caused so much outrage and trauma across the country. Policing reform is an issue that the president has talked about, a lot, and aspires to get more done on. But it has been a very challenging issue for this administration, because, politically, it is so fraught and challenging. One other person that we expect to see tonight as well is Ukraine's ambassador to the U.S. Very obvious why someone like her would be invited, of course. Ukraine has been such a major focus and driving factor for this president over the last year. And, of course, we are approaching that end of the one year mark of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. And for this president, at, least, you know it has really been a challenge and an opportunity for him to demonstrate some leadership on the world stage, to continue to try to rally American allies against the goal of trying to keep the nation united as Russia has continued to invade Ukraine. So these are some of the themes that we will see demonstrated in the president's speech and, again, as we said, the guests that are attending tonight's speech will sort of demonstrate and help paint a story of the narrative that the White House wants to put out there tonight.",

Immediately afterwards, I'm sure the authorities will focus on questions of housing, feeding those people who cannot return to their homes and of course, will start the painful process of reconstruction. And we point out this earthquake has not only affected Turkiye; it has also affected Syria. There it is even more complicated, because essentially there is no official interlocutor. So we have to work through international organizations.

Jim, significant disruption, yet again. Is there any sense that the government are yielding or simply hardening their position on this? JIM BITTERMANN, CNN SR. INTL. CORRESPONDENT:  Well, I think Mr. Macron has made it very clear he wants to reform retirement plans here. It's -- made that clear from almost his first day in office. There has been some movement from the government. They did compromise on one issue; that is, basically, if you start work at age 22 or 20, you can retire at age 63, which would be one year more than what is the present retirement age of 62. But what's got all these people out here is that is just a very incremental change. They're afraid that they may have to work until 64 years old. Currently they only have to work until 62. So there are, I would say, probably 1 million or so in the streets today. By all accounts, it's not as many that were out just back on the 31st of January. So it could be a sign that the support for this movement is just diminishing. In fact that also may not be the cause. It could be that, in fact, it's because school vacations are on. And there's another strike, another strike and demonstration movement coming up on Saturday. So people maybe saving their energy for that Saturday demonstration that's going to take place here.",

In fact, there are a lot of young people out here today, including student unions and whatnot. But also, of course, people near the retirement age; I've seen a couple of interviews here done, where people are saying, hey, look, I've only got a year or two left before I hit age 62. I was planning on retiring. Now, you're saying I've got to on for another couple of years. Actually, that is not the case. This law would not go into effect for a few years. But in any case, it is quite a movement. There's a lot of people out who are opposed to this. Pollsters say there is about 62 percent or 70 percent of the French are on the side of the people out here demonstrating.",
