There are a total of 12 jurors plus six alternates. Ten of them are women, eight are men. So what do we know about the people deciding the fate of the former president. The foreman originally from Ireland, works in sales. Juror number two is an investment banker who follows Trump's Truth Social post. Juror five is a young Black woman who teaches English. She says that as a person of color, some of her friends have strong opinions on Trump. However, she says she is not political. We should note this other news today, a man set himself on fire right outside the courthouse just a couple of hours ago. Police say the man walked into a public park across the street, opened his backpack, scattered pamphlets. We should be clear, not tied to Trump trial in any way, then he pulled out a canister holding some kind of flammable liquid, lit himself on fire. Police say he is alive, but in critical condition at a nearby hospital. Marshall Cohen is in Washington. Mark Morales is outside the courthouse, and Mark, if I could begin with you to be clear, police have said lot of conspiracy theories that this person was spouting prior to this attack and distributing pamphlets as it happened, but not tied in any way to events inside the courthouse.",

And this really sort of brings security back to the forefront because this is one of the hardest things for law enforcement to defend against. I wouldn't necessarily call it a blind spot, but when you have somebody who is looking to do some kind of damage and does not really care about whether they get arrested, this can be one of the hardest things for them to defend. Just to go back through what happened, around 1:30 in the afternoon, he is seen walking in to the park, opening his backpack, digging in, grabbing those leaflets, and then grabbing some sort of an accelerant, dousing himself with that and then lighting himself on fire. It wasn't too much longer before local police officers and other court officers, even passersby came by to snuff that flame out.

He is trying again, appeals court is hearing it. Most likely outcome from this appeals court decision? THOMAS G. MOUKAWSHER, FORMER JUDGE FOR CONNECTICUT SUPERIOR COURT: Well, I don't think there is going to be a change in venue at this point. I think that in fact the jury selection process has proved that they could find a wide variety of people who weren't necessarily prejudiced against the former president.

And nobody -- no business is coming into the city. None whatsoever. They are looking at that case, that case is a threat to democracy, frankly, what took place with the A.G. A crooked A.G., Letitia James, who campaigned on the fact -- who campaigned of the fact that I'm going to get Trump -- I'm going to give Trump. That's all she said for two years. And its -- people don't want to see this stuff, where you have violent criminals all over the streets of New York, and nothing happens. So, even when they catch them, they let them go. No bail -- no bail whatsoever. So, this is just a concerted witch hunt, whether it's Judge Kaplan with a person, I have no idea until they called and said they are suing us. I had no idea who this person was. Who are this judge -- or if you look at Engoron, where he said that Mar-a-Lago, whichever was worth a billion or a billion and a half now, she said it was where they keep and get tell us because that suited his narrative. But what -- what's happening in this city and all over the country, but what's happening in particular in this city, some are very good, by the way. Some are very fair, versus really the cities that are thriving. But what's happening here with the judicial system is an outrage, and all over the world, they are watching it, and all over the world they are saying, this is a giant witch hunt, to try and hurt a campaign that's beating the worst president in history.
