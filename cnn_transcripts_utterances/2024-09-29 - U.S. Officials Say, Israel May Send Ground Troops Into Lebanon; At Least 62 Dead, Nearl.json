I appreciate your company.It is now 7:00 A.M. in Beirut where fears are growing that the exchange of missile fire between Israel and Hezbollah could ground war. U.S. officials say Israeli troops have mobilized and are clearing areas in what could be preparation for ground troops to move across the border. Israel is saying a ground offensive is only one option being considered. The IDF continued their air offensive meanwhile on Saturday with blasts hitting close to Beirut Airport. Saturday's strikes in Lebanon reportedly killing more than 30 people and wounding close to 200 others. Overall, nearly a thousand Lebanese have been killed since this latest escalation, according to health officials. Hezbollah firing back, saying it launched missiles towards Jerusalem, prompting a response from Israeli air defenses. Police say pieces of one intercepted missile crashed in the suburbs. All of this happening after Israel killed Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, prompting new fears of a wider war in the region. Hezbollah pledging to continue its fight, while Iran says Israel will face, quote, a crushing blow for the killing. Israeli Prime Minister's response was, think twice. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And we've seen, as we can see now, smoke hanging over the Beirut skyline there.We've also seen air raid sirens in Israel's southernmost city, Eilat, sounding as a projectile was heading that way, something that was claimed by Iran-backed militia in Iraq, and also air raid sirens sounding in northern Israel. So, certainly no let up in hostilities there or in Israel's airstrikes. And as Oren was saying Israel feels that after the walkie-talkie explosions and after decapitating Hezbollah, not just by killing its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, but also most of its senior military leaders as well, Israel feels that it has momentum, that it has the advantage, that it still has its boot on Hezbollah's throat, and that now is the time to press that advantage. So, no let up in that that air campaign and Israel will continue to do so until, as again, Oren was saying, Israel has fulfilled its objective, which is to return safety and security to Northern Israel, to allow the 60,000-plus Israelis to return, something they've not been able to do since October the 8th, when Hezbollah began firing on Israel in solidarity with Hamas a day after the terrorist attacks carried out by Hamas. So, that is something that is continuing. And as Oren was also saying, you know, the question now is if Israel can't achieve that objective just with airstrikes, the possibility of a ground incursion remains open.",

I appreciate you being with us. Good to see you. Hezbollah is Iran's most prized non-state ally. Does Nasrallah's death, along with the other hits on Hezbollah, the crippling of Hamas in Gaza, and the assassination of the Hamas leader, Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, Does all of this weaken Iran's reach or influence regionally? Is it humiliating for Iran? TRITA PARSI, EXECUTIVE V.P., QUINCY INSTITUTE: It certainly has been humiliating. And Hezbollah, of course, is of tremendous importance to Iran. Iran views it as its first line of defense against any Israeli aggression. And, for instance, in 2006, when Israel went into Lebanon, and as you reported, actually suffered a defeat, part of the objective was to get rid of Hezbollah in order to pave the way for an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities. Because of the failure in Lebanon, of course, then there also wasn't that type of an attack, but it tells you the importance that Hezbollah has played for Iran's security strategy. So, with the way that Hezbollah now has been hit with some major, major blows, this is definitely setting back Iran.

And Tehran has been very much criticized by many of them, particularly by the Houthis, for being too risk averse and not willing to enter the fight.Iran's objective clearly has been to stay out of this fight, but that is becoming increasingly difficult given the blows that Hezbollah is suffering. Because going back to your earlier question, Iran not responding is also something that is very costly to Iran, not just amongst its rivals in the region, but amongst its partners in the Axis who are increasingly frustrated that Iran isn't doing much.",

So, it's a question really for Iran is not going to be very difficult to pick a successor. There are two obvious successors in line, which is his deputy, Naim Qassem, or the head of the political bureau of the Shia (ph) Council, Hashim Safieddine. These are usually talked about as the normal successors. but not only they are not. They do not have the same popularity. They're not linked to the legacy of Hezbollah and its victories.
