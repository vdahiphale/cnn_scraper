Well, it is looking more and more likely, we will see a 2020 rematch in the U.S. presidential race this November, after Joe Biden and Donald Trump dominated contests on Super Tuesday where 15 states and one U.S. territory held primaries. Among the last states reporting results, delegate rich California with CNN projects another win for Trump, a victory too for Biden.And in Utah, President Biden is heading for a victory there in the Democratic race. He has so far won every Super Tuesday contest except American Samoa. And Trump is also looking for a Utah when as the votes continue to come in. There was one small prize on the night for Nikki Haley. CNN project she will win Vermont's Republican primary with 17 delegates would stake. Despite that win, Trump has built a commanding lead in the delegate count over Haley, his only remaining Republican opponent. Trump didn't mention Haley during his victory speech, but did criticize President Biden and his immigration policies. Here is part of his message to supporters. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: They call it Super Tuesday for a reason. This is a big one. And they tell me, the pundits and otherwise that there's never been one like this, has never been anything so conclusive. This was an amazing, -- an amazing night and an amazing day. It's been an incredible period of time. And our country's history, it's been said in so many ways, but I think it's going to be inspiring because we're going to do something that frankly, nobody is been able to do for a long time.

The next couple of weeks, you should expect them to expand out their campaign operations in places like Michigan, Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Nevada, states that they believe our high priority battleground states.And we have seen a lot of polling that shows Donald Trump ahead in some of these days. But they're not taking any of this for granted. They do not believe that every single poll is completely accurate. They believe that every vote is going to count. And then, any kind of rematch with President Joe Biden is going to be incredibly close. So, that's why you're seeing them start to build out this operation. Now, they also know that their candidate is incredibly polarizing. So, that's something they have to work on. Now, some -- one of the things that I've been told by a senior advisor they are going to look into tonight is looking at some of the datasets, and seeing how it could shape some of their strategy in these battleground states, particularly when you're looking at states like Virginia, not quite a battleground state that more leans blue, but states like North Carolina, which, again, leans a little bit red, but it's still considered a purple or battleground state. The other part of what you noticed tonight from Donald Trump was the fact that he stayed on message for Donald Trump. This is what his campaign advisors and what his allies want him to continue to do. Not mentioning Nikki Haley, not going off into any rabbit holes, but instead, focusing on immigration, the economy, and the general election. He even talked about unifying the party. Now, of course, Donald Trump does not have a good track record when it comes to unifying the Republican Party. However, this is exactly what his campaign, his allies want him to continue to do as they head in to November.",

Henry has not been seen in public since last week when he visited Kenya to sign an agreement on a mission intended to help Haiti's police beat back the gangs. But around the same time that deal was signed, the same gangs launched a wave of coordinated attacks on capital city, Port-au-Prince. And according to the leader of one gang coalition, Jimmy Cherizier, who goes by the name, Barbecue, the attacks are intended to overthrow Henry's government. The attacks have targeted state institutions. The gangs have burned down police stations and broken into two prisons, releasing, thousands of prisoners. And they have also targeted the airport, where it seems they are waiting for Henry's return. Security sources say the love of coordination between previously warring gangs is unprecedented. This time, they are using each other's territories to launch attacks for example. And amid the chaos, Haiti's government has declared a state of emergency. The neighboring Dominican Republic has stopped all flights connecting to Haiti. Meanwhile, the civilian toll is rising. The United Nations says thousands of people have been forced to flee their homes. And that adds the over 300,000 who had already been displaced by gang violence before this escalation.

Two key Russian military commanders, both functioning in the Black Sea area issued arrest warrants by the International Criminal Court.Two of them, both accused of being involved in attacks on civilian, infrastructure, and essentially the damage that has caused to the civilian population, essentially killing innocent civilians. Here, the warrant points to two individuals, Admiral Viktor Sokolov, and another man, Lieutenant General Sergei Kobylash, both of whom were key commanders in the Black Sea. The warrant suggests, during the last couple of years while much munitions fight against civilian areas were initially originating from the Black Sea fleet, that Black Sea Fleet itself though targeted by Ukraine over the past hours. The Ukrainian intelligence service suggesting they managed to take out a patrol ship called the Sergey Kotov that cost $65 million they said, another example of how Ukraine has begun to project its force into areas that Moscow would normally have considered to be its safe territory. These outlying suggestions of Ukrainian strategic success, it comes a time of extraordinary trouble for Ukraine here near the eastern front where I'm standing, You can hear the distant rumble of explosions far away from me. Really Ukraine is struggling to hold the defensive line. It said, it will be able to maintain after it pulled out of the town of Avdiivka, about two weekends ago. Avdiivka be fought over for months, and Ukraine said that it had voluntarily pulled back. It gave up a number of villages in its retreat, and it said it would hold another three villages. Those villages themselves under significant Russian repeated persistent assault, Russia would throw extraordinary resources at these particular objectives. And Ukraine, I think on the best day struggling to suggest that it has that fight calmed entirely. It's significant because if we do see Russia continue to put pressure on Ukrainian front lines around me here. There are minimal signs that there is another back defensive line prepared for Ukraine to be able to hold. And so, we are dealing with a very complex time for Ukraine in this moment. They are able to project success in the Black Sea. Yes, they even suggested in the recent days, they hit a bridge 500 miles inside Russia, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said they took 15 fighter jets out of the sky in February alone. They are doing things that nobody felt they could do at the start of the war. But the one thing that we're able to do right now is hold key parts of the Donbas front line, because they haven't got the ammunition they need from the west. And that is because of the holdup in Republican held Congress. No sign of that changing at all. And we hear from Ukrainian fighters on the front line here that it is simply a matter of life and death, until that changes. And already, the resurgence of Russia is changing the frontline calculus daily. Nick Paton Walsh, CNN, eastern Ukraine.",

It was a call between senior German commanders, including the commanding general of the German Air Force, and Pistorius said that one of the people who was on that call, called in from Singapore using the Webex software, but failed to adhere to the necessary security protocols. In general, though, the German defense minister does say that he takes all of this very seriously. All this has caused a massive rout between Germany and the Russians. The Russians, for their part are accusing the Germans of planning to attack the bridge of Kerch, which is of course, the bridge that links Russia to occupied Crimea, using the Taurus missile. The Germans for their part, see that the conversation did deal with Taurus missile, and then it dealt with the specs of the Taurus missile and how many of those missiles would be needed to destroy the Kerch Bridge, obviously, the Germans saying that they did not plan to attack the Kerch Bridge. All this, of course, comes as Germany has been talking about possibly giving these Taurus cruise missiles to the Ukrainians. So far, the German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is saying that he is not willing to do that at this point in time.

It's not a large proportion, of those voters, but it is a significant proportion, and it has a steady and consistent one over the last several election cycles. So, most certainly, the Biden camp is going to have to do work to build back those relationships where they can. We see a lot of the shift in some of these voters.

This just goes to show that on so many issues, you got to ignore public instead (ph), you've got to watch instead what they do.

So both parties looking to flip this seat in November, and now, instead of it being a three-way contest involving Kyrsten Sinema running as an independent and running as an incumbent, it is going to come down to a two-way contest between a Republican and a Democrat, at least making things a little bit more cut and dry. And both parties believed this is going to be a boost for their own chances. Just take listen to Steve Daines, the Head of the Senate GOP's campaign arm.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. STEVE DAINES, (R-MT): Wasn't surprised by that announcement. And the polling shows that actually gives somewhat advantage to Kari Lake in all polling we've done.

And also, because she is at least in the past, expressed support for bans on abortion even though she has sought to moderate that issue in recent days.

And we've been watching this over the course of the last hour. These are supposed to be international waterways with free passage. I'm aboard this Philippines Coast Guard ship that was part of a convoy of four vessels that were headed towards a place called the Second Thomas Shoal.And before dawn, all of a sudden, these Philippine ships were swarmed by much larger and many more Chinese ships that are more off to our port bow. These are not marked like the Chinese Coast Guard ships, but they're clearly operating with them and operating in very close proximity to this Philippines Coast Guard ship. In fact, I've seen them in the past, cutting this off and what they've succeeded in doing is not only pretty much stopping our ship in its tracks, but it has separated this ship from the other boats in the Philippines convoy, which included two small resupply vessels that were trying to get to the Second Thomas Shoal. Now, part of what is at play here is a territorial dispute. That Shoal the Philippines claims is part of its economic exclusion zone. China, though it is much further geographically from this area, claims it for itself and clearly tries to stop Philippine ships from getting to it. We are completely encircled by a fleet of Chinese ships, at least 14 that I've counted. And moments ago, the Chinese Coast Guard ships were blasting a Philippines resupply vessel with water cannons. It is clearly by swarming this ship, a show of force and a show of intimidation, and it is physically stopping vessels from another country from being able to move forward through this international waterway.

      "sentences": "Hey, Rosemary. Yeah, so Reuters had reported yesterday that the Hamas delegation in Cairo for those talks had been persuaded by mediators to continue for one more day after talks appeared to have broken off. That's not necessarily a sign that they are onto something or that there's going to be a breakthrough just because Hamas is continuing to talk.Egyptian state media says that there are difficulties. The foreign minister, the Egyptian foreign minister said yesterday that he's neither optimistic nor pessimistic about the situation, but said that it's clear that they are not ready for a ceasefire right now, and there are no signs of an impending breakthrough or anything like that. And also remember, the Israelis aren't even in Cairo for these talks, a decision made by the Mossad Director and also by the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu because they say that Hamas has not responded to two of its key demands. Number one, that is for Hamas to provide a list of all of the hostages, who is alive and who is dead. Something that Hamas said yesterday that they could not provide until a ceasefire actually began. They are also looking for confirmation of the ratio of hostages to be released for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. Reuters and Al Jazeera had reported last week that Hamas was considering a proposal for 40 hostages to be released in exchange for 400 Palestinian prisoners. So 10:1 ratio. But again, all of this is under negotiation. Hamas also put out a statement just today saying that, look, they are being flexible. They have been flexible on their demands, but they accused the Israelis have not addressing what they would like to see and their demands are three things. Number one, a permanent ceasefire. Though that's something that Prime Minister Netanyahu has made clear is not going to happened because he will only consider the war to be over once Hamas is completely wiped out. And that also involves an invasion or going into Rafah where more than a million people are currently sheltering. Hamas is also demanding a complete withdrawal of Israeli troops, something that seems to be a non-starter or is at odds with the day- after plan released by the Israelis which would allow unfettered access to Gaza for IDF troops there and also full control of Gaza's borders. And Hamas is also looking for people displaced from the north to be allowed to return to their homes from the south, something that seems relatively benign, but again, is at odds with Israel's insistence that even after a pause to get hostages out and aid in, that the war will in fact begin again. The U.S. is pushing maybe a more stopgap proposal and that is for a six-week stop in fighting in exchange for Hamas releasing 40 hostages -- sorry, in exchange for Hamas releasing vulnerable hostages. We are talking about women, elderly people, sick, injured people, but the difficulty with that we understand is that Hamas has not agreed on to engage on a definition of who would be considered vulnerable in that circumstance. And so, that is where things stand right now. Obviously, the U.S. continues to push Israel to get more aid in. It seems to be running out of patience given the humanitarian situation there, given the risk of famine, the Hamas-run Ministry of Health in Gaza says that 15 children have already died from malnutrition or dehydration already. And so, the U.S. is doing whatever they can. They are airdropping aid, as you mentioned already, along with some other countries. Something that should be pretty embarrassing considering that Israel is its very close ally. It is considering a maritime corridor to get more aid into Gaza. It is calling for the immediate ceasefire at the U.N. Security Council, as you mentioned, Rosemary, a change in their previous position and also U.S. officials met with Prime Minister Netanyahu's chief rival Benny Gantz yesterday. Rosemary?",

And with the Chinese economy facing that long laundry list of challenges that you mentioned just then, the Chinese President Xi Jinping is now calling for China to unleash new quality productive forces. This is his new mantra at the National People's Congress, which is currently underway this week in Beijing. We heard China release that growth target of around 5 percent this year, but no major stimulus measures were announced.So, analysts fear that China may have a target, but it doesn't have a plan. In fact, one analyst at UBS says this. Let's bring up the quote for you. He says, \"The growth target is OK, but the missing part is how they want to achieve that. What sort of stimulus is unclear for now.\" Now, during the Congress, Xi Jinping spoke to a delegation from Jiangxi Province and he used that new mantra saying this -- let's bring up Xi's words. Xi Jinping saying developing new quality productive forces does not mean neglecting or abandoning traditional industries. It is necessary to prevent a headlong rush into projects and the formation of industry bubbles. Now, that term, \"new productive forces\" that was first used by Xi Jinping September last year when he called for the need for new growth model based on innovation. But analysts point out that Xi is putting the focus on future economic growth at a time when China right now is facing a long list of economic issues, like the property crisis, like the demographic crisis, like weak consumer spending, (inaudible) unemployment, rising local government debt, et cetera, et cetera. The situation has gotten so bad. It's been called a drag on world output by the IMF. Now, we are, Rosemary, monitoring a press conference that's happening right now in Beijing with senior officials. It's an economy related press conference. The Central Bank Governor is there, along with China's Commerce and Finance Ministry Chiefs, and its top securities regulators.
