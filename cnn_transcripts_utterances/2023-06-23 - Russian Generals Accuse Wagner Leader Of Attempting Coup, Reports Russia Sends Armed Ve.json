There are reports of military vehicles on the streets in Moscow right now. The Russian military is accusing the head of the mercenary Wagner Group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, of calling for an armed coup in Russia. Prigozhin is vowing violent retaliation for what he says was a deadly attack by Russian forces that killed a huge amount of his mercenaries. President Biden has been briefed on this situation. We're told national security officials at the White House are closely watching developments and not weighing in until they have a clearer sense of what exactly is happening.

It could eventually see him jailed in what would be a dramatic fall from grace of one of the country's most prominent and outspoken figures. For months, Prigozhin has been lambasting Russia's high command for its handling of the Ukraine war, routinely accusing the defense minister and the country's defense chief of incompetence. In the hours before the alleged attack on the Wagner camp, prigozhin posted more comments on social media accusing the defense ministry of deceiving President Putin about the threat posed by Ukraine ahead of his February 2022 invasion. He also questioned Russia's invasion motives for the war. Now, Moscow has been placed on high alert and Prigozhin has said there's going to be a march for justice against Russian officials he said were responsible for attacking Wagner, while his mercenary forces are said to be now entering the southern Russian region of Rostov.

General, thanks so much. I know you've been monitoring this now for a couple of hours. What is happening in Russia? LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Alisyn, some back and forth. Matthew and Oren just elaborated on some very important factors. First of all, you can never believe what comes out of Russia. There is always an element of what they call maskirovka. It's a deception effort to fool the enemy into thinking they're doing something that they're not. But there are also indicators. We're seeing military vehicles loggering, forming groups within Red Square. They're increasing the security around the Moscow region itself. You're also seeing on Telegram channels some firefights going on in the province of Rostov, which, as Oren just said, to the southeast and it's just over the border from Ukraine. This is where Prigozhin said he was going to go with his forces and he also said his forces were attacked by helicopters when they were in a column going into that oblast in Russia. But Rostov is about 200 miles away from Moscow. So, you don't create a coup outside of a capital city where Putin is and holding court. But this comes at a horrible time. All afternoon long, you've seen Russian generals get on Telegram channels saying, Prigozhin, don't do what you're doing right now, it's going to be harmful to what we do. You now see the map of Rostov outside the border of Ukraine. And, again, to the northeast of that is the capital of Moscow. It would take a long time for Prigozhin and his troops to do something within the capital city where a coup is normally formulated. But you have all these generals, Russian generals on Telegram channels today saying, Prigozhin, don't do this, it's only going to hurt our cause. The Ukrainians are coming to our zero line, which what is they call their final defensive lines and we have control. Don't mess with them now. The problem is with that, Alisyn, there's a whole different subset between Russian generals and what's going on in the Kremlin and what the individual soldiers are experiencing on the frontlines. But when that trust and when that command infrastructure further breaks down, as we've seen it done so many times during this war within the Russian hierarchy, it only causes more problems at the front. So, this is a fascinating dynamic of personalities inside of Moscow and the Kremlin. How much is it going to affect the frontline? I'm not sure just yet. But I got to tell you, I'd much rather be on the Ukrainian side right now than the Russian side, because there is utter chaos and dysfunction allegedly on the Russian side, whereas the Ukrainian side is continuing with their own momentum in their offensive.",

So, the U.S. intelligence community probably has a much better feel for what's going on certainly than we do, but I would also suggest certainly a better feel for what's going on than even Mr. Putin does.They have intelligence human factors inside of Russia that's giving them information. They have satellite imagery of any kind of troop movements. So, if Prigozhin really is moving, we probably have a pretty good feel for that. They have what's called Mazen (ph), signals intelligence, reading their mail. So, all of these things, I think, give the best-equipped intelligence in the United States with some very accurate information of what's happening. And, by the way, great question, because I'm sure we're sharing quite a bit of that with the Ukrainian government.",

Although as we've reported over the last few months, much of that has been a meat grinder, they've just been throwing soldiers to their deaths.But, truthfully, the Prigozhin-Wagner Group is mostly an infantry force, in other words, dismounted soldiers. They have some conventional equipment, but they certainly don't have fighter bombers or tanks in the scale that the rest of the Russian army has. But as we've seen throughout this war, the Russian army has not fought well either and there's an increasing protest movement inside of Russia, as well as some of the groups that have attacked within Russia from the Ukrainian side. So, I think you're seeing a Putin that perhaps is taking a lot of hits from a variety of different angles. And I wouldn't bet on either side, to be honest with you, if it was Prigozhin versus the entire Russian military, it might be an interesting fight, but I'm not sure who would come out on top. But notwithstanding that, it's going to certainly be a benefit to the Ukrainian counteroffensive.",

As General Hertling just said, it's very important in particular for the Ukrainians. Ukrainians are now wrapping up their counteroffensive. This is the perfect timing for the Ukrainians to really take advantage of this chaos in Moscow, chaos in the Russian military. So, this is an opportunity for the Ukrainians to take advantage of that misunderstanding, not knowing, as General Hertling just said, the Russian soldiers not real sure what's going on back with their chain of command.

He's hoping to get support from Russian soldiers who were disgruntled. General Hertling just described how they've been thrown into the meat grinder around Bakhmut, in Ukraine. There are families that have lost soldiers, a lot of families, 200,000, probably more, 250,000 families who have lost their loved ones. There's discontent.

All he has to do is cut off or control certain railway, for instance. And you can basically paralyze the military movements, you can paralyze the economy that way. And then Prigozhin can either extract something or bring the folks on thinks side.So, I personally am not sitting around expecting a legitimate, traditional coup to happen in terms of Vladimir Putin is out, Prigozhin is in, it's possible, but I certainly think he's going to extract some big concessions.

It's possible. Because what he wants to do is he knows he's losing in Ukraine but he can't declare that. And so every day that goes by, he throws more and more bodies at this war simply because it buys him an extra day on the earth.So, I think his hold on power is certainly tenuous.

In addition to that, you've got the Canadian Transportation Board involved as well. What's going to be key to the investigation, though, forensic evidence, right? You've got to get as much as you can, gather as many pieces as you can, of the Titan as possible.

So while you've heard word about vessels pulling out of the area, and indeed that is happening in the North Atlantic, those ROVs, those remotely operated vehicles, are staying there. They're continuing to scour the debris area, trying to get as much evidence as possible, because what forensic experts are going to have to do is they're going to have pieces of that hull, and they're going to have to get, try to do some testing on that to try to come to some conclusion about the integrity of the hull.

In fact, he took the same trip on board the Titan to see the Titanic wreckage two years ago. David, thank you so much for your time and for being here. Back at that time, two years ago, when you took this trip down to view the Titanic, did you have any reservations about the safety of the submersible? DAVID WAUD, RODE ON THE TITAN IN 2021: No, I did not. And in fact, I felt very lucky to be one of only 200 some odd people who would have ever seen the Titanic underwater at the 12,500 foot level. And now I feel of course very lucky that I went on the fifth trip with Titan when the hull was still strong enough to withstand that pressure. But I did not have any reservations. I thought the trip was very professionally run. I adored Stockton and P.H. who were on the trip with me. Only Stockton was in the submersible, not P.H. on that particular dye. But I didn't have any reservations. I just was so excited to be doing something that I'd been hoping to do for 11 years.",

I think then the Titan was tested and found that maybe it had to be reinforced some more, which I think was done during 2020. I don't know all the details in that.

It's a mangled, very big piece of metal. And we also were in the debris field the next day, which was the last day for all those summer trips.Three other men went down with Stockton and P.H. and actually got the film. And of course, when everyone thinks of the Titanic, they think of the bow. And I was also filming, cause I was gonna make a movie for charities about this trip. So I was disappointed, but still the whole process of going down 12,500 feet was amazing. So I considered it a very successful trip.",

Special counsel Jack Smith filing a request tonight for the trial date to be moved to December.We also have exclusive CNN reporting on the special counsel's investigation into Donald Trump's involvement in January 6th. So here to help us understand all of this, we have CNN senior crime and justice reporter, Katelyn Polantz and defense attorney, Misty Marris. Thank you both for being here. Okay, so Katelyn, tell us about these late Friday filings. KATELYN POLANTS, CNN SR. CRIME AND JUSTICE REPORTER: Late Friday filings, Alisyn. These are a little bit procedural, but they're important procedural steps that have to be taken. So there's the first one. Is this trial date request from the prosecutors? This was very expected that trial date the judge put on the calendar earlier this week for August was never gonna hold because there needs to be a lot done in this case, especially around classified documents and the handling of them. That all has to be litigated with special proceedings. So now the Justice Department is saying they want that trial date to be in December. Still a pretty quick turnaround for a trial. We'll have to see what happens though with the judge and Donald Trump's team. And the other thing, Alisyn, in these late night filings tonight is that there are 84 witnesses, according to what the Donald Trump's team says are on a list that the Justice Department provided that he is not allowed to be talking about the details of this case with. That would be part of his release conditions as well as the release conditions of his co-defendant, Walt Nauta. And 84 names is quite a list. We're also going to have to wait and see what happens with that. The Justice Department did hand over that list after setting the bond conditions following Donald Trump saying he was not guilty in court last week. But there could be some more disputes that arise as his co- defendant, Walt Nauta, is headed to be in court next Tuesday to enter his initial pleading of not guilty as well. Alisyn?",

And what happened with this immunity situation is that two of thosefake electors from Nevada went into the grand jury last week and were given some limited immunity to force them to testify. They didn't want to answer questions under their Fifth Amendment rights, wanted to decline, and the prosecutors said that wasn't going to fly. They needed their testimony.
