I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York, sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. Well, the stakes in Ukraine have again been laid bare. A Russian ballistic missile hit Odessa today, killing at least eight people, with children among the seriously injured. So, the news that President Biden will allow the use of powerful long-range American weapons inside Russia may feel timely. Russia says the decision will throw oil on the fire. So, President Biden just raised the stakes in this war. But will these missiles make any real difference? First, let's ask our guest, Dara Massicot, who's a senior fellow at the Russia and Eurasia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. She joins me from Washington, D.C. Dara, always good to see you. So, first of all, your reaction to President Biden finally greenlighting the use of long-range ATACMS missiles. This has been something that military experts have been pushing for the administration to do for months now. Obviously, it goes without saying, the Ukrainians have been making the same ask. How significant is this development?",

But I do think that it's going to alleviate some of the pressure and some of the most problematic parts of the front. It will just depend on how many missiles they are given.",

Is this more of a symbolic gestureor change in policy or is it something where you could see real inroads made, specifically as it relates to Kursk where it appears that is where the U.S., thus far, is limiting the use of these weapons? Russia has been gaining ground in the battle there. And since the last few weeks, we've now know that the North Korean forces have joined Russian forces in Kursk.

So, previously they have been allowed to shoot the shorter range ATACMS intoRussia and other parts of the front line that has a range of about 50 kilometers or so. This new range actually extends it out to around 190 miles. So, that gives them the ability to look further into Russia and target things previously out of range. And then the other benefit is, those HIMARS launchers, they can actually pull them further back from the frontline to help them survive. The Russians are actually quite successful at this time in terms of targeting these very high value assets, and immediately trying to strike them. So, there's two benefits here. The flip side is, you know, this weapons family has been in Ukraine now for a year, and the Russians have been able to tweak their air defense systems and their jamming systems and many of the Ukrainians that we had an opportunity to meet with recently have told us that that jamming is quite effective. So, this is not a game changer per se, but think of it as alleviating a lot of -- alleviating some pressure.",

Some of the challenges that they articulated to us was a manpower challenge. There are many units that are not built to their full capacity. There's some force employment issues, I think, it would be fair to say, at different parts of the front. The Kupiansk area is under strain. Areas in the Donbass by Pokrovsk are also under strain from Russian attacks right now. And there was a degree of uncertainty at that time about the future of western support. But what I found is that they are incredibly innovative, incredibly resourceful, and I know that they're going to use this new expanded capability to the best of their capabilities. They'll just be running up against Russian technical countermeasures to try to reduce the impact of these expanded ATACMS strikes. So, all in all experience, a great experience.",

And instead of rushing head on at a city or anobjective, they try to encircle it, try to flank it from both sides. And what they're doing against the Ukrainian line is death by a thousand cuts, multiple small attacks, sometimes interspersed with armor to really exhaust them and wear them down. And this strategy is effective on parts of the frontline. The Russians are able to find the weak seams. And right now, they're pushing south of Pokrovsk. The fear or concern that some of us have looking at that is if they are able to encircle that city, then it opens up the south part of Donetsk and potentially into Zaporizhzhia as well. It's not there, but it's not trending particularly well in that sector. So, this is something that the Ukrainian leadership is obviously tracking very closely.",

And, of course, they want the best deal possible for themselves. They know very much the stakes of this. If Russia is given an opportunity to reload and try again in three or four years. Russia is also working very hard right now to make sure that it sets the terms as best as it can for itself right now.

Ten years later, now, when we meet in Baku, we've still not made progress. So, of course, the urgency is right here. We have to reduce global emissions by 7.5 percent per year. Next year, we have to remove 3 billion tons of carbon dioxide from the global economy. This is exponential, it's transformative, and we're facing an unmanageable challenge. We cannot go on in negotiating promises and commitments that we're not held accountable to. So, what we are suggesting is to shift gear, to recognize it's time to celebrate. We have all the legal components we need to really deliver and solve the problem. It's not perfect, but we have what we need. To hold 1.5 degree Celsius as the limit. We have finance in place. We have adaptation platform. We have even the Article 6 on carbon trading. All of this is even supported by the Dubai statement of transitioning away from oil, coal, and gas, follow science and update national plans. Now, we need to shift gear and have more frequent meetings all-inclusive with all stakeholders on board, including indigenous communities and low- lying island states that are the most vulnerable nations in the world to be part of accountability or reporting on progress to deliver against what we have agreed upon.",

As I said, the protesters are wearing similar clothing, and that's actually apparently deliberate to try and intercept people before they get into the clinic. In fact, it's got to the point where the clinic volunteers actually have special copyrighted vests with a design specific to themselves so that no one can directly copy what they're wearing, just so that they can at least be identified by the people coming in. But it is intimidating. People are shouting, people, as I said, threw themselves on my car. I spoke to one OB/GYN who was an abortion provider inside the clinic and he was carrying a firearm and he was carrying a firearm with him as he was performing abortions. It was tucked into his scrubs. So, that was pretty eye-opening for me. I mean, I knew that there was -- you know, this was a contentious issue, but I didn't realize that the abortion providers themselves were seriously worried about their own lives.",

If she goes to a restaurant, she wants to make sure that nobody there recognizes her. It is quite stunning the links that they have to go to. And also notable is that the majority, almost 95 percent of the women who visit this clinic in Bristol are not from Virginia. Some drive as far as 10 hours just to get here for treatment. The consequences of some of these really draconian laws, full abortion ban after six weeks, as we know, most women don't even know they're pregnant at six weeks. But the impact that it has on women who are carrying unviable fetuses, situations where not only is their fetus at risk but they -- their lives themselves are too. And you've countered, you spoke with some of these women, Nicole Blackwell (ph) is one of them. Let's play some sound from what she told you. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NICOLE BLACKWELL (PH):  I was going to give birth to a child that wasn't going to live. I did ask the nurse to put a sheet in between me and her, so when I did give labor, I wouldn't see the dead baby coming out. How do you prepare yourself? There was no way of trying to prepare myself. And I was in labor for 32 hours. That's how complicated the situation was.",

Then she was told that the pregnancy was non- viable, the baby wouldn't make it, outside of the womb. And also, that the pregnancy was life-threatening and she wasn't allowed to have an abortion, and she didn't have the money to travel out of state and she was too ill. And she -- the only piece of control, the only agency she had was being able to put a sheet between her and the bits of the baby that she was forced to give birth to. She is so frightened now of getting pregnant again because she nearly died, that she's actually gone undergone a sterilization. And that is actually -- we're seeing a rise in people undergoing vasectomies and tubal ligations across the states. There was a University of Pittsburgh -- a report that came out recently that said that, because people are scared. No one should be too frightened to be pregnant, and no one should feel that they cannot be treated. And Nicole's not the only one. I spoke to other people as well. Those who desperately wanted children, I think that's what I really realized, was that most of the people I spoke to were mothers, or they were people who wanted to be mothers desperately. You know, abortion is -- DNC is an essential part of maternal health care, and that's what I think I really realized during the whole process of this film.",

These lawmakers, many of them said that that's hyperbole, you're over exaggerating, it's fear mongering that's not the case, but you actually spoke with a lawmaker in Tennessee where you spent a great deal of time who voted for this law, a doctor himself, we should note, only to regret it, after the fact.

And, you know, even ectopic pregnancies, which obviously, you know, incredibly life-threatening when included, that's changed since then. He said he regrets it so much that he's actually been working on legislation to include medical exceptions, to allow people to have abortions in life- threatening situations, which is happening, you know, almost every single day. And he said that even though there are people who agree with him, they're still not going to vote for his new legislations because the anti-abortion movement is so strong and people have -- you know, state senators are really worried about losing the ability to be voted in again.

We were working together on a film about Benjamin Franklin, and you'd given us a good interview for that film, and we were having dinner in Washington, D.C., and all evening long, you were pushing me to consider Leonardo da Vinci as another great artist and scientist. You thought that maybe the 18th century, certainly in America, the greatest a scientist was Benjamin Franklin, if not the world, and certainly, he was a great artist of the word and of political artistry. The compromises that created the United States are his. But I kept saying, Walter, I don't do non-American topics. But I came out of that dinner and was talking to Sarah Burns, my oldest daughter, and David McMahon, her husband, who we had collaborated for many years on films like \"The Central Park Five\" and \"Jackie Robinson\" and most recently \"Muhammad Ali.\" And they said, we love the idea of Leonardo. So, Sarah and Dave picked up family, my two oldest grandchildren moved to Italy for a year and did all the basic research, wrote the script, did most of the interviews and brought back all this raw material, which we then had the luxury, because it's PBS, to digest over many, many months, well more than a year and create this portrait.

How does that help them figure out the patterns of nature, Ken? K. BURNS:  Well, this is the key to the whole thing. I mean, what's so interesting with regard to Leonardo is that he's born out of wedlock. And so, he's not going to be able to take a kind of traditional trajectory that his father, a well-known notary in Florence would have permitted him to do, go to university. You know, he ends up at the end of his life knowing more than any scholar in any particular discipline. And as Sarah is saying, he doesn't see the borders between the disciplines. And so, what his first teacher is nature, and he's beginning, as the filmmaker, Guillermo del Toro, says in our film at the opening, that his great, you know, privilege, the responsibility was to, you know, interrogate the universe, ask it every essential question about what is its nature. And so, he's studying water dynamics. He's studying botany. He's studying atmosphere. He's studying rocks and geology and fossil distribution. He's inventing, he's looking at flight and gravity before Galileo. And he doesn't have a telescope and he doesn't have a microscope, but he understands a kind of fundamental thing that the solar system and the atom share a similar and one could say profound architecture. And so, I think there's something incredibly compelling that he's able to escape the specific gravity, no pun intended, of his upbringing to become a person who knows almost everything. So, the Mona Lisa is a great work of science and it's -- and his anatomies are great works of arts. And I can hear him talking in my ear saying, don't make the distinction. I have to -- in order to paint the Mona Lisa, I have to understand not only the bone structure and the musculature and how hair is and how things drape and what the background and the atmospheres in that background are doing, but I have to know the circulatory system. I have to know how the heart works. And all of that is so amazing that it is absolutely why this is the most famous painting on Earth. We may have encrusted it with pop symbolism, but it is -- that smile is -- in her smile, is the whole human experience there, and he's able to take and not only make a three-dimensional portrait of somebody that's different and better than anybody else had ever done, but he knows, as he said, the intentions of their mind. He wants to know what they're thinking, what they're feeling, what their suffering is, what their joy is. And his life is this joyous inquisitive interrogation of everything there is to know. And Franklin is in that realm, but he's trailing way behind who I -- the guy who I think is the man of the last millennium.",

BURNS:  I think what was so great about what Sarah and Dave were able to sort of suggest is that because, as Sarah says, of Leonardo's lateral thinking, this ability to encompass all this stuff, it suggested that we could split the screen, which is really risky for us, because my whole project is to say that a painting is alive, that it's three dimensional, that you can go into it and do a close up for a photograph as well, of course, and that the landscapes are themselves the painting. So, we've reversed it, and to do a split screen, not just two frames, maybe four, maybe six, maybe not, whatever it might be was -- and to include modern footage in it and photographs and all across the 20th century was to encompass his -- the capaciousness of his mind and his curiosity. And so, we risked returning those images to their plasticity, that is to say their two dimensionality, but at the same time we were honoring the sheer magnitude of his work.",

And we're also thinking about his imagination. He is both this incredible scientist and thinker and also has this extraordinary imagination and creativity. And so, there are all these things, inventions, things he draws, ideas he has that are, as you said, incredibly modern and that, in many ways, are sort of throwing us into the future, into the present so that no, he doesn't invent the helicopter, but he imagines the fact that we could someday fly, that we could create these machines that would allow us to fly. And so, all of that gives us this permission, this opportunity to use material from across the centuries to reflect that modernity and to reflect his imagination, these things that we will eventually achieve that he prophesized in some way. And so, we can see a rocket ship taking off, and we can see bicycles, and we can see cars, and we can think about the way that his ideas are, whether they're planting a seed for these things, or just imagining the possibility of them, it gives us license to really expand what we can think about and what we can show. And so, for us, that was really exciting because it was very different and it created this creative opportunity for us and for our editors to pull in all kinds of materials that we would never normally consider.

And I think we're actually very lucky sometimes, as with the Adoration that he didn't finish it because it is still spectacularly beautiful, even in its partially finished state. And it gives us this sense of what his process was, how he layered these works, and these, you know, under drawings and under paintings, and also how he saw the work, the painting itself, as an experiment, and that he was making changes on the panel as he went, rearranging where this thing was, moving something around, trying to figure out exactly the way he wanted to tell the story.
