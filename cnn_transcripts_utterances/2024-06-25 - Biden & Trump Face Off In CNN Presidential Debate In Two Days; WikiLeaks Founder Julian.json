I had a few people, although it was very difficult to find people to match your two wonderfulness, but I was able to do it.Anyway, all right, let's run some numbers here. What are the major factors that, you know, folks are saying for their vote for president? And look, we've been talking about it all year long. Numero uno is the economy, 82 percent. Right behind it is another form of the economy, I guess, inflation, 75 percent. Interestingly enough, state of democracy, number three at 71 percent. That's obviously been an issue that Joe Biden's been hitting upon. So these are the three top major factors. So the question is, who do voters trust more on these issues, Joe Biden or Donald Trump? Well, on inflation, this is where Donald Trump wants to be playing. Look at that, an 18-point lead over Joe Biden. The economy, another area where Donald Trump would be happy to play ball. Look at that, a 13-point lead in average of polls on the economy for the former president. The only one of those top major factor issues where Joe Biden leads is the state of democracy. Look at that, a seven point advantage, which is not half bad, but I think if you asked a lot of folks on the Democratic side, they would hope this margin would climb ever higher. And I guess Thursday's debate is a chance for them or at least a chance for Joe Biden to sort of push that message home.",

So yes, more times than not, the candidate trusted more on the economy wins. But if you asked Donald Trump last time around, did you win the 2020 election, despite what he says, the actual truth is, no, he did not win that election.

The other 19 times, the other 19 cycles on which we have polling, that question wasn't even asked. So this is a very unique time, a very unique issue and Joe Biden, of course, given the polling that we see here, trusted more on that particular issue, is definitely going to be a message that he's going to push on Thursday night.

It would actually make inflation even worse.Let me read you a key line from this letter. These economists write: \"We believe that a second Trump term would have a negative impact on the U.S.'s economic standing in the world and a destabilizing effect on the U.S.'s domestic economy.\" Now, in particular, they argue that Trump would, quote, \"reignite inflation.\" These economists point to, specifically, former President Trump's policies around taxes. Remember, Trump wants to extend the 2017 tax cuts. Economists say that would add trillions of dollars in debt. And it would give the economy a sugar rush that it probably doesn't need. Trump's also calling for lifting tariffs and an immigration crackdown, including unprecedented deportations at a time when businesses say they need more workers, not fewer. Economists say that all three of those points would actually make inflation even worse. Reach out to the Trump campaign. They responded by blasting the economists, saying the American people don't need, quote, \"worthless, out of touch Nobel Prize winners to tell them which president put more money in their pockets.\" Boris and Brianna?",

Of course, that was coming down after spiking to almost 15 percent during the worst of the COVID crisis. We had very low inflation at that point, sub 2 percent.Again, that was because the economy was still in this health crisis and consumer confidence was low. Again, that was related to COVID. Now, if we look at how things are right now under President Biden, we can see the unemployment rate is actually lower, right, 4 percent. I mean, this is historically low. This is a job's boom. But clearly, the biggest problem in this economy under Biden is the cost of living, right? Inflation, CPI is at 3.3 percent. That's how much prices were going up year-over-year. That's a massive improvement from two years ago when this was at 9 percent, but it is still too high. And that, of course, has weighed on consumer confidence, which is higher than it was under Trump, but still lower than you might expect when you're talking about historically low unemployment. And listen, we're going to hear the two candidates battle it out on these very issues on Thursday night.

What they see and what they're sort of offering their - some of their unsolicited advice to the Biden team is make this all about the contrast.Now, the Biden team obviously wants that contrast, too. It's why they clearly wanted to debate earlier than ever in a general election season, because they want Biden and Trump on the stage together to help wake up the American electorate, many of whom have tuned out of politics, to say this is the choice before you. Now, the Trump campaign, though, guys, thinks that contrast suits them as well and therein lies the difference. Both these guys think standing next to the other one serves their purpose.",

These candidates need to prepare for every eventuality of what their opponent brings to the stage. But I think it's very revealing that Donald Trump himself sees a difference between his two 2020 debate performances against this same opponent. We don't usually have that opportunity.

Because this race has been so remarkably stable, Brianna, and because we know there is a swath of the electorate that has been reluctant to tune in and engage on it, and both can't see bringing people who are not yet dialed into this race into the conversation as a critical component.So I'm - I am very curious to see how they use that opportunity on this massive stage to try and reach that narrow swath of undecided, persuadable voters in these key battleground states.

And this goes all the way back to 2010, right?We remember that when WikiLeaks started publishing this trove of documents, it ultimately ended up being about 500,000 secret military records. And they were given to him by then-Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning. Prosecutors say that Assange effectively goaded her into giving him those records. But, look, we've come to a point where this case has stretched out for so long that prosecutors and Assange have reached a point where they found an agreement that was mutually beneficial. Prosecutors were not going to accept a deal that didn't include a felony plea. Assange has been in prison for a long time and wanted his freedom, but did not want to stand trial in the continental U.S. So this deal effectively makes both of those things bright for both sides.",

And we have to remember that some of the material he published, including that video that showed an attack, a helicopter attack in Baghdad, did reveal new details about civilian deaths in war zones.

However, on the other side, we are already hearing that there will be protests planned by the ultra-Orthodox.So this Supreme Court decision was a unanimous decision, ordering the government to start bringing them into the mandatory military system. And also, if there are any religious schools that do not make their students basically accept these draft notices, then the funding will be taken away from those religious schools. So really trying to bring them into it as well, to try and make sure that these people actually comply. Now, of course, there will be those who are not happy, the Israeli prime minister, for example, Benjamin Netanyahu. He has two ultra- Orthodox parties within his ruling coalition, and they help him to stay in power. If they then decide to pull out of the coalition, then that poses a very big problem for the prime minister himself.
