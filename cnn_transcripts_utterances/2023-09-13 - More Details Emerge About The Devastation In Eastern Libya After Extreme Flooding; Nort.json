Thousands are presumed dead and thousands more missing. I'll speak to a doctor on the ground for you this hour. Then North Korea's Kim Jong-un and Vladimir Putin wrap up a day of talks in eastern Russia. We have the details for you on that meeting. Plus, Ukraine launches an extensive missile attack on a shipyard in Crimea, in what appears to be one of Kyiv's most ambitious strikes yet. But we stay on this hour with the floods in eastern Libya where the scale of death as well as destruction is truly mindboggling. Authorities in Tripoli say more than 6,000 people are dead, that's slightly higher than the 5,300 deaths reported by officials in the eastern government on Tuesday. Earlier reports said 10,000 were still missing, and the U.N. says more than 30,000 displaced. And the epicenter of the disaster is Derna where bodies remain in the streets and under rubble. The city now covered, you can see there in that thick brown mud is built over dry river valley called the Wadi in Arabic. And you can see the Wadi as it reaches the sea in these images. The Wadi became a roaring river when a storm caused dams upstream to collapse. Whole neighborhoods that we've been showing you was simply wiped out. Our Ben Wedeman has been to Derna before the disaster. He joins me now live from Rome with the very latest. And Ben, it seems that with each passing day, the situation is getting worse and even more desperate.",

Rescue workers and volunteers helped retrieve the body of a boy wrapped in a blanket and prepare to put him in a body bag. When his father arrives, overcome with emotion. Doctors fear so many dead left in the open could lead to an outbreak of disease. \"We aren't able to identify all the bodies and bury them\", says this woman identified as Dr. Aisha(ph). We want to provide a humane place, freezers where loved ones can then identify them. Access to Derna remains difficult. The flood destroyed many of the roads and bridges leading to the city.

Remember, an impeachment inquiry is simply an investigation looking into allegations of wrongdoing and that could potentially lead to trying to charge the United States president with high crimes or misdemeanors. That has only happened three other times in American history, a very high bar to clear. So he's trying to tell his colleagues, look, let us investigate. We'll see what we find and then that will potentially lead to impeachment. But a lot of the Republicans say it's almost a foregone conclusion, that they will ultimately lead to articles of impeachment and a floor vote. Even though there's a long way to go between now and then, plenty of skepticism within the ranks, including among the Republican ranks about all of the evidence that has been found and whether it actually ties to Joe Biden. And if Joe Biden took any official action as vice-president to help his son, Hunter Biden, that has not been established yet this investigation. It also has not been established yet that Joe Biden personally enriched himself based on Hunter Biden's business dealings. Those are some of the key allegations that they have pushed forward to lead part of this probe in the months ahead. You played that sound bite of me and Kevin McCarthy speaking about holding a vote. Typically what happens during an impeachment inquiry, there would be a vote to actually launch an impeachment inquiry. That actually did happen when Nancy Pelosi was the Speaker of the House in the first Trump impeachment. About a month after the inquiry began, it passed along party lines but it did not happen with the second Trump impeachment. He was impeached a week after the January 6th attacks here in the U.S. Capitol. McCarthy explained why he changed his position. Just 12 days ago he said he would have a vote to now not having a vote, simply instructing his committees to probe Joe Biden going forward.
