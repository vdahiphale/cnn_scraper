      "sentences": "The Supreme Court is now weighing one of the most important transgender rights questions to ever come before it. And that is, can states ban gender-affirming care for children and teens? The justices heard oral arguments today in a blockbuster case that focuses on a Tennessee law prohibiting doctors from providing puberty blockers and hormone treatments for minors.And more than half of the U.S. has similar policies in place. So the implications of this could be far-reaching. CNN chief legal affairs correspondent Paula Reid is with us now. Paula, walk us through the stakes here and where you saw the justices seem to be today during those arguments.",

      "sentences": "Well, minors transitioning has become a political hot-button issue, right? And today we saw the justices poised unlikely, right, unlikely they appear to overturn this ban in Tennessee that prohibits minors from receiving certain medical treatments if they want to transition. Now, teens who have been affected by this, the ACLU and the Biden administration all argue that this ban amounts to unconstitutional sex discrimination.Because if you were born a boy and you want access to testosterone treatment, you can get it. But you can't get it if you're born a boy and you want to transition to a girl. Now, the state of Tennessee says it's not sex-based discrimination because it doesn't matter if you're a boy or a girl. You can't get this medical treatment to transition. So today the justices had a lot of questions for both sides, but we were watching really closely some of the potential swing votes that the ACLU and the Biden administration would need to overturn this ban. For example, Chief Justice John Roberts. Let's take a listen to what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And, of course, we are not the best situated to address issues like that, unlike in, you know, like Morales and Craig Reborn and some of the other ones where it doesn't strike me that they're intensely affected by medical considerations. And if that's true, doesn't that make a stronger case for us to leave those determinations to the legislative bodies rather than try to determine them for ourselves?(END VIDEO CLIP)",

Justice Alito also pointed to the fact that some European countries have restricted this kind of treatment for minors. The solicitor general, that's the top lawyer for the Biden administration, pointed out they didn't outright ban it.So things are not looking great for the Biden administration here. It's unclear how long it will take the justices to issue their opinion. But as you know, before that opinion comes, we are likely to get a new administration, a Republican administration that does not support this kind of treatment for minors. I spoke to the teenager, one of them at the center of this case, and she told me that, look, even if they don't have federal support for their position, that the ACLU will continue to advocate for these rights.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Brianna, so this really spans the gamut, you know, for young children who are entering into these kinds of questions. Really, this starts with mental health care, working with their families and a team of physicians and really what's known as social affirmation. So just thinking about things like adopting gender-affirming hairstyles, clothing, names or pronouns that affirm the gender that they feel that they are.Once kids get into puberty and they've had a sustained period of feeling this way and they go through, you know, extensive counseling with a whole team of providers, they can get into puberty blockers. Those are drugs that can essentially pause the pubertal development so that kids and their families and their caregivers have more time essentially to consider what's going on. As they get older and if they're still showing sustained feelings in these ways along with that extensive counseling, then you get to hormone therapy. So testosterone, estrogen, things like that. These are hormones that can affirm somebody's gender. So those are really the things that people talk about when they're talking about gender-affirming care for minors. Then you have gender-affirming surgeries. But according to the American Academy of Pediatrics, those are really talked about for adults who are in this space and only really on a rare case-by-case basis for anybody, you know, under the age of 18. And so when you're trying to look at the number of people who might be affected by the outcome here, estimates put the number of people who identify as transgender in the U.S. at about 1.6 million, including about 300,000 kids between the ages of 13 and 17. So you're talking about hundreds of thousands of kids here, Brianna, who could be affected by the outcome of the court's decision.",

It goes on to say -- President Trump respectfully submits that upon reaching this decision, this court, Court of Appeals, should dismiss his appeal for lack of jurisdiction with directions to the trial court to immediately dismiss the indictment against the president. This investigation, of course, began with that infamous phone call from President Trump to our Secretary of State here, Brad Raffensperger, in which he asked him to find more votes. There was also the fake elector scheme where they tried to subvert the Electoral College and say that Trump won this state in 2020 when he lost. And, of course, the illegal accessing of voting data in rural Coffee County.

What we are told, according to a law enforcement official speaking to CNN, is after the landing later this afternoon here at JFK, she will meet with federal authorities. She will be interviewed, and that's when authorities will further assess the situation to see if this actually merits charges. But again, to be very clear, she's currently not in custody during her eight-day stay in France. She was simply held in a specially designed part of Charles de Gaulle Airport for people who do not meet entry requirements and are scheduled for deportation, which is essentially what we saw was currently playing out as she's flying directly here to New York.",

Not really all that new. But this is likely the first time that airlines have been put in the hot seat for it on Capitol Hill. Also the first time we've gotten a clearer picture of what airlines charge and how much they're making through those fees. The Senate report that inspired this hearing said from 2018 to 2023, airlines made $12 billion -- there's your answer -- on seat selection alone. Listen now to Senate Democrat Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut who called for this hearing. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D-CT): Airlines call the practice of separating -- separately charging for every little thing, unbundling. Frustrated passengers have a different word for it. They call it junk. Sometimes they use another four-letter word. And understandably, they feel that sense of frustration and anger. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
