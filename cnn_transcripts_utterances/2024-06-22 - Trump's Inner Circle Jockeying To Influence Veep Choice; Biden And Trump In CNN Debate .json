But before the candidates hit the stage, CNN has new reporting on who tops the list to be Donald Trump's vice presidential pick and who are the prominent figures supporting each of them.Ohio senator J.D. Vance is said to be a favorite of Donald Trump Jr. We've learned that media mogul Rupert Murdoch is urging Trump to consider North Dakota governor Doug Burgum. While FOX News host Sean Hannity has gone to bat for Florida senator Marco Rubio. Now Trump has said he will announce his choice at the Republican National Convention next month. But here's what some top contenders have been saying about the presidential candidate. Have a look at this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. J.D. VANCE (R-OH): The world is on fire and I sort of see Donald Trump as a bit of a fireman. GOV. DOUG BURGUM (R-ND): I wish every American could see President Trump the way we've seen in the last six months. He's genuinely exceedingly funny but, as you know, Jesse, the best comics are really smart people, highly intelligent and highly perceptive and they know their audiences. And I think President Trump's been amazing. SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL): When Donald Trump was president of the United States, this country was safer, it was more prosperous. The country and the world is a better place when he was president. And I would love to see him return to the White House. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But now they're trying to change that. They believe that Biden really has a low bar and so they're trying to raise the expectations. Take a listen to what Trump told the all-in podcast yesterday.

Biden's campaign says the president's haul last month totaled $85 million.But that figure pales in comparison to the staggering $141 million that Trump's team say he collected last month. His team says a surge in donations followed Trump's criminal conviction in New York. Now tune in to see the CNN presidential debate right here, of course, on CNN, coming up June 27th at 9:00 pm Eastern time. And we will replay the debate in its entirety at a few different times. You can watch it at 7:00 am London time on Friday, June 28. That's 2:00 in the afternoon in Hong Kong or 12 hours later at 7:00 pm in London, 10 in the evening in Abu Dhabi. The judge in Trump's classified documents case is showing a bit of skepticism when it comes to Trump's efforts to get the special counsel, Jack Smith, removed. Aileen Cannon heard arguments in a hearing on Friday. She pushed Trump's team to defend their claim that Smith's position amounted to a shadow government. Trump's attorneys argued that Smith was illegally appointed and doesn't report to anyone. The judge also questioned prosecutors about the attorney general's role in the case but they insist they are following all the rules. The judge didn't say when she will issue a ruling. The trial has been indefinitely postponed after several delays. Trump was initially indicted in June last year and he faces 40 charges in the case. Now there are two more hearings scheduled on Monday and Tuesday ahead of the CNN presidential debate. More than 100 million people across the U.S. are under excessive heat watches, warnings and advisories this weekend. New York City could see 90 degree temperatures for the next seven days, which would be the longest ever in June for the city. That prompted the mayor to open cooling centers across the city. New York's governor has opened an emergency operations center to monitor extreme heat conditions across the state's 62 counties. Now the worst heat this weekend will be in the mid-Atlantic states. Temperatures in Washington, D.C., could reach 100 degrees Fahrenheit for the first time since 2016. Needless to say, the unrelenting heat dome is making temperatures miserable for millions.

We heard earlier in the week from a U.S. official telling CNN that they believe Hezbollah's armaments and its arsenal of weapons could suddenly overwhelm Israel's air defense system, namely its Iron Dome air defenses, since that is a huge point of concern. We're talking about an organization that is very different, of course, to Hamas in Gaza. While we have heard from the Israeli military in the past saying it could, quote, \"copy and paste\" what we're seeing in Gaza, in Lebanon, this is a very different organization. It is politically and militarily more sophisticated. It has the backing, of course, of the Iranian regime. And it has a military arsenal that is far stronger and more powerful than Hamas. We are talking about drones and short-range rockets which we have seen used extensively over the last eight months, of course, in response to continued airstrikes. And we're also seeing in southern Lebanon by the Israeli military but they also have longer-range missiles which could target deeper into Israeli territory. Now we've continued to hear from Hezbollah officials over the last eight months. Characterizing their actions as being directly in response to what we're seeing in Gaza, saying that they do not want to see an outright war with Israel. But that their actions at the continued hostilities that we're seeing between Hezbollah and the Israeli military will not come to an end until we see a ceasefire in Gaza, until we see the end of Israeli airstrikes in the Gaza Strip. But of course, there has been mounting concern over the situation on the border between Lebanon and Israel, from members of the international community, not least the United States. Of course, there have been intensive discussions between U.S. and Israeli officials, as well as other regional allies over the last week. And we've been hearing warnings as well from the United Nations. Take a listen.

So this is a huge point of concern. And while the confrontations that we've been seeing, while the exchange of fire has been directly between Hezbollah militants in the south and the Israeli military, we've also been hearing in the past from the Lebanese government, who has said that while they do not want to see an outright war with Israel. The Lebanese military cannot be expected to stand idly by if Israel threatens to push Lebanon into an all-out war. And, of course, we've been hearing those warnings from U.S. officials around the likelihood of a ground incursion by the Israeli ministry.

That's all that stops people actually getting into the monument. If you had to protect it more, you'd have to bag check every single member of the public. You'd have to have much more security, high fences. It would really affect the experience of actually visiting the site and, thankfully, at least so far, these are rare events. And I do feel for the staff who had to try and stop the protesters. And that's their job. I know what that's like to try and protect somewhere.

And it's the most pressing issue. So I fully agree with their stance on trying to get this further up the agenda. However, it has perhaps turned some people off. Some people see Stonehenge as a monument that has outlasted generations. It's really a symbol of connection between people and nature and the past. And to attack it is very shocking for people. So I can see that sometimes the tactics might alienate the very people that they're trying to reach. But in other ways, I do think these are conversations that need to happen.",

It gets well over 1 million visitors a year. And those people are flying around the world and adding to the climate crisis. So really it's a question of thinking about how do we change things? How do we -- it feels bad but do we really need to visit Stonehenge? Do we have to travel around the world in our jets and our airplanes? These are the questions we're going to ask ourselves if we want to try and keep Stonehenge protected and future generations being able to appreciate it.",

Not yet, anyway, according to French officials, recent heavy rainfall caused pollution runoff that's resulted in poor water quality. But they say new infrastructure is now in place that will clean the water for events like the swimming leg of the triathlon. And the forecast is calling for clearer skies, which would also help to keep lower pollution levels. It's a feat that defies the odds. The Edmonton Oilers clobbered the Florida Panthers on Friday, 5-1, forcing a winner-takes-all game seven in hockey's Stanley Cup championship. The team score early and often and they sealed their third straight win with two empty-net goals in third period. Now they are only the third team in Stanley Cup finals history to force a decisive showdown after being down 3-0 games. The Stanley Cup will be decided in Florida on Monday. The West Indies beat the USA in their Super 8 match-up on Friday at the T20 World Cup in Barbados. The Americans suffered a heavy nine- wicket defeat. The loss was a jolt and a wakeup for the U.S. who was off to a strong Cinderella start of the tournament. Shai Hope was responsible for most of the West Indies scoring. He gave his team a total of 130 for the loss of just one wicket. The Americans aren't out of the tournament. They go up against England on Sunday. The U.S. is co-hosting this tournament with the West Indies. And despite the loss, the Americans have breathed life into a sport that most Americans don't know, as Nick Watt reports.
