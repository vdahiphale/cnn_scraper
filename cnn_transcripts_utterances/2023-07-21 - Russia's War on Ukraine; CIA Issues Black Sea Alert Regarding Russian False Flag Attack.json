This set of strikes slightly different than the ones that we have seen, the three previous nights, these starting around dawn and going throughout the morning. Slightly less intense, as well, in terms of the number of missiles that was used, but still incredibly destructive.What we know from Ukrainian officials, at least seven different types of cruise missiles hitting targets, civilian targets, civilian infrastructure, food infrastructure. This is exactly what President Zelenskyy and other officials have been talking about, calling it weaponizing hunger. We know that those Russian strikes hit grain warehouses, destroying hundred100 tons of peas, 20 tons of barley, and injuring at least two people. Now, Ukraine says that this is Russia's response after pulling out of that grain deal earlier this week. That grain deal that was so important for Ukraine, for the world's food supply. Russia, however, has said that they are responding to that attack on the Kerch Bridge by Ukraine on Monday, that brazen attack by Ukraine using sea drones. But it is clear, at this point, that Russia, after the termination or at least the suspension of this grain deal, is very much going after Ukraine's food infrastructure with this fourth straight day of attacks.

They have three -- well, they have the four cases, he is a suspect and charged in three. But in three of those four cases, their cellphones seemed to track from where they started out right to the Massapequa Park area of his home and then they go dark.The other thing is, in all four of those cases, those were times when his wife and children were out of town, away from the house. Why do something in your own house where you are going to be creating evidence? Because it's the one place you've got plenty of time to clean up that evidence. It's the place where what they call, the murder kit, the things you're going to need to tie somebody up or do the rest of the things that are alleged in this case are readily available to you. It's where a victim screaming, unlike a hotel room at 1:30 in the morning where people are going to hear that can be muffled. And it's a place where, more important than all of that, you as the killer feel you are in control of the environment and the victim is not. So, do they have a piece of physical evidence that ties any of these victims to his home yet? The answer is no. But they have removed a lot of things that they're going to be testing to see if they can tie either the victims' presence there or evidence of the victim at that location.",

Yesterday she was inducted as an honorary member of the Delta Sigma Theta Sorority Incorporated during its national convention in Indianapolis.And in an exclusive statement to CNN, Justice Jackson said, \"Because Delta Sigma Theta only extends honorary memberships to women who have made significant contributions to society while excelling in their chosen fields. It is a tremendous honor to have been so recognized. I'm thrilled and humbled to be among this year's extraordinary group of inductees.\" Now, it may be unusual to see a sitting justice inducted into a sorority. But this sorority is one of a group of nine historically black sororities and fraternities that have long histories as centers of activism, social scholarship and service in the African American Community. On Thursday also Vice President Kamala Harris, she spoke at the Delta Sigma Theta convention yesterday. Although, she is actually a member of a different Divine Nine Sorority, Alpha Kappa Alpha. And I should also say Phil, I'm also a Delta. And so, she is now technically my sorority sister.",
