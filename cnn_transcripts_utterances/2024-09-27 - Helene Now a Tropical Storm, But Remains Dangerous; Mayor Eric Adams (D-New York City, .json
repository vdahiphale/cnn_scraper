A manager for the airline told an Adam staffer, quote, I'm going to charge $50. Adam staffer replied, no. The manager, that would work, wouldn't it? No, dear. The staffer replied, $50, what, quote, a proper price. The manager asked, how much should I charge, and added a smiling emoji. The Adam staffer said, quote, his every step is being watched right now, $1,000 or so. Let it be somewhat real. We don't want them to say he is flying for free. At the moment, the media's attention is on Eric. Well, it turns out federal prosecutors were also paying attention. Adams ended up paying $1,100 each for two tickets.

ALLISON CHINCHAR, CNN METEOROLOGIST:  And good morning. Yes, that is now a tropical storm, but I want to emphasize for some of these communities, this may have made landfall, but the worst is yet to come in terms of rain and especially the wind for some of these areas. Now, the center of the storm is east of Macon right now. It's according to the last update, about 40 miles or so east of there. So, you're really starting to see a lot of those wind gusts begin to pick up across portions of Northern Georgia, as well as areas of the Carolinas. Now, one of the other concerns is going to be the flooding. All of these green areas you see here, flood watch, the potential is there for flooding. The red areas indicate where flooding is ongoing at this point in time. This white box, we actually now have two white boxes there in Western North Carolina, flash flood emergencies for these areas. The one of them is just to the west that you can see of Asheville. We have one just south of Asheville, and now we have one east of Asheville, basically surrounding it on three sides. The concern here is that at least six to ten inches of rain has already fallen in the last few hours. There have been reports by emergency managers that there have been water covering the roads, water rescues taking place, and also some landslides in the area. And the unfortunate part is even more rain is expected for these areas, and not just a little bit, but several more inches of rain. We've also had several tornado warnings. Right now, we have several active in South Carolina, but we've had some in Georgia and North Carolina as well, as the bulk of that rain continues to spread northward. With that said, more tornadoes are possible throughout the day today. You still have the tornado watch in effect for portions of Georgia and the Carolinas. That is valid for at least about another hour or so. But it's very likely that some of this will get extended because the threat not only stays for those states but also even expands farther north into portions of Virginia. So, Norfolk all the way down to Charleston, looking at the potential for tornadoes and damaging winds as we go through the day today, the damaging winds, not to mention just the winds themselves from some of the other areas and maybe trees coming down. We already have two and a half million people without power, Kasie. We could see that number continue to tick up as we go through the day today.",

President Joe Biden had publicly called that move a red line. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Israel, you're going to have to make your own decisions, but go into this clear eyed, understand the consequences for our relationship. Netanyahu seemed braced for a possible rupture. If this is it, this is it. If this is where we end, this is where we end. You have to do what you have to do, and we have to do what we have to do.

He considers himself a good friend. And there's been this tension almost from the very first days of the war. Joe Biden did not want Israel to invade Gaza on the ground and he told Netanyahu that very specifically. He knew Israel wouldn't listen to him, so there was always this tension where he was trying to direct Israel, but never really asking for things directly or leverage or issuing his opinions as demand. They were always kind of Socratically opposed to Israel. And he continues to bleed on behalf of Israel despite the fact that he's never really in line with the policy of the government.The second thing we're seeing this play out today is that his great abiding fear in both Ukraine and in Israel is the fear of regional escalation that would ensnare the United States. He's somebody who grew up in the atomic age. He remembers kids hiding under their school desks, and so he's constantly confronting these moments where there's tension between Hezbollah and Israel. There was one moment where a flock of birds was mistaken for paragliders by the Israelis four days after October 7th, and it nearly resulted in Israel preemptively attacking Hezbollah at a moment that would have been pretty bad for them to have done it because they were in so much disarray internally. And so we have moments like that constantly where we're going up to the brink. President Biden is trying to bring the world back from the brink, but there's only so long he's able to do it because the region is, in fact, a tinderbox.",

It was all of the Israeli officials they would meet with in the immediate days after October 7th, because they had just presided over the greatest security failure in the history of their state. And so their nerves were jangled. There was a sense of shame. Remember Netanyahu took a couple weeks to really begin meeting with hostage families. He wasn't showing up in public in a very forceful sort of way. In a sense, when President Biden visited Israel after October 7th, he stepped in and he filled this very calming role that you would expect a prime minister to play.And so this goes on and on, though, because October 7th becomes the frame through which Israel processes everything else.

And then they make all of these discoveries about the tunnels underneath Gaza, and for very understandable military reasons, the war continues on. But the great hope looming over it all constantly was that there was this possibility for a deal where you get the hostages back in return for a ceasefire. And one of the things that was just most aching to me to learn in the course of my reporting was that in the end of August, there was this hope that Netanyahu had come around to a position where he was ready to deal Hamas looked like they were ready to deal, and then the six hostages were killed. And that deal that was so close started to evaporate because Hamas had murdered its six best bargaining chips and then started making a whole series of demands.
