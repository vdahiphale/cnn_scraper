A few more hours fromnow, the fighting there is expected to pause for the first time in six weeks. In a moment, coming up, Qatar calls it and confirms Hamas is preparing to release 13 hostages in that deal with Israel. The director of Gaza's largest hospital is detained by Israeli forces. What does he know about command-and-control centers? And the Netherlands takes a sharp turn to the right. Geert Wilders comes out on top in the election. Live from New York, Thanksgiving, but Thursday, November the 23rd. I'm Richard Quest, and I mean business. Good evening. The four-day truce between Israel and Hamas is now expected to begin nine hours from now. Qatar's foreign ministry spokesman made the announcement earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAJED AL-ANSARI, QATARI FOREIGN AFFAIRS MINISTRY SPOKESMAN: The beginning of the pause will be 7:00 AM, Friday, the 24th of November. And it will last, of course, as agreed, for four days. And The first batch of civilians to be released from Gaza will be around 4:00 PM of the same day. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

You just delineated what happens on the first day -- 13 women and children whose names are on a list that have been shared with the Israelis will be released. Thirty-nine prisoners -- Palestinian prisoners and Israeli prisoners will also be released. That's one of the obligations. The second obligation is that all hostilities must cease. There can be no fighting on the ground, nor any surveillance drones flown in the air, at least for the period during which these hostages are likely to be released. Let's remember, that's supposed to be around 4 o'clock of the first day. That time is very likely to slip because, you know, for -- this is a conflict zone, right? I mean, and nothing is easy. But I think it's really important to underscore these obligations. Each side -- and there is no trust on either side -- each side understands its own obligations. And I put it to Majed Al-Ansari, the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs here, what a breach of, for example, the hostilities, would look like. This is what he told me. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) AL-ANSARI: I'm -- I don't think I can get into the technicalities, you know, tactically on the ground because this is to be handled by the, you know, people who are there on the ground. But what I can tell you is that the agreement is about full cessation of hostilities within the four days. So obviously, any resumption of hostilities of any kind would be a breach. And I think it is very important that lines of communication remain open so that any possible breach, however it is defined, is communicated immediately to both sides. And there is a way to work back from it and make sure that we continue with the -- with them. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And the cost of hosting a Thanksgiving dinner is coming down for the first time in years. There's all sorts of reasons why, but your turkey's cheaper. But this is -- only after the headlines, because this is CNN, and on this network, the news always comes first. In India, rescuers are getting closer to reaching trapped workers. A tunnel partially collapsed more than a week ago. There are 41 people inside. Workers have dug more than halfway through the rubble and officials estimate they could reach those trapped very soon. At least five people, including three children, have been injured in a knife attack in Dublin, in Ireland. Police say it appears to be a standalone incident. They don't believe it was terror related, but they haven't yet ruled out all motives. A man in his 50s has been detained at the scene. New York City's mayor has been formally accused of sexual assault. The accuser has filed court documents on Wednesday, alleging Eric Adams assaulted her in 1993, when they both worked for the city. The mayor has denied the allegations. Returning to our top story, the Israeli military has said the hostage handover process will be complicated and warns there could be changes in the deal at any moment. A truce between Israel and Hamas is expected to begin at 7:00 a.m. Israel time, that's midnight Eastern in the United States. To give you an idea, it's about eight and a half hours from now. Qatar says 13 women and children will be released by Hamas later the same day. The pause is due to last for four days, with at least 10 Hamas hostages being held -- actually, that should be 10 Israeli hostages being held by Hamas, released on each day. Oren Liebermann joins me from Tel Aviv to explain how all this will work. We heard from Becky about hotlines and communications, but, you know, you've got the two parties, you've got Hamas getting the hostages together, you've got Israel getting ready to release from prison. You've got the Red Cross involved. I'm not being flippant when I say this, Oren. What could possibly go wrong?",

It starts, of course, with the pause in the fighting, that's about eight and a half hours from now. Then the trucks can start moving in, bringing in that desperately needed aid. Then nine hours after the pause in the fighting, we'll see -- or we should see at least, the release of the first 13 women and hostages from Hamas, to the Red Cross, to the IDF, to the hospitals for evaluation and checkup, and to their families. And then, once that's confirmed, that the hostages are in Israel again, then Israel will release 39 prisoners from -- Palestinian prisoners, women and children, at that same three to one ratio of the overall deal. The 50 Israeli women and children for 150 Palestinian prisoners. If all this goes well over the course of the next four days, then we could see an extension.
