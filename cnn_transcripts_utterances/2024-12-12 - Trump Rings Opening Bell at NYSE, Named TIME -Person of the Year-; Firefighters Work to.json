He wrote this cover piece. He sat down with the President-elect for this lengthy interview. And going through it during the show, quickly in commercial breaks, I have to say, Eric, very interesting and some important parts to get to. But first and foremost, I think I saw there was like a 65-minute sit- down. Your -- what was your overall impression from your interview with the President-elect?",

He has felt that sense of vindication.And there was almost a kind of wistfulness on the part of Trump that his last campaign was over. He actually said it's sad in a way this will never happen again. So he was much more calmed down than I think I and others expected of him.",

On vaccines, you all asked him about RFK Jr., who he's picked to head up the Department of Health and Human Services. RFK joining him this morning at the Stock Exchange just to show how important he is to him.RFK is a known cynic of vaccines, and the question that you all posed to him was this. If he, RFK, moves to end childhood vaccination programs, would you sign off on that? And Donald Trump's response is, \"We're going to have a big discussion. The autism rate is at a level that nobody ever believed possible. If you look at -- if you look at things that are happening, there's something causing it.\" You all did not even ask about autism, as it was linked, as I see in this -- in this transcript, in the false link to vaccines, and that's exactly where he directly went?",

I followed up and said, you know, President Trump, do you think there's a connection? He says, I want to see the numbers. He's going to look into it. But I think that was one of the major takeaways from this interview is that Donald Trump is preparing to listen to Robert Kennedy Jr., who he has nominated to head the Department of Health and Human Services, to potentially remove childhood vaccination programs, routine vaccinations that have been in place for generations. And, of course, this would be very controversial.It's also noteworthy that, you know, one of Donald Trump's historic achievements from his first term was Operation Warp Speed, and there is a bit of a discrepancy between what he thinks on that issue and what Robert Kennedy Jr. thinks on that issue, which is that they should not have released those vaccines until further testing. So it'll be interesting to see how this plays out once he takes office.",

      "sentences": "Well, that was certainly the impression he made at that portion of the hour. Which is that he doesn't want to see actions like that taken, which he thinks risks escalation. But the most striking part of that segment of the interview to me was when, you know, I sort of pressed Trump on how he was going to approach this issue, whether he was going to continue military, humanitarian, and intelligence assistance to Ukraine.And I specifically said, Mr. President, would you abandon Ukraine? And his answer really struck me. He says, well, part of getting to a deal means you don't abandon. So I think that President Trump signaled in that moment that in his efforts to sort of reach an agreement between Russia and Ukraine to end the war, which is really what he wants, I think he wants the ability to tout that as an accomplishment, that means he would not pull the plug on Ukraine, as many of his supporters, many members of his base would like him to. Obviously, his choice for vice president is a vociferous critic of continued U.S. aid to Ukraine. We'll have to see how things play out. Trump is an unpredictable person. But in that instance, he signaled he's not getting ready to just remove U.S. assistance to Ukraine because he thinks that's leverage he can use against Russia to strike an accord.",

The fire spread at a devastating pace, devouring more than 4,000 acres. We are joined now by the Mayor of Malibu, Doug Stewart.Thank you so much, sir. I know you have lots to do in your community and lots of people relying on you. You know, at first, Mayor, this fire at one point was burning so fast and so furiously, it was consuming an area larger than five football fields every single minute.

It -- you're correct, the wind was howling. We probably had somewhere between 30 to 50 knot winds going through the canyons. And where that fire started is like a chimney. And it was as though a fan was blowing that fire straight down the canyon, straight to the heart of the city.As far as doing that many football fields in a minute, you're absolutely correct. That fire, when I got the first notice, I was actually on the phone with the assistant city manager. We were talking about how to deal with power shutoffs that the Edison Company had done. And within a matter of moments, it went from 10 acres to 30 to 100. And it was ripping. So it was a fire to fight. And thankfully our first responders were ready for the attack and they did all they could. When you ask about what the conditions are, we had major fire burn, but we didn't have major fire damage. We lost a few homes, but when I was looking at the aerial shots from the TV news stations as the fire was burning, I thought we were going to lose major, major areas of very critical infrastructure and homes right in the heart of our city. So we were lucky and very thankful that we're where we are today.",

And I know from that Woolsey Fire that we've spoken to people who are having issues trying to get insurance after that because the insurance companies are either pulling out or they're making their costs much higher.What is your concern that you're hearing from residents when it comes to that as climate change and the fires just continue to burn in a really big way there?",

But I think we've also got an insurance system here, at least in Southern California and California that is not up to match the kind of risk as being assigned to them or their undertaking.In Malibu, myself included, we all have had trouble getting insurance or there's no insurance available. Or if you get insurance, it's so priced up, you can't afford it. And I have to tell you, my biggest concern in this fire and this fire season is that people that are underinsured and, you know, Malibu is viewed as being a millionaire city, but there's a lot of people that I assure you that don't have a million dollars that live here. We're just a typical suburban area, although in a beautiful area, but we don't have insurance necessarily. And some of these people are going to sit there and see that fire coming and say, send the wife and children away. I'm going to stay and fight the fire and at great risk. And we can't let that happen. Insurance is hard to come by. It's very expensive. I think this is a state issue that's going to have to be addressed in a better manner.
