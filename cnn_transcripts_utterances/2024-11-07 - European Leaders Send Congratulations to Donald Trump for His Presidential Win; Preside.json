They've called President-elect Donald Trump already. They've issued sort of congratulatory messages over X and other places. So they're making the right noises.But the noise that they're going to have to make is that Europe is going to have to stand more alone, be ready to support Ukraine more alone. They recognize that President-elect Donald Trump has said that he'll end the war in Ukraine in the matter of a day, and that concerns them, because they think the United States is going to withdraw some of its support. They don't think that's good for them. So that's the pressing issue. That's getting a lot of attention today. And I think you get a sense of that from what the French president said today at that big meeting in Budapest. He said that we've got to look to ourselves. We cannot rely on the United States to be our security crutch going forward. So Ukraine, that's the first one, I think, that really worries, particularly U.S. allies.",

I'm sorry, Congressman. Let's get back to business. I want to read for you what fellow New York Democrat Ritchie Torres said, told \"The New York Times\" some of his take coming out of the election, which is this, \"the losses among Latinos is nothing short of catastrophic for the party.\" And looking at the results from your district, looking at Queens in New York, you can see that Donald Trump is making inroads. His support growing in your district every year he has run. What did the Harris campaign miss? What is the Democratic Party missing, congressman? REP. GREGORY MEEKS, (D-NY):  Look, I think this is what's happened. When you talk about it, Bill Clinton talked about, it's the economy, stupid. What we've talked about here is, as a result of the pandemic, it took place all over the world. We had high inflation. We had a situation where things became more expensive. This was something that took place as a result of the pandemic after Barack Obama gave Donald Trump a good economy. And so now things are coming down. But people still feel that the cost of rent and the cost of housing and to get goods are too expensive. And I think that the vice president did talk about that. And we did start to move and we're at a point now, most economists will say, and they said, whoever became the next president will be inheriting a good economy. That economy was created. So I think that the focus was that the people were looking at the short term situation of their immediate lives and not looking at the long-term ramifications of what a second Trump administration would do, particularly for them, because we know if Trump is like the first administration, his first administration, it's all about Donald Trump and not about anyone else, and our national security becomes at stake.",

We won with Josh Riley in New York 19. We won with Laura Gillen in New York 4. We won with Tom Suozzi. We kept the seat with Pat Ryan. So it's not that there was anything gained there because we showed that we can win. And there was a difference from 2022 and 2024 in New York. And it's still not certain where we are going to be in the House, but we have to make sure.And I think that the economy is improving, and he will inherit again, as Republicans generally do after a Democratic administration, they inherit a better and strong economy than what the Democrats received when they came in.

People need to know from the beginning to the end exactly what we're doing and why we're doing it and what we stand for.

I mean, when you look at -- I don't want to be a Russia. I just don't want to be. I don't think most Americans do.

The only big question is will he write a Special Counsel Report, like we saw with the Mueller Report, the Robert Hur Report, the Durham Report. The regulations that he's under, the special counsel regulation, say at the end of your investigation, you're supposed to do a final report. Ordinarily, that's after you try all of your cases. Here, that's the only thing left to do. I suspect he will write a report. I think we will see it sometime between now and January 20th. One thing that I think is important that people need to understand, yes, Donald Trump said he will fire Jack Smith, \"in two seconds.\" No doubt he will, but Jack Smith would be doing this anyway. He would be winding down anyway because long-standing DOJ policy goes back to Watergate says, you cannot indict, prosecute, try, imprison the sitting president.

He reiterated his promise minutes into his victory speech early Wednesday morning. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R) PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES: We have a country that needs help and it needs help very badly. We're going to fix our borders.

Under the current legal framework, with the current resources that are allocated to ICE, you can't get nowhere near the kind of numbers he's talking about, a million deportations in a year. I think just to put this in perspective, during the biggest years of the Trump administration, ICE deported 267,000 individuals from the United States. You've got to quadruple that. So, how do you do that? One is, you need more ICE officers. You need to increase the number of arrests. Two, with this administration will want to build mass detention camps to house those individuals before they're deported. But most importantly is the immigration courts. You and I have talked about this for a long time. Huge backlogs have formed. The Supreme Court has said that migrants before they're deported are entitled to due process. How do you get them through the courts? And I think what the administration in thinking how do we bypass those courts, right? Not supplement them, not surge resources to them, but how do we eliminate that right to the courts in the first place. And that's going to be the focus of what they're going to launch here.",
