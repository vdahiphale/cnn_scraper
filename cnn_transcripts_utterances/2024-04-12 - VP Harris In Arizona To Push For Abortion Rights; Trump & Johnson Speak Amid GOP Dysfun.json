They're holding a news conference at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. They say they're going to discuss election security though skepticism is warranted given the last time these two teamed up on the issue of elections. They were trying to undermine the 2020 election. CNN's Kristen Holmes is following all of this for us in Palm Beach, Florida. Kristen, Trump and Johnson set to begin speaking in moments. What are you expecting to hear?",

      "sentences": "Well, I am told that they are likely to relitigate the 2020 election, which isn't surprising since both of them were part of the effort to overturn that election. But I'm also told that they are going to highlight this issue of non- citizens voting. Now to be very clear, there's already a federal ban in place that would stop non-citizens from voting in federal elections. However, there is some nuance here, there are some cities in some states that allow non-citizens to vote in local elections, like the school board election or certain mayoral elections, but it is not an issue in terms of widespread fraud.However, I got some pushback earlier today from advisors to Donald Trump who said this is also a way to prevent that from happening and alluding to the immigration crisis at the border, talking about this influx of migrants at the border. This is a way for Donald Trump and speaker Johnson to talk about an issue that they both want to talk about and link it to immigration, which is an issue that Americans care deeply about, voters, particularly cares one of the top issues, and something that they believe will help them in November in the election cycle. Now, again, there is no real evidence that we have seen that this is an issue, but they are saying that this will be a way to prevent that from happening in the November election. This is also a way as we know, for Speaker Johnson to get some support from the former president at a time where his speakership is really in peril. TAPPER: All right, Kristen Holmes, thanks so much. We're going to monitor the live feed of those comments and bring you some highlights of what Trump and speaker Johnson have to say, and perhaps a fact check if one is warranted. Who knows? Meanwhile, on the other side of the country, Vice President Kamala Harris is in Tucson, Arizona right now getting ready to talk about abortion rights in Arizona. Her remarks come just three days after the Supreme Court of Arizona upheld a law from the 1860s, one that would ban abortion in every case, including rape, including incest, except when it's quote necessary to save a person's life. Arizona's legislature had a chance on Wednesday to repeal this 1864 law. But some state lawmakers say Republicans left the chamber after blocking the vote causing this reaction. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We anticipate that the Vice President is going to directly tie these unpopular abortion bans, including the state supreme court ruling here to former President Donald Trump. I'm told by sources that this has been top of mind for the vice president and she wanted to hammer home this message here in Arizona, particularly that the former president poses a threat to health care and to personal freedoms.Now we got a preview as to what Harris is expected to say. That includes, for example, quote, \"The overturning of Roe was a seismic event. And this ban in Arizona is one of the biggest aftershocks yet.\" She's also expected to say that the second term -- a second Trump term looks like more bans, more suffering, less freedom.\" Now, of course, take the Biden campaign sees abortion as a salient political issue going into November. And just this week, they announced a seven figure ad by to air more abortion related ads in this state on the heels of that state supreme court ruling. And the vice president has been uniquely positioned on this. Early on this year, her team positioned her to tackle this issue head on over the course of the year by going on her reproductive freedoms tour. And while this is on a stop on that toward this is a campaign event because to show that they are leaning into this issue. And look, I talked to a Democratic strategist who said this court ruling essentially is another data point for this ongoing argument that Democrats are making that Republicans are the extreme ones, that they are the ones that pose a threat to personal freedoms and to healthcare. So that is the message that we anticipate the vice president is going to hammer home here in a state, of course, that is a battleground state. It's a critical one for this campaign, and one that President Biden only narrowly won in 2020. Jake.",

And that makes a huge difference in talking on this issue, not that the president can't talk about it to you, saw on that ad that he talks straight to camera on it, but if you have the first ever female vice president in the United States as your running mate on the ticket, and this is an issue animating your party to show up, you put her everywhere and anywhere where it is a relevant issue as it is instantly in Arizona after that ruling.",

How much do you think this issue of abortion rights is going to be a factor in places where lack of access to what is stark such as Arizona?ASHLEY ALLISON, FORMER NATIONAL COALITIONS DIRECTOR FOR BIDEN-HARRIS 2020: I think it'll be an issue where access is diminishing, but also where it's not because of what can happen in the future. If we do not -- if Joe Biden does not secure the White House, we are most likely looking at some form of a national abortion ban. So it won't matter what your access is, you will now then have to fall under the law of the land. I do think it's smart that Kamala Harris is going out there and talking about this. She's been doing it since the fall of Roe. And a lot of the polls in 2022 said that this was not going to be an issue that really carried Democrats. And it absolutely was. We saw it again in 2023. And I think what this issue does in states, if you're someone who's like, I don't know, I'm not really super excited about the ballot but this is an issue that resonates with you, it gets you to the polls.

And I give great credit to the Supreme Court and the justices for having the courage to do it.What they did is very simply give it back to the state. And I'll tell you, the Democrats are the radicals on this because they're willing to have abortions in the seventh, eighth, ninth month, they're even willing, and you can call it what you want. But you go back to the governor of Virginia, of the previous governor of Virginia, the Democrat governor of Virginia, we're talking about execution of a baby after birth. And you can say what you want, but that's extreme and that's radical. And nobody should have that and it has to be ended. Please go ahead. Go ahead, please.",

CNN's Tom Foreman is standing by to do some fact checking of what was said. But while he prepares that, let's bring back CNN anchor Kaitlan Collins. Kaitlan, obviously, he said a lot of harsh things, false things, things that are braggadocious, as you might say, what's your take on what we just heard?",

He talked at the beginning about some legislation that he wants to stand up, that I should note, that has zero chance of getting passed through the Senate. But in essence of how this went for Speaker Johnson, I mean, you see why he got on a plane today in Washington and flew down to Mar-a-Lago because he just stood next to the presumptive Republican nominee and leader of his party as he stood by him and said he's doing a good job under tough circumstances and did not throw any support behind Marjorie Taylor Greene's efforts to potentially oust speaker Johnson from that job and the way that she has said she has no confidence in the way he's handling that job instead, former President Trump there speaking up for him and praising the job that he's doing.But Jake, what broke through obviously from that is how Trump is feeling about what Monday is going to look like, when he becomes the first former president to face a criminal trial. And he did say he's willing to testify, we'll see how his legal team feels about that. He has had a lot of animosity toward past attorneys who encouraged him not to testify, the E. Jean Carroll trial. But what he said there, Jake, really underscores the significance of what Monday is going to look like. And the former president said, jury selection is largely luck, it depends on who you get. And certainly those two sentences are true, Jake, among the things that he did say. And what that jury looks like is something that his team is hyper focused on right now. Because all it takes is one juror for this case to not go the way that the district attorney Alvin Bragg hopes it will go. And so clearly you can see just how focused he is on what Monday is going to look like. Jake, the other thing that we've been talking about all week is abortion. And you heard the former president there asked about why we should believe now that he won't sign a federal abortion ban if he's in office. Again, he says it would not be necessary because Roe versus Wade was overturned by the Supreme Court. And I think a statement that the Democrats will probably be using in there ads, he said we broke Roe versus Wade. Obviously taking credit for that giving credit to the Supreme Court and the three justices that he put on that court. But when he was asked one point, Jake, if he was pro-choice or pro- life, he said, you know the answer to that. But he did not say, you know, what that answer is, and that just stands out to me. I mean, we remember Governor Ron DeSantis, that he doesn't think Trump is pro- life that he thinks he actually, you know, is someone who, you know, puts forward policies that aren't conservative, and isn't actually a believer in that underlying policy. He didn't actually answer that question, Jake.",

And he said such an interesting question, what's your next question?We should note that he did this big press conference talking about elections and such with this trial coming on Monday. His legal team had tried to delay it with any number of motions. Every one of them was rejected. It looks as though jury selection is going to begin on Monday in the first time in the history of the United States of America that a president, a former president faces a criminal trial. You say he's made his peace with it. But one might suggest that this press conference, this event today was -- is rooted in that.",

He doesn't agree with it, but it is going to be happening. And I should note, Jake, as this is happening, his legal team is arguing with the judge who is going to be overseeing that trial, about what Monday is going to look like and about the questions that they are going to ask the jurors.I think you should expect that jury selection process to take a lot longer than it is normally going to because they want to question each individual juror. And you can see just the emphasis on the weight of that and what it even means for Trump that he is also thinking about what that jury is going to look like and how it could affect him here whether or not he's ultimately convicted in this trial and what that means for him. And, you know, he tried to downplay the legal threat that it poses to him there. But still, he is going to be on trial. There are going to be a slew of witnesses getting on the stand and testifying. And this comes as his legal team is debating, you know, what that jury selection is going to look like what they're allowed to ask the jurors, whether they can ask them if they feel that they are biased, and cannot serve on a jury in a fair manner. And so that is something that is happening right now, 5:30 p.m. on a Friday as this trial is set to kick off on Monday, Jake.",

I think people have to continue to remind folks, what was your life like four years ago, and when I look at my Facebook posts that come up, they weren't fond memories, quite honestly, in a political realm like some there is this jaded perception that everything was great under Trump. And that just is not the case. People felt the chaos. And if he comes back, we will fill it again. It's not to say that things around the globe are stable by any stretch of the imagination.

You have to have a social security number.They do check that information against other databases. And you have to affirm that you are a U.S. citizen under very stringent penalties if you're caught, including jail time, deportation, fines, maybe that's one of the reasons that even when the conservative Heritage Foundation looked at possible fraud cases, from '22 -- from 2002 to 2022, they looked at roughly more than a billion lawfully cast ballots, more than a billion. And they could only find 100 examples of non-citizens voting.

So that's one of the reasons critics are long have said the Republicans here are talking about a solution to a non-existent problem.
