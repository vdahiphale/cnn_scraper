The Harris campaign drops a new attack ad against Trump and also sees the pool of potential VP candidates shrinking. And it's now not just childless cat ladies comments.

And right now what he's saying in his prepared remarks that we will hear live in about an hour from now is that he cannot defend why that roof was not better secured.So, there are many questions about the advance here. And one of the things that I continue to hear from sources, and certainly the acting director will be asked about this today, is, how is it possible that that building, just 150 yards from the podium, was not within the secured perimeter? Why was it so vulnerable and why was it exploited in such a way? So, those are going to be certainly some of the main questions here. And then further, John, what Senator Josh Hawley has made very clear is that he is looking for accountability. He does not feel, even after the resignation of the Secret Service director, that there has been enough accountability at the Secret Service. What we heard in a previous hearing were questions about whether anybody had been - had been disciplined or placed on administrative leave in the aftermath of that attack. And certainly that question will come up again today. And so, finally, John, what the senators are going to be looking for is more detail on what the Secret Service is doing right now, right this second, to ensure that this never happens again. Acting Director Ron Rowe says in his opening remarks that they are stepping up their threat assessment, stepping up their security plan. They have also picked up new protectees, so this workload is growing. But they are adamant that they are looking at their operations, increasing security for the protectees to make sure that this never happens again, and that they are well prepared, especially, John, as they move in to some of these larger events, like the Democratic National Convention that's going to be here in Chicago in just a matter of weeks.

You've heard Donald Trump talk about his immunity and ability to do whatever he wants. He even talked about, if folks vote this cycle, they never have to vote again. This idea of kind of unchecked presidential powers, gutting Medicare under - overwhelming or taking over or undermining Social Security. All of these things are things that are part of the agenda of Project 2025, and things that Republicans have been working on already.So, I think it's important that we hear what they're saying. They're extreme. We talk about the issues that they continue to push in Congress, like taking away reproductive freedom. And we've seen that across the country. Iowa put in place one of the strongest abortion bans just yesterday. So, as House Democrats, we have opportunities. In fact, we have two great pickup opportunities in Iowa. Abortion's also going to be on the ballot. We have a strong messenger in Vice President Harris on standing up for reproductive freedom.

They acknowledge that of course Kamala Harris is an entirely different opponent and they do think it's going to be more challenging to face off against her, especially after they've seen some of the enthusiasm after her becoming the apparent, you know, successor of Joe Biden. I can tell you that after that June 27th CNN debate, Donald Trump's team was incredibly confident. They were essentially measuring the drapes for November. And now they're not as sure and they are, of course, still trying to figure out how they're going to define her. Something they're also struggling with. I do want to quickly read this statement, though, from Vance's spokesperson in response to that \"Washington Post\" reporting. They wrote, quote, \"poll after poll shows President Trump leading Kamala Harris as voters become aware of her weak, failed and dangerously liberal agenda. Her far-left ideas are even more radioactive than Joe Biden, particularly in the key swing states that will decide this election like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.\" And so that's their response to this. But again, I mean, he said it himself, he's saying whatever we might say, it's clear that she's much younger and she's an entirely different opponent.

Vance really taking the opportunity to reintroduce himself. You know, I like J.D. Vance. I supported him in his Senate campaign. I see a lot of myself in him as a millennial dad.

I think they - they weren't surprised by the shift away from Biden. They were - they were surprised by the - how quickly people have coalesced around Kamala Harris. They thought they were going to have a few more weeks of chaos to exploit. But I think they really need to coordinate this message.I think it's pretty clear from the best message we've seen up on the air, that needs to be communicated and distributed. The surrogates are not on message. There need to organize this and really prosecute the case against Kamala Harris because she is not defined in the way that Joe Biden was, but that means that the American people need to hear the case against her. There's plenty to work with in her own words, she has staked out positions that are out of step with the mainstream. That's what people need to be reminded of. And that's what I expect to see for the next 99 days.",
