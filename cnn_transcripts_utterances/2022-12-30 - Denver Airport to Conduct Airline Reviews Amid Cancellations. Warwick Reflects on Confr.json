Of course, the idea of dry January is that you don't take in alcohol during the month of January, and it's clear from these numbers that a lot more people are interested at least in the idea of dry January.Now, why would they be interested in the idea of dry January? Because there are a lot of benefits to it, right? A majority of those who follow the program reported saving money, sleeping better, weight loss, it's easier to focus, perhaps something we can work on here, fewer days drunk, even months later.

It stayed very, very consistent. So 67 percent this year, and Gallup said that they did as compared to 66 percent 20 years ago, 65, 40, 63 nearly 50, and we're back to where we were in 1945 at 67 percent.So we're basically a country that is drinking the same percentage of alcohol that we have drank throughout the years, but I will point out one thing that really has changed is the perception of alcohol, how dangerous is alcohol? Which is more dangerous to use, alcohol or marijuana? Look at the -- look at this right year. 54 percent say alcohol compared to just 7 percent who say marijuana in 2022. If you compare that to where we were in 1974, it was a basic split. So what's happened is even if the same percentage of Americans are drinking alcohol as used to, the perception of how dangerous it is has clearly changed.

And we really lucked out because we had sent out the ballots and the information on it in late 2019, but then like everyone was home in 2020 and they had time. Like Beyonce would usually not have time to think about like her favorite albums, but she sat down and she submitted it. And so, I think there's a really great diverse number of voices who weighed in on what the greatest albums of all time were.",

It ranked very highly on my personal ballot, and you know, I think seeing an album by an artist who was disrespected as not authentic being seen as one of the greatest albums of all time, to see an artist make that, it just felt really special to kind of see people put respect on pop music and on especially like female artists, young women who make music in this list.",

Like if you had this number one, I think, you know, it's a certain number, like hundreds of points or something that helped actually kind of streamline it instead of just being like well this person put it at number one, so like let's put it in the top 10.
