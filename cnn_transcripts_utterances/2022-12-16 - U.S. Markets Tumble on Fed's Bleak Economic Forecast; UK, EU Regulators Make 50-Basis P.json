If you are just joining us, let me bring you up to date with some of our top stories this hour.Millions of people in the U.S. are waking up to winter storm warnings. Some 3 feet of snow has already fallen in the plains where blizzard conditions are expected for the next few hours at least. Now the slow- moving storm could bring a foot of snow to parts of Pennsylvania and New England. Missile attacks are reported in cities across Ukraine this morning including Kyiv, Odessa and Kharkiv. CNN's teams on the ground said they saw missiles and heard explosions as air raid sirens sounded. U.S. financial markets are hoping to rebound from a steep drop on Thursday but right now the Dow, Nasdaq and S&amp;P futures are all in the red. Trading has been underway for about 90 minutes in European markets. And as you can see, they are in negative territory. In Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index finished higher. Tokyo's Nikkei saw a big drop, the Shanghai Composite and the Seoul Kospi were basically flat. British and EU regulators are taking a cue from Washington on their efforts to tame the highest inflation in decades. They each raised interest rates by half a percentage point on Thursday, the day after the U.S. Federal Reserve did the same. Inflation on both sides of the English Channel is still in the 10 percent range even though it did tick down last month. There's a concern more interest rate hikes will push economies into a recession which is already looming in Britain. The regulators say they don't have much of a choice. Listen to this.

But Thursday's stocks dropped on other big news.The markets nosedived after the Federal Reserve predicted the U.S. economy will barely grow next year. As Richard Quest reports, the economic prospects are now becoming more clear and more grim. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RICHARD QUEST, CNN BUSINESS EDITOR-AT-LARGE: This was the day when reality seemed to seep in. As interest rates rose in Europe, the ECB and the Bank of England both raised rates by half a percentage point. And of course, we have the rate rise from the U.S. only 24 hours earlier. The reality that's seeping in is that next year is going to see even higher rates with slower economic growth. Some might call that stagflation, others are refusing to use that term and there are still those that won't admit the reality that there'll probably be a recession in the United States. Whichever way we cut it, the markets are unhappy because of what they see as the higher interest rates now moving very firmly into that phrase, restrictive territory. The very goal of these higher rates is to slow down economic activity. And we saw that in the U.S. with the latest retail sales numbers, which were down. We know that the consumer is starting to get exhausted. Even though it might be Christmas, if we look into 2023, I'm afraid the economic omens are not that good. Richard Quest, CNN, New York.
