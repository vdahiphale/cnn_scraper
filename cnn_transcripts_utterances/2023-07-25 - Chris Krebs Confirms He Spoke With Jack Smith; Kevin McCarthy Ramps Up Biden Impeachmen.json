Welcome to \"CNN Tonight.\"New tonight, the top election security official who was fired by President Trump after the 2020 election is talking to Special Counsel Jack Smith. Chris Krebs is another big name who may have deep insight into what was going on behind the scenes. The Smith's team has been asking about Krebs' firing and the timeline around it. Another detail, as Trump awaits, what he says he's sure will be a third indictment. But the grand jury did not meet as expected today. Why? More on all of that coming up. Also, disturbing news from the world of basketball. LeBron James's son, Bronny James, suffered a cardiac arrest during basketball practice at USC and was hospitalized yesterday. He's only 18 years old. So, what happened and how common is this in young, seemingly healthy athletes? We discuss all of that as well as the controversy and COVID vaccine conspiracies that always seem to arise in these cases. Our Dr. Sanjay Gupta weighs in on all of that ahead. Plus, a threat to impeach President Biden growing as Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy ramps up the accusations without offering any verified facts at this moment how impeachments don't always hurt the politicians they're aimed at. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KEVIN MCCARTHY, SPEAKER, UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES: As more of this continues to unravel, it rises to the level of each inquiry. What that simply provides is that the American public has a right to know, and this allows Congress to get the information to be able to know the truth. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I mean, it is rare, but, you know, we're talking about thousands of times that this happens even among people around that age.There was a study back in 2015. At that point, they projected some, you know, 6 to 7,000 cases of sudden cardiac arrest annually. Now, one thing I should point out is that it is often related to sports, more likely in men and more likely related to basketball players, but about 39% of the time in those under the age of 18 sports was involved. The numbers start to go down as people get older in terms of the relationship to sports, but it still happens. I will say once you get to 35 and older, the likelihood of having sudden cardiac arrest is more likely associated with blockages in the blood vessels that supply blood to the heart. I'll just show you really quick here, Sara. You got these blood vessels on top of the heart. They can become blocked. You can develop clots in those. As you get older, the tends to be the more common problem. That can lead to muscle in the heart tissue dying, and that can lead to problems with the heart. But in younger people, it can be a structural abnormality with the heart, heart and muscle problem, an electrical problem with the heart, inflammation underlying, one of those things. We don't know yet. I'm sure that's what they're investigating right now.

That's what happens.Now, with a heart attack, as I'm just showing you, you get a blockage of one of those blood vessels. That leads to some of the muscle tissue in the heart not getting enough oxygenated blood, and that can lead to an electrical abnormality that can cause a cardiac arrest.

But I do remember back when Bronny was born and LeBron talked a lot to us then about how important it was to have that connection with his son. He did not have his own father in his life. And that has really been such a constant companionship, not just as Bronny has grown up, but as LeBron has grown up into the athlete that we know him to be today.

Last summer, an incoming freshman at the time, a kid who is now a rising sophomore, had the same cardiac arrest issue during a practice in July, one year ago today, and the training staff in that incident rushed into action, saved his life. And they did the exact same thing almost exactly a year later with Bronny. But it, again, speaks to the fact that this is not something that happens a lot, but it does happen. And in fact, cardiac arrest is the leading cause of death in student athletes. And you look at NCAA basketball players, male basketball players only make up 4% of the NCAA student athlete population, but they make up 20% of these cardiac arrest issues. So, it's definitely something that college training staffs are prepared for.

He has kind of lined up his contracts in a way that, yes, he's still under contract with the Lakers when Bronny potentially joins the NBA, but it's his option. So, if he wants to go somewhere else where Bronny goes, he can do that, too. This has been the plan. And we will just have to see if Bronny's health will permit this. Sanjay was talking a little bit earlier about the different ways cardiac arrests happen. With Damar Hamlin, who you mentioned, that was blunt force trauma, right? We all saw it. I mean, that was so jarring. We saw him take a shot right to the chest and it stopped his heart. When it's a case of what we expect or what we've heard so far with Bronny James, maybe he took an elbow to the chest. We don't know. But more commonly what happens is that there's something about the athlete's heart that in that moment of stress of stopping and starting and everything that goes on that causes this condition. So, as Sanjay mentioned, the expectation is that he will go through testing over this next week, see if they can identify the problem that led to this, and if it is solvable or fixable, we expect him to get right back on the court the way Damar Hamlin has been able to enter training camp just this week with the Bulls, and hopefully continue that bright future that is ahead of him. If not, obviously, you know, it would be a crushing disappointment if he can't play basketball again. But I will say this about Bronny James. I saw him just a few months ago after he committed to USC and we were talking about his college experience. This is such a well-rounded kid. This is not someone where basketball is the only thing in his life. So, I think everybody -- the main thing is that he's okay, which it seems like he is. The second thing is the hope that he can continue his dream and play along inside his dad in the NBA and all of that. But I will tell you just from knowing him. He will be okay either way. It's just hopefully he can do what he loves still.",

But that's not what the guideline says that has everyone so upset.I want to ask you about what you think of this. The demand for the new AP course in African-American studies is actually surging across the United States, where people are looking for more information, not less. And those numbers are going up. The pilot course will be offered in the upcoming school year in 800 schools twice than what the College Board says it had planned for. Why do you think this is happening now?",

We've at times been pro-slavery and abolitionists. We've been pro-racial segregation and pro-racial integration, for voting rights for Black people and all people and against voting rights.And I think right now, in the midst of what I've called this third period of reconstruction, we've got people who are for and supportive of the 1619 Project and AP African-American history and really getting to the deep roots of our story because this is the origin story of us. And yet we have people who are really violently opposed. So, it's always been a story of this narrative war between reconstructionists who are supporters of multiracial democracy versus redemptionists who are really followers of the lost cause and that old antebellum history that we're still trying to come to terms with today. And so many people want to view slavery as some kind of benign institution. But that's how we got \"Gone with the Wind.\" And now we know, \"Gone with the Wind,\" which premiered in 1939, poor Martin Luther King, Jr. was dressed as an enslaved young person at the premiere in Atlanta in 1939. And we know this from my friend Jonathan Eig's new book, \"King.\" We have a distorted history of what slavery was. We still think about slavery as mint juleps and tea and sort of nice polite white folks. And somehow, this was some kind of rough education for Black people. That's what Senator John Calhoun from South Carolina called it. It was not that. It was the super exploitation of Black women and children and men and boys and girls and babies to enrich the entire United States from sea to shining sea.",

So, certainly, within the horrors of slavery, Black people found great beauty against all odds. They loved their family members. They innovated in terms of food and cooking and music. They were rice cultivators. They're the people who distilled the whiskey and gave Jack Daniels all the knowledge to do what he did. We were creators and there was black talent and black genius that came from Africa, right? But the idea that somehow, we have to soft pedal this because telling our kids the truth is going to offend one part of the population really ignores the fact that black history is American history and the souls of Black folks are really what has really enlightened this country and really ennobled us all. So, this idea of black dignity and citizenship despite racial slavery is the key through line -- and remember, we had white people during antebellum slavery.

Normally, when somebody does something like that in a dictatorship like Russia, the dictator will take the rebel and chop his head off, literally, and go after everybody involved. That hasn't happened in this case. Putin, instead of taking him to Red Square and chopping his head off, he brought him into the Kremlin for meetings with him and his guys. They gave him the money back that they seized from his office, $111 million. And now, he's sitting in Belarus enjoying the good life.
