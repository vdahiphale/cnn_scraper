A British Palestinian surgeon who has worked in Gaza's hospitals during the war. Finally, the death of America's most famous 20th century statesman, Henry Kissinger.

Vice President Kamala Harris said Israel must do more to protect innocent civilians.So as Israel resumes its offensive in Gaza, what is its strategy and will it heed America's call to safeguard civilian lives? I'm joined by Miri Eisin, a retired colonel in the IDF and director of the International Institute for Counterterrorism. Miri, welcome. So if you were, in response to President Macron, to define Israel's strategy, how would you describe it? COL. MIRI EISIN (RET), ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES: Destroying Hamas is very challenging as he said. But what the Israeli strategy is, is we're focusing on their military terror capabilities. That is actually something you can break down in a very specific way. You're going after 16 years of building positions, accumulating weapons, building the subterranean arena, and training these different thousands of terrorists. And that's what Israel is doing with the military capability. It goes hand in hand with the diplomacy because of the issue of the hostages, you want to try to get to the hostages. I'll remind that that's part of the picture. But it's most definitely focusing on destroying military capabilities and thinking about that next day of what will come instead.",

In other words, I realized that of course puts IDF forces in harm's way, but isn't that a more precise and tactical way? I mean, this is something the U.S. discovered in Iraq that you have to send special forces in rather than just bombing the entire neighborhood to smithereens.",

It's a combination of different type of infantry forces because you need to go in its urban area, very densely populated. The first thing that Israel did before we went into the ground operation at all is we were telling civilians, please move. Go to the areas that we defined to save your lives.You're going into urban areas that are still unhappily filled with civilians and so when I say systematically and slowly, you're going in to make sure that you never target civilians but you do get to the different positions that are built, into apartment buildings, into mosques, into schools, into kindergartens, so you need the forces on the ground to do that. You need a large portion of forces to be able to detect the shafts that go into that subterranean arena. You have to have forces on the ground. It's a combination of special forces together with the different types of infantry of engineering corps that could go in and blow up those tunnels. And all of this, Fareed, where we all know that there's the challenge that the hostages themselves most likely held mainly inside the tunnels so you have to do everything systematically and slowly. I know it seems like we're doing it from the air. It's actually very much on the ground. We were still on the ground in this week of the pause which was done to get out our hostages as much as possible. But it's taking it systematically and slowly to save the civilian lives, we need to do so, not just for us, it's the right thing to do, but because at the end of the day, the civilians in the Gaza Strip deserve a much better future than one where Hamas rules. [10:20:05] ZAKARIA: The reason I think many people think it's been a war mainly from the air is by the IDF's own numbers, the number of bombs it has dropped in northern Gaza far exceeds -- in 45 or 50 days far exceeds what the U.S. dropped in Afghanistan over four, five years. So when you look at Southern Gaza, I'm wondering you've already moved a million people into that area, so now it's twice as densely populated as it was, how will you manage this balance? Is there a different, more precise, more targeted approach or is it going to be a replay of what we saw over the last 45 days?",

So when we look towards the south, and you're absolutely right, it's a way larger amount of people as we told the people to go from the north to the south, and we have been doing that again now, Fareed.We've been telling people in the area of Khan Younis, specifically, where to go to save their lives. Doesn't make it easy. Doesn't make it pretty. How do you actually change in that sense? You do it carefully, with as much information as you can have. The information is not from the air, per se, you need to go in and to start it. I don't think in that sense that my biggest challenge for me as an Israeli is that I can't as an Israeli leave the Hamas there in any way. What they built there over 16 years is something that threatens our existence, in the fact that if this type of terror organization could do so, embedded in the population, this is a threat for the entire Middle East. So we will go in, we will try to be as exact as possible. And I say it not just for myself, but for my kids who are the ones who need to do that kind of targeting we're talking about Israeli soldiers who have to make these decisions, you never target civilians, but the entire Gazan arena is urban warfare and that's the biggest challenge there is.

And with the doubling of its population, and now the sheer number of wounded, I mean, when I moved to the south, the last two days, I felt completely helpless. There was no way getting inpatients with the operating rooms and social supplies was such a pressure on the operating rooms, and there were so few operating rooms (INAUDIBLE). That's why I decided to leave fast (ph), that because I felt as a surgeon, I'd become redundant, the system had collapsed so much. And so now there's a major loud invitation.

You know, they had attacked and since Shifa, they've attacked now the hospital in the north (INAUDIBLE). And so, same that the whole -- the health system, more than us on what's being dismantled. When I was at Shifa, I had no stage come across any armed present. I would walk freely as I was trying to find the kind of equipment and the dressings as we were running out of them. I would go around the hospital trying to get what I needed from other departments and (INAUDIBLE) stage that I see an area that looks out of bounds and has been down to the radiology department to get radiologists to comment on some CT scans of my patients. Still, I could not see anything. Actually, at some stage, I came to the realization because we weren't getting any kind of men that looked like they were fighting men, I came to the realization that most likely there was a parallel military medical system, because even the wounding that we were getting were all civilian, and you weren't getting any of that fighting men that were being (INAUDIBLE).

So, there were strong military arguments for attacking the North Vietnamese bases in certain parts of Cambodia that were crucial to their war effort. This didn't really particularly emanate from Kissinger, it really came from the Department of Defense and (INAUDIBLE) came from the U.S. military, in Vietnam, and Richard Nixon was president, not Henry Kissinger when these decisions were taken.
