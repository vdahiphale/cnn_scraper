Just a short time ago, we got new reports of Russian missiles falling in the northern city of Sumi. And this follows hours and hours of attacks across the entire expanse of the country. In the east, in Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia in the south, Odessa, all the way in the west in Lviv, also the capital, Kyiv, and in Central Ukraine in Dnipro.I can show you some video of what happened in DeNipro. A maternity ward and a shopping mall hit there. You can see some of the devastation. We are getting new casualty counts from the entire country. At least 26 dead at this point, over 100 injured. That count is expected to rise in the coming hours. The Ukrainian president, Vladimir Zelenskyy, says they are being hit with almost every type of weapon, from drones to cruise missiles to air bombardments, heavy air bombardments again across the entire country. A short time ago, we heard from CNN Portugal's Helena Lins on the ground in Kyiv. Let's listen. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

That was pretty major. But I think what's going on is this is much bigger.And it actually was not totally unexpected because over the past few months, many people who were watching the situation predicted that Russia was saving up armaments, saving up men, doing what it could to prepare for a gigantic blitz in the winter, as it did last year, hitting infrastructure, energy, et cetera. But this is almost, I think you'd have to say, wanton destruction at this point. On Russian T.V., they're essentially gloating over this. And you have the situation when you have bombing like this, it's very destructive not only to the infrastructure but to the emotions of the people who are in Ukraine right now. Imagine being hit entirely across the country. Winter is here. It's the middle of the holidays, and it gives people -- it can terrorize people into feeling that this is never going to end. And then if they look at the United States, they see the Congress stalled in giving any type of aid. So, it's pretty serious situation. And I think right now the Russians are trying to destroy the will of the Ukrainian people.",

That essentially is what it is. And I don't think that he has any intention of stopping. And I think there is a lot of, let's say, desire to just show the Ukrainians that they cannot win this, to try to show them that and show that Russia is strong. Putin needs that internationally, but he really needs it domestically to show that the war that he started, in his estimation, he's going to come out in some fashion winning it, whether he spins that or whatever.

A decision could come anytime, as soon as this morning.Late last night, Maine became the second state behind Colorado to bar Trump from the primary ballot, this after the secretary of state, Shenna Bellows, decided the 14th Amendment disqualifies him because of its ban on insurrectionists. The U.S. Supreme Court seems destined to weigh in. With us now, CNN Legal Analyst and former White House Ethics Czar Norm Eisen, he served as special counsel for the House Judiciary Committee during Trump's first impeachment. Ambassador, great to see you. You and I have had a chance to talk about this now a few times. So, I want to focus on some new territory here, if I can, and it has to do with the decision from the Maine's secretary of state who said, yes, she thinks Donald Trump committed insurrection, yes, she thinks she has the power to ban him from the primary ballot, in fact, the responsibility, she says. And that's where it gets interesting, because we've talked about the text of the 14th Amendment, and Section 3 clearly states that no person shall hold any office who shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion or given aid and comfort to enemies thereof. That's Section 3. Section 5 says the Congress shall have the power to enforce by appropriate legislation the provisions of this article. The secretary of state of Maine is not the Congress. So, why does she have the power and the responsibility to do this?",

It's well understood that both with the 14th Amendment and other parts of the Constitution, unless there's that key limiting language, only, that it's a concurrent responsibility on federal and state government officials to enforce the Constitution.It's common sense, John. We wouldn't say that a state official has no obligation to follow the First Amendment, that a state official is free to restrict the speech of person in the United States. And we don't say that the 14th Amendment Section 3 is off limits for secretaries of state. But that's not the whole story, because the other piece of the puzzle is that a secretary of state has to have some authorization within their state law to take the next specific step of ruling somebody ineligible. Some states give that authorization to people in office, like the secretary of state. That is what Secretary Bellows found, that she had that power under state law. So, then she went with it and she disqualified Trump.",

On Wednesday, DHS said more than 7,000 migrants were apprehended at the southern border. How big of a problem is this?REP. JASMINE CROCKETT (D-TX):  It's a huge problem. And if anyone is sitting around and acting as if it isn't, then they simply aren't aware. I just want the American people to know that Democrats as well as Republicans acknowledge this. You talk to a number of Democratic mayors that are complaining about this issue. And I appreciate what was said in that very last statement, which was the fact that the president has actually put forward a supplemental package that would actually provide relief to cities. Republicans don't want to tell the truth about what the president is trying to push forward and that may absolutely acknowledge the problem. The problem is Congress. The president can't do this by himself. He can't just shell out money. It takes action on behalf of the House as well as the Senate. And right now, the House is in shambles and can't do anything right. So, when people are complaining about the migrant crisis and Republicans are saying that they are the ones that can fix it, I want to remind people that, basically, the Republicans have said the house is on fire. We see it's burning, but no, we are not going to do our part. That's exactly what they've done while the president is trying to provide some immediate relief as well as long-term solutions.",

You know, it's one of those things that Republicans like to put out things and make it seem as if this is going to fix the problem for people that have never been involved in this. As someone who comes from the state of Texas who was serving in the Texas House when Operation Lone Star began, I understand what doesn't look like a fix, but I also understand what makes people feel better.And Republicans simply want to campaign on fixing immigration when they know that it's not an actual fix. They don't want to provide the resources that are necessary. We need to make sure that we have the courts that are fully staffed. We need to make sure that these persons that are coming over seeking jobs have the ability to actually work so that they're not a burden, but instead they're doing exactly what they want to do, which is working and supporting themselves and adding to our tax resources. We need more tax income anyway. So, I mean, we absolutely can work through this, but Congress has to be willing to fully fund everything around immigration.",

If our governor felt like he really wanted to come up with some federal enforcements, he should have ran for president of the United States. Currently, he serves as the governor, unfortunately, of the state of Texas. And you can't make Texas law go over and above what federal law says. And that's what he's trying to know. Historically, under Operation Lone Star, what he did was they came up with a scheme to arrest people under criminal trespass, which was present law. They found that, number one, it costs us more money. Number two, it puts us at risk for more lawsuits because Texas doesn't have air conditioning in our jails. And they were throwing them into prisons because they didn't have the space. Long story short, it was ineffective before what Greg Abbott was doing when he was trying to arrest migrants, is going to be ineffective again, and it is costing us tax dollars. But it makes people feel good, so he panders and puts that out there. People should start demanding to see the receipts and demand that we have actual fixes to these problems.",
