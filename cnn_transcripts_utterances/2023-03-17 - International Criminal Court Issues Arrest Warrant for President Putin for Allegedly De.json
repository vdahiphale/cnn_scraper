Senior international correspondent, Ivan Watson is in Kharkiv tonight, and CNN international diplomatic editor, Nic Robertson is with me in London. Ivan, I want to go to you first. We had just been hearing there from the president of the ICC, that the reason they moved to make President Putin's arrest warrant public was because it was a signal to the world that the ICC were doing their job.

And the statements coming from everybody, from Vladimir Putin's spokesperson, to the foreign ministry, is to say that this arrest warrant is null and void. It's absurd, and then we have a statement from Maria Lvova-Belova; who is kind of the children's rights official in the Kremlin, who is also named in the arrest warrant along with Vladimir Putin, who has done an awful lot, a very public work where she's actually escorting Ukrainian children from Ukrainian-Russian-occupied territory to Russia. Very publicly talking about the adoption of these children by Russian families. She says she's even adopted one of those children herself from the shattered city of Mariupol. And she responded by saying quote, \"it's great that the international community has appreciated the work to help the children of our country. Now we do not leave them in the war zones.\" Left out here is the fact that this part of the world wouldn't have become a war zone if it hadn't been for Russia's invasion of Ukraine in the first place a little bit more than a year ago, Christina.",

So, every time Russian shells and rockets and missiles land in Ukrainian town or city, yes, there's the military working their anti-aircraft defenses, trying to protect those places. But then, as I learned from Russian investigators, police investigators, then the investigators come in, and they document those strikes where they can. They try to gather cases to then subsequently have evidence to prosecute Russian troops for alleged war crimes. The head of the police investigators here in Kharkiv, Oblast, I interviewed him yesterday, he says he has more than 900 investigators on his team. And more than half of them -- more than half of the work they're doing is preparing cases of alleged war crimes committed by Russian troops on Ukrainian territory. That, I don't know if ever they'll be able to prosecute some of these individuals that may or may not be accused. But it has to somehow filter down to at least some of the officer corps on the Russian side of the frontlines. That there are people watching, there are people taking note, and there might be accountability down the road, particularly, if any of these officers end in Ukrainian hands.",

So, the narrative will be, well, what effect has this had on us? None, here they are. There's clearly been a lot of international pressure put on President Xi not to supply and support President Putin with weapons as a concern that he might. But there's a panoply of weapons that he could supply from sophisticated missiles, that Putin wants, which really seems incredibly unlikely. But maybe ammunition, that he might be able to sneak through different ways. That could be a possibility. But these two leaders will use this moment to stand together and thumb their noses at those 123 other nations of the international community, because neither of them want to see -- want to see the war end on terms that are unfavorable to President Putin. That sends a bad message for both of them, and they may not be military support, but the economic support that Xi will probably give Putin will be enough to allow him to continue the war, maybe in a lesser, but grinding pace for longer, and he wants that.",

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says hebelieves NATO will become even stronger with Finland's membership. Nada Bashir has more on what this means for the alliance's expansion plans. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER (on camera): Well, after weeks of talks, Finland appears to have cleared its biggest hurdle to joining the NATO alliance with Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan finally giving the green- light, speaking during a press conference alongside his Finnish counterpart on Friday. Erdogan said Finland had taken sincere and concrete steps to fulfill its commitments and address Turkey's security concerns. Adding that he believes NATO will be even stronger with Finland as a member. NATO, of course, requires unanimous approval from its 30 existing members. Now Erdogan must gain the approval of Turkey's parliament before formally ratifying Finland's bid. However, it is important to note that Finland applied to join NATO last Summer alongside Sweden. But this continues to be a major sticking point for Turkey's government continuing to object to Stockholm's membership bid. Speaking on Friday, Erdogan accused the Swedish government of embracing terrorists, in reference to allegations that Sweden is harboring members of the banned Kurdistan workers party or PKK. A group designated as a terrorist organization by Turkey, the U.S. and the European Union as well as Sweden. Sweden however denying sheltering anyone with such links. But with a NATO Summit scheduled to take place in July, the Turkish president said he will continue talks with his Swedish counterpart with the focus on counterterrorism policy. Telling reporters that the process will be determined by Sweden's next steps. Speaking earlier in the week, Sweden's prime minister acknowledged the likelihood of Finland joining the alliance ahead of Sweden, but told reporters that Sweden is also safer with Finland in NATO than outside of NATO. Adding that he believes it is not a matter of if Sweden will gain membership, but when? Nada Bashir, CNN, Istanbul. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Eleven American banksare stamping up $30 billion to save troubled lender, First Republic. The bank shares are tumbling again today as investors fear that intervention might not be enough. Meanwhile, Credit Suisse -- Credit Suisse isn't out of the woods either. Shares in the Swiss lender fell by as much as 10 percent this morning, erasing some of Thursday's gains. Well, here, to help us unpack this, is CNN's Richard Quest joining me. And Richard, it has been a head-spinning week, culminating as I say, in this industry-led rescue of First Republic, and yet, there still seems to be some fears and jitteriness in the markets. So, explain why to me, is this because investors are essentially waiting here for the next shoe to drop? That there could be some contagion in the air? RICHARD QUEST, CNN BUSINESS EDITOR-AT-LARGE: That's exactly it, got in one. How far will this go? Look, the regulators are in a different environment than 2008. Even the speed with which a run on a bank can take place happens as fast as I can use one of these. As soon as I can move my money, that's a run on the bank. I don't have to go and stand outside like in Northern Rock and wait for the door to open. I can do it fast, and if I realize I am hearing rumors in chat rooms that things are going badly at my lending institution, I can take the money out. And that's why they've moved so fast. And then you get those like First Republic, which may well have had some problems, but it certainly wasn't a basket case. And that's why the major banks decided to club together and bought $30 billion worth of deposits. Basically saying, look, there's nothing wrong with this bank, we're not -- we're not worried, you shouldn't be either. But regional banks are still going to bear the brunt. And if you look at the way the share prices of regional banks have fallen, that's because they're not regulated in the same way as the big national banks.

Last night, they were accused, you can hear them now banging on that fence again, this is getting increasingly -- please, don't use that kind of language -- it's getting increasingly difficult for President Macron, as he has been accused of having abrogated his responsibilities as a protector of the French constitution by effectively overruling or ruling by diktat -- by ruling by diktat against what he assumed would be the failure of the deputies in the National Assembly to vote in favor of his plans to increase the pensionable age from 62 to 64. Now, that doesn't seem like the sort of thing that you would expect to see demonstrations like this as a consequence. But this strikes at the very heart of the French economic system, the very heart for many, and now, the police are beginning to charge forward. They're responding to incoming rocks that have been thrown repeatedly. The protesters and demonstrators have been digging up cobblestones and hurling them at the police. They are trying to protect this barrier, the police have been responding with tear gas and stun grenades. As a demonstrator, they're throwing a scaffolding pole just as we speak. Now, this is getting more and more violent with every minute that goes on, and that is a real problem, because not only for the Macron administration, but also, for the many hundreds of millions indeed of French people who object to the economic reforms that President Macron is trying to achieve.
