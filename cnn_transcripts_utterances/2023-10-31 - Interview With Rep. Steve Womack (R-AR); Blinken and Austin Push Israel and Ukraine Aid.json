The goal, the mission for them today is to make the case to lawmakers for President Biden's $106 billion ask for an aid package that he wants in order to support both Ukraine and Israel, two nations at war, two allies of the United States. But what has happened is protests, Blinken interrupted multiple times by people protesting angry over Israel's action in Gaza. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Yes, Kate, so one of the big themes that we see Secretary Austin and Secretary Blinken underscoring here is the fact that Israel and Ukraine and the wars that both are fighting are pretty inextricably linked.And, therefore, you can't divorce the two in a major supplemental aid package, as the House wants to do. And Secretary Blinken made this case explicitly by saying that Russia's invasion of Ukraine is being supported by Iran. And, in exchange, Iran is getting advanced military equipment and technology from the Russians. What can the Iranians do with that? Well, then they can use that to support their proxies across the region, which attack Americans, which attack the Israelis, and, ultimately, this is all interconnected, this axis of Iran and Russia that is posing such a big threat to the U.S. and its allies. So that is really the case that they are making at this point. Secretary Blinken actually said that, if the two were to be separated in a major aid package, then that would just show adversaries that the U.S. is simply playing Whac-A-Mole with its funding to its allies. Here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  This is all one fight, and we have to respond in a way that recognizes that. If we start to peel off pieces of this package, they will see that, they will understand that we are playing Whac-A-Mole while they cooperate increasingly and pose an ever greater threat to our security, as well as for that of allies and partners.

And, in addition to that, it would strip funding for the IRS that was included in the Inflation Reduction Act, something that the administration, as well as some senators, have said is a nonstarter.So that remains to be seen just how this all gets passed. But another major through line so far in this hearing has been questions about humanitarian assistance and protecting civilians in Gaza. Both Blinken and Austin have reiterated that they have said multiple times to their counterparts how important that is. The U.S. right now, according to Blinken, trying to get up to 100 trucks of aid per day into Gaza. Right now, it's at about 60, still a drop in the bucket, of course, what Palestinians there need -- Kate.",

We also have some pictures of Israeli infantry on the ground there. And it's not the only place where Israel has been conducting operations. North of Ramallah, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Israel says it has targeted a Hamas leader's compound there. But I do want to get right to the very latest with our Jim Sciutto, who is in Northern Israel, who has seen ingoing or outgoing fire along the border between Israel and Lebanon.

It gives you a measure that this is constant.There was a Hezbollah funeral just on the other side out of the border from one of those fighters. Mostly, Israel has been able to repel those ground invasions. But, listen, those shells fall on this side, and they're dangerous, right? But it is not a full-scale invasion yet. You have many, many thousands of Hezbollah fighters on the other side. And, crucially, Lebanon, Hezbollah has many thousands, missiles, including very high-grade precision missiles that they didn't have in previous conflicts, supplied by Iran. They fired a few, but if they fire those in number, the concern is, it would overwhelm Iran's -- sorry -- Israel's missile defenses, much like those rockets coming out of Gaza fired by Hamas. They were fired in such volume and such number that they were able to break through the Iron Dome defenses. If Hezbollah were to unleash similar from here, then we're talking about something quite different.",

And the IDF says that they took out Nasim Abu Ajina in an aerial strike on Monday, and he also commanded Hamas' aerial array, is how they describe it, helping to develop UAVs and paragliders.

I have heard from a source familiar that the Hamas political wing in Qatar is much more willing to negotiate than the Hamas military leaders inside Gaza. So, the more of those leaders you take out, perhaps you remove some of that friction. But Hamas also knows that those 200-plus hostages are the only leverage against an all-out Israeli assault. So I think you're going to continue to see days, if not weeks, of Israel picking off these leaders with airstrikes, and the more of the area that they saturate, probably also raids on the ground. But you can see that they're holding back on some of those raids to protect their own forces. They don't want to have their forces at this point also taken hostage as they're attacking.",

And in each particular occasion, they are replaced. This is a fight against not only the leaders, the people who direct the operations, who plan the operations, but also, the American people would be surprised, the financiers, who's getting the religious approval for different strikes. These terror cells are so robust that they can replace their leaders in a nanosecond. It's important to take out individuals that we have identified as key leaders of the cell or that Israel thinks are controlling part of the operation. But, truthfully, when you're talking about a terrorist organization that has thousands of fighters who have already been immersed in a plan and who are now hunkered down inside those tunnels waiting to continue the fight, and they have other terrorist cells in, like we just talked about, Hezbollah, Yemen, and other locations that are all being supported by Iran, it's very difficult to squash this terrorist activity, but also to basically beat the ideology, which is Hamas.",

But the problem is, to Mark's point, yes, there are many people who can tactically be replaced to do these jobs within Hamas. The hope is that, by the Israelis' military keeping the pressure on and taking out some of the well-known political figures within Gaza, that it gives the figures within Hamas in Qatar a greater chance to negotiate to get those people out peacefully.",
