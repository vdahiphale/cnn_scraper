So, these are things at the heart of their job when they are president.When it comes to other official acts, there's also the presumption of immunity, but they're saying there is no immunity for unofficial acts. Now, they did not delve into what exactly that translates to when it comes to the Trump case. That is a job that will now fall to the district court judge, Judge Tanya Chutkan. But sussing out what's what in the Trump case after this opinion will take some time. And this opinion makes it unlikely if not impossible that this case could go to trial before November. Now, a source familiar with the Trump legal team thinking tells me they view this as a major victory because they believe not only will this opinion allow them to get some of the charges here tossed. But they will also be able to get some of the key evidence in this case tossed, evidence that they believe Jack Smith would have to have in order to prove whatever remains of his case.",

One thing that Chief Justice John Roberts opinion does that have surprised a lot of us is say that if the evidence that's trying to be admitted is itself related to immunized conduct, that evidence can't be used.So, you know, with regard to drawing a line going forward, I actually think courts will be able, Pamela, to draw the line between official and unofficial acts. The problem is, if you're, you know, special counsel Jack Smith, how do you prove that the president actually committed unofficial acts that give rise to criminal liability if you can't use official acts, which the Supreme Court says are immunized as evidence? That's the real challenge now, it's why I think you know, Paula is right that the Trump team is, you know, calm, it was a huge victory for him. And I think that's the biggest reason why the January 6th prosecution is now in serious trouble.",

Now, in New York, as you noted, we already have a conviction there that is expected to be appealed. And we can expect the Trump team I'm told will particularly try to challenge key pieces of evidence that they believe were entered in during this trial but are also covered by this opinion, including key portions of Hope Hicks's testimony, and tweets that were entered in. You can also expect they're going to try to use this down in Georgia. Now, it's unclear, right, the impact that this opinion will have on those other non-January 6th cases.

But you also have in the middle Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who is actually quite critical in her concurring opinion of just how far the majority opinion goes. She insists in various places in her concurrence that this case can and should go forward. And I think there's a real tension there. And a real hard question that the chief justice never answers, which is, if the president's not supposed to be worried about facing criminal liability for his misconduct, and if our political reality is that a president shouldn't really be worried about being impeached and removed from office for criminal misconduct, what is going to stop a president, whether it's this one, the next one, 20 years from now from actually doing something that's in his political interests, but that's in flagrant violation of the law?

That would probably be more of a statement for Clarence Thomas's wife because she was involved, certainly, in sort of the machinations of trying to put some pressure on people in certain states.

And just beyond the specifics of Justice Thomas participated in this case of Justice Alito, you know, I think we should step back for a second and say, in general, how bad does it look at that this court at this moment in American history, divided right down its ideological line, 6-3 in this ruling.If you look at the history of the court, the most celebrated political rulings, whether it's the Watergate tapes case in 1974, Clinton versus Jones in 1997, Brown versus Board of Education, in 1954, the civil rights movement. One of the things that all those rulings have in common is that the court spoke with one voice, you had justices from across the ideological spectrum, just as across the political spectrum, joining together to send one message to the American people. The only message I think the court has sent today is that this issue has divided them into the same partisan camps that they've been in historically. And I think that's really, to me, far more troubling from an optical perspective, even in the participation of, you know, justices whose own behavior could be called into question. What it reinforces, Brianna, is that I think the court looks back much more political, in a case in which it would have really behoove the court to look like it was above the politics of the moment.",

Now, it's almost codified, if you -- you know, political violence is perfectly legal if you win. My concern is that if you believe the polls, Donald Trump may very well be our next president. And if he is, he's made it very clear that not only is he going to exact retribution that people like me and Andrew McCabe who've been speaking out about his actions, but he's also going to free those individuals that attacked the Capitol on January 6th.

And this is kind of my area, the Homeland Security support online from a lot of these violent right-wing individuals saying that he is -- he is not only being persecuted, but he's actually the one that's standing up for their rights. And so, the longer we can he can keep himself away from being prosecuted or even being, you know, pulled in front of a jury for these actions, the more it really substantiates all the claims he and his other report -- his other supporters in the Republican Party have been saying that January 6th was not violent, and that no one should be prosecuted for this.

And so, you know, I think that helped. But I don't think it has resolved the doubts. I think a lot is probably going to come down to how the opinion polls suggest the impact has been, and they're beginning to come out. But there'll be better ones in the coming days. And I think if they suggest there was not much impact, then I think it's more likely that President Biden will remain on the ticket. I think if they show that he was badly hit, and that he will hurt the chances of the Senate and House going democratic, I think then, you know, there'll be a broader push as you -- as you just suggested, to remove him from the top of the ticket.

They hadn't subjected him to that kind of grilling, in a way (AUDIO GAP) people that they weren't entirely confident of how he would do.And so, that debate performance played into this narrative that he is struggling. And I think that is why it has been so devastating. And, you know, in a way that was not true of Obama in 2012, in his first debate, and, you know, I think this is also something that just resonates with the public. So many of us have had parents and we've had had these difficult conversations about taking away the car keys. We remember Ruth Bader Ginsburg and you know, she made a -- and I think, you know, a lot of us have had an enormous respect for her as we do for Joe Biden. But she made a gamble and she lost.
