We need to restore the integrity in our election process.(END VIDEO CLIP) ERIN BURNETT, CNN HOST, \"OUTFRONT\":   Alice had such incredible integrity and she was also personally deeply kind to all of us, always remembering things about everybody's personal lives, an incredibly kind person. And she will be deeply missed by everyone at CNN and, of course, viewers too. We are sending our care to her family tonight. Thanks for joining us. Anderson starts now. ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST, \"ANDERSON COOPER 360\":   Tonight on 360, disorder in the court as the judge in the former president's hush money trial criticizes a defense witness for breaking the rules of decorum. Also breaking news on the helicopter crash that killed Iran's president and eight others. We'll have the latest on the investigation and what it means for Iran and the world. And later, one-on-one with comedian Bill Maher, talking Trump, Biden and what he thinks is wrong with American politics and culture. Good evening. There was drama today in the Trump hush money trial, the lengths of which we have not seen in the more than five weeks of proceedings. No sooner after the prosecution rested and the defense called another witness, then Judge Merchan cleared the courtroom. A rare act after the judge cited that witness, attorney Robert Costello, for improper courtroom behavior that included rolling his eyes and an audible sigh. At one point, Merchan said to Costello, quote, \"If you try to stare me down one more time, I will remove you from the stand.\" Not something the defense likely wanted to see or hear as the whole purpose of calling Costello, who had once given legal advice to the prosecution's star witness, Michael Cohen, was for him to undercut Cohen's credibility. The defense later asked Judge Merchan to dismiss all charges over Cohen's credibility issues. The judge would only say he's reserving his decision. Trump's one-time fixer and attorney spent more than 17 hours over four days on the stand. Today, the defense got Cohen to admit he stole from The Trump Organization for an unrelated expense that was included in the alleged $420,000 Stormy Daniel reimbursement at the heart of the felony charges against the former president. Now, the prosecution has painstakingly tried to use witness testimony to paint Trump as a micromanager who would know every detail about that payment in order for the jury to find him guilty of falsifying business records. The prosecution also tried to rehabilitate damaging testimony Cohen gave on Thursday when the defense used text messages between him and Trump's bodyguard, Keith Schiller, to suggest that a subsequent call on October 24, 2016 was not, as Cohen had testified, a way to contact Trump about the final details of the Stormy Daniels payment, but as the messages suggest, a conversation with only Schiller about a 14-year-old crank caller who was aggravating Michael Cohen. Today, prosecutors showed a still photograph from this video of a Trump rally that night in Florida. You can see there Trump waving, and in the spot shadow, Keith Schiller, both sides stipulated the video concludes roughly five minutes before that 8.02 PM phone call. Now, prosecutors were suggesting that it proves that Schiller could have handed the phone to Trump when Cohen called, that he was that close to him. Now, that's, of course, up to the jury to decide. A jury that the judge today said would hear closing arguments next week, but not before the court is back in session again tomorrow with that lawyer, Robert Costello, back on the stand. I'm joined now by criminal defense attorney Arthur Aidala, former federal prosecutor, Jeffrey Toobin, CNN Anchor Abby Phillip, who was in the courthouse today, New York Times senior political correspondent Maggie Haberman and our own Kara Scannell, who was in the courtroom. Also with us, John E. Jones, former chief judge of the U.S. Middle District Court of Pennsylvania. Kara, you were there, and I know you just got the transcript. What was that moment like between Judge Merchan and Robert Costello?",

And he has a few times, but not like this.But it was not entirely surprising because anybody who has dealt with Bob Costello knows that he can be a wild card. And this is why a lot of people in Trump's world thought calling him was a risk. And we got to see what a risk it was because this all took place in front of the - except for that bit at the end. But the objections all took place in front of the jury. The parts of cross that took place today by the prosecutors were not great for Costello.

JONES III, FORMER CHIEF JUDGE, U.S. MIDDLE DISTRICT COURT OF PENNSYLVANIA:   Well, you know, my first comment would be just another day at the office for Judge Merchan. I mean, I can't even imagine. I would levitate out of my seat if I had a witness who is a lawyer, an officer of the court, and knows better than to talk over me and, you know, give me the eye when he's sitting there. I think he handled it perfectly, to warn him that he was going to hold him in contempt. You know, the greater question is, from a tactical standpoint, why they called this witness. And jurors tend - and I've said this before - to sort of cleave to the judge. The judge is their protector, the person who greets them, sends them off at the end of the day. They don't like when a judge gets walked on by a lawyer or, in this case, a witness. It leaves a really bad sensation, a bad taste in their mouth.

He, at one point, Susan Hoffinger, the prosecutor who was doing the cross-examination of him, was asking a question and he spat out - speak into the mic.

I think there is a sense of disconcertion that there has not been adequate fortification put in place in the Northern border to hold that Russian offensive that took place about a week ago back. And also that we're going to see a slow arrival potentially of Western aid into people's hands to give them the upper hand. The staggering thing, Anderson, though, is to see how drones have completely changed daily life on the front line. Pretty much every unit we've been with since we've been here in the last week, at some point we've been told to run for cover, to get away from the visibility of Russian drones flying overhead. Sometimes they simply don't even know who the drone belongs to when it hovers above them and it's most likely Russians trying to spot targets for the intensive airstrikes, huge half-ton bombs or superior artillery. They've got more ammunition currently than the Ukrainians to bring them to bear on those positions. So it does appear, yes, in recent days that Russia's advance may have slowed. They're certainly not making huge strides deeper into Ukraine that perhaps they thought they might be able to, but ultimately it is an uphill task certainly and it's one that may get tougher in the weeks ahead because at this stage there are thoughts Russia may start probing in other parts around the front line rather than necessarily focusing on the areas it's already hit here north of Kharkiv. Anderson, behind me, just -- we've heard explosions over the night but it's desolate here, utterly silent, lights off. Kharkiv bracing frankly for any potential Russian attacks tonight. Anderson?",

He played a huge role in the Latin freestyle movement and helped a lot of musicians make hits. A few years ago, he started his own label, Flygroove, and was making new music right up until the end.
