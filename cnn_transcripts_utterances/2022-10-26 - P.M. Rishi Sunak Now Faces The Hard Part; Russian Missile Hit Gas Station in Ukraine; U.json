We begin this hour in London where Rishi Sunak is beginning his first full day as the British government's new leader, and he will soon face a grilling from lawmakers during his first prime minister's questions in parliament. Mr. Sunak was greeted by mostly cheers as he arrived at 10 Downing Street for the first time as prime minister on Tuesday. He is Britain's third leader in just seven weeks, and he's vowing to steer the country out of crisis and fix the mistakes of his predecessor Liz Truss, who stepped down after just 45 days in office.

And Nic, I believe you have an update for us on the latest from Ukraine. NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR:  A relatively quiet night. Those two people killed, four others injured in Dnipro when a shell landed, or missile, rather, landed on a gas station. The sirens, the air raid sirens did sound across the whole country almost the total -- a totality of the country except in the very west this morning, just an hour or so ago. They didn't last long. It is unpredictable how and when and how frequent Russian airstrikes will come. So far today, relatively quiet, but the news from the front lines is different in Kherson there. The reports are that the Russian authorities there in the illegally annexed city of Kherson are putting increasing amounts of pressure on the civilians there to leave. Indeed, operating as they did when they forced people out of other areas of Ukraine like Mariupol in the summer. They're forcing those residents who leave to go through filtration systems, if you will, to check their backgrounds and take away the people who they feel are anti-Russian. There is a track record of Russia doing that, and the reports are that is happening again in Kherson. Along the frontline tense in some areas, but in the cities of the country today at least the wave of strikes that we've seen on electricity supplies is not in action this morning. But this all changes in any moment, Anna.",

The country's transition to democracy and ended a power sharing agreement between the army and civilian leaders. It was also met with widespread condemnation, sparking pro-democracy protests inside the country and cutting off hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to Sudan from international donors. A year later, Sudan's future is still in limbo. The country still has no prime minister. The last one, Abdalla Hamdok was put under house arrest during the coup. Reinstated a few weeks later only to resign in January amid more protests. There has been little progress in mediation efforts by the United Nations and the African Union, though in July General Burhan said the military would step back from talks so that civilian factions could plan a new government. Sudan's main civilian alliance called the move a ruse. And encourage people to continue protesting. The political unrest has been made worse by a growing food crisis. In June, the United Nations said a third of Sudan's population, that's 15 million people, is facing acute food insecurity. The war in Ukraine making conditions worse. About half of the country's wheat imports comes from the Black Sea region so prices of goods have skyrocketed. Aid agencies are also monitoring extreme flooding in parts of the country. The floods impacting nearly 350,000 people by destroying homes and fields and increasing the risk of waterborne diseases like cholera.
