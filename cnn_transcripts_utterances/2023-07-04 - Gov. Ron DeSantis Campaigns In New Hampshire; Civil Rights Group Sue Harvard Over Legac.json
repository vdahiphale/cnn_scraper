It really has been former President Donald Trump, who by latest CNN polls has been around 47 percent. And then Ron DeSantis, around 26 percent than everyone else in single digits.And to this point, the spokesperson for the pro-DeSantis super PAC Never Back Down said this is what they feel they are way behind, but take a listen to how he put it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STEVE CORTES, SPOKESMAN FOR PRO-DESANTIS \"NEVER BACK DOWN\" SUPER PAC: Look, right now in national polling, we are way behind. I'll be the first to admit that, OK. I believe in being really blunt, and really honest. It's an uphill battle. I don't think it's an unwinnable battle by any stretch, OK. But clearly, Donald Trump is the runaway frontrunner.

Even after former President Trump was indicted in Florida for allegedly mishandling classified documents.I came up here and I talked to some of his supporters here in New Hampshire to see if that made any sort of a difference and it only seemed to embolden them. So that is the dynamic that all of these candidates today Fourth of July, it's part of why they're out and about across the country here in New Hampshire a little bit later today here in Merrimack, New Hampshire. We're going to see for the Governor Ron DeSantis, South Carolina Senator Tim Scott, North Dakota Governor, Doug Burgum, and more as they come through here. But then over in Iowa, we're also going to see former Vice President Mike Pence, former Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson, all of them out and about to try and make some inroads to again, what so far has been a runaway raise, polling have indicated for former President Donald Trump but it's still very early. And this is where all of these candidates I think are going to try and make some progress.",

The Journal reports prosecutors have issued subpoenas and questions several key figures including attorney Sidney Powell.Powell helped spread baseless claims of widespread election fraud to bolster the former president's efforts to overturn his 2020 loss to Joe Biden. CNN recently reported that investigators also spoke to Rudy Giuliani, who was Trump's personal lawyer at the time. With us now is Former Deputy Assistant Secretary for the Department of Homeland Security and Former Federal Prosecutor Paul Rosenzweig, Paul, great to see you this morning. What are the areas of possible illegality that investigators could be looking at? What is it that the lawyers for Trump then could have done that withdraw legal questions?",

In each of them, the attorneys in question are likely to have provided advice to Donald Trump, about the legality of his conduct, probably telling him it was illegal in some cases.Rudy Giuliani is famous for having been reportedly in a meeting with Trump and Sidney Powell, which degenerated into a yelling match, because Powell's advice was so crazy, that even Giuliani thought it was untenable. That kind of evidence of conversations that happen with the president would go directly to speak to his state of mind, as he continued his course of conduct, notwithstanding the advice of his attorneys.",

So Giuliani obviously has some fear of personal liability for his conduct.

Tell me the things that you can say that would help me prove the case against somebody else.Typically, it happens, for example, in large criminal conspiracies, the mafia, Hitman testifies that the dawn ordered him to do the, to do the shooting. So his lawyer tells the prosecutor, hey, let me come in. I'll tell you what I can tell you. And if the prosecutor thinks its good enough, he gives the lower level person a deal. And he takes the testimony of that lower level person against the leader here, the lower level persons Giuliani and other attorneys.

Also a federal judge has blocked a Florida voter registration law, legislation by the way was backed by Governor Ron DeSantis and would have made it illegal for people convicted of certain felonies and for non-citizens, including permanent legal residents to collect or handle voter registration applications.

It's an unjust and unearned benefit, and these applicants are receiving the benefit based on work or money donated by other people. It is not an individual merit situation; it is not something where they're being considered on an equal playing field with their colleagues with their fellow applicants.
