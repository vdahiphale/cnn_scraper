But the Hamas gunmen who stormed the sites didn't just take hostages, they also murdered hundreds of festivalgoers. And we caution you the images of the aftermath you are about to see our graphic, as CNN's Clarissa Ward saw when she visited the site. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CLARISSA WARD, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): What happened just off this quiet border road was a massacre. The bodies of the perpetrators still remain, while the fate of many victims is unknown. Organizers of the Supernova Music Festival say that thousands of young revelers had gathered to celebrate the end of the holidays. Just snapped or 6:00 a.m. Hamas militants launched a bloody attack. WARD (on-camera): So we're just now on the approach to the Kibbutz where that dance party was taking place. You can see there's vehicles all around here that have been shot up. We see the bodies of at least one, two Hamas fighters. I think there are more down this way. WARD (voice-over): Many of the victims spent hours in hiding, waiting to be rescued and calling their loved ones. WARD (on-camera): Many of them are still missing. Many of them are dead. It's been very difficult to try to get a precise number. WARD (voice-over): Now a volunteer group that handles human remains says that at least 260 bodies have been found at the festival site. The government here took a bold step releasing an image of scores of body bags in a tent where investigators were tasked with identifying them. WARD (on-camera): So you can see over here the body of at least one other person. I don't think you want to get too close to it. It's pretty graphic. WARD (voice-over): Active fighting continued along this stretch of the border throughout the day as Israeli military forces poured in. So we're seeing a bunch of tanks being brought down this way. You can also hearing a steady stream of booms, apparently rockets, landing in the distance in that direction. And certainly a feeling that people are on high alert. We tried to push further down that way. We were told no on certain terms, we needed to turn around. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

They also some of them were fired towards the suburbs of Tel Aviv and of course, to the cities right around the Gaza Strip.

Sir, good to have you with us.The U.S. is sending Navy warships and a Pentagon announcing support for Israel, sending U.S. military assets. What is the significance of this aid, the objective? And what do you make of the specific requests that Israel made? What can you read into that? LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING (RET.) CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Hey, it's a couple of things, Laila. And first of all, thanks for having me. It has to do with the carrier strike group. The Ford Carrier Strike Group is a significant power punch for deterrence in the area, not just in support of Israel as an ally, but also to counter and deter anyone else, as Oren said in his report, actions by malign actors. But that's not the only thing that's coming. There's also quite a few aircrafts that are going to be based in the area. This is something when I was commander in Europe, we often supported our ally Europe. It was under the European Command at the time, now it's under Central Command. General Kurilla, who is the Central Command Commander, has judged these are the kinds of things that may be needed, first of all to deter, but also in probability that there are some Americans that are have been captured and perhaps killed, they may participate in actions to get those hostages out and coordinate with the Israelis to do that. So multiple purposes for some of these forces that are going in. There's a lot of ammunition stocks inside of Israel that can also be resupplied. And that's the request for additional missiles to help in the Iron Dome systems. This is a system that is shared by both the United States and Israel. So there are some stocks. It's a from a company created between Israel and the United States. So those are certainly important, given the massive amount of rocket attacks that Hamas has been conducting against some key target within Israel.",

I've written many papers about it as part of military requirements and courses.And what's fascinating is, this is a repeating theme. We have seen the Israeli military having to be prepared for these kinds of things. They've even built a training center outside of Tel Aviv to train for operations in the Gaza. So these are some of the things that are going to be affecting, first of all, not just the U.S. military. You've seen Secretary Austin, working with his counterpart, the Minister of Defense Gallant, that's going to take away from some attention toward Ukraine. There's also the congressional speaker elections that are going to be held this week that have so far appear to be a little bit chaotic. There's factors like Senator Tuberville's hold on promotions. Two of the key members of the campaign of the U.S. military that will be involved in this out of Central Command, the Deputy Commander of CENTCOM, as well as the fleet commander of the naval forces going into the area around Israel are both on that hold list that Senator Tuberville is at. So all of these factors play a part in what's going to happen within the next few days. And it's certainly going to be a little bit chaotic and a little bit dysfunctional, as the U.S. military tries to help to different partners who are under crisis situations. because they're bearing the attacks of either terrorist or Russians.",

It says that it's been hitting operational centers, command center. It goes on to say in the statement, the Israeli military does that it has severely degraded Hamas' capabilities.But as you mentioned there, they are still very much able to operate. Just in the last few hours, Hamas claiming yet another barrage of rockets, some landing in Ashkelon. Claiming that it was able to fire rockets as far as Ben Gurion Airport. Claiming that Hamas was able again to take more hostages on Sunday, nearly two days into this surprise attack. All of this a reminder of just how difficult that military objective that Prime Minister Netanyahu has set of breaking Hamas' back. Take a look at how the very early stages of that operation is unfolding. My apologies, I thought we were -- we had video to play for you there. But again, the very early stages of this operation, we already see tens of thousands of people displaced inside Gaza. Now just from my own experience of being there, what happens is that many of those families then migrate to the city center to Gaza City. That means that that already very densely populated city becomes ever more crowded, meaning every single strike that you see has a greater potential of killing more and more civilians. There are more than 400 people killed according to the Palestinian health ministry with hundreds more wounded. And there is nowhere to turn, and that's what's important to remember about Gaza. It is a blockaded enclave -- blockaded by air, land and sea. There are severe travel restrictions, there is no sirens if bombs are going off. There are no bunkers for families to go into. It is essentially open air for those families. So while Hamas goes underground, according to reports, trying to save their own, entrenching itself ever deeper within the Gaza Strip. Those families, those 2 million people will have very few places to turn. HARRAK: Salma Abdelaziz reporting. Thank you very much for that update.

When you deploy a carrier group capable of putting some up to 90 fighter bombers into the air, it's a show of force that demonstrates very potent potential force.Now the reason it's being moved to that location is not just to reassure Israel, but to suggest to Israel's enemies, chief among them, I think the Iranians, that any kind of escalation beyond the borders from -- of Israel will could be met by, not just its own Israeli response, but an American response. You'll recall that President Biden yesterday wagged his finger and pointed, but didn't mention the name of any outside nation. But everybody knew what he was talking about, when he said that others should not take the opportunity of Hamas' infiltration of Israel and the atrocities there to try to attack Israel. Now, clearly, the biggest threat externally close to Israel comes from Hezbollah. Hezbollah is controlled largely from Tehran. It is an extremely dangerous force with a very, very large armory of rockets, capable of hitting targets throughout Israel. But Hezbollah also knows, because it has been told in no uncertain terms that if it were to attack Israel in a significant way, the whole of Lebanon would be very heavily bombarded by the Israelis. And that is something I think that the Lebanese know that they definitely can't afford, least of all at the moment when they're in such an appalling political, economic state.

Looks like last time the Israelis went in, it was extremely bloody, it's extremely complex environment to fight in. It's one of the most densely populated areas on Earth. About 2 million people live there. Very tight streets, very high, high rise buildings, poorly made many of them. A lot of them, of course, now very badly damaged by continuously Israeli airstrikes.They would use artillery in advance of advancing infantry. They would have armored vehicles, they were have tanks. But they're -- all of those armored vehicles are of very limited use in that very tightly packed area. And then you've got the very complicating issue of what Hamas claims to have at least 100 hostages taken from Israeli territory, and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad about 30. So if you've got 130 hostages there, that makes Israelis calculations that much more complicated. You'll recall that last time they did an invasion there, the Israelis had one soldier captured alive. He was five years later exchange for over 1,000 -- the release of over 1,000 Palestinians held in Israeli jails. And now there's 130 hostages there. So this is going to be extremely difficult. It's going to be difficult politically for the Israeli government not to go in on the ground and to enter it in negotiations with Hamas. But it's very difficult to see even if those negotiations are through backchannels, how else they are going to get their hostages out other than ultimately by negotiation. But I think we're certainly going to see a lot more violence unleashed inside the Gaza Strip over the next week or so for absolute sure.",

Some, though, without question have more sophisticated long range components that have been imported and supplied by Iran. It's largely funded, according to Israeli military intelligence by Iran, a lot of these rocket components.But they make them out of equipment that looks like drain pipes, some rocket fuel, and some homemade explosives. They're unsophisticated, unguided, inaccurate, but deadly if they hit and they can get through the Iron Dome. And of course, the more they make, the harder it is for the Iron Dome, defensive anti-missile missile systems that the Israelis use to a very, very significant effect. But if you fire enough into the air, some eventually get through. Two, for example, got through into, I think, it was Ashkelon, earlier on today when CNN was reporting from there. So in that context, the -- they can carry on making, I think, many thousands of these lower, more primitive missiles.
