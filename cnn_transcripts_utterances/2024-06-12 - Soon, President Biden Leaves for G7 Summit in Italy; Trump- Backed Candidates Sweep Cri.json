This is what the spiritual adviser and family friend of the -- or family friend had this to say about how this unfolded within the family. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REV. DR.

More of that over the course of this trip where the two again will reaffirm their support and also perhaps announcements on additional aid to Ukraine. Of course, the world leaders will also be discussing a range of other issues, given the situation in the Middle East, climate change, and artificial intelligence.

Now, this is somebody, a congresswoman, who was initially against Donald Trump after January 6th. She has done an about face. She was able to push back against outside money from Kevin McCarthy, the former House speaker, to win her primary. If you also look William Timmons as well from South Carolina, he was a moderate, well, I should have said, a conservative, but yet not conservative enough for the Freedom Caucus, they went out after him. Williams Timmons does pull out a win. He was also Trump endorsed. If you go out to Nevada, we saw Sam Brown. Now, this is a Purple Heart winner, got a last-minute endorsement from Donald Trump. He easily won out in Nevada. That's going to be a race that we are going to be watching for control of the United States Senate. And then if you go up to North Dakota, there were two or three up there in North Dakota where Donald Trump did very well. And, of course, this is very interesting, up in Maine, a NASCAR, former NASCAR driver, endorsed by Donald Trump, won the nomination to take on Jared Golden up in Maine.

And yet a source familiar with the talk says it was neither an acceptance of the ceasefire proposal or a rejection of it. Hamas offered some amendments, according to a source familiar with the discussions here. Israel has, however, categorized that as Hamas' rejection of the deal that Biden put forward. The question, where is this? Well, this has gotten caught up so many times in the details, and we're back at that spot right now, waiting to see if the details can be worked out to push this forward. Meanwhile, at the same time, the U.N. has released its most in depth investigation to this point of the beginning of the war from October 7th to the end of the last year, so, roughly, the first two and a half months. And in it, the U.N. says, both Israel and Palestinian militant groups, including Hamas have committed war crimes and violations of international humanitarian law. Amongst those, the U.N. says both Israel and militant groups committed acts of sexual violence, torture and the intentional targeting of civilians. To put forward this report and put it together, Israel did not cooperate, but the U.N. spoke with victims, witnesses, media reports, as well as open source investigations and information that they were able to verify as they looked at the first couple of months of the war. The part about Hamas and Palestinian militant groups, perhaps no surprise, that focuses on October 7th. And in it, they say Hamas and those groups intentionally targeted civilians, committed acts of murder and torture, outrages upon personal dignity, as well as taking hostages, including children. Israel, which is accused of a systemic and widespread targeting of civilians, rejected the report, calling it anti-Israel discrimination at the U.N. and saying it viewed October 7th through a Palestinian lens.

Now, the Fed -- there's almost no chance that the Fed lowers interest rates today. The big question is, what does it say about rates going forward? Previously, they were penciling in three interest rate cuts this year. That seems very unlikely, just looking at the calendar. So are they going to go to one cut, which would mean maybe no interest rate cuts before the election, or, two, that would be good news for the White House and borrowers who are dealing with really high cost of living and interest rates right now. And also, what does Jerome Powell say at the 2:30 presser today? How tough does he sound about inflation? How concerned is he? Is he preaching patients? Here's a look at the estimates for today's inflation report. 3.4 percent, that's the annual rate, that would signal no progress at all, well ahead of the pre-COVID rate. But the silver lining could be the month over month figure, 0.1 percent. That would be a good number. It would be driven by lower gas prices. And this would actually be the lowest month over month inflation figure we've seen since last fall. And I think when you look at the trend for inflation, it's clear that we're in a better place than two years ago. This inflation figure was about 9 percent two years ago, miles away from that. But it's also clear, Kate, that the progress has stalled and it needs to resume before interest rates go lower.",
