Which Founding Fathers appeared on the first U.S. postage stamps?Washington and Jefferson, Washington and Franklin, Adams and Franklin, or Washington and Adams? If you said George Washington and Benjamin Franklin, go ahead and put your hands up. The 5 cents stamp depicting Franklin and 10 cent depicting Washington became valid for use in the U.S. in the year 1847. We`ve got news in the world of snail mail. Stamp prices are set to rise, again. The U.S. Postal Service is bumping up the price of the first class forever stamp by a nickel. The cost is increasing from 68 cents to 73. If you`re thinking that`s a lot, you`re right. Since 2019, the cost has shot up by 36 percent. So if you paid a dollar to send something five years ago, you`d be paying $1.36 today. The Postal Service says this price hike is designed to get the post office on better financial footing. They added that the prices though remain among the most affordable in the world. The 5 cent increase doesn`t kick in until July and still requires regulatory approval. With today`s story getting a 10 out of 10, we`re shining some light on all the animals that were suddenly in the dark during Monday`s eclipse. They didn`t know what was going on. Our Ed Lavandera reports from the Dallas Zoo. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ED LAVANDERA, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It was like momentarily walking into the classic comedy \"Night at the Museum,\" a glimpse into the secret lives of animals at the Dallas Zoo when humans aren`t around to watch. Zebra started chasing him and then the ostriches got into the mix as well. Just as the zoo slipped into total darkness, a jolt of, well, animal energy seemed to shoot through the grounds. The moment mesmerized Lisa Van Slett, a curator of mammals at the Dallas Zoo. So did the total eclipse today meet your expectations?",

Just before total darkness, an ostrich laid an egg and hovered over it for a time, protecting it. Zoo officials say it`s not clear if the moment was caused by the eclipse, but that the timing was certainly curious, they said. Guinea fowl suddenly crowed wildly.",

Here and around the country, elephants grouped together and appeared to head back to the area where they sleep. Flamingos packed together in the middle of a pond in their habitat. Primates apparently also thought it was bedtime. Animal experts say the sudden darkness triggered a natural reaction among many of the animals.",

Another video captured a cat wanting to come inside its home when darkness struck. At the Toledo Zoo, a polar bear didn`t seem to care about all the fuss, nonchalantly dove into the water before the sun disappeared. Texas Parks and Wildlife officials teamed up with NASA to set up these acoustic recording devices to monitor the sounds of animals in the wild. But not all animals were flustered or impressed by the total eclipse. Tobogo (ph) the giraffe mostly walked around, unfazed, ready to start chewing on the lettuce the humans feed him when the sun came back. (END VIDEOTAPE) LAVANDERA (on camera): Because a total eclipse is so rare, there`s very little documentation, very few studies that have been done on animal behavior during a total eclipse. Because of that, zoo officials say they plan on sharing their observations and the data they gather, not just with other zoos that were in the path of this eclipse, but as well as with other zoos across the country.
