Tonight, Hollywood actors have joined writers on the picket lines for the first time in more than 60 years, setting the stage for what could be a long costly fight with the studios. These are live pictures out of New York where picket lines are formed outside NBC's headquarters, as well as outside CNN's parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery. And in Los Angeles, they are been marching outside Netflix and the major studio lots. Chloe Melas takes a look at what led to this historic walk off.

They say they're really fighting for the soul of their craft, and it really just has come under fire from these powerful forces from big tech and Wall Street.

      "sentences": "Yes, that's absolutely right. You know, years ago, when I was starting out as an actor, fifteen, twenty years ago now in Hollywood, I'llgive you a very interesting example. I was on a show called \"iCarly\" for many years that was on Nickelodeon. Fast forward 15 years, the show is back, it's now on a streamer. So let's think about the economics between the original \"iCarly\" versus the new \"iCarly\" or really any shows in the streaming era, both for actors and for writers. You know, residual pay was such a critical lever for income for these hardworking people that in between series, because it is kind of like gig work, you might do a 10-episode or 12-episode series, and then hope you get something else, you would be collecting residual pay. You know, that has really withered in the age of streaming. So that's one serious issue. Writers are also very worried about in this age of streaming, shorter seasons, you know, in this sort of cable network world, you might have 25 or 30 episodes for a season of a show. And now it might be 10. Think about it on the streamers that you and I watch. They are concerned about a topic called mini rooms, which is essentially a mechanism to control headcount of numbers of writers. So there will be fewer writers staffed on projects. Fewer writers, fewer jobs, fewer people collecting an income. I think the fundamental thing to think about here is 15 years ago was the last writer strike for a hundred days, and Netflix was like barely a whisper. It was a mail-order DVD service, nobody knew what Apple TV+ would turn out to be or Disney+ or Hulu, you know, these are all sort of inventions of the digital age. And the stakes have gotten so much higher from that strike to now for both sides. You know, the studios as well say that streaming has put a real pressure on their ability to turn a profit. So all sides trying to figure out this new landscape for economics here, but at the heart of it are performers and creators who say that they are Hollywood's longest running denizens, they've been there since the beginning, but they are somehow getting impacted the worst.",

      "sentences": "Yes, one of the things that the actors are fighting for, SAG- AFTRA and their union is fighting for is to prevent background actors. So these are the \"extras\" that you see in the background of scenes from havingtheir likeness scanned, and then replicated, so they might only be paid for one day of work as opposed to, you know, if you're shooting a scene in a movie, you might have to go back for several days as a background artist. So SAG is fighting to ensure that you know, this tool, this technology to sort of scan likenesses of people and minimize their number of working hours or working days is something that is struck out of the deal that they will eventually arrive at with the studios. So that's one mechanism that they can use. You know, in the case of writers, they can try and control things like an entire script be generated from a tool like, you know, ChatGPT, or one of these AI tools that is very powerful at writing original content. You know, they want to make sure that we don't live in a world where one of these tools could spit out a hundred-page movie, and then a studio could hire one writer and say, you know, fix this up, make a couple of edits. So these are the kinds of things that both unions are fighting for in their negotiations with the AMPTP, that's the acronym for the studios, the streamers, the networks, you know, this powerful trade association that represents them all. It is very tough to get a look inside what's going on behind closed doors, because the negotiations are so secret, but that's what we've learned through leaks and reporting and talking to sources.",

Even though you see the energy high behind us, people very motivated and excited for day one of the strike, it is still a very serious decision they had to make, she said. She was very disappointed with the incremental changes that she says the studios offered. She compared that to moving furniture on the Titanic, and a lot of the people here we've been talking to say that what she has talked about, really resonate with them when they discuss better compensation, residuals, and streaming and AI. Here is one actor we met on the picket line talking about a residual check that her brother got for a network show that he did as a child actor 30 years ago, compared to the check, she got for a streaming show. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BRITTANY GARMS, SAG-AFTRA MEMBER:   My brother was an actor. He has since retired, but in the 90s worked a lot and we sometimes get residuals, and he'll get checks from broadcast television shows that he did in 1995, that are worth more than residual checks from big corporations for films I did in 2020. And that is, I think, a big part of the reason why people are out here today. I understand that streaming is such an uncharted territory, but there has to be some sort of cap because they're making money. All of these millionaires are making money, but nobody else is seeing any of that money. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And he said, they -- well, they could fight under this commander. He's commanded them for 16 months. So, who is he? Andrey Troshev is -- I believe, 61 years old, had a storied career in the military. He's a retired colonel. Got a lot of awards, served in Afghanistan, served during the Chechen wars. And then also in Syria after he retired. He was with Wagner in Syria. And you have to say that he's no doubt very loyal to the Kremlin, and also seems like a pretty savvy guy who could keep the Wagner fighters in line for the Kremlin.",

These were good fighters but they got dragged into this. And so, I think what he's trying to say, again, preserve those fighters because they're useful to the Kremlin. And then somehow solve Prigozhin but it's making -- it's very schizophrenic. And it's been back and forth, and back and forth which undermines his image as a leader. And just the last thing that happened was we have video from the Belarusian Defense Minister showing Wagner fighters in Belarus training the territorial guards. So what does that mean? That was the original deal? Maybe some of them took it. It's all really continuing to be very confusing, and I think that really does undermine Putin in his image.",

With this mission, they're aiming to land the rover near the moon's unexplored South Pole. Officials say the lander is due to reach the moon on August the 23rd. After the landing, scientists plan to deploy the rover and to conduct scientific experiments including analyzing the chemistry of the lunar soil. Measuring the temperature of the lunar surface and scanning for moon quakes. On launch day, India's Prime Minister tweeted this. \"14th of July 2023 will always be etched in golden letters as far as India's space sector is concerned. Chandrayaan-3, our third lunar mission will embark on its journey. This remarkable mission will carry the hopes and dreams of our nation.\" Success would be huge for India.
