We are continuing our coverage of breaking news out of the Middle East where fighting is ongoing between Israel and Hamas two days after the militant group's large-scale surprise attack.The Israeli military says it has severely degraded the capabilities of Hamas as it keeps up strikes on Gaza. And on the ground, Israeli troops are still battling Hamas militants inside Israel. Overnight, Hamas also claiming to have launched a missile attack on the southern Israeli city of Ashkelon. Militants say 100 rockets were fired in response to Israeli defense forces targeting their safe houses. Israeli police say the rocket attack made a direct hit on an apartment building. This all comes as Hamas claims to now be holding more than 100 hostages in Gaza, including high-ranking Israeli officers. Inside Israel, the death toll from Hamas's attack has now climbed past 700. At least 260 were killed at a music festival. And we are getting new details and images from that day, and we want to warn our viewers, you may find this next video disturbing. Dashcam footage from one car shows militants shooting and killing people at point blank range before looting their belongings. The video has no audio, but sheds light on the terror that unfolded Saturday at the festival site near the Israel-Gaza border. So, we do want to go now to Israel to get a first-hand account of the fight against Hamas. Major Libby Weiss is a spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces. She joins us now from Tel Aviv. Appreciate you being with us. So, what is the latest you have on overnight airstrikes from both sides and of course fighting on the ground?",

But of course, in the region, there have been real calls for these tensions, for this violence to be de-escalated. We've heard from the Turkish government calling for an end to violence, but also saying that Turkey stands ready to support in any efforts to mediate some sort of peace deal, to mediate a de-escalation of those tensions. We know of course that Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, all key players in this conflict and they have been for decades now, all calling for an end to the violence, condemning the attacks that we've seen by Hamas and calling for tensions to be de-escalated. But we heard from the Saudi Foreign Ministry over the weekend highlighting that they, in their view, hold the international community and Israel partly responsible for their failure to uphold the rights and freedoms of the Palestinian people, which they see as a potential cause for this attack by Hamas.",

U.S. President Joe Biden has pledged his full support to Israel in the wake of the attacks.

I think that what Hamas is doing is much more related to what has happened in Israel over the last year and not to what happened 50 years ago.You have to remember that ever since the elections which were in November of '22, a new government was formed in December and in January they announced that they were going to begin to dismantle Israel's judicial branch. And ever since then Israelis have been protesting in the streets, the country has ripped itself apart, some of the reserve troops have not shown up, and this was a weakness, an internal weakness that was perceived by Hamas and you can leave it up to our neighbors to take advantage of the fact that we are internally divided over what our government can legitimately do or not do just because they have a slim majority in parliament and Hamas used that internal division much more than the 50th anniversary of the Yom Kippur War.",

And when this conflict ends, and it's not going to be a short one, we will have to ask ourselves what happened.And here, this is where I would agree with your earlier question, we will see parallels to the 50-year-old anniversary of the Yom Kippur War where we were caught completely by surprise, we had to retreat on multiple fronts. The difference between then and now is that we retreated largely in uninhabited areas, and now we are fighting inside of villages and Kibbutzim and Israeli cities even where Hamas has managed to infiltrate a thousand or so terrorists, who have killed almost a thousand Israelis, and these are just the unofficial numbers that we have. The numbers are likely to go much higher. So yes, this is going to have to be addressed.

And what we've learned is that while we show them calm, what they'redoing is that they are arming and preparing to attack our civilian population and butcher women and children. The fact that Hamas now holds, and again these are unofficial numbers, over a hundred Israeli hostages ranging from an 85-year-old woman to a two-year-old child shows that the government is incapable of doing what it really needs, which is to go after them. But this is going to be a long conflict and until we realize that these people's lives can be saved or not we might be forced into some sort of negotiation, rather than an all out confrontation with Hamas. And as you correctly stated, the most important thing right now is that the conflict not spill over onto other fronts. Hezbollah in the north is the most dangerous one. And I think this is why the United States is sending a carrier force, including some vessels that are capable of intercepting long range missiles because they want to send a message not to Hezbollah but to Iran that if they force Hezbollah to join this conflict, then this is a conflict that Iran itself will be held to blame and that they might be facing a Middle East that is now quite different where certain Arab nations are not condemning Israel and the United States that over the last year might have seemed to be at odds with Israel, but when it comes to butchering innocent civilians, the United States and Israel stand side by side.",
