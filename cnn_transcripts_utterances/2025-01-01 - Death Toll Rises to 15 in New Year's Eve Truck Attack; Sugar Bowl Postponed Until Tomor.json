The FBI later determined that those people had nothing to do with carrying out this attack. So, at least for that part of the investigation, that part is closed off.

Yes, the violence were not there, but the plan B was in place for them to block the street using the police vehicle, but he drove around onto a sidewalk where pedestrians are walking and then hit the gas and began to hit as many people as he could until he came to a crash and confronted police.And it shows how intensely he wanted to commit harm, how intensely he wanted to kill people, which I agree with Superintendent Kirkpatrick.

I know it sounds odd to say that, but ISIS has been very organized about telling attackers how to do what they need to do. Their manual of how to do a ramming attack, which appeared in their magazine Rumiyah Magazine, I think it was Issue 13, where they talk about get the largest vehicle you can. The larger the vehicle, the more people you'll be able to hit, the fewer places they'll have to run to get out of the way. Try to find a place where you can achieve a long enough run to get maximum speed.But among the other things they say, Wolf, is have a secondary weapon so that when you finally are stopped, whether you come to a stop or you crash, or police stop you, you are able to exit the video and continue your attack with knives or guns or IEDs, in this case, it seems like there might have been a combination of at least two of those, and achieve martyrdom for the cause. This is literally all built into the plan. So, what we're seeing yesterday, what we're hearing in that dramatic video, the number of shots being fired, what we saw in those terrible videos of the truck going down the street is really kind of literally out of the ISIS playbook. And who do they seek? They seek people who are in that hero to zero mode, where their life is failing and they kind of try to convert that with propaganda where they say, you'll go from loser to lion if you do it in our name.",

And I am sure now that they are going to create an ingress plan that does not allow any vehicles other than people who are authorized to come in. And those are going to be checked to come into that area.Everybody's right. In 2016, when this happened in Nice, the mayor of New Orleans said, I want to fortify this area and we then invested in those bollards to be put up there.

And what I worry about now, I mean, this particular attack could have been a copycat on that, or it could have been planned for much longer.You know, in 2010, ISIS at the time, or actually Al Qaeda at the time, put out a manual, basically an article to, to inspire these kinds of attacks, giving some tips to would-be terrorists about how to do this on their own. And now we're seeing it picked up. And so I do worry. And, you know, I hope that viewers are learning something from this and that extremists aren't, but that, you know, we all have to be careful when we're in these public places that are exposed to vehicle traffic, that have narrow kind of entry ways and are confined. So, you know, we do have to worry about those things.",

It's just the latest salvo in an ongoing dispute between the two actors that erupted during production of the movie, in which Baldoni plays Lively's on-screen abusive husband.The complaint filed by Baldoni in a total of ten plaintiffs, including his producing partners and publicist, states \"The Times\" relied almost entirely on Lively's unverified and self-serving narrative, lifting it nearly verbatim while disregarding an abundance of evidence. Lively's original complaint was filed with the California Civil Rights Department almost two weeks ago, and was first obtained by \"The New York Times\". It alleges Baldoni and his team tried to destroy Lively's reputation after she raised concerns about repeated sexual harassment and other disturbing behavior by Mr. Baldoni. \"The Times\" published their article December 21st, highlighting excerpts from the civil rights complaint, including text messages from a crisis PR manager for Baldoni that say, quote, we can bury anyone. \"The New York Times\" telling CNN they will, quote, vigorously defend against the lawsuit, saying our story was meticulously and responsibly reported. It was based on a review of thousands of pages of original documents, including the text messages and emails.",
