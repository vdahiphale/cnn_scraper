Now, this is a really poignant moment, it's the first time we've seen the Princess of Wales now for months since that shock diagnosis of cancer and while she's been undergoing treatment. Now, yesterday, the statement released by the Princess of Wales came as really quite a surprise, most people had assumed at this stage that she probably wouldn't be able to attend. So, a birthday surprise for the King, a surprise for the public certainly, and I think it will be a really wonderful moment each year, Trooping the Colour, the King's birthday parade is one of those events on the calendar where you see all of the royal family together on the balcony.

Those pictures there showing, showing Charlotte looking just so lovely, and Kate coming out in that wonderful dress, that white dress, it looks very 20s to me and it was so important that she was here. She's the Colonel-in-Chief of the Irish Guards who are trooping their colour today. She was very unhappy that she couldn't come to the rehearsal, so I think she's delighted to be here.

Now, Kate isn't telling us what kind of cancer she has, she may never do so, it's her private information, but she's telling us how she's feeling, that she feels tired, sometimes she has to rest and sometimes she feels well enough to go to school events with the children. And that, I think it's because she's been, as she said, she's had all these lovely letters, all these lovely cards and people have been sharing their stories with her, and she, and the King, I think, feel very strongly that they want to be a significant beacon of hope, really, for everyone in the world and there are so many people in the world cancer sufferers, cancer survivors, people who are caring for those with cancer. It's a disease that touches us all and I think as royal family members, it's a new role for the royal family, but leading through sickness and really showing us a beacon for hope and that photo that they gave out yesterday of her with the tree, it just said to me hope, positivity and Kate really is giving us this insight and I think it's so important and so moving. [07:10:29] WALKER: You know, a beacon of positivity also for her children. I mean, it struck me when I saw George, and Charlotte, and Louis step out of that carriage to see their mother back at her royal duties just for this, you know, short period of time.

That's not going to happen.And the message for China was, it is your support for Russia, either political and in terms of giving technology support, vital components, microchips and other sorts of things to Russia for its military industrial base which allows it to keep the war going. So, there was a very clear message on the Russia angle for China, but there was a very clear message as you say for Russia's trade practices which are undermining the economies, the workers, the security even of G7 nations, because they have such an influence when they overproduce on supply chains, and, and potentially controlling vital mineral assets around the world. All of these put pressure on, on G7 nations, so that was a very clear message for China there, but there was a message of support for developing nations there was a clear intent declared to, to find better governance for AI to put it to good use.

And in that event alone, he raised $26 million. And so, they see this as a very successful strategy to raise money. The second reason is Democratic strategists say that when celebrities attend these events it serves as an informal endorsement for Biden, them showing their support. In a way, they hope that, their campaign strategists hope that it would also court some voters to also show up for Biden in the upcoming election. And they say that that could serve as a pivotal role too. So, these campaign events, and these campaign fundraisers are very important for Biden for multiple reasons. Victor, Amara, back to you.",

And this was a rare regulation to result from a mass shooting in the United States, specifically the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, which left dozens of people dead and hundreds wounded.Friday's opinion fell along ideological lines with Justice Clarence Thomas writing the majority opinion saying, \"We hold that a semi- automatic rifle equipped with a bump stock is not a machine gun because it cannot fire more than one shot by a single function of the trigger, and even if it could, it would not do so automatically.\" The three liberal justices joined in a fiery dissent written by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who wrote, \"When I see a bird that walks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, I call that bird a duck. A bump stock equipped semi-automatic rifle, fires automatically more than one shot without manual reloading by a single function of the trigger. Because I, like Congress, call that a machine gun, I respectfully dissent.\" The ATF, which put forth this regulation, has released a statement calling on Congress for a legislative solution, but that seems very unlikely that they would actually be able to pass anything, especially in an election year.

And let me just say this to you very briefly.Let's just say, for example, that you had Congress say you cannot have race cars on highways because the intent being that they're dangerous and people would die. You then, Victor, have a normal car, not a race car, but there's a device in which you would install it for the motor. It would make it just as fast as a race car, just as dangerous as a race car. Guess what? Victor doesn't own a race car, he owns a normal car, but isn't the functionality the same? Isn't the intent to save people's lives the same? So, why then, because it's not called a race car, should Victor be able to drive a normal car, which does what a race car does on a highway? And so, that's what this is. The reality is that we can wax poetic about it's not a machine gun, but if it's doing the same thing and has the same functionality with respect to a machine gun, that's exactly what it is.

Because what in essence they're doing, that is the Supreme Court, is saying that listen, again, ATF, right, it's really a case about what federal entities can do. And what the Supreme Court is doing is saying you ATF do not have the lawful authority to make a distinction and determination as to what a machine gun is in this definition.No matter what it does, that is the bump stock, to facilitate the rapid fire of weapons. That's a function of Congress. You don't. ATF, have that authority. We're not going to give you that authority. And the minority against Sotomayor is saying, but what are you talking about? The effect of this bump stock is making weapons more dangerous. It's taking lives. It's putting bullets out there more rapidly. Don't tell me about the functionality of the gun itself. Talk to me about how humans use the gun. And if the bump stock allows for the gun to be facilitated in rapid fire succession, is that not a machine gun? So, I would argue to your point, Victor, that anything and everything that is not specifically within the definition of machine gun is subject for fair game. And so, at the end of the day, everything has a context. And if the context is danger, the context is rapid fire, the context is the reason Congress did it is to make it, right, is to make it more safe, then hey, they should have interpreted that way.

So, we might as well just move it to November. But even though we've had this awful weather, this ceremony that, as you were saying, dates back to George III, 1760, the idea that we celebrate the monarch's birthday, with the Household Cavalry, the household regiments trooping their colour to date, the Irish guards, the guards of which Kate is colonel in chief, that the crowds were so happy and delighted.

There is a 41-gun salute from Green Park, taking place right now by the king's war horse troop cavalry.So, you can hear those taking off. There'll be five -- well, 41, it's going to take a while. And then, we will see members of the royal family, senior members of the royal family gathering on that balcony, for that famous balcony shot. And you're looking now at pictures of the public starting to jostle into position, because this area outside Buckingham Palace was closed off for the procession -- for the Royal procession down the mound. Now, it is open. So, they are able to get right up to the Gates of Buckingham Palace. And for royal fans, they come here, hours and hours before all this kicks off. They have been here pre-dawn, the weather, as you can probably see hasn't been great. There has been thunder, there has been kind of slightly biblical rain, so, there drenched at this stage. But it does appear to be cheering up ever so slightly. The balcony scene is really important to this whole ceremony. This is the moment where you see the members of the royal family together as a unit. And I think as you compare year to year, who's on that balcony, really tells a story of the evolution of the royal family. With Queen Elizabeth II, it was often quite a large crowd on that balcony, you would see up to 40 or actually I think, more than 40 in 2016, people are gathering. This is a slim down monarchy. Of course, it's Prince Harry and the Duchess of Sussex also left the fold of the royal family, they are not going to be there, so, it's slimmed down even more, which is why it is so fantastic for the royal family, for the princess of Wales is able to attend today. I hope you are enjoying the booming sound of the 41-gun salute, which is actually quite easy to mistake for thunder today.",

So, we're used to being down by Green Park, down by Buckingham Palace, being a bit wet. And it was just beautiful this morning. All the flags out, all the cheering crowds. And I think many of them had long planned to come anyway. But the news we got last night that Kate was going to come when I think many of us thought that she wouldn't perhaps be up to it. That was a really wonderful boost. And the king said he was delighted to see her, and the crowds were absolutely thrilled. And that moment when we see the royal family, we're just looking at the balcony here. It's empty, but it's all ready for them. The moment when we see the royal family out on the balcony, watching the really fantastic RAF flypast, the -- this amazing flypast done by the Royal Air Force, that will be such that will be -- that will be on the photo, on the front page of every newspaper tomorrow.

But to see Kate there, I mean, the crowds were there for the king, the crowds were there for Kate, she is a royal superstar. And people have been very worried about her, because it's clear that as she said in her statement, it's been tough good days and bad days. She is not out of the woods yet. Today is not a return to work. It should not be seen as such -- we probably maybe won't see her until the autumn or perhaps even early next year going back to full time royal duties. So, everyone I was speaking to, there were some real royal fans. There were some tourists, there were visitors, they were all families, there were all these children, and they were all saying, you know, how happy they are to see the king, to see Princess Kate. And just -- it feels like the royal family are getting back to normal. That's what someone said to me. We were like they are getting back to normal. And so many people in the world, they are touched by cancer. And to have two members of the royal family being so open about it. There were people in the crowd, who were saying to me, no, I've been through chemotherapy, and it's so important and moving to me to see Kate talking about it and honestly say how tough it can be.",
