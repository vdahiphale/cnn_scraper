I am Kate Bolduan, right now inside the room where Republicans will soon be getting the party started once again today. Last night, they celebrated the return of Donald Trump and his newly minted running mate, the senator from Ohio, JD Vance. Vance will be giving his big speech tomorrow night. Overnight, though, he posted a new reaction during one of his first appeals to voters as Trump's running mate. Vance sharing this. I'll read it for you. \"What an honor it is to be running alongside Donald Trump. He delivered peace and prosperity once. With your help, he'll do it again.\" Ending it with, \"onward to victory.\" Emotions were high in this room as Trump walked into the hall last night. The moment marking his first appearance since he was nearly assassinated on Saturday. Today, the RNC's theme shifts to focus on security and crime. CNN's Alayna Treene leads us off this hour. You have some new reporting, Alayna, this morning on the decision behind selecting Vance - JD Vance as his running mate. What are you learning?",

And many people close to both Vance and new Trump had said, out of all the top contenders that Donald Trump was considering, the two of them had the best personal relationships. So, that's part of it.The other part is that Donald Trump and the Trump campaign itself actually believe that Vance will be - will appeal very well with some of the rust belt working class voters that they think they need to win over to win the election. Vance actually addressed this in an interview with Fox News where he was discussing a phone call or the phone - the phone call, I should say, he received when Donald Trump informed him that he was being chosen as his running mate. Take a listen to what Vance said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. JD VANCE (R-OH), VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He just said, look, I think we've got to go save this country. I think you're the guy who could help me in the - and in the best way. You can help me govern. You can help me win. You can help me in some of these midwestern states, like Pennsylvania, Michigan and so forth. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Even though he's very young, he thinks that JD Vance has done a lot with his career thus far.I'm also told that he believes that JD Vance will be one of the more loyal vice presidential picks. And we know, especially after Donald Trump's treatment of his former vice president, Mike Pence, loyalty has been a top quality that he had been looking for. Now, I also can tell you that Trump had been receiving a series of phone calls from top allies and influential conservatives up until Monday morning, right before he actually had finally made that decision to choose Vance. One person in particular, Elon Musk, Tesla billionaire, had called Donald Trump on Sunday, just hours before he ultimately made his pick. And Musk, I'm told, had urged Donald Trump to go with Vance. Other notable names include Donald Trump Junior, Tucker Carlson, Steve Bannon, a number of Republicans in Congress. All of them kind of lining up and in the final hours telling Trump that they think Vance - they thought Vance was the best choice. Kate.",

Instead, he goes to the other side of the planet, the other side of the galaxy, and gets the most radical pick that he can find.Trump, at least, is more of an instinctive kind of intuitive nationalists. This is an ideological nationalism. That's, I think, a much more dangerous form of the virus because he can go try and explain this stuff and recruit all these people and make it seem kind of polished and make it seem like it's great. I just think that JD Vance had the potential to be one of the great unifiers of this country. His first book, you know, the way that he was - showed up at first when he was on our air, trying to build bridges, trying to show how people could come together. He then did a hard turn and he's gone from being a bridge builder to being a barn burner. His positions on women are so extreme. His statements about women are so extreme.

Listen, we've seen it ourselves with a lot of videos that have been coming out since Saturday evening. We've also heard it from eyewitnesses. But our teams sync up all of that witness video and detailed, as you said, that there was at least a minute and 57 second gap between when people in the crowd, and from different parts of the crowd, I should say, at that Trump rally realized that someone was on top of that roof. And then that distance between when he actually opened fire. So, I encourage viewers to take a look at that online because it really does paint a picture of not only how quickly this happened, but also how many people were noticing something was wrong before, of course, this tragedy struck.But, Sara, I want to detail also what you were talking about that we are learning new information about some of the movements of this shooter prior to that ultimate shooting. We're talking, of course, about Thomas Matthew Crooks, the 20-year-old from Bethel Park, Pennsylvania. We now know that on Friday evening he went to his sportsman club that he belonged to. He went to the rifle range there to practice. Then we also know on Saturday morning he went to a Home Depot and he purchased a ladder. Then shortly thereafter he went to a local gun store and purchased, as we understand it from law enforcement sources, 50 rounds of ammunition. He then drove to Butler. And once he was on site here at the rally, we do understand that local law enforcement did note him. They noted that he was acting suspicious around the metal detector area. But then, far as we understand, he was not noticed again until he ultimately was perched on that roof and opened fire at former President Donald Trump. But against, Sara, the big question that we still don't have an answer to right now is that question of motive. The FBI saying yesterday they still have not found a motive. And that's after interviewing witnesses, law enforcement agents, friends, family, and even being able to crack into his phone. Still, no evidence that there was any strong ideological motivation that would have led him up to that roof on Saturday evening. Sara.",
