General Assembly. The five Americans released from Iran are now safely back on U.S. soil. And later in the show, a first look inside the Wagner heartland in Africa following the death of Yevgeny Prigozin. Don't give up on Ukraine, that was the U.S. president's message on the world stage. You heard Joe Biden speak just moments ago making the case that if Russia wins, the territorial integrity of no country is safe. Mr. Biden called this an inflection point in history. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  If we allow Ukraine to be carved up, is the independence of any nation secure? I respectfully suggest the answer is no. We have to stand up to this aggression today and deter other would be aggressors tomorrow. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I want to start with you, Richard, because the U.S. president we just heard from speaking to the U.N. General Assembly last hour. Speak about his understanding, to be a leader for good in the world, about working together, using democracy as the best tool to meet the challenges of the world. And, of course, he covered a myriad of issues, including the war in Ukraine, but what were the key takeaways overall of what he spoke about today? RICHARD ROTH, CNN SENIOR U.N. CORRESPONDENT:  Well, not unexpectedly ending the speech with about ten minutes on Ukraine, the country has been invaded by a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council and there is just a limit on how much the U.N. itself can do. It is a bedrock U.N. Charter was not set up for one country to invade its neighbor. Yes, we know about Iraq and Kuwait but this involves a country with veto power on the Security Council. And that body has had over 71 meetings since the war began on Ukraine. The other issues, he talked about China. Mr. Biden saying we're not, in effect, going after them. We want them with us, but he keeps having to respond to Chinese aggressive actions in different places. Lynda?",

That goes for the offensive that are taking part in the south of the country, in the east of the country, but, of course, a lot of those rocket strikes that we are seeing on a pretty much daily basis as well. In this case it was actually a drone strike that took place in the western city of Lviv, so pretty much away from the frontlines and pretty much in the rear echelon, if you will, pretty close to the borders of NATO, though, NATO's eastern flank, if you will. What the Ukrainians were saying that these were 18 drones that were launched towards Lviv. They say that they managed to down 15 of them, a lot of them or most of them actually in the area of Lviv. So, they had already flown across large territories of Ukraine. One person was killed and there was some pretty dramatic footage that came out of those warehouses on fire. The mayor of Lviv later in front of those warehouses giving you a statement as well. They say that it was mostly humanitarian aid and humanitarian vehicles that were destroyed. They also say it is going to take you awhile obviously for them to sort of take stock and see how bad the damage really was. But it certainly shows that as the U.N. meets and as this important global body speaks about the ongoing war in Ukraine, the war itself is going on at a very deadly pace and at a very high pace as well, Lynda.",

If you do that, those people probably aren't going to get out. Or do you take a political hit, which is what Biden is taking from all these Republican presidential candidates and go ahead and do a deal which, by definition, with a U.S. enemy, will be pretty unsatisfactory in many ways.

And with, what, nearly three years in to the Biden presidency, there are big concerns outside of that in terms of security, tensions between U.S. and Iranian ships in the gulf. There was one occasion when President Barack Obama back in 2013, I believe it was, actually called up the Iranian president, Rouhani, at that point, when he was leaving the U.N. and going back to the airport in New York. I don't think that the conditions between the two countries are anything like they were then. So, I doubt there is very much hope of a meeting at all. And, indeed, I think you would have to question whether either of the current Iranian president or the current U.S. president, President Biden, have the political cover back home in their own political situations to meet each other. That would be a huge consideration as well. Biden is getting a lot of stink from the Republicans on issuing a visa to allow the Iranian delegation to actually come to the U.N.

What kind of event is that? And we found that without climate change, it would have been even more extreme and because the only difference between these two worlds of possible extreme rainfall is climate change. We can then say that climate change made this event up to 50 times more likely.
