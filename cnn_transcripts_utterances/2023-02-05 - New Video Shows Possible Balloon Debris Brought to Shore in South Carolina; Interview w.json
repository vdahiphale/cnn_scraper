This video was shot by a South Carolina resident just coming in this evening. This resident told CNN he saw a Navy boat carrying what he believed to be debris from the balloon. CNN cannot independently confirm whether this is indeed debris from that balloon. But we are reaching out to the U.S. Navy for comment. In the meantime, this comes at the same time we're learning new details about when the Pentagon learned about the balloon and when the president was informed about it. More on that in just a moment. But I want to begin in CNN's Carlos Suarez in north Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, and the focus of these recovery efforts. Carlos, what are you seeing there right now? What more can you tell us about this video that we're seeing coming in to CNN that appears show possible remnants of that spy balloon?",

The members of the Navy did not want to tell us exactly what they were doing out here. But this is the dock where we believe that some possible debris was spotted here earlier today. Important to note, as you mentioned, CNN has not been able to confirm the details with the U.S. Navy.We have reached out to see whether or not what they found out here is, in fact, related to what's left of that balloon that is off the coast of South Carolina. A CNN viewer provided us video that shows some sort of white material on the deck of a boat. All of this is taking place about a half hour north of where we were earlier today in Myrtle Beach. Now off the coast there, about 10 to 15 miles to the east of there is where we spotted what we believe to be a Navy vessel. That is the area in question where we believe all of this debris lies in some shallow water. Again, we have not been able to confirm whether or not that piece of video is in fact the debris tied to this suspected Chinese spy balloon. We are waiting to hear back. But locally, we have been told by authorities that they spent the entire weekend reminding folks that live in this part of South Carolina, if they come across anything that they might believe is debris to leave it alone. Don't pick it up. Don't take photos with it. And of course, do not take it home, because right now they are saying that all of that is tied to a federal investigation. Now authorities, they expect to get some of this debris on to a military vessel in the coming days. They do not expect this to play out for several weeks or several months. We are told once that process is done, they're going to go ahead and take all of that debris from here in South Carolina up to Virginia -- Jim.",

You know, as Alex was just mentioning a few moments ago, there's word tonight from Congressman Waltz, one of your colleagues there in the House, that Congress was briefed about earlier spy balloon flights near Texas and Florida during the Trump administration. We talked to Congressman Joaquin Castro in the 6:00 hour of this program earlier this evening. He had not heard about this. Is this something that you were aware of? REP. RO KHANNA (D-CA): Jim, I was not. But I think the important thing here is that President Biden acted decisively and wisely. We shot down the balloon, thanks to our great military. But the president made sure that no American would get hurt. No American town would get hurt. And that we'd actually be able to collect the debris when it's over water to make sure we understand what China is doing.

David, I guess it's no surprise that we might see some sort of resolution from the Republicans criticizing the president for this. The Pentagon, though, urged the president to wait to shoot down the balloon until it was over water, we're told. Not only safer for the people on the ground but more likely to preserve data and devices. What do you think? Was that the right call?",

In this case the Chinese just have been much more brazen. They have been frankly very stupid about it. And they've damaged U.S.-China relations, and you know, people are going to be up in arms for this.It also has some repercussions for the president's State of the Union on Tuesday. I do think that they made the wise decision ultimately about not shooting it down while the balloon was over the U.S. territory because there was apparently very little intelligence to be gained if you just leave it up there. But if you shoot it down, you do so in a way that could cause harm to American citizens. You know, things could be falling from the sky. This structure, this balloon structure with all sorts of equipment, you know, was the size of three buses. So it was a big thing to fall out of the sky like that. I do think that, Jim, they could have told the country sooner. They could have alerted people. We could have had this conversation starting several days ago. It looks like, you know, we saved it up in such a way that I don't think particularly helping, gave Republicans more of a handle to go after the Democrats on this.

I think that President Biden should have gotten in front of it and told the American people exactly why we were not going to shoot it down until it reached the ocean.But I do think overall we did it the right way as a country. You don't want to harm any citizens. You don't want to harm any structures. It's my understanding that we had some technology that was blocking them from getting a lot of the intel that they were maybe trying to get. And again, as David said, once it was over the ocean, there was a team there. The coordination I know for a fact had to be huge. There was a team there to shoot it down and ready to grab it.

Living large, it looks like. DARREN FOSTER, DIRECTOR, \"AMERICAN PAIN\": Well, thank you for having me. Yes, in 2009 I started reporting on the opioid crisis. And I started reporting about these pain clinics in Florida that were handing out, you know, oxycodone like they were Tic-Tacs. And the most famous at the time and the most prolific dispenser of these drugs was American Pain. So I went to American Pain to film it for a documentary I was working on at the time, and I got one shot off. And the next thing I knew, I was surrounded by some pretty big dudes. And they chased me and my production crew down I-95. The police eventually broke us up.
