The report makes 11 recommendations, including one aimed squarely at Trump. It says anyone who incites an insurrection should be disqualified and barred from holding public office. The report also urges Congress to codify that no vice president or other official can ever overthrow electors chosen by individual states. That's exactly what Trump wanted his vice president, Mike Pence, to do. Let's bring in CNN justice correspondent Jessica Schneider, live in Washington at this late hour. There is so much in this report, but what is the big takeaway?",

In fact, what the committee has made clear is that it was the final step in a multi-pronged, multi-month effort to overturn the election that ultimately enlisted collaboration from a large number of other Republican elected officials, both in Congress, and especially in the states. It is true that none of this would have happened without Donald Trump, as the committee says. But the other clause that you read is also important. It could -- he could not have done this alone.

Look, you know, what the committee did, clearly, was make an unbelievably comprehensive case that Donald Trump violated his oath of office, and in fact, may have violated the law, as well.And in particular, in that early chapter on the big lie, chapter two, they show over and again how he was told clearly and unequivocally -- not only by the Justice Department, but by his own campaign -- that what he was saying about the election wasn't true, that there was not the evidence of fraud; for example, with Dominion Voter Systems. And later, the report makes very clear that the plan that he urged on Mike Pence to simply ignore the results, he was told that that violated the Electoral Count Act. He knew that at the time that he did this. That's obviously very important from a legal point of view. If there's any criticism of this report, is that it zooms in so tightly on Trump and his circle, and their culpability that is sort of crops out the picture those other Republicans in the states, and in Congress. For example, in its dealing with the fake electors, it really bends over backwards to argue that they were, in effect, duped, in many cases, by the Trump campaign, and the Trump White House. Obviously, there are investigations going on in the states, and through the special counsel about whether that is, in fact, the case.",

And obviously, there were many local officials, predominantly Republicans in these states, who resisted that pressure from Trump. There were others who went along with it and participated in the fake electors scheme. One thing that really struck me was a memo from a White House officialthat I had not seen previously disclosed, that was included in the final report, in which this official argues that they don't even need evidence of fraud for state legislatures to overturn the votes in their states, and instead, award the Electoral College votes to Donald Trump. That the threat of socialism from Joe Biden -- Joe Biden -- was sufficient to justify overturning the vote of the people in their state. And that really goes to this larger question, because this is the argument that so much of conservative media, that Trump, indeed other Republican elected officials had been feeding their base for years, that any Democratic win would so transform and deform the country, would uproot it from what it has been for over two centuries, that essentially, any means necessary are justified to prevent that. You know, it's been summarized as the Flight 93 argument. And the question, I think, the big question that the committee -- one question they did not grapple with is, even if you deal with Trump, even if you politically marginalize him or indict and convict him, is that virus contained inside of the broader conservative movement? And certainly, in the -- among the extremist groups that they -- that they explore here in this -- in the summary (ph).",

One -- someone who works at one of the groups that study democracy, they pointed out that in the past, in episodes like this, there's been an elite reaction that says we should not look back. We can't have one administration judge the actions of a previous administration's as criminal. That was the argument Gerald Ford used when he pardoned Richard Nixon. It was the argument Barack Obama used in 2009 when he chose not to prosecute torture under the Bush administration. We're not hearing that argument.

It's in Fahrenheit, by the way. That's nine below in Pierre. North Platte, seven below. Five below in St. Louis. It's all moving in on the Ohio Valley. But here's the kicker. You factor in the winds. So the \"feels like\" temperature is what's important here. So even though it's 11 below -- that's the actual temperature in Minneapolis -- it feels like 33 below. So we're talking about the wind-chill alerts. We have wind-chill warnings from Montana all the way down into Texas, back on through the mid-Atlantic. And wind-chill advisories all across the Deep South and up parts of the Eastern Seaboard, as this whole cold front presses eastwards. Now, behind it, it gets windy. And we can factor in that wind. And of course, that arctic blast feels much colder. So we have wind alerts, wind advisories from Texas, up the Eastern Seaboard into New England, and high-wind warnings for parts of New England down into parts of the Appalachian mountains. And that's where we get wind gusts over 60 miles per hour. Factor that in with temperatures that are already below zero, it feels like 35 to 45 below. And when that happens, you get -- you get frostbite rather, within about 5 to 10 minutes. So it doesn't take much. My best advice to you is stay indoors and avoid it altogether if you can. [00:15:07] Here's your forecast for wind chills. Minneapolis expected to feel like 29 below on Friday; 34 below in Chicago, and there's the snow. To put everything together, that area of low pressure brings in snowfall through the Ohio Valley, up into the Great Lakes. Some of the heaviest snowfall now and especially across the Great Lakes as that cold air works its way over the warmer waters of the Great Lakes, and we get that lake-enhanced. And we factor in the winds with the snow that may not be falling all that hard, but it continues to cause whiteout conditions.

More than half of the population, about 170 million people, are under some kind of winter watch or warning. States of emergency have been declared by a number of governors, now bracing for a once-in-a- generation storm.CNN's Omar Jimenez reports from Chicago, where it's now minus four Fahrenheit, minus 20 Celsius. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) OMAR JIMENEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It's not just snow. It's wind and cold as part of a huge winter system descending onto the U.S. just days before Christmas. Over this week, more than 80 percent of the country's population will see at or below freezing temperatures. Some places, way below, like Denver, where the temperature dropped nearly 40 degrees in just an hour, hitting negative 15 by Thursday morning. Or, Wyoming, where a state trooper took this video, zero visibility, and temperatures 60 degrees below zero. Elsewhere, parts of the Midwest are doing what they can to keep up.",

MAYOR BYRON BROWN (I), BUFFALO, NEW YORK: Some meteorologists are calling this a once-in-a-generation event. JIMENEZ (voice-over): Even Atlanta is forecast to have wind chill in the negatives Friday. GOV. BRIAN KEMP (R), GEORGIA: Communities across the state are about the same temperatures that they haven't experienced in a decade or more. JIMENEZ (voice-over): The message is the same, even for places used to dealing with bad winters. It's the combination of snow, wind gusts up to 50 miles per hour, and the demand to get home for Christmas that could mean disaster, especially on the roads, where AAA estimates the majority of those traveling this holiday week will be driving.",

That, again, officials fear could reduce visibility significantly,especially on the roads that people might be taking to try and get home for Christmas. Omar Jimenez, CNN, Chicago. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The vaccines are unfortunately not that effective. So there will be a lot of deaths. And that's why we get to that 1 million figure or higher, even. And then as you're getting at, there's even implications outside of China, because this is, of course, a way for the variants to be nurtured.

But the point, I guess, to add to what you just made, John, is that there are a lot of immunocompromised people in China, as -- as in the rest of the world. And when an infection occurs in one of those individuals, it can go through an accelerated mutation, an evolution, within that person's body. Then that person could infect another.And that's basically how we think Omicron got started in Africa, over a year ago. So that's the kind of thing that we're particularly concerned about: getting a whole new family of variants beyond Omicron, like a Greek letter Pi, or Sigma, or something like that.",

But the problem was, coming out of the zero-COVID policy, which was necessitated because of these highly-contagious Omicron variants, and the readiness just wasn't there. They didn't have the vaccinations at the level that they should have, or the potent vaccinations. They're just now getting, potentially, some Paxlovid as a backup for people when they do get sick, to prevent deaths and hospitalizations. But they just haven't been prepared. They've been unwilling to import potent vaccines that are more effective against these variants. So it's just a case of just very poor preparedness, unfortunately.",
