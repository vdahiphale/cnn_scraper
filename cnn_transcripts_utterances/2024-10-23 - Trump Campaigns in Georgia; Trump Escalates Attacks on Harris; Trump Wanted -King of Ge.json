In Georgia, almost 2 million ballots have been cast. It's about a quarter of the total number of people who voted in that state in 2020, but compared to the same point, in 2020, early turnout is lower in 36 states this year and higher in one state. And in four battleground states that report party breakdown, more registered Republicans and fewer Democrats are voting early compared to last presidential election, at least that's so far.Today, Former President Donald Trump heads to Georgia. His 11th visit to the battleground state this election season. During a campaign event yesterday, Trump escalated his personal attacks against Vice President Kamala Harris, calling her, quote, \"lazy as hell.\" Steve Contorno joins us now, covering the Trump campaign. Steve, what else is Trump saying? What else might he say today?",

We saw him make similar attacks against Harris -- excuse me, Hillary Clinton in 2016, clearly similarly against Joe Biden just a few months ago while he was still his opponent. And now, we are seeing him leaning into this once again, Jim.",

It's a word that I was very hesitant to use for a long time because, as you know, I taught politics for many years before I became a writer and, you know, the word fascist has a pretty scalding meaning but there comes a time when Trump's behavior, when the shoe finally -- when the boot finally fits. And when you're hearing people like Milley and General Kelly and others use that word, people need to pay attention to it.And I think that's part of the problem is that people really don't pay attention to it. They've become desensitized and kind of numb to it. And they think it's just part of the give and take of politics. And I think they just don't realize what deadly serious business this is and how dangerous Trump really has become. Even if they hear it from people that worked side by side, even if they heard from a four-star general who worked side by side with Trump every day, they still just kind of shrug it off as, you know, just another episode of reality TV, unfortunately.",

I was asking Congressman Castro about this earlier on, if Trump gets back into the White House, are there enough checks and balances in place to protect democracy if Trump gets in there and behaves like a fascist dictator? He has said that he would be a dictator on day one. You have generals saying he is fascist. Are the checks and balances strong enough? Will they hold?",

And what do you make -- I wonder if you think that Trump is sort of -- for all of his deception and his lies and so on, whether he is being fairly candid with the American people heading into this election by talking about immigrants being poisoning the blood of this country by talking about going after his enemies, by talking about going after the media? He is quite openly saying it. It seems and leveling with the American people as to what kind of president he would be.",

      "sentences": "Yes, there are two things. One is that Trump lies fluidly. But when he talks about immigrants, when he talks about the things he wants to do when he gets into office, he's not kidding. These are moments where -- you know where the truth sort of bumbles out of him because he can't help himself. And of course, his advisers are all freaking out and saying, oh, you know, he didn't mean that.You've seen -- you've interviewed people who have said no, no, he doesn't really mean that, he meant something else. And of course, Trump can't help himself. He says no, no, that's exactly what I meant. But as for your question about trying to use the military, yes, he's going to try to use the military. Now, the good news is that the men and women of the United States armed forces are patriots and they understand their constitutional duty. But as I wrote some months ago in the magazine, Trump doesn't need the entire military on his side. He needs a handful of unprincipled people at very senior ranks who will then issue orders that will at least initially seem like legal orders and then they'll count on the chain of command. So, you know, I have no doubt that the military would refuse blatantly illegal orders, but a handful of people carefully washing Trump's orders so that they are something palatable to at least a handful of people in the Defense Department is going to happen and he's going to provoke a civil military crisis at some point in those four years.",

Vice President Kamala Harris will take the stage later tonight for a CNN town hall in Pennsylvania. She's likely to face questions on a key issue, of course, the economy.A recent analysis of both candidates' tax plans shows that under Harris, lower income taxpayers could see their average income rise by more than $2,000, while those making more than $592,000 would see their income drop by about $900. Compare that to Donald Trump's proposed plan, where those same higher earners would see their incomes rise by more than $20,000. Lower earners would get a few hundred dollars more. Joining me now to help break down all this is Justin Wolfers. He's a professor of economics and public policy at the University of Michigan. Justin, your thoughts, when you look at these two plans, is that the kind of breakdown that you're observing? What are your thoughts?",

And then, how this impacts your viewers.Let's start with the first one, Jim. You know, you could call the Harris campaign somewhat irresponsible. You could say that because the independent scorekeepers say that it's going to run up maybe a trillion dollars in debt over the next decade. A few election cycles ago, we would have said that was a lot. Well, they've also scored Trump is four or five times larger. It's just a promise of Palooza. No sense of where the money's coming from. It's like going to the Oprah show. And if you work overtime, you get a tax cut. And if you get Social Security, you get a tax cut. And it turns out every viewer gets a tax cut, but at the end of the day, we're going to have a ballooning government debt as a result.",

The cost of food has come down, we should note, after skyrocketing in 2022. Mortgage rates are still up almost 3 percentage points from where they were.How do these conditions impact how voters see these proposals? And I guess, how did the -- how did -- how does Trump's tariff plan play into all of this, too? If folks are concerned about the high price of things, the tariff plan from Donald Trump may have a big impact on that.",
