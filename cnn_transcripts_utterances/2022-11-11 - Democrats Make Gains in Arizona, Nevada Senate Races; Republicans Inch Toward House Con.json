Republicans are going to lay it on Joe Biden and his associates focusing on everything from Hunter Biden's laptop to COVID-19, to charges of a politically motivated Justice Department to even withdrawal from Afghanistan.

Kevin, there's going to be, you know, all eyes really on the U.S. President because it's one of the biggest emitters, of course United States.

And remember, it was only a year ago that the president arrived to last year's climate summit in Scotland just as his climate provisions were all falling apart in Congress. So, the difference a year has made is significant, the president has $370 billion included in a domestic spending bill that goes towards combatting climate change. That's the largest investment in American history.And so, the president when he speaks later today will try and use that as leverage to try to convince other leaders to make similarly ambitious pledges to spend money in their countries to combat climate change. He'll talk about some new proposed rules about government contractors cutting carbon emissions, some new methane rules. What the White House says is that the president will call on leaders to keep their eye on the ball, stay focused. But there is a dilemma here that a lot of other foreign leaders are focused on something else at this summit which is the issue of climate reparations. Essentially, they are calling on wealthy nations like the United States, one of the top emitters, to pay up on the damage that's being done in some of these low income countries when it comes to floods, fires, other extreme events that are due to climate change. Now that is not really politically feasible even before the midterm elections. If Republicans do take control of one or more chambers of Congress, this is really the last major piece of climate legislation. We would expect that to happen in the next two years. And we did see the House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, she is also here in Sharm el-Sheikh. Speaking yesterday she said when that it comes to climate change, many Republicans still believe that it's a hoax. And we will hear more from her later today. And so, that really is kind of the dilemma that the president is confronting as he embarks on this around-the-world trip. Of course, his message on all of these trips is that America is back. It's resuming its commitments. Certainly, the biggest threat to that is President Trump and it does appear to be politically weakened right now. But on the other hand, if Republicans take control of the Senate, much of the president's agenda would be installed. If so, that is kind of the dynamic. The president's aides say heading into the trip with the wind at his back. They say he feels confident heading into this around-the-world trip. But certainly, that dynamic will be at play while he's on ground here for a few hours in Egypt -- Max and Bianca.",
