Until now, things have been moving relatively quickly, they did make some backwards progress today, two of the seven jurors who had previously been seated have now been dismissed by the judge. One of them said she felt intimidated by the potential of her identity being made public after parts of her identity were reported. As it stands, five jurors are now seated, seven more are needed as well as six alternates. The court is on a lunch break right now, it is expected to pick up again in about 15 minutes.

And so, the judge allowing this juror to be excused from the case, bringing our number to six jurors at that point. And then another juror, juror number four, formerly known as juror number four, was called back into the courthouse, met with the judge and spoke with attorneys on both sides for a considerable amount of time. This juror was called back because prosecutors had uncovered some information as they were doing their due diligence since seating the jurors on Tuesday, that suggested that this juror may not have been completely honest or forthcoming in some of those responses, specifically, there were some information that indicated this juror may have been arrested in the '90s for tearing down political advertisements. And there's also some information that somebody with the same name as this juror had a wife who was involved in a corruption inquiry and had reached a deferred prosecution agreement with the Manhattan DA.

When miscalculation, when miscommunication, when mistake could lead to the unthinkable. A full-scale regional conflict that would be devastating for all involved and for the rest of the world.

And Nic, those words that we just heard there from Antonio Guterres really mirror in many ways what we've also heard, the fears, the concerns for many in the EU. Today, we heard from the EU's top diplomat, Josep Borrell, who warned that the Middle East is on the brink of a regional war. Where are we?

And we heard some comments on that today from the Foreign Minister today, who was commenting and thanking the United States, President Biden for the additional sanctions that it has put on Iran, the U.K. has done the same. And he said, he wanted the United States and others to get the G7 together on that as well. The British, for example, have put sanctions on seven people and six entities. Some of those people are top military generals, the Armed Forces, Chief of Staff, the chief of the Navy, Navy, a couple of senior headquarters staff, somebody in the logistics, staff, that also targeting aero -- people working or directors in the aerospace industry. The U.S. has similarly sanctioned 16 people, two entities. There -- they're focused on companies that are making the motors for the Shahed 131 drones. Those are the one way explosive drones that were fired here over the -- over the weekend. And the U.S. Department of Treasury as well, they've got their own sanctions going on five companies connected to steel manufacturer in Iran. So, from an Israeli perspective, they want to hear more of that, more countries signing up for those sorts of sanctions and a joint statement coming out of the G7 and as well from the U.N. But they are looking for the G7 to have very strong words, condemning Iran's actions when it comes to Israel's own actions in response. I think we are really no further forward in understanding when they will come or what they will be. The perceived wisdom is that they will be narrower in focus than they might have been previously. But when they will happen, you know, the best indicator of that came from Israel's Prime Minister yesterday, saying that Israel will make its own decision about when and what to do. But I think the more diplomatic sanctions, international diplomatic sanctions, the prime minister here feels are in the bag, then he might think about his next move, because of course, that could lose him some international support when he does that.",

And as we see the diplomatic push underway,just being underway for days now, we must not, we cannot forget what's happening in Gaza. The number of young lives lost in Gaza is simply staggering. UNICEF says nearly 14,000 children have been killed since the war began last October. The U.N. says one child is injured or dies every ten minutes. CNN's Jeremy Diamond now with the heartbreaking story of just one, just one of those children and her grieving family. And do -- we want to warn you, many of the images in this report are both graphic and disturbing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A moment frozen in time. The bodies of at least four children splayed around the foosball table. Laughter and shrieks of joy silenced in an instance. Blood now marking where they stood only minutes earlier. \"Shahed(ph), no way, Shahed(ph) my beloved\", a cousin screams from behind the camera. Ten-year-old Shahed(ph) is one of those children. Her bright pink pants unmistakable in the arms of the man carrying her away. With her family's consent, CNN has decided to show Shahed(ph) in life and death in order to give a face to this war's deadly impact on children. At Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, those who can still be saved arrive alongside those who cannot. Amid the chaos, Shahed's(ph) pink pants dangling as a doctor confirms what is tragically obvious. But Shahed(ph) is not alone. She's one of eight children who died on that crowded street in Al Hamazie(ph). The hospital says they were killed in an Israeli airstrike. By publication time, the Israeli military said only that the incident is under review. One after another, their small bodies arrive at the hospital's morgue, and into the arms of grieving parents. His eyes swollen and red, the father of nine-year-old Lujain(ph) recounts his daughter's last moments, playing foosball with her friends. \"This is my eldest daughter\", he says, \"a drone strike hit them while they were playing. They're all children.\" Hours earlier, Yousuf(ph) was one of those children playing alongside Shahed(ph) and Lujain(ph) when he was suddenly killed in a war he did not choose. His mother still clinging to her son. Neither does this boy who cannot believe his brother is dead. \"He's still alive\", he cries, \"don't leave him here\". Amid the outpourings of grief, there is Shahed(ph), her bloodstained-pink pants, once again impossible to miss. \"Dear God, what did they all do?\" One man cries. \"What did they all do?\" (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Now, the top line numbers and what the House is proposing to do and what the Senate has passed is similar. But the big hurdle here is going to be getting enough support in the House. We know that Democrats are going to have to help pass the aid for Ukraine because it does not seem to have widespread support in the Republican conference.

And so, it's not unanticipated. It's a bump in the road. It's nothing, you know, really a huge deal. It's good that it was caught at this point. I suspect they'll move forward.

But I'm wondering if he wants to get put in, if he wants to go to jail, if he wants to use that again as an outcry to talk about the system and how unfair it is and how it's weaponized against him. So, I think there's a political imperative where he wants to test a judge potentially or presumably. And if he does get put in, does it help him politically? It certainly hurts him in the case. But as it relates to his behavior, something needs to be done to rein him in. If you're going to accept the proposition that no one is against the law or above the law, then you have to accept the proposition that people should be guided by the directions that the law provides. And the law provides for a sanction to be jail. So, is that next?

Do the details of that case break through some of that sense that you hear from many on the right that this is a fundamentally unfair prosecution?",

They're familiar with the \"Access Hollywood\" tape that won't be played in this case but will be referenced. They know all that. But they're looking at this from the standpoint of, they were -- they support Donald Trump on his policies more than they do Joe Biden's. They look at the fact -- they feel the economy was better under the Trump years. They feel the border was more secure under the Trump years. They feel that national security was stronger under his years. And they're looking to that. Again, the key is how are independent voters going to feel? And my advice to Trump in the campaign, who they certainly wouldn't take it. But every time he walks out of that courtroom and has the cameras and the megaphone of the entire world media at his disposal, talk about what he's going to do for voters in this country. How he's going to improve the economy and the border and security, and stop talking about himself. Make the address in the appeal to independent and late decided voters.",

He's -- he keeps repeating the same message about his view of this trial, and frankly every trial he's faced. He will use that same phrase, witch hunt.",

The limited time he has outside the courtroom, he went to a bodega earlier this week in New York where he really highlighted law and order, and the policing, and the justice system in New York City. He was in Pennsylvania talking about the economy. He's going to North Carolina over the weekend. He'll be talking about jobs and the economy. At an off-the-record stop in Georgia, he went to a Chick-fil-A and really painted a picture of how he's connecting with African American voters. So, some of these optics and opportunities he's taking outside the courtroom, they -- they're certainly not scripted. They're not his big MAGA rallies.

The water levels have receded. We've also seen a lot of efforts to clean up and cleanup operations where teams have been pumping water into trucks and taking it to the sea and also into the desert. And of course, teams that are trying to free up the highway and the freeways. You can see its water as far as the eye can see, and it's resulted in really horrific stories from people we've spoken to, where they had their cars submerged in water and they had to find a way to get out of the floods. And this is just one example, seeing a big van like this that obviously was carrying many passengers being derailed by the floods. And so many stories like this. This street actually holds many stories after the torrential floods on Tuesday where one passenger we spoke to said they were trapped in a car for eight hours and they weren't driving. They said they were basically swimming. Now, important part of the story is Dubai International Airport that has been very affected by the floods, 1,000 flights have been cancelled over the last few days. Think about it, one aircraft can carry around 300 passengers. So, we're talking hundreds of thousands of people that have been affected. Now, operations seemed to be getting back to normal according to the CEO of DXB. He tells us that the recovery process is slow, but it seems like they're getting back to normal operations within the next 24 hours after incredible delays. And, of course, scenes at the airport of passengers waiting to get on a flight. The CEO was telling us that logistically, it's been incredibly intense to get aircraft into position, to get supplies into the airport as well. But a heroic effort, essentially, by emergency service workers in a city that is usually bustling and extremely busy, to see scenes like this, completely unprecedented. Isa.",
