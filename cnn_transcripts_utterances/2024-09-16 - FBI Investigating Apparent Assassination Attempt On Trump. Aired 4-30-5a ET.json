      "sentences": "We are learning more about the man who was detained in this incident here at Trump International Golf Course.His name is Ryan Wesley Routh. He lived in Hawaii for some time. He's 58 years old. And the car that he was driving actually belonged to his daughter. We understand from law enforcement that when he was taken into custody, he was calm and that he was not displaying emotion, according to law enforcement. Now, we also know that he had with him, according to what was found at the scene, two backpacks and a GoPro, as well as an AK-47 style rifle. Now, this all unfolded after Secret Service, who was on the golf course, working the holes ahead of Donald Trump, saw the barrel of a rifle poking through the fence, and then they engaged the suspect with some gunfire. He took off. They made chase. They eventually tracked him down and took him into custody. Now, in terms of the law enforcement presence here still at the International Golf Club, the roads have been closed since this incident occurred. That has continued much through the day here on Summit Boulevard, which is the main thoroughfare outside the front of the International Golf Club. That is where holes five and six, where this incident apparently occurred, those holes back up to Summit Boulevard, where we are standing. And this has been closed for hours. So that is sort of a key boulevard, as well as others that surround the club, which would be Kirk Road and Congress Avenue. All of them were shut down following this incident. The former president was kept here at the International Golf Club for hours, made sure that the area was secure. The entire golf club was locked down. And then he was brought to Mar-a-Lago, which he calls home about 15 minutes from here in West Palm Beach. So we understand that he does still have scheduled events this week, and we will see what the week brings and what the investigation brings as well. Randi Kaye, CNN, Palm Beach County, Florida.

They're often the largest outdoor area a president can visit, and the landscaping offers many opportunities to hide. Secret Service agents typically follow the president in golf carts, whilst others secure the holes ahead. That's how the agency says it was able to stop the alleged gunman on Sunday.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

In Pennsylvania, that might not have been the same strategy. And also, there was a communication breakdown in how they actually talked to one another on the comms, their ability, local law enforcement's ability to hear what is going on, to directly communicate. There is some issues in that way which must be addressed in the first incident, but you can see that the changes in communication and strategy were significant in this particular incident.",

An additional advance team, more resources, because clearly his life is under threat, and we must address that.We must figure out a way to reduce the level of threats against him, and particularly as we get closer to election time, and then even afterwards. So we are going to have to really figure out how to strategize, communicate, and get things done, but more resources, I am sure, are a part of the conversation and necessary.",

And we see time and time again, I want to say this very carefully, but we do see connections between the rhetoric of Donald Trump eating cats. J.D. Vance yesterday told Dana Bash that that was not true. And then we see violence ensue. We see January 6th, Nancy Pelosi. So we do see connections and we've seen it in the past here.",

Remember, Reagan, a Republican, they're not usually associated with those words.So there are meaningful changes, whereas there's a hopes and prayer element to this time after what we're becoming normalized, this political violence, and it's just not obviously meaningful.",
