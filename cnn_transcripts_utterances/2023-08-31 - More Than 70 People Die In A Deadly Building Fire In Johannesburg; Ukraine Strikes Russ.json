We'll have the latest from the scene this hour. Then more drone strikes on Russian territory. We'll ask a former U.S. Army official whether this is the beginning of a new phase of the war. Plus, UEFA's president finally breaks his silence on the kiss scandal involving Spanish football chief Luis Rubiales. We'll have his response later in the show. But first this hour, tragedy in Johannesburg where South Africa's president just visited the site of a massive fire that has killed at least 73 people. Officials say the blaze broke out in a building taken over by gangs and rented out to those who can't afford any other type of housing. There is no indication the fire was deliberate as of now.

He's well known face here on the show. John, great to have you on the show. Look, I think our viewers will know this, drones aren't new, they -- but they have become, I think, it's fair to say, a weapon of choice in this war with Ukraine, as we just played out there, taking the fight to Russia by air.

And what we're talkingabout, what interests most people are these drones that drop explosives or that crash into something, and that they are guided objects. But just as importantly, Ukraine has been developing the basis of using drones for intelligence collection, electronic warfare as well as some of these targeting capabilities. When you hear about President Zelenskyy saying, hey, we -- now have a drone that can strike 700 kilometers, over 400 miles. That's pretty significant in terms of what they have and what they're developing. They're not just using western technology in terms of obtaining drones from the west. They're creating their own drones themselves. They are signing contracts with western corporations like BAE, B-A-E and Raytheon, they're developing cardboard drones that have been successful, and they're having these much longer-range drones that can be successful in these long-term strikes.",

But what Ukrainian forces have done is they've attacked across the front, they've chosen the places they want to attack, and they've reduced it to several axes of advance. And now, what we're seeing is, they've gone through allegedly the first line of the three lines of defenses, the so-called sever-aching(ph) line, and they have breached that. Now, they have two more to go, and I would venture to say from a military perspective, those latter two lines of defenses are going to be less defended with less Russian soldiers and with not as capable defensive capabilities as we've seen in the frontline. So, in any kind of offensive operation like this, you get slow movement at first, which we've seen.

TheU.S. believes Russia has grown desperate for ammunition to use against Ukraine. Officials are threatening to place new sanctions on North Korea if the country does help re-arm the Russian military. Our Paula Hancocks has the very latest for you. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera):  Newly released U.S. Intelligence shows that they believe Russia and North Korea are quote, \"actively advancing towards talks of a potential arm deal. Now, this has been a concern for some time that Russia has been trying to re-arm itself because of its war in Ukraine, it is looking potentially to North Korea, and there are concerns that North Korea is likely to agree. Now, according to this U.S. Intelligence report, they say Russia is desperate to obtain ammunition, and it is likely to be used in Ukraine. Now, what it points to is a meeting back in July when the Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu went to Pyongyang. He was seen with Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader at a military parade. There were also photographs, walking through an arms exhibition where they were surrounded by weapons and artillery. This is concern that there were talks towards a deal here. There was a concern, which is also shared by South Korean Intelligence agency just earlier this month. They said they believe that, that was why the defense minister was there, to talk about a deal, also to talk about joint military exercises going ahead. The South Korean NIS also saying that they believe there was a Russian plane that left Pyongyang earlier this month, believed to have transferred unknown military supplies. Now, CNN cannot confirm what was on that plane, but this is what we're hearing from the Intelligence agency here. Now, of course, during an arms deal with North Korea would violate U.N. Security Council resolutions. Resolutions which Russia has signed on to. LINDA THOMAS-GREENFIELD, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO U.N.:  United States is now able to share that Shoigu's visit was more than just a photo-op.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SHUBERT (voice-over):  At the moment of Spain's triumph an unwanted kiss now threatens to bring down Luis Rubiales, the powerful president of the Spanish football federation. Rubiales apologized but it was not enough and he became the target of national anger, a wave against sexism in sport, triggered in part by Miguel Angel Galan and his unassuming office in Madrid, officially, the head of the national training center for football coaches; unofficially, the longtime nemesis of Rubiales and the football federation. He says he has filed more than 50 complaints against the Federatfion, one of which landed the previous president in prison. Now he hopes to take down another with this case. \"It was a sexist and intolerable act, a chauvinistic act,\" he said to CNN, \"by a president who is already plagued by corruption scandals and sexism.\" Steeped in tradition, Spain's royal football federation has long ruled over the nation's lucrative football fortunes. When this broke, Spain's prosecutor was already investigating Rubiales for trafficking in influence and bribery, allegations Rubiales has consistently denied. CNN has reached out to both the federation and Rubiales; neither have responded. And now, women footballers have entered the professional ranks, demanding equal pay, rights and structural change, says the president of Spain's women's league, La Liga F, Beatrice Alvarez, who has had her own disagreements with Rubiales. \"In that federation meeting, that totally delirious speech he made,\" she says, \"look at how they applauded him. It is unacceptable. It shows that more than the president has to change; the entire model has to change.\" As the scandal grows at the Rubiales hometown church, his mother went on hunger strike to support her embattled son. Briefly hospitalized, she continues to defend his innocence, even as others close to him are speaking out. His own uncle, Juan Rubiales, told Spanish news, \"El Mundo,\" that the kiss was just the tip of the iceberg. \"I was not surprised by that at all,\" he said. \"He is an extremely arrogant man, who has not acted as a president should. Instead of being a political leader, he wanted to be a warrior, who sees ghosts and enemies everywhere.\" He said, \"In the end, his own worst enemy was himself.\" Spain's historic win at the Women's World Cup, it seems, is forging a path for change in more ways than one.

Clearly, his team here recognizes that this could be a ballooning critical problem for the longtime GOP leader. And they are trying to be more transparent about his health than they have in the past. His first episode, last month here in the Capitol at a press conference, they wouldn't even say whether he consulted or saw a doctor about any medical treatment. Clearly, to me, they're trying to make more of an effort here to be more forthcoming and trying to tamp down speculation about his health and his political future.
