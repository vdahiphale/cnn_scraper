And this is from moments ago here at the University of Texas.A large group of students walked out of class today as part of a pro- Palestinian demonstration, and they were met with a heavy response from troopers who appeared to make a number of arrests.",

The car was then surrounded by protesters demanding, let him go, let him go, let him go. It appears that they might actually be letting him go.This is just a perfect example of the issue that college campus officials have across this country of how to police these events. Before they moved in to try and move tents and other things off this little park, it was a peaceful demonstration. There were speakers. It was peaceful. About 200 people. As soon as public safety officers from the university moved in, it very quickly got verbal, and then it very quickly got violent after that. There was pushing and shoving, cursing, swearing, a great deal of anger and then this arrest, which is what we are seeing behind me right now. Meantime, over on the park where the tents were pitched, protesters have now picked those tents up and are marching with the tents, so they're not breaking down. They're not breaking any university ordinances, but they are still making their points known. A lot of anger, and these protesters are saying that they are not going to leave. Now, initially, they came here about 4:30 this morning, pitched some tents. They were told by the college to take them down and they did. Then they felt that they were being silenced. They say that the college officials were \"nitpicking\" by getting at them for hanging banners on trees and for pitching the tents, and that is when things very, very quickly changed. Things very quickly turned contentious and turned violent. Back to you.",

      "sentences": "Yes, exactly. Because we've seen that some schools have closed down or gone to Zoom. So there's no singular approach. I'd give a little bit of a historical precedent here.Look, we haven't - university police, local police have not dealt with sort of extensive student protest since Black Lives Matter, which happened during COVID. So it had a very different feel than this does now in terms of everyone out and about. Classes are ending. There's a lot of dead time, so to speak, for students. And so colleges and universities have to do three things and I'm pretty clear about this. One is they do have to allow space for students to protest. I said, you've got to give them an outlet. Students are allowed to protest, this should not be a shock to anyone with teenagers or young adult children. They have strong feelings and they're passionate because if you just immediately go to arrest, it's going to cause, I think, some of the - what we're seeing on air, which is nothing's happening and then lots is happening. You want to give students space as long as you're protecting students who want to go to classes, Jewish students, if they're targeted. The second is you have to have off-ramps. You have to - in terms of these colleges and universities, you've got to give students rules about what they are and are not allowed to do. Maybe this happened at USC, but they have to be clear about, yes, you can protest. No, you can't block a building. And this is what's going to happen if you block a building. And then third is, of course, then exert your outcomes, right? I mean, in other words, these kids who are violating these rules, these students, then have some sort of punishment. And whether you need the police or something like that is each college and university's decision. But in the absence of violence at this stage, it is - it behooves a lot of colleges and universities to think through essentially how they are going to try to de-escalate this. This is on their property. And that includes things, I'll be honest, like access controls. Are all of these students - can we check IDs at gates, some of the universities are different. Look, I'm working with a lot of colleges and universities right now because they do want to de-escalate. They want to give students a chance but - to protest, but they want to protect other students who may feel threatened and then those who simply aren't involved with this at all. And I think we're going to find hopefully a medium between those two things, especially as we lead up to graduation.",

      "sentences": "Yes, I think that really is the balance here, Juliette. I mean, when you think back, even in the '60s, the free speech movement, we're seeing this thing with the car is sort of reminding us of what happened in Berkeley there. These moments sometimes of law enforcement moving in actually create sometimes a moment of escalation, which isn't to say in some of these protests that we have seen, listen, at Columbia, there are a lot of students, we've had them on the program, where they are not feeling safe.So it is a fine line, certainly between free speech, knowing who is part of these protests. But how should law enforcement, be approaching this in a very real way at the moment as they go in and assess these protests that they're going into, where it does just appear to be pushing towards escalation.",

We've been following, of course, Columbia University, but we're now also watching USC in Los Angeles and UT Austin there in Texas, where we've just seen police presence grow and sort of the - I guess, animosity in a way between law enforcement and some protesters definitely escalate. We've seen that with a lot of people just obviously observing what's going on, but there's been quite a bit of chaos there at those scenes.We have reporters across the country. CNN's Omar Jimenez is at Columbia. Tell us about what you're expecting, especially because the House Speaker Mike Johnson, is set to speak.",

      "sentences": "Yes, so House Speaker Mike Johnson is expected to be here within - this afternoon. And what you're looking at right now, you're just seeing the encampment that is here now for an eighth day here at Columbia University. It really first went up to coincide with the university president when she testified on Capitol Hill about anti-Semitism on campus. That was when the encampment went up.It was not long after that that the NYPD was called in to clear out the encampment. It did seem to anger many students and faculty here, and it was part of what prompted a revival of the camp, and it also prompted faculty to walk out in protests of students that were then arrested and or suspended. And then fast forward to last night, the university president gave a midnight deadline for this camp to clear out. That - or she said they would have to find alternative ways to clear out this camp. Midnight came and went. Nothing happened. A few hours later, a university spokesperson said they actually have been making good progress in talks, and so that deadline has been pushed out 48 hours. But of course, at the crux of all of this is the protests, they say, that this is because they want Columbia to divest from companies that profit from Israel. But also, at the same time, there is a Jewish population at this university, some of whom we've spoken to, who say that the protest makes them feel uncomfortable, threatened, even - so a few went as far as to say - as feel not safe on campus, even though there are some Jewish students who have gone into the encampment as well. And then you contrast this type of demonstration with some of what we've seen off campus. A lot of demonstrations have happened at the gates of Columbia University. That's where we've seen, while students can't participate in that, a lot of non-students have come to that and that's where we have tended to see a little bit more violent messaging, a little bit more anti-Semitic messaging there. So much so that even some of the students have tried to distance themselves from some of those protests. But again, bottom line, we're entering into an eighth day here. Speaker Johnson is expected to be here this afternoon, not too long from right now, where we do expect him to call for the resignation of the university president here, because he feels that she has done a weak job to keep Jewish students safe on this campus. So we expect that call to happen officially a little bit later this afternoon and, again, comes on an eighth day of this encampment that clearly, we've seen methods of which spread to campuses across this country, whether it's camping out or protests, solidarity with this campus, solidarity with Gaza in general. And clearly, this is something that has manifested pretty quickly.",

      "sentences": "Parker, what is that felt like for you personally when you've experienced those moments that go from perhaps advocacy and the freedom of expression to then threats directed toward you for your faith?It feels almost like a betrayal, because I think people in the Jewish community will tell you, we will - we understand what it feels like to be marginalized. Our ethnic population has been marginalized for thousands of years. And so we will continue to stand with groups that have been marginalized. And the Jewish community always wants to stand for social advocacy. That's what we stand for. We've done a lot of fundraising, whether it's with the LGBTQIA movement, the BLM movement, we've done a lot with other movements in the United States and trying to want to use our own level of experiences and wanting to advocate for other movements as well. And now you see it in this movement, we want to advocate for peace in the Middle East, just like everybody else. We want there not to be war between Israel and Hamas. We want there to be a ceasefire contingent upon the hostages being released and the hostages in Israel who were taken on October 7th being returned to their families. We want peace in the Middle East, just like everybody else. But it seems that our identities now have become a pawn in this political game, where people can't separate our Jewish identities from the occurrences and the incidents and the behavior of the Israeli government. And so we're being linked together. Me as a Jewish individual in the United States has no power over the Israeli government abroad. And now we're being linked together and we find ourselves being subjected to forms of anti-Semitism and that's really, really hard as a Jewish student and it's disheartening, especially because universities are told and are promoted as to be a place where we can participate in civil discourse, and we can have critical conversations and foster meaningful learning and challenge our own biases. But now we're going to universities, and there is so much tension between these two groups, and the protests are becoming so loud that we can't even have these conversations anymore. And that's the part that's so damaging, is Jewish students don't feel we can participate in these conversations.",
