This as the rebels have captured four cities in a day. CNN's Nic Robertson and Oren Liebermann are joining us now with the latest. Let's go, Nic, first to you. I know you have new reporting on this.

We know that through the day, rebels have been arriving from the south, from the east, and from the north.And we know as the sun was setting early evening there in Damascus, some of those groupings of rebels had got perhaps within 5 miles of the city center. What has clearly been happening through the hours of darkness, it's now 3:00 a.m. in Damascus, those rebels have been moving in small elements it appears, deeper inside of Damascus. Also, we know that there were reconnaissance elements of rebels in the capital now for over 24 hours. They were looking for the whereabouts of President Bashar al-Assad. They weren't able to find him. They don't know where the -- we can almost now say, the former president of Syria, they don't know where he is. Has he left the capital? Is he in hiding there? Is he hiding out somewhere else in the country or has he in fact left the country? That is unknown at the moment. But what has become very clear through the day and is evidenced by the rebels' relatively free and easy movement so far at least into the capital is that the military defenses there have been collapsing. We've seen more than 2,000 of Assad's Army leave in their military vehicles, some of them big trucks towing heavy guns, leave into neighboring Iraq. I mean, this is almost unimaginable that Assad's Army, an army that under him and his father has had an iron and bloody grip on Syria for 53 years, that they now would be fleeing to another country. This is unseen in recent history in Syria. And it really does point to what effectively is amounting to a military collapse of Assad's defenses of Damascus, a disappearance of the president. And the rebels now moving ever closer to the center of that city.",

And so the people of Syria are fed up.Second, Assad's backers, Iran, Russia, and Hezbollah, have all been weakened and distracted. And so he has not had the support from those three actors that he expected to be able to count on and has been left basically naked. His forces are hollowed out. (END VIDEOCLIP)",

And it's even hard for me to understand how these rebels could move so quickly, move so successfully. And I question whether they would be able to maintain control because these rebels are somewhat of a ragtag group.This isn't a group of individuals that is very well trained in governing. They do control a small sliver, or up until this point had controlled a very small sliver of Syria in the northwest. But that's why when Nic talked about their aspirations, while it's nice to hear, I would agree with him that it's completely aspirational. It's shocking. All of this is shocking because even when they took Aleppo, my analysis at that moment was, well, they were able to take Aleppo because it was a surprise offensive. But my experience when I was in the government handling Syria -- and this is the case, by the way, not just for Assad, but for many dictators all over the world, is that they double down. They will bulldoze their own people and their own country if it means they can stay in power. And they will make friends with the thuggiest of thugs in order to do that. And we saw Assad do it. And not only did we see Assad do it, but it worked for him. He maintained power. Not only that, but countries started welcoming him back in the fold again. You saw the Arab League, for example, welcome to the Syrian government back into the Arab League last year. And you saw the United States turn a little bit of a blind eye to that. And so, nothing to me indicates that Assad wouldn't want to pursue that again, except for the fact that his thugs are very weak right now. Hezbollah has been decapitated. Iran is on the defense. Russia is obviously distracted. But I wouldn't expect him to go so easily. That's the thing that that's -- so this has been very surprising, stunning. I don't think any foreign policy expert could have seen this coming this year, regardless of how weak his Assad's thugs are. But, again, I just don't think it'll go down that easily.",

Sources telling CNN the country's military defense forces have fallen.Joining me now, CNN Political and National Security Analyst and National Security Correspondent for The New York Times, David Sanger, and CNN Military Analyst, retired Colonel Cedric Leighton. Good to have both of you here as we follow this breaking news. David, I just want to get your first take on what we're watching, which is that we're hearing from a resident there in Damascus that rebels have entered that city. DAVID SANGER, CNN POLITICAL &amp; NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Pretty remarkable. We don't know. At this point, it's pretty much anecdotal evidence, but certainly all the momentum has been on the side of the rebels. And a point that we were making before the break and that you heard from Hagar Chemali and others is these rebels are no freedom fighters. They are a designated terrorist group. U.S. is designated, and were al-Qaeda affiliates. In fact, they were considered to be the al-Qaeda group in Syria. They had some split with them. So, it's not as if the United States is rooting for this group to take over. They are rooting for Assad and the rule of the Assad family, which now goes back more than half a century to be ended. And that may be what we're seeing play out. Just last night, people in the American Intelligence Community were saying to me they thought it would be five or six days before we knew what would happen to Damascus. It may turn out that that was a much longer time period. And then reality, it kind of reminds you of the fall of Kabul.",

We also need to note that there are some troops, American troops there in Syria, though they are not in the area where this activity is happening right now.",

I think that's why you've heard President Biden and you heard Jake Sullivan earlier today out of the Reagan Defense Forum talk about how cautious the U.S. is going to be about not getting involved in this.Another reason to be cautious is the United States does not want to be charged with being behind the overthrow here. So, you know, that's a secondary factor. But if you just back up for a moment, what we're seeing happen is that all of Syria's defenders are either weakened or busy someplace else. Iran, obviously, you know, was unable to go score against the Israelis in their most recent missile attacks. They've suffered a good number of losses. They've suffered from Hezbollah and Hamas's destruction or near destruction on the part of the Israelis. And so, all of the forces that would normally come in to go bolster Assad are gone, which is what made the rebels realize that they had an opportunity here.",

So we will deal with what's called Hayat Tahrir Al Sham, which is the main element under a fellow named al-Golani. We have dealt with him indirectly through the Turks for years as we froze the conflict. I won't say it'll be totally successful. It's much better. What we need to do now, other than protect our own troops and people there, is to work with the people on the scene. Those are our Kurdish allies in the northeast, Turkey and Israel, all of whom are engaged in various ways. Work with the U.N. that has a way forward, Resolution 2254, calling for ceasefires, reconciliation, new elections. That's the way that we should engage. We don't want a new Afghanistan, but -- and both President Biden and Donald Trump made that point today. We don't want to get directly involved, but we have huge interests here.
