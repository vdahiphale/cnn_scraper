So, I'm certain that right now, you have a lot of behind-the-scenes discussions going on. Remember, the former president still has Secret Service protection, and it would be the Secret Service actually bring him to Manhattan, if in fact, he is indicted, and has to turned himself in. So, they would know in advance that this is going to take place and certainly coordinate with Secret Service there, with the FBI, with NYPD, with the DA's office, with anyone who needs to be involved, because it is going to be -- is something that's going to draw an awful lot of attention, and perhaps even protests. And whether this happens Tuesday or not, he is calling for people to show up on Tuesday. So, you have to be ready for that not just to protest, but any counter demonstrations that might happen.",
