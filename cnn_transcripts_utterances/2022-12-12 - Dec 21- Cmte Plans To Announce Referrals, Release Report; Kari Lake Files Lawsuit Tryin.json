It's a lot easier for them to get financial information. It's a lot easier for them to get phone records.

He only can afford to lose four Republican votes in order to become speaker. He already has about four or five who were saying, no. Marjorie Taylor Greene is trying to get him elected speaker.

It's been incredibly difficult to do that here on Earth until now.These scientists at this Department of Energy Lab in California, they've been able to produce more energy than they actually used in the process. And the reason why that's so significant is because that is so necessary to make this possible to use this sort of power on a wide scale, commercial sort of level. But, you know, just to put this all in context as to what this means and where we are today, one scientist said to me, it's like we have an embryo now and we're asking, when is it going to graduate from Harvard. So clearly, there's more growth to go here. But this is such a critical and necessary step as we tried to get to that zero carbon footprint source of energy.",
