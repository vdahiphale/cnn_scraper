      "sentences": "Yes, Kate, this is new research that was just recently presented. And researchers developed and tested a type of hormonal gel that can be used as a form of male birth control.So how this works in this research, you apply the gel to your body, men in this study applied it to their shoulders. You apply it one daily, and it contains progestin and testosterone. It's a hormonal gel. And it works by suppressing sperm production in the body. So, a normal production of sperm, a normal sperm count typically ranges from about 15 million to around 200 million. But in this study researchers say the gel was able to suppress production to less than 1 million per milliliter. And in this study, researchers say that after using the gel for about 12 weeks, 86 percent of men did achieve that sperm suppression. And that's the way that this form of birth control would work. Now, I will say, if a man forgets to put the gel on one day, it won't have an immediate effect because it takes about eight to ten weeks to stop the gel and return to a normal sperm production. So, on the flip side, there is that caveat. But overall, Kate, this is an interesting, I guess, alternative for men out there, outside of vasectomy, to consider. And this research, again, it was just recently presented. So, more trials, more testing needs to be done. But it's fascinating, preliminary data on this gel, Kate.",

No one is quite sure what that means because she doesn't live here. She could go back to Seattle, have - you know, she has no obligations to come back here to Italy. She's not under any thread.
