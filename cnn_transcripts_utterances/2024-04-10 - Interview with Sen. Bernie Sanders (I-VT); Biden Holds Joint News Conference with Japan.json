Look, there is a terrible war going on which violates international law. In fact, it is violating American law. Let me tell you how. Foreign Assistance Act is very, very clear that, if a country blocks American humanitarian aid, no more funds for that country. Israel has blocked American humanitarian aid. So, what I am saying right now, talk is cheap. But we cannot be critical of Netanyahu and his right-wing extremists and, at the same time, give them money and weapons to continue this terrible war. That's where the leverage is. I suspect that President Biden is beginning to use that leverage in his discussions with Netanyahu. What we have seen in the last week is a -- we don't know exactly, but an improvement in the number of trucks. The U.N. says now that over 200 trucks got in yesterday. That is an improvement. But, obviously, you need 500 trucks. You need 1,000 trucks. You need those trucks getting to the most desperate parts of Gaza, where people are literally starving to death. So, we're seeing a little bit of an improvement, but we have got to hold Israel accountable. And, in my view, the leverage we have is money. Not another nickel until Netanyahu changes its entire policy.",

So, I think, politically, it's a good issue for Democrats, but it's not the only issue. The issue that we need, in my mind, in addition to abortion, in addition to climate change, which is also something that resonates very strongly, especially among young people, we need to make clear to the working class of this country that Trump is going to give massive tax breaks to billionaires. He's going to appoint anti-labor officials to the government, making it harder for workers to form unions.

You have got people all over America who cannot afford the rising costs of housing. You have a health care system which is broken and dysfunctional. We pay twice as much per capita for health care as people of any other country, and yet 85 million Americans are uninsured or underinsured. Our childcare system is a disaster. People don't have pensions. So we have enormous problems. And, in my mind, the president, yes, should take credit for what he has accomplished, but he has got to look to the future and say, you know what, I understand the pain that working families are experiencing, and I am going to pass A, B, C, indeed, strong legislation. I happen to believe health care is a human right, that we should guarantee health care to all people.

Families have been bombed out of their homes and the healthcare system is on the brink of collapse.

The doctor holds her hand as she lies on the floor and tells her it's going to be OK. There's no pain medication for her burns and shrapnel wounds. He tells to pray. Nearby, another doctor tries to save one of his own, performing CPR on a paramedic who is injured by Israeli artillery fire. His heart eventually restarts, one life saved, amidst so much loss. His longer-term chances of survival in a decimated medical system are unclear. These doctors are American, volunteers on the World Health Organization Coordinated mission to the north of Gaza, desperate to help in an ever more helpless crisis. DR. FARHAN ABDELAZIZ, EMERGENCY MEDICINE PHYSICIAN:  The situation here is intense. It's catastrophic. Really, these words are hard to describe what we're seeing. I mean, you're talking about mass casualty events where people are coming in with limited staff, limited overwork staff and hungry staff, all working who have been displaced from homes and they're sitting here in the ER trying to do the best they can. HANCOCKS (voice-over):  This is Kamal Adwan Hospital in the north, one of the few hospitals still open, although barely functional. DR. SAMER ATTAR, ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON:  This morning, we woke up and found out that four patients died in ICU. One of them was about 10 years old, and the mom just refused to leave the child's bedside, refused believe that the kid was dead, refused let the staff cover her up. The child died of malnutrition and dehydration. HANCOCKS (voice-over):  Patients here lie on the floor in their own blood. Electricity relies on solar panels. The fuel ran out some time ago. The hospital's director says volunteer specialists traveling into Gaza are a massive help amid a shrinking medical staff. Close to 500 medical personnel have been killed since October 7th.

At the summit, you confirmed your strong objections against unilateral attempts to change status goal by force or coercion by China and agreed on reinforcing response capabilities. Under current circumstances, should Japan and the United States bolster defense capabilities, China may become more preoccupied in military expansion and intensify its coercive behavior, that is the risk of dilemma. In order to avoid divide and expand -- avoid the divide, how should Japan and U.S. respond? KISHIDA (through translator):  Let me then take that question first. At this summit, we confirmed that the United States and Japan will resolutely defend and bolster a free and open international order based on the rule of law. And that Japan and the United States, as global partners, shall work together for that purpose. On challenges concerning China, including the point you raised on objecting to unilateral attempts to change status quo by force or coercion, we concurred that Japan and the United States, as global partners, shall work together for in close coordination. And also, as I said previously, we will continue our dialogue with China and we will cooperate with China in tackling common challenges. And the President and I confirmed the importance of such dialogue as well. Based on the solid trust with our ally, the United States, we will continue to call on China to fulfill its responsibilities as a major power. Japan's policy, which I have consistently embraced, is to comprehensively promote the mutual strategic relationship we have with China and establish a constructive and stable Japan-China relationship through efforts by both sides. That has been my consistent position that I have upheld. We will continue to seek close communication with China at all levels. That's it for me.",

And the fact of the matter is that Bibi and I had a long discussion. He agreed to do several things that related to, number one, getting more aid, both food and medicine into Gaza, and reducing significantly the attempts - - the civilian casualties in any action taken in the region. And thus far, and we -- and it's tied to the hostages. There are a number of hostages that are being held by Hamas. And just yesterday, we're meeting with the vice president, our national security adviser before that, and then -- and our American hostages as well. And they know how committed we are, the whole team, to getting their loved ones home. We're not going to stop until we do. The new proposal on the table of Bill Burns led the effort to -- for us, we're grateful his work. There's a now up to Hamas. They need to move on the proposal that's been made. And as I said, we get these hostages home where they belong, but also bring back a six-week ceasefire that we need now. And the fact is that we're getting in somewhere in the last three days over 100 trucks. It's not enough, but needs to be more. And there's one more opening that has to take place in the north.

It's still close to 4 percent, about 3.8 percent year over year, and that is going to be a consistent issue lingering into the next election.

And as you saw, there was a deepening of military collaboration, the co- development of weapons through a new Joint Defense Council, a consultation to evaluate whether Japan should be a member of the AUKUS partnership with Australia, the U.K., and the U.S. to develop nuclear submarines to deploy in the South China Sea and across the Indo-Pacific. Prime Minister Kishida was asked whether there is a clear path for Japan to join that alliance. And he said that that is what they're going to be discussing through this new consultation. Of course, you mentioned the fact that China is not present here. President Xi is not here at this visit. But he was the center of the discussion. He was sort of the raison d'etre for this summit even taking place. And while the leaders went to great lengths to say that this is about readiness, this is not about conflict, it's about peace and stability in the South China Sea and across the Taiwan Strait, that they condemned the idea of unilateral force being used to reclaim Taiwan by China, but they still took the opportunity to mention their alliance and mention the efforts that they were going to to try to protect that peace and stability while ensuring that the lines of communication are open and stressing cooperation with China as the key to essentially diffuse tensions and avoid a misunderstanding or a miscommunication. Certainly, that is also going to be the theme tomorrow when the president of the Philippines joins the conversation. The three leaders are going to be discussing an infrastructure investment, we're told, where the U.S. and Japan will be funding a new rail and shipping corridor, connecting to critical Filipino military bases while the Philippines accuses China of harassment in some of its critical economic zones. So, China will figure prominently in those continued discussions, even if they are saying that the goal is to diffuse these tensions. Brianna, Boris.",

Obviously, Japan is the linchpin of this effort in the United States to exert influence in the Pacific. But there was mention of Australia, of South Korea, the Philippines, obviously. It sounds a lot like Biden is trying to reclaim the arena in the way that Donald Trump did not. Donald Trump blew up the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which sought to do the very same things, right, that Biden is doing now.",
