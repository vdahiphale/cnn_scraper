I'm Rosemary Church.Well, U.S. President Joe Biden will leave later today for an extraordinary wartime visit to Israel. It's a strong show of support for the longtime American ally. The announcement came from U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who has been on a marathon mission across the Middle East. The top U.S. diplomat says Mr. Biden will underscore Israel's right to defend itself and to prevent future terrorist attacks. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: He's coming here at a critical moment for Israel, for the region and for the world. The president will reaffirm the United States' solidarity with Israel and our ironclad commitment to its security. The president will hear from Israel what it needs to defend its people as we continue to work with Congress to meet those needs. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And it says another 28 were killed in Rafah. That is home to the border crossing where many Palestinian civilians have been gathering to try to enter Egypt. An IDF spokesperson says he is not aware of any specific strikes in that area.CNN's Katie Polglase is following developments for us. She joins us live from London. Good morning to you again, Katie. So President Joe Biden will visit Israel Wednesday. What might be achieved in terms of the release of hostages, establishing a humanitarian corridor, and of course preventing this war from expanding beyond Israel's borders?",

      "sentences": "Good Morning, Rosemary. Well, clearly being on the ground, talking with leaders, meeting with Netanyahu himself will be a clear way for Biden to try and see if there is an option for de-escalation here. That is the major concern from the U.S., that they are witnessing a conflict that could potentially spread across the entire region.And so just by making this visit, by making this announcement that the U.S. president during a war will be going to Israel is a very significant step. It indicates how important this is given the security risk of such a high-profile figure going into Israel at this point. It shows how urgent this is for the Biden administration. Now, he will be meeting with various leaders. And one of the main things will be to discuss this concern around escalation. We've been seeing reports just yesterday that Israel has evacuated 28 areas in the north of Israel because of fire exchange with Hezbollah, the militant group in Lebanon. This is the concern that other actors outside of Israel are going to become embroiled, involved in this conflict. And one of the statements that Blinken made while announcing that Biden will be coming to Israel was very clear about this. He said that this visit will underscore the U.S.'s crystal clear message to any actor state or non-state trying to take advantage of this crisis to attack Israel. Don't. And that is very clearly what the U.S. message is here. Let's not escalate this conflict further than it already has got to. And clearly, as we've been seeing as well, reporting on what's happening inside Gaza, the humanitarian cost of this crisis, as it unfolds, as we're seeing more reports of potentially even the U.S. military getting involved with Israel, as this unfolds, the humanitarian cost of this crisis is all too clear.

But you know, let's remember the last time Putin came here was before the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics where he and Xi announced that no- limits partnership between the two sides but that was also a few weeks before he launched that brutal invasion against Ukraine. But you know, despite China's claim on neutrality in that war, we have seen bilateral ties really grow much deeper and more robust and more substantive in the past few years. Bilateral trade, of course, soaring to new levels, but also you've seen them increasingly coordinated on many policy fronts militarily, politically and economically as well. That is because the two men are really bonded over their shared grievances against the U.S. They're really, you know, all of that has happened in the past few years reinforcing their desire, their willingness to reshape this current world order led by the U.S. and dominated by Western powers. So in that sense, the current conflict in the Middle East is presenting Xi Jinping with a perfect backdrop to compare and contrast, to present an alternative vision and narrative exemplified by his Belt and Road global infrastructure investment scheme. And that's why we have seen headlines from Chinese state media that while the U.S. fans the flame of war, China exports peace and development. That's something obviously Putin is very much on board, praising the Chinese quote-unquote \"unique approach in dealing with other countries, not through coercion and imposition, but by providing opportunities to other countries.\" Rosemary?",
