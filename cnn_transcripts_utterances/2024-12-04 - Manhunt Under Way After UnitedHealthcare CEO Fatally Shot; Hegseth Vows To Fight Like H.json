A massive manhunt underway right now for a suspect on the run after the CEO of UnitedHealthcare was shot and killed just outside a Manhattan hotel. Why police believe the attack was targeted.Also breaking, Pete Hegseth says he's ready to fight like hell to salvage his imperiled nomination. Donald Trump's pick to leave the defense department spending another day up on Capitol Hill, as sources now tell CNN the Trump transition team could replace him with the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis. Also this hour, we'll bring you a live report from JFK International Airport in New York, where the woman who stowed away on a Delta Airlines flight to Paris last week just landed back here in the United States. CNN's producer who was on that return flight is standing by for details. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. We begin our coverage tonight in New York, where we just got new images of a gunman suspected of fatally shooting the CEO of UnitedHealthcare in what appears to be a targeted killing. Let's go to our senior crime and justice correspondent first, Shimon Prokupecz. He's at the scene of the shooting in Manhattan. Shimon, you're getting your first look at where the shooting actually took place.",

The police just reopening the street to traffic, and so this is our first look.This is where the shooting took place. This is the side entrance to the Hilton Hotel. This is where the gunman police say was waiting for the CEO as he was making his way inside here to go to the conference. What police say happened was the CEO, Brian Thompson, was walking from the luxury hotel, which is just behind me. He walked from that hotel, walked up this street to get inside the hotel to go to the conference as the gunman was here waiting for him. As video, which we obtained, shows, you could see the gunman, as he's standing there waiting, and as the CEO approaches, he starts firing. Police say he fires some shots. The gun then malfunctions, and then the shooter clears the gun. It jams. But they say he seems to know how to operate weapons. He clears the jam and continues firing, striking the CEO in the head and the leg. And then obviously we know that the victim died. Police then say that the shooter went across here, across this street through this alleyway here, Wolf. Let me just show you where this is where we have reporters here. Sorry about that. Sorry. So, they walked this way and they say he went through this way, through this alley. They found a phone here. And then there is ebike station just around here, Wolf. That is where he got on a bike, police say, and then drove north on 6th Avenue and through Central Park. And that is the last time, police say, they saw him.",

Was it a change of clothes? Will they have an image of him switching clothes somewhere else? The key is they want to find something where he shows his face, because he was pretty diligent about trying to cover that up. The second thing, Wolf is, you know, they have various pieces of evidence. As Shimon said, he runs through that that alleyway past the Ziegfeld Theater, but they find a phone in there. They believe that phone may be connected to him, and they're working with technicians to open it and see what it will tell them. Is it a burner or does it have personally identifiable information? They also found a water bottle. They think that that water bottle is likely the water bottle he purchased at that Starbucks along with two power bars just before the shooting. Will that give them DNA? Is there a fingerprint on that plastic bottle? That's another thing they're going to be working with. So, between trying to find something technological, like a picture of his face through the video canvas, and then, forensically, from the clues found on the scene, there's that.

How does that play into this investigation? DONELL HARVIN, FORMER D.C. CHIEF OF HOMELAND SECURITY AND INTELLIGENCE: Well, it's going to play a lot into it because that means there's a potentially digital evidence and individuals that may be behind those threats. I've read reports that his wife has said that there were threats against him as well that are nonspecific. Listen the healthcare industry has been really under siege since COVID. We were tracking threats against the healthcare industry writ large, not specifically this country -- this company, rather after -- during COVID with collusion and all these other, you know, online conspiracies. So, you know, this is going to put front and center this industry once again. And they have to really look at how they're protecting their CEO.

So there's about six different entrances he could go in. How did this killer know to be at exactly the right entrance to catch him walking down the street?Now, one potential answer to that is he was staying in the Marriott Hotel from the Lux Collection next door. Did the killer know that and say what's the closest entrance between his hotel and the hotel where the conference is? And as Katherine points out, you know, having this gun with the silencer, when the gun jams, he clears the malfunction, he fires another shot, it jams again, he clears it, he fires a third shot, he clears it, that's left them additional ballistic evidence because each time he did that, a bullet landed on the street that he may have touched or left prints on. But it also tells us the silencer is probably the thing that's causing that gun to jam, which is common with silencers and guns that don't have a special adjustment to handle them. So, as Kathy says, you know, a lot of planning went into this, but maybe not quite enough. Not just his professionalism, which we see, but his mistakes are emerging as well.",

She's the first out transgender state legislator in the U.S. Senator, thank you so much for joining us. The conservative majority, as you probably know, on the court appears likely to support Tennessee's ban on gender-affirming care. What went through your mind hearing the arguments today? STATE SEN. DANICA ROEM (D-VA): Sure. So, as I was listening to the arguments, a few things that really stuck out. Number one, representing Virginia and knowing that Virginia's been on the wrong side of Supreme Court cases before, especially in the Loving case when Justice Jackson, you know, brought up that, hey, if you decide this way in the way that Tennessee is, you could potentially be undermining the rationale of the way that Loving versus Virginia has decided in terms of equal protection of the law. But the next thing that really just -- there's a lot of things I just that just went through my mind, like listening to these arguments today, and part of it is, you know, whether they were supportive of or not of, you know, the rights of these families to make sure that they're able to determine that what's the best healthcare for them and with their doctors, it was that none of them know what it's like to live like Chase does, you know, Chase Strangio from the ACLU, who argued in front of the court today. They don't know what it's like to just feel like you're suffocating under this. I do know what that's like. I know that Chase knows what that's like. And at the same time, you have to look at every single one of these cases that goes, where you've got a parent, you've got the child, and you have a doctor, who are working this out on a case by case basis and evaluating every single thing that makes medical care, you know, basically important and necessary here. [18:35:21] The American people just have to ask, do you want politicians getting in the way of the decisions that you and your family are making and your doctor's make together?",

Whereas I, as the first out and seated trans state legislator in the country, kept my 2017 campaign promise to expand Medicaid back in 2018. Wolf, we insured more than 700,000 people because of that. This is a case of misplaced priorities when SB1 from the Tennessee legislature is about this instead of expanding healthcare for a lot more people.",

Right now, there are growing calls for President Yoon to resign or face impeachment. CNN's Ivan Watson has our report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) IVAN WATSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A night of dramatic confrontation at South Koreas national assembly. Troops face to face with civilian protesters. A lawmaker challenging a soldier grabbing his gun and shaming him, yelling, aren't you embarrassed? Hundreds of troops were deployed here in the pre-dawn hours on Wednesday, some landing by chopper sent to enforce the shocking declaration of martial law made by President Yoon Suk Yeol late Tuesday night. But they weren't enough to stop 190 lawmakers, including 18 from Yoon's own party from voting unanimously to overturn the president's decree. It may have been the shortest period of martial law the world has ever seen. President Yoon's martial law decree only lasted around six hours. He withdrew it before the sun even came up on Wednesday. And now, the opposition is calling for his impeachment. Opposition lawmakers are pushing for a vote to oust the president as early as Thursday, while his chief of staff and defense minister have both submitted their resignations. Yoon's aborted power play barely affected business in the Korean capital. And at the airport, international flights also faced no disruptions. But there is anger among some ordinary Koreans.
