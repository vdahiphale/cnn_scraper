The reason she's allowing this is because she believes the Supreme Court has issued her a task, and that is to look through the allegations here and the evidence and determine which portions of this case may be immune from prosecution under their ruling granting former President Trump and other presidents partial immunity for official acts. So this could potentially be filed on Thursday. It will be filed under seal, so it's possible that she could release this at some point before the election. But of course, Jake, if Trump is reelected, both of Smith's cases will be dismissed.",

That is an argument that the RNC has been making in this case. They lost at the trial court, but then they appealed up to the Fifth Circuit, and the panel that they drew three Trump appointed justices. This was really a dream panel for them.But arguments earlier today, Jake, just really did not go their way. It appears that this panel may be leaning against their arguments. Now, if the RNC loses before the election, it's fully expected they'll try to appeal up to the Supreme Court, but the goal was to try to get a ruling in their favor.

And two of those states are important battlegrounds, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, where election workers can't even begin processing mail in ballots until 7And even when we do have a notion of who the winner is, we are still expecting to see an avalanche of additional litigation. You know, we're expecting to see challenges to certification and how that process plays out. We could still see challenges to different buckets of ballots, as Paula was talking about. These could be ballots that come in after Election Day. These could be ballots that folks allege have been cast by people that they don't believe are citizens of the United States.

Even the office that prosecuted Marcellus Williams now wants his murder conviction overturned. That office says he might not be guilty.Still last night, Missouri Supreme Court and Missouri's Governor refused to grant a stay of execution, and as CNN's Whitney Wild reports for us now, the decision on whether to spare his life is up to the U S Supreme Court. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WHITNEY WILD, CNN LAW ENFORCEMENT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A more than two decade long fight by his family and supporters to stop the execution of Marcellus Williams in the state of Missouri ends tonight, despite pleas from St. Louis prosecutors and his defense attorney for clemency, Missouri Governor Michael Parson has refused in the final hours to let Williams live. GOV. MIKE PARSON (R) MISSOURI: Every process always comes back to where it all began, and he was issued a death sentence many years ago, and it's our job is to execute that when the time comes. WILD (voice-over): Williams has been on death row since 2001 when he was convicted of the 1998 stabbing murder of Felicia Gail, prosecutors said at the time, Williams told two people he killed Gail during a burglary. But Williams has adamantly maintained his innocence. In 2017 then-Governor Eric Greitens launched a commission to review his case, but in 2023 current Missouri Governor Michael Parson disbanded the effort. Over the weekend, St Louis prosecutor Wesley Bell and Williams' attorney Jonathan Potts filed a rare joint motion asking the Missouri Supreme Court to halt Williams' execution and send the case back to a lower court. At Monday's hearing, attorneys argued Williams' rights were violated during the trial. JONATHAN POTTS, FORMER PROSECUTOR IN WILLIAMS' CASE: The Trial prosecutor in Marcellus Williams' case has admitted under oath that he struck a juror in part because of his race. That is the unrefuted admission. WILD (voice-over): But an attorney from Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey's office disagreed.",

Instead, it took months, nearly a year, before incentivized informants came forward, only after there was a reward, only after they faced their own criminal charges, that they came forward and said that they heard Marcellus Williams say he had committed this crime.They don't even say that they saw that he committed this crime. The other piece of evidence that they use is a laptop that Mr. Williams did sell that was from the victim's home. But what the jury never heard, and what the courts continue to just ignore, is that laptop was provided to him by one of those incentivized informants who, herself should have been a suspect, but instead was allowed to testify and get deals and sentence this man to death.

About 61 percent of Gen Zers say they increasingly would like to abstain from alcohol.Around the country, if you take all adults, it's about 41 percent of people saying they're trying to drink less alcohol, and that's translating into this no alcohol or low alcohol movement. If you look over all the numbers just over the last couple of years, you can see that it's steadily increasing about 30 percent a year non-alcoholic drink sales expected to be about a billion dollars in the next two years. So, this seems to be going and increasing as well. Top two reasons people want to be healthy, but they still want to be social, that's really what's driving it. I'll tell you quickly, Jake, what's interesting about 68 percent of people still say that they drink even if they're not drinking as much. And 93 percent of people who go and buy drinks like this in the store, this is a non-alcoholic gin or a non-alcoholic wine, they say that they are still buying regular alcoholic drinks at the same time.

Certainly should not pursue drinking in the pursuit of good health.But let me show you something with Heineken specifically here. So put up a head to head comparison. Heineken has a regular beer and they have a non-alcoholic beer, so you can take a look at the numbers, Jake. Far fewer calories in the no alcohol version of the beer, but you do get more sugar, so you are trading carbs for alcohol to some extent. So that may dictate people's decision making in terms of how much they would actually drink the no alcohol version. I should also point out that the Heineken is 0 percent alcohol, but there are some of these that have 0.5 percent so they're not entirely alcohol free as well.
