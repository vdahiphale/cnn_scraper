I live in Texas, where a recent poll showed that even 42 percent of registered Republican voters in Texas agree that climate change poses a threat. And the second thing I tell them is,that is a rational response to what's happening. If you actually understand what's happening, we should be worried, because this is the only home we have. But what I do know is that our future is not yet written. Our future is literally in our hands. And I know also, in the words of the science, that every 10th-of-a- degree matters.

If we stop adding to the overburden of these greenhouse gas pollutants in the sky, if we reach what they call true net zero and stop adding to the heat-trapping capacity up there, the temperatures will stop going up right away. And if we stay at true net zero, half of the human-caused greenhouse pollution will fall out of the atmosphere in as little as 25 to 30 years. We have the ability to do this. And it's not impractical, because we now have the cheapest new source of energy in the history of the world with solar electricity and wind electricity. And the electric vehicles reached 20 percent of sales globally this year. The batteries are now -- we had one Gigafactory several years ago. Now there are 200 and another 400 being built. A long time ago, one of the Saudi Arabian oil ministers said, the -- we better remember the Stone Age didn't end because of a shortage of stones. It ended because something better came along. We have got something better now. We can do this if we just overcome the greed and political power of the big fossil fuel polluters, who've been trying to control this process.

And so we need to pay more attention to them now. Here's one thing they say. If we don't take action, there could be as many as one billion climate refugees crossing international borders in the next several decades. Well, a few million has contributed to this wave of populist authoritarianism and dictatorships and so forth. What would a billion do? We can't do this. We could lose our capacity for self-governance. Already, we're seeing people driven from the places they have always called home. And we're seeing an expansion of areas in the world that are physiologically unlivable now because of the combination of heat and humidity. They're relatively small areas now, but, if we don't act, they will expand to include most of India, large parts of North and South America, the Philippines, Indonesia, Pakistan. The list goes on. Our -- the survival of our civilization is at stake. And it sounds dire, but it is dire. And -- but, again, the good news is, we can reclaim control of our destiny if we summon the political will and the courage and the moral courage to do it.

Mitigation -- by mitigation, I mean trying to find -- with alternative energy sources, making sure temperatures don't rise by one 1.5 degrees Celsius, those things that mean that it doesn't happen, climate change. And then you go to, if it does happen, adaptations. It's going to cost money to adapt, to build the air conditioning and the water, the high -- to deal with the high sea levels. And then there's number three, the damages. So, this, any way you cut it, is going to be a lot of money. The problem is that it's not economic.

It's going to have to come from that double bottom line. For example, Bill Gates has a climate fund which is called Breakthrough Energy, and it produces a return from finding the new inventions. It may be solar. It may be other forms of invention. But, also, we must recognize that that will not happen at a pace that is needed. And so we have to deal with adaptation. In other words, we're not likely to hit that 1.5 degree limit. And, as a result, there are going to be consequences of that. Then that gets down to a nitty-gritty level of, what does that mean? It means, OK, preparation for sea levels rising, for temperature changes.

It was ratified by the Senate in 1988. It came into force in 1989. Five years ago, the United Nations announced that the upper ozone layer over the Northern Hemisphere should be healed by the 2030s, and the hole over the Antarctic should be gone 30 years after that. President Reagan's leadership is to be credited, but it also helped quite a bit that there was support in the business community for developing alternatives to the ozone-depleting chemicals, and that there was not a multibillion-dollar industry such as big oil denying facts, with politicians in their pockets. In terms of its mendacity, the oil and gas industry is quite comparable to big tobacco. They knew what the product was doing. They hid it. Then they shaded the truth, fighting facts all the way.
