I'm Brianna Keilar in Washington.And, right now, authorities in New York and Washington are on high alert, preparing for potential unrest if former President Donald Trump is indicted. According to an internal memo shared with CNN, all NYPD officers are expected to be in uniform and ready to deploy. These are images that you're seeing now out of New York today, so far small gatherings of pro-Trump and anti-Trump demonstrators. And then, in Florida, protesters are outside of Trump's home in Mar-a-Lago. The district attorney in Manhattan has given no timeline on when Trump could be charged for his alleged role in hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels. The former president has claimed that he could be arrested today and has called on his supporters to protest. CNN's Kara Scannell is following all of this. So, Kara, what more do we know about these preparations for what's really an unprecedented moment in U.S. history, a former president criminally charged?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Brianna, it is an unprecedented time.I mean, right now, we have just -- we're seeing a small buildup of police presence, but it's really very low-key and calm around the courthouse. It's more the things behind the scenes, the increased security cameras, the barricades that they have in place for potential deployment, if necessary. And, as you mentioned, there was the internal memo telling people to be in uniform today and ready to deploy, if anything were to take off, any protests to take off,given former President Trump's tweet over the weekend asking his followers to protest this potential indictment. I mean, right now, around me, it's mostly reporters. There are a couple of individual groups who have stopped by the courthouse to just make their thoughts known, but it's not a big event here yet in terms of any sort of protest activity, because we're all still in this waiting game of when will the district attorney make a decision of whether to charge the former president? What sources tell us is that they are looking at this hush money payment and Trump's alleged role in it. They're focusing on whether Trump was involved in any falsification of business records. Remember, Michael Cohen reimbursed -- Michael Cohen was reimbursed for advancing that $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels. And he has said he submitted a false invoice to the Trump Organization, and federal prosecutors said that the Trump Organization had incorrectly docketed that in their books as a legal expense. That is a misdemeanor in New York. So the question is, would they bring this as a felony case. The lowest felon in New York will be falsifying business records to conceal or commit another crime. The question here is, would that crime be campaign finance? In the federal case that Michael Cohen pled guilty to, he admitted under oath to making this payment, which prosecutors said was an outsized campaign contributions, something above the legal limit. The question here, is that something that the state prosecutors would bring against the former president? We did see some grand jury activity yesterday. The question is now, how long will this decision take, Brianna?",

This was seven years ago, statute of limitation. And I think, in your heart of hearts, you know too that you think this is just political.

That was a little bit fuzzy in terms of just taking a look at the New York state election laws. There's obviously a federal campaign finance law he could try to bootstrap to. That would be a little bit novel for the state DA to be using the federal law. It's certainly theoretically possible, but that might open up a better argument by Trump's team, maybe something like preemption, for example. The other intriguing possibility is, he could try to link it to some of the other financial crimes that were involved. And he'd have to show that when Cohen was involved with, let's say, bank fraud or tax fraud, that Trump knew about that, and that could be part of what was being covered up through that falsification. So we won't really know until we see the indictment. But there is sort of a menu of choices for him.",

STODDARD, REALCLEARPOLITICS:  Well, Brianna, we know that telling his supporters that he would be arrested imminently and that they should protest only helps Trump bolster his position in the nominating process, in the primary contests. But also, for House Republicans, this is extremely productive. The truth is, they're going to run around on conservative media night after night and on the Internet fund-raising telling voters that they are going to go after this soft-on-crime prosecutor who's out to get -- liberal prosecutor who is out to get Donald Trump and that they are going to investigate the investigation. They cannot investigate a live investigation, and they cannot interfere with a pending case. But that doesn't matter. It will still meet their ends and be quite productive for them. So it's a win-win for House Republicans. This was the best case that could come first that they could call just an old misdemeanor, just a bookkeeping error. Obviously, any indictment in Georgia or at the federal level over January 6 would be far more difficult for Republicans defense. So they're pretty tickled that this is the one that came first and allowed them to set this narrative.",

China's state media reporting that the two signed a joint declaration deepening their partnership, with Putin saying he's in constant contact with Xi. A short time ago, the head of NATO said there are indicators that Russia is asking China for military help, the so-called lethal aid, for its war on Ukraine. It's something the U.S. has warned China not to do. And, today, Ukrainian officials confirmed to CNN that discussions are under way for a conversation between Xi and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. So there is so much happening here today. Let's talk about it now with Major General James \"Spider\" Marks, retired, and former U.S. Ambassador to China Gary Locke. Ambassador, to you first. What is your reaction to what you have seen from this summit so far? GARY LOCKE, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO CHINA:  Well, it's really all about show. It's trying to enhance the image of Putin, in light of the criminal charges by the International Criminal Court against him. And China simply wants to project and enhance its image as a peace-loving country trying to bring people together. But it's really all about show.

How could that change the war? BRIG. GEN. JAMES \"SPIDER\" MARKS (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Well, it certainly could. And that's kind of a reinforcement of what our intelligence community has been saying as a possibility. It certainly could change the war. But the real issue is, is that, if China is going to provide some enhanced capabilities to Russia, Russia has to have the ability to absorb those capabilities and use them effectively. To date, they have demonstrated they don't have that capability. Everything they engage with in a tactical manner is always very -- every one of those things is stovepipe. They will use artillery. It won't be in concert with maneuver. They will try maneuver. They won't necessarily use fires. They certainly engage without intelligence. So these challenges exist. This equipment by itself has to be utilized in an effective way. And I'm not sanguine the Russians know how to do it. KEILAR:  That raises some very serious questions, considering what we have seen Russia do on the battlefield and not do here in the last year. Ambassador, I wonder if that's something Xi is thinking about. What is he weighing when he's thinking, yes, maybe I will give lethal aid or, no, I'm not going to?",

Have the Ukrainians been able to achieve some operational, not just tactical, but some operational successes that will put additional pressure on Putin, so that Ukraine can possibly go to some type of a negotiating -- negotiation from an improved position?
