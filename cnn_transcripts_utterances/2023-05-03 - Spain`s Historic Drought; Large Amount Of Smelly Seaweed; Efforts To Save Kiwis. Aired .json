This is the Sau Reservoir near Barcelona, normally one of the largest bodies of freshwater in this part of Spain, but months of drought and the water levels are so low and the entire medieval village usually underwater has come to light. (On camera): The folks here say normally you`d barely be able to see even the tip of the medieval church because it would be almost fully submerged. But now as you can see the church is very much on land and the authorities here fear things will get much worse once the summer`s heat really sets in. (Voice-over): The Sau Reservoir is already at less than 10% capacity. And that`s causing hundreds of thousands of acres of farmland to dry up. All of this wheat is probably lost. Farmers, Santi Caudevilla shows me why. The grain should be milky, he said. We`re in a critical moment. If it doesn`t rain, this will end up empty. We should be seeing the grain come up to here but it`s only like this. If it doesn`t rain in the coming week the crop will be zero. But there is no rain in sight and temperatures in Spain have skyrocketed. Scientists at the Institute of Agri-Food Research and Technology are trying to find ways to make very little water go a longer way. Chief scientist Joan Girona says efficiency to be maximized.",

Dozens of towns are without water and need to get it trucked in. The village Castellcir hasn`t had any for about a year and residents say they can`t even remember the last time it rained. I don`t recall, Juan, tells me. It`s been a long time a year or more without proper rain, nothing. Back at the Sau Reservoir, authorities are actually draining most of the remaining water to prevent this precious and ever scarcer resource from getting contaminated by the sludge at the bottom of this once mighty lake.

And if you and your family are thinking about heading to any of the South Florida or Caribbeanbeaches, you might need to know that you could encounter some seaweed, and by some I mean a whole lot of it. That`s because a record-breaking amount of seaweed known as Sargassum, which can smell like rotten eggs or sulfur when it washes up on shore is starting to pile up on popular beaches threatening tourism in certain areas. Check out this NASA image which shows just how enormous this massive blob of floating seaweed is, 13 million tons of it just drifting ominously throughout the Caribbean stretching all the way to the West Coast of Africa. CNN`s Leyla Santiago reports from a beach in Key West, Florida and tells us how this seaweed phenomenon is just the tip of the iceberg with the peak expected to come later this summer.

And remember last month we talked about this but now we`re actually starting to see it come in and those record numbers that scientists predicted. So much so that take a look over here, the beach rakers here on this beach and Key West have already a wide and have already done one run through on what`s hitting the Florida coast right now. Let`s go for a walk so I can kind of show you how all of this stuff just piles up and again gets pretty smelly, because it decays out here. And as we mentioned, this is what one scientist told me it`s just the tip of the iceberg, more expected. Because when this is out there, it is not only right now a 5000-mile-long body of seaweed, it is still growing while it`s out there, so it is increasing in the amount that will be headed this way.

When it comes to capital cities, Wellington New Zealand is as low as you can go sitting at 41 degrees south. Now when you think of New Zealand, you might think of Kiwis which is the country`s iconic national bird but the population of these flightless birds has plummeted. Conservationists say that most people have never seen a kiwi in the wild and estimate that there are only about 70,000 of them left in the country. But as our Michael Holmes tells us there are now efforts to keep this species alive and thriving in New Zealand. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
