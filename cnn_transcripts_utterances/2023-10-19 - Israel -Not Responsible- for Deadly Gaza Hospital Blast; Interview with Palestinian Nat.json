And the United States now echoing Israel's claim that the explosion was the result of an errant rocket fired by the Palestinian Islamic jihad. New video appears to show a rocket fired from Gaza exploding high above Gaza City just before the blast at that hospital. And on the ground, this was the moment of the explosion outside the hospital. CNN has not determined if these Events are related. President Joe Biden says he believes U.S. intelligence. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  I don't say things like that unless I have faith in the source from which I've gotten. The people at the Defense Department who I respect and the Intelligence Community that I respect, it is highly improbable that Israel did that. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Assaults that have left buildings across Gaza flattened and huge craters in the ground. At the hospital today, charred vehicles littered the parking lot, which is pockmarked and has a small crater.

Well, I bring in Dr. Mustafa Barghouti, who is the president of the Palestinian National Initiative and a member of the Palestinian parliament, joining me now from Ramallah in the West Bank. It's good to have you, sir.We are hearing reports that the IDF has conducted raids in the West Bank and arrested several, perhaps even hundreds of Palestinians. I do, with you, want to concentrate on what you can tell us about what is happening there, what you are seeing on the ground, sir. DR. MUSTAFA BARGHOUTI, PRESIDENT, PALESTINIAN NATIONAL INITIATIVE: There is a massive Israeli operation to arrest Palestinians. Our information is that no less than 700 Palestinians have -- additional Palestinians have been arrested during the last 10 days, and every night they are conducting more and more arrests. The number of Palestinian prisoners now in Israeli jails is up to 6,300, including more less than 1,500 of people who are in jail without knowing why. They're not charged, they're not taken to court, there is no due legal process, and that's what they call administrative detention, including, by the way, no less than 200 children who are now in Israeli jails. But in addition to that, what we face here, which is very serious, is settler terror. The settlers are attacking several communities and several villages. So far, 20 Palestinian communities in Ramallah and Hebron area in Jordan Valley have been evicted from their homes by Israeli settlers protected by the Israeli army. And sometimes they kill people like has happened in Kusra, which is a Palestinian village in the north near Nablus, where the settlers attacked the village, killed three people. The army then came and killed a fourth person. And on the next day, during the funeral of these four people, the settlers attacked again and killed the father and his son.",

We met a family who were driven -- or who were leaving their home because they felt they simply couldn't stay. It was the home that was originally attacked, and at the heart of that incident.So, we were told by the mayor of Al-Khutra (ph) that the violence against settlers, this ongoing violence -- the violence against the Palestinian residents by settlers, sorry, this ongoing violence is driving young Palestinians, he said, towards combat. He said that they would rather die in combat than be humiliated and killed in their homes. We are seeing escalating violence in the West Bank. How concerned are you? DR. BARGHOUTI:  Very much so. 50 percent of Palestinians in Gaza as -- are children and 50 percent -- about 78 percent of the Palestinians in the West Bank are young people and children. And of course, these people have no hope. And what they see is continuous aggression on them. They see their people being killed. They say -- they see that Israel has -- is not subjected to any form of accountability. And especially now, with this western support to Israel. Israel feels completely impunitive to international law. And they are encouraging these settlers. One of the main reasons why this whole situation exploded in Gaza was that during -- because -- before the war started in Gaza, no less than 248 Palestinians were killed by settlers in the West Bank and by the army, and 40 of them were children. More than that, settlers tried to burn whole towns like Hawara and Turmus Ayya, where American Palestinians live. And they burned houses. They burned cars. They threatened people. They killed.",

It seems that Israel is resistance to that -- is resistant to that temporary ceasefire at this point.Is there any one country, at this point, is there any single individual or country who can be the voice of reason now, do you believe between all parties? DR. BARGHOUTI:  I don't know if there is a person who can be accepted as a mediator between all parties. Maybe Guterres can be -- can play that role, but I don't think he has the sufficient strength to do so. But I think the one person who could stop all these atrocities immediately is President Biden. But to do that he has to stop saying that he's teaming up with the Israelis and calls him -- calls them our team. He cannot be on the team of one side while one side is committing war crimes against the other. He has to be -- he has to take a different position. And that's why I think the United States much -- must immediately change its position and allow the passage of a resolution in the Security Council to have immediate ceasefire. There is one country in the world that has leverage over Israel and can stop these atrocities, for the sake of Palestinians and Israelis, and that is the United States of America.",

Although we now have documentary evidence that Hamas intended to inflict the maximum possible human casualties there and to hold hostages. A highly detailed street map found on another Hamas gunman and obtained by CNN shows individual buildings in Sa'ad identified and assessed for their military value. The communal kitchen, for example, is described as the main place suitable for holding hostages. Inside the guard room, the soldiers must be neutralized, the Hamas instructions say. While the kibbutz dental clinic is designated a place for first aid for both enemies and friends. Israeli residents of Sa'ad say they also found that level of detail astounding.

It is a dark turn. Even for a group seen here parading before the attacks, that's come to symbolize the uncompromising face of Palestinian resistance and violence against Israel. Israeli officials say a document referencing ISIS and al-Qaeda, which CNN has not been able to authenticate, was found on one Hamas gunman killed during this attack on kibbutz Be'eri. The document given to CNN by a senior Israeli government official praises jihad against Jews and crusaders. Israeli officials say that's evidence Hamas is increasingly influenced by global jihadi ideology, an assessment many experts have dismissed. But in the wake of the unprecedented brutality of these attacks, U.S. officials tell CNN the Hamas threat may now be reassessed. Matthew Chance, CNN Israel. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
