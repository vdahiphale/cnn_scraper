Hezbollah is claiming success in what it calls the first phase of its retaliatory strikes on Israel. The militant group says, it has fired some 300 rockets in recent hours as Israel's air defenses worked to shoot them down. Earlier, Israel said, it struck Hezbollah militants in Lebanon as they were preparing to launch their attacks. Israel says, its strikes are continuing. Hezbollah was responding to the recent killing of its top military commander near Beirut. Israel is accusing the group of endangering Lebanese civilians. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Nic to you, first, the region has been on edge for a month, really, since the Israeli assassination of Fuad Shukr, the Hezbollah Commander, in the southern suburbs of Beirut.And now, it appears we have confirmation that Hezbollah has now begun its retaliation for that attack. Explain to us how this is being received in Israel, how the Israeli military is now retaliating, and give us a sense of the mood on the ground in Tel Aviv. Well, the military has been postured for a long time, particularly, the Air Force, to counter strike ahead of any perceived threat, and that's what the IDF is saying they did last night. Right now, Israel's security cabinet is still meeting. Right now, you can hear fighter jets in the skies above Tel Aviv. So, right now, this is still an active ongoing dynamic, I would say, assessment situation by the Israeli military, and politicians here, to consider what Hezbollah has a) done in terms of its attempted missile launches, b) in terms of what the IDF has been able to achieve in its counter strikes, and see, if you will, decide whether or not more counter strikes of the type that Israel said they took last night are necessary. We know that the Home Front Command here has been put on a heightened state of alert. And the message over the past month or so here has been no change to that Home Front instruction for the civilians of Israel in terms of their preparedness in case of attack. That has changed, and that remains in place, no gatherings of more than 30 people allowed from Tel Aviv all the way to the northern border. The air raid shelters in Haifa have been opened in the north. One lady was injured by shrapnel in Acre in the north. So, the country is now postured on a much greater sort of readiness, if you will, not just the military, as we've seen over the past month, but for civilians as well, to be aware, and prepared for more incoming strikes. But I think, the point of where everything is at right now will be inside that ongoing security cabinet meeting where they decide Israel's next moves.",

      "sentences": "Ivan, we've seen two statements put out early in the morning from Hezbollah, saying that they have begun the response to the 30th of July killing of Senior Hezbollah Military Commander, Fuad Shukr in the southern suburbs of Beirut. In their second statement, they said then, in the first phase of their response to that assassination, they conducted 11 strikes focused on Israeli military positions.And in that statement it said that, that those targets were intentional to allow the passage of drones into the depth of Israel, and that they have passed. So, on the assumption they saying, it's the first phase there, we must assume there is a second phase to the best of -- the best of our knowledge, it hasn't happened yet. Now, the official Lebanese national news agency is reporting the most intense strikes on South Lebanon since the 8th of October, when those cross- border exchanges of fire began. They say, one Syrian has been has been injured. These are obviously preliminary reports, and we know that there aren't a lot of civilians left in southern Lebanon at this point, more than 100,000 have fled to safer ground further north, and so, we're just waiting to see what happens next. Now, regarding the situation in Beirut, I've seen now four commercial aircraft coming into the airport. So, it doesn't appear that the airport has in, there's one coming right now, has stopped its operations. But certainly, this is something people have been waiting now for almost four weeks to see how Hezbollah will respond to these to the assassination of Fuad Shukr. What we've seen, certainly, in the last few days, is an intensification of cross-border fire. Hezbollah has said that yesterday, for instance, it launched 12 strikes on Israeli targets, the day before 15 strikes. So, it's been running on an average of well over 10 for probably the last week, and of course, we have seen also strikes well inside Lebanon by Israeli war planes, two significant ones on what appear to be weapons depots in the Beqaa Valley, one in the central Beqaa Valley, one further north. Now, the Israelis are saying that they were able to take out launchers in the south of the country. Until now, the strikes are limited to the south. We shall see if they spread further north. But, it's worth noting that Hezbollah's real high value weaponry, its long range precision missiles, are clearly not near the Israeli border. They keep them further away. And it does not appear that, at least today, those facilities that house those high value weapons have not been struck yet. Ivan?",

Those battle groups include naval vessels that have, what we call, a ballistic missile system, the technical title are standard missiles, the Block 2 Offshore, could provide and would provide the type of defense by when a similar situation took place.But a situation that has now been discounted, we have amongst ourselves, American forces, what we have in both the Mediterranean the Red Sea, we also have the patriot systems. Those systems are shared, meaning that, we have systems deployed in Jordan, in the Emirates, and those systems themselves were used a couple of months ago, will most probably be used now, if we see what Hezbollah is suggesting as Phase 2, which is a much more significant assault and attack on Israel. So, we have those systems. So, those are the type of weapons that I think are most prominent, the systems from the U.S. and its allies that can provide some level of protection to Israel, and perhaps, as we saw in July, if we're successful, if Israel and its allies, U.S., are successful in basically blocking these multiple rocket and drone attach, so that the damage is insignificant, and the damage does not affect civilian population centers, maybe, just maybe, both sides will stand down.",

There was zero tourism coming into Israel during the summer. So, so that, that should be one indication.Look, the public is anxious, and it is still devastated from October 7, and I don't think people are prepared for a broad escalation. The question, obviously, is Ivan, what kind of escalation are we looking at? Because we're in a vicious circle right now, in which, Israel's response depends on how former Hezbollah will retaliate and escalate, and then, Hezbollah's retaliation is dependent on the scope of Israel's reprisal. So, we're in this vicious cycle that, that it is almost impossible for an economy, for a society, and even for individuals, to cope with and adequately prepare for.",

There's a Prime Minister who most Israelis, in consistent polls, is interested in his political survival, rather than in national security. While people justified the war in Gaza after the debacle and the catastrophe of October 7, a few short months after that, they ceased to understand what the political goals were.And then, came the Hezbollah front, which actually began in October, but it deteriorated significantly at the beginning of 2024, and that already is seven or eight months ago. And so, the government keeps on talking about the need to deal with Hezbollah and the need to destroy Hamas in Gaza. But no, the government, at least, is not making the connection. In fact, Ivan, Israel has rejected the American concept or notion, that these are two connecting vessels, meaning that only a ceasefire in Gaza could de-escalate the situation in Lebanon. And what Hezbollah has been doing is jumping, you know, taking a hitchhike, so to speak, on the war in Gaza, but that Israel has no political goals vis-a-vis Hezbollah. And so, people are not necessarily making the connections, nor is the government, except, and I need to add, that this, this caters to or serves Mr. Netanyahu's narrative, according to which, this is not about October 7, and this is not about the Hamas -- Hamas terror attack, but this is a great war, 360-degree war, he calls it, against Islamofascism centered in Iran, spreading its long arms or wings via proxies, and that this is a general war.

Obviously, within the Shiite community itself, there is support, not unanimous in any sense of the word. Keep in mind that 100,000 people have had to flee their homes in the predominantly Shiite towns and villages in the south, and there's a certain amount of resentment that that has happened. But at the same time, the Shiite community, which is a large minority here in Lebanon, by and large, is supportive of Hezbollah.Keep in mind that it was Hezbollah that between 1985 and 2000 was the only Arab military force in history that was able to drive Israel out of occupied territory without any sort of negotiations. Hezbollah is also very attentive to the needs of its community, keeping in mind, of course, as you well know, Ivan, that the Lebanese central government is weak, largely bankrupt, and is unable to provide basic services, which Hezbollah, because of its support from Iran, because of its abilities, provides many of those services. There is -- so yes, there is support. And for instance, I was speaking to a resident of southern Beirut, a Shiite, who was telling me that, for instance, yes, I go out, I drink whiskey and beer. I'm not a good Muslim, but nonetheless, when it comes to the breach, if it's necessary, he stands firmly behind Hezbollah and Hassan Nasrallah, the Secretary General of that organization. On the other hand, there are many, many Lebanese who deeply resent the fact that Hezbollah is, for all intents and purposes, a state within a state that acts independently of the, albeit, very weak Lebanese central government. They feel that Lebanon has been sucked into this war against their will, and the country has suffered as a result. Many people say, for instance, just across the street from the man who told me he drinks whiskey and supports Hezbollah, I met another man who told me, Gaza is not our war. This is Lebanon. We don't want anything to do with it. So, opinion is very divided, but because Hezbollah is the best organized, most disciplined political party, in addition to military force in Lebanon, that seems to be able to allow them to act independently of the government itself.
