Also tonight, there's still dangerous remnants of Tropical Storm Hilary. What more it might do after drenching Southern California and Nevada with more rain than they normally see all year. And a shop owner in California, Lauri Carleton murdered for displaying a rainbow pride flag. Her daughter speaking out tonight about how her mom lived a life of love and acceptance. Good evening. Thanks for joining us. We begin with the breaking news, and there is a lot of it this evening. First, late word that the former president will surrender to authorities Thursday in his fourth indictment. That's what two sources familiar with the plan tell us. It is just one of a string of late developments kicking off a week in which he and 18 others, these people here all have to turn themselves in. But it is his surrender, of course, that is generating most of the headlines, including more threats against those handling it. A source familiar with the matter telling CNN, and we're being very careful with the language here, the threats have been made against Fulton County Sheriff's office employees and their homes for their role on Thursday. That's in the wake of recent similar threats against DA Fani Willis. We learned about this shortly after Mr. Trump's attorneys agreed to a $200,000.00 bond deal. It his is first time paying any money upfront in his four indictments. The agreement explicitly forbids him from using social media to \"intimidate any person known to him or her to be a co-defendant or witness in this case, or to otherwise obstruct the administration of justice.\" There is also this breaking item, a new filing from Special Counsel Jack Smith, rebutting the Trump team's effort to push the January 6 trial to April of 2026. We'll have more details on that shortly. And also tonight, an arrest in Illinois. A woman there charged with threatening to kill the former president and his youngest son, Barron. As we said, a lot going on. CNN's Paula Reid outside the Fulton County courthouse starts us off. Paula, is it clear why the former president won't just be released on his own recognizance?",

That's your first time going before the judge.'Now, in this case, even though this is his fourth indictment, this is the first time that he has had to post cash bond. He is also subject to a lot of other restrictions that are unique clearly tailored to him, including being barred from threatening anyone else involved in this case, especially on social media, because we've seen him attack judges, prosecutors, witnesses in this case. And this appears tailored to him because we've seen four other defendants today negotiate their bond agreements, anywhere from ten to a hundred thousand dollars. And while they're also barred from talking to their co-defendants, none of them have this social media provision. So that's five defendants of the 19 in this case, 14 more to go with these bond agreements.",

And so prosecutors and judges are going to have to use their judgment, but for every close call, like this example, with Mike Pence, there have been many that are far over the line and really, the question is going to be how tightly do prosecutors and the judge police this because everyone in this case has been threatened somehow.",

He has been on the bench for just a short time, less than a year. It will be interesting to see how he decides to run it. I will agree with this premise, and that is, the line that's going to have to be walked will be about what he can say politically versus -- and defend himself politically versus what he could do to sort of throw gas on the fire on his criminal case. And so I think that's going to be the danger, and the danger will be the prosecutors filing too many motions or making too many requests to sanction him in some way and then getting shot down. So hopefully, they will reserve sort of the nuclear option of having a bond revocation or something like that until he does something that is clearly an overt threat, encouraging people, responding to a tweet, you know, or responding to something that is politically have been said to him or a challenge that has been made by one of his political opponents.

So from the jail to the courthouse and all of that, the coordination between the Secret Service and local law enforcement is going to be important, but these kinds of threats are different than when we are talking about threatening grand jurors or threatening jurors, threatening witnesses. I think law enforcement by and large, they are used to dealing with people who are recalcitrant, and who want to say crazy things and do crazy things. That's what the nature of their job is.

We have a date.We know today his legal team negotiated a $100,000 bond agreement with the Fulton County District Attorney. And now he will turn himself in on Wednesday. Now, it's notable that this date came out in a separate disciplinary, a state bar disciplinary proceeding. He is facing those proceedings in the state of California. And his lawyer had to tell the judge, I'm sorry, my client can't be here on Tuesday or Wednesday because he's surrendering in Fulton County.

Now, that was originally an idea that was put forth by one of his co-defendants, Kenneth Chesebro. He put that forward, and then John Eastman actually, and some other lawyers expanded on it. But John Eastman, in many ways is really the architect of this effort to overturn the election, trying to make legal arguments that have been widely discredited by most legal experts about how the vice president had the authority to overturn the election. And, you know, I can tell you, Anderson, many legal experts, many sources were somewhat surprised that he and others were not formally charged in the January 6th federal case.

We know Rudy Giuliani recently asked him for money.Mark Meadows is pretty much left the former president in the dark about what his legal strategy is. And Johnny Eastman has and his attorney have been trying to keep their distance as well. So it should not be an issue specifically when it comes to Eastman. The bigger thing, I think, in terms of the former president's bond restrictions is that that restriction on social media and anything that can be perceived as a threat on social media, that right now, based on what we saw today in the bond agreement, that I think is going to be the biggest challenge for the former president and potentially for the judge overseeing this case.",
