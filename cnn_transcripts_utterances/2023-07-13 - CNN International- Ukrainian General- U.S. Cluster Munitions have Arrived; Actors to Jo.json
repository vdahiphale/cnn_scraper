And it will be seen as a defining moment, not potentially because they played a part, but because they just showed that unity and resolve.They are two additional nations joined NATO, and that center, a very hard message to Russia and a message to support Ukraine. So I think yes, in the future, it could be but I think the jury's out at the moment, but that seems to be that trajectory. I mean, it's interesting as well, if you just look back five years, where President Biden is today meeting with these Nordic leaders five years ago, right now. President Trump at the time was meeting with President Putin, how much things have changed. That was a U.S. President that bought the message of President Putin over and above the message of own intelligence services. Now we're in a completely new page.",

Officials say at least one person was killed in the Ukrainian capital amid falling debris. And CNN's Alex Marquardt joins us now live from Dnipro in Eastern Ukraine.

General Tarnavskyi also acknowledges that these can be very dangerous of course for civilians and that they won't be fired in heavily populated areas, Bianca. That was part of the agreements that Ukraine struck with the United States in getting these weapons. Here's a bit more of what the General had to say earlier today. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
