That was with Elon Musk on X.Any of those leaders, of course, could be trying to interfere with the U.S. election. The former president's team is blaming Iran for hacking their campaign in June. According to multiple sources, the hackers compromised the personal email account of longtime Trump operative Roger Stone, stealing sensitive documents from the campaign. A source telling CNN overnight that in June the FBI briefed the then Biden-Harris campaign on Iranian efforts to hack them as well. Let's bring in CNN political commentator, former Trump defense Secretary, Mark Esper. Mr. Secretary, thank you so much for being here.",

And it's more often the latter, how they try and influence, cause social discord, et cetera, in our elections.And the principal players have been Russia, number one. This year, secondly, Iran. And then a distant third, China. And then there are others. North Korea is in there. A lot of other countries trying to sow discord or influence our elections. It's completely feasible that it is Iran behind this. Iran does not want Trump to get back into office. They had a very bad experience with him during that time. Of course, it was the ending of the nuclear accord. And then finally, at the end of the administration, the killing of Qasem Soleimani. So, they do not want Trump back in office, that's for sure. So, it's - it could be - it could be him. But we, again, know that others are trying to sow discord as well.",

If you look across the map at other potential nefarious actors in this, I mean there's, obviously, been a lot of conversations about the Russians and their potential involvement.

And they have been trying to sow discord going all the way back to elections, right? So, you know, it's - it gets a little bit less clear, but one might argue that, yes, they'd be more inclined to have, for sure, Trump in office because Trump has said that he was - does not support Ukraine, that he has challenged NATO and other things. So, one might say that they favor him more than the other.Xi Jinping and China, again, a little bit more unclear, although Trump has promised to levy across the board tariffs and upwards of a 65 percent tariff on Chinese goods coming into the country. So again, these are probably the three principal actors. North Korea is in there as well. And all these are trying to, again, not interfere as much - it's very hard to interfere in the United States elections - but influence them by sowing discord through misinformation, disinformation, just stirring things up is what they're aiming to do. HUNT: Sir, while I have you, I also want to ask you about what's going on in Israel also with Iran because we've been sort of waiting with bated breath for a response to the killing of the Hamas political leader, and it still has not come and we did learn that Hamas is going to go back to the negotiating table around a ceasefire and a hostage deal in Gaza, as we're still waiting here and we've sent a nuclear submarine to the region. Of course, very rare that we would announce that we are doing that. Why do you think it has stretched this long? And what are you looking for next?",

And he, a Brad said, he certainly had that connection.But he also ultimately won Pennsylvania, in part with margins in Philadelphia, with margins with voters of color, black voters in Philly. And, obviously, I think Kamala Harris has a message that thus far we see as resonating as we watch - as we see some of this polling over the last week, just in the, you know, Siena poll, you see black voters starting to come home in - in some of these swing states where, you know, Biden had been struggling. So, you know, I think there's definitely a path for her here to rebuild that winning coalition. But, no question, Pennsylvania is going to be absolutely huge. I would expect to see her there are lots making the case. And - and it is going to - it's absolutely going to be probably decisive at the end of the day. : You know one more thing is, Pennsylvania is moving rights slowly. It has been moving right for 20 years. The registration difference between Republicans and Democrats is down to almost 300,000 people. It was 600,000 four years ago in the last race.

I mean John Adams - good old John Adams said it was the most insignificant office in the history of man. But it becomes significant, just as you suggest. That's not a great resume for a vice president, right, but 15 of the 45, 46 presidents have become president, either by the resignation or the - or the death, or they win the election in their own right. So, that's almost one third. So that makes it really important.But in the old days, when the political bosses were choosing the candidates and the vice presidents, because we didn't and have the primary system, they really were just choosing them to balance the ticket so the candidate they wanted for the nomination for the president would have somebody that he needed to win another state. So, for example, when Rutherford B. Hayes from Ohio was chosen as the nominee, they chose William Wheeler of New York to balance him. And he said, I'm ashamed to say, I don't even know who William Wheeler is. So, that just showed how insignificant it seemed to be in that kind. And then when Teddy Roosevelt was made to be vice president, because they wanted him out of New York, because he was too progressive in New York, and he felt he couldn't turn it down because he would look like he was too snobby, he hated every minute of it. He said, I'm so bored, I'm going back to law school. I need something meaningful to do. And even old Lyndon Johnson felt it was the most miserable time of his life, that he had been such a powerful majority leader and now he was shriveling up day by day. It was really not until good old Carter brought Mondale in and gave him an office in the West Wing. As you can imagine, Kasie, that matters everything. You're in the West Wing. You're right in the center of power. You can hobnob with the people there. You're not over in the executive office building. And then that changed and Mondale became an important vice president. Gore was an important vice president. Cheney was an important vice president. And now I suspect that it's not only that Walz might help her win, but that he's going to be a person who will have real responsibilities once he gets in there.",
