So Jared Isaacman, if you talk to him, he really sees this as a chance to not just help SpaceX, a private company, but really, in his mind, all of humanity in order to achieve SpaceX's goal and his own personal dream of making humanity multi-planetary and not just all of us being beholden to living on planet Earth.
