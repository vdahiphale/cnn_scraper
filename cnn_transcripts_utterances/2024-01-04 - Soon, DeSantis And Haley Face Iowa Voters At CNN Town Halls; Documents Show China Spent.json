We're setting the stage for our back-to-back town halls with Donald Trump's top GOP rivals. And I'll speak with another Republican in the race, Chris Christie, this hour.Also tonight, newly released documents reveal that China and other foreign governments spent millions, millions at various Trump owned properties while he was president. We're following the money trail. And ISIS is now claiming responsibility for a pair of deadly explosions in Iran. Stand by for new details on the terror group's apparent motives and how this attack could impact wartime tensions in the Middle East. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Will Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. In Iowa tonight, the most heated rivalry of the Republican presidential race is taking center stage. Behind me are live pictures from Des Moines where Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley will soon appear in back-to-back CNN town hall events. Right now, let's go to CNN's Kristen Holmes. She's joining us live from Sioux City in Iowa. Kristen, with the Iowa caucuses now only eleven days away, what are we hearing from the candidates? KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Wolf, what we're hearing is a lot of ramped up rhetoric in the fight for second place. I mean, the thing to keep in mind here is that as Haley's poll numbers have continued to grow, Ron DeSantis has used every opportunity to attack her. Many of his attacks really centered around these comments that she made in New Hampshire to voters there about their importance in the primary. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Because history does tell you Iowa often supports one candidate and New Hampshire says, thanks but no thanks and supports somebody else. She's not supposed to talk like that. Now, how big of a deal? I don't know. I think the bigger question is this is the second unforced error in just a couple of weeks for Nikki Haley. When she was asked about the civil war, she forgot to mention slavery as the key cause, the central cause, the central reason of the civil war, the war of the states. And so it's another unforced error by a candidate who has had some momentum. How much momentum is an interesting question. But the old cliche in politics, if you're explaining you're losing, you don't want to be cleaning up. She wants to be building support, not trying to keep what she has.

In fact, the Chinese government alone spent more than $5.5 million at Trump properties during just two years of Trump's presidency, which is significantly more than any other foreign country.And we should also point out that that number is likely only a tiny fraction of the overall payments that Trump's businesses actually received because this report, Wolf, only covers two years of the Trump presidency and only accounts for a handful of Trump's businesses. So, the question really here is whether that money influenced Trump's policymaking. One example cited in this report was that Trump declined to issue sanctions on the Chinese bank despite the fact that the DOJ had issued a complaint and accused the Chinese bank of conspiring with North Korea to avoid sanctions. And that bank, Wolf, was one of the largest tenants of Trump Tower. Now, a lot of these lease agreements were happening before Trump became president, so it's complicated. It's not a clear cut and dry issue here. And meanwhile, the Trump Organization has denied any wrongdoing. But we should point out that this report from House Democrats is coming as House Republicans are pursuing an impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden over his son's foreign business deals. But at this point, Republicans have not proved that Biden has personally profited or made any policy decisions because of those foreign business deals. So, no doubt, Democrats going to try to use this report to draw a contrast between Biden and Trump ahead of a potential impeachment and ahead of the 2024 election, Wolf.",

I think all of us know that he never really let go of his business interests while he was president.And so these are things that just continue to add to the reasons why he's unfit to be president of the United States again.

What is ISIS saying, Nic, about this attack? NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR:  Yes. ISIS is saying that they used two suicide bombers, two brothers, in fact, to attack and kill those civilians in Iran. Indeed, they are claiming to have killed over 300 people at that attack. Now, part of the rationale they laid out as well was that Iran is using its Sunni neighbors as proxies for its own fight, for its own end. So, this is a critique ISIS is leveling at Iran here. And also they're targeting Soleimani, it appears the memory of him, the memorial, because they saw him as part of the coalition trying to bring down ISIS. So, they're saying they're responsible. Their story is not quite matching up to what Iran said. Iran had said that one of the bombs at least was in a suitcase, that it was remotely detonated. ISIS is saying suicide bombers. But the pattern and the style of attack, killing a large number of innocent civilians, is very typical of ISIS.

We have the killing of the Hamas leader in Beirut under the noses of Hezbollah, the Iranian proxy there, and just about ten days prior to that, the killing of an important Iranian commander inside Syria. No one claimed responsibility for that, but the indications were that it was very likely Israel.So, I asked the former head of the IDF's military intelligence, Amos Yadlin, what he thought about the rise in all these strikes. And he said he believed at the moment that they were underneath a threshold that could lead to an escalation. And part of the rationale for that is because that whatever is done at the moment, even the fact that Iran has sent a destroyer to the Red Sea to apparently back up for Houthis in their attacks against shipping and Israel from there, that even if that destroyer ship was sunk, that Israel -- that rather Iran wouldn't strike back. This is how he told me. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) AMOS YADLIN, FORMER HEAD, IDF'S MILITARY INTELLIGENCE DIRECTORATE:  I think the Iranians will be very, very careful, even if after a provocation they will suffer a loss, but starting a war with the U.S. or even with Israel, they are not there yet.

JASON CROW (D-CO):  Well, Wolf, good to be with you. I mean, that the ISIS conflict and their attacks throughout the region date back decades now and really centuries. This is the Sunni-Shia conflict that we see playing out in a lot of different ways throughout the Middle East. So, it is interesting to see a large-scale attack like this in Iran and what Iran's response is going to be to combat ISIS. But ISIS has been a problem in Afghanistan, has been a problem in Syria and, of course, it was a huge problem in Iraq. We were able to help address that problem with our counter-ISIS campaign and we still have thousands of troops in the region Iraq and Syria and other places to help our allies address it. But, of course, Iran is not an ally but they've been caught up in this fighting as well.",

And I would remind Donald Trump, there is no border wall. Where is that southern border wall that you promised Republicans and didn't deliver on? So, the more the former president gets nervous about her, the more it means Nikki is doing the right thing. And she's campaigning, right? She's on the trail. She's engaging with voters.

She's listening to the voters. Again, I think the last three polls in Iowa have those two basically dead even, DeSantis and Nikki, and that gets the DeSantis people nervous.

She said in the document that she and Epstein had a conversation and, quote, he said one time that Clinton likes them young, referring to girls. When asked if Clinton was a friend of Epstein's, she said she understood Epstein had, quote, dealings with Clinton. Clinton has not been accused of any crime to wrongdoing related to Epstein and has denied any kind of criminal activity. A spokesperson for Clinton on Wednesday reiterated that Clinton knew nothing of Epstein's crimes. Sjoberg also recalled the time she was with Epstein on one of his planes. And a pilot said he needed to land in Atlantic City. Jeffrey said, great, we'll call up Trump and go to, I don't recall the name of the casino but we will go to the casino. She says in the deposition she never gave a massage to Trump. In 2002, Trump called Epstein a terrific guy but later said he threw Epstein out of his Mar-a-Lago club. Trump is not accused of any wrongdoing. When CNN asked for a statement, the Trump campaign responded by attacking the media. The documents also contain excerpts of a deposition taken from the woman behind the lawsuit, Virginia Roberts Giuffre who previously reached an out of court settlement in a separate sexual abuse lawsuit against Prince Andrew. Giuffre alleged in her deposition that she was Epstein's sex slave and Maxwell directed her to have sexual contact with people including Prince Andrew, and former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson who died last year. But, Prince Andrew and Richardson have denied wrongdoing. A spokesperson for Richardson denied he had ever met Giuffre.
