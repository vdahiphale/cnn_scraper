Just last hour before they went behind closed doors, President Biden spoke to cameras, we brought that to you, and he reiterated the United States unwavering support for Ukraine, also rolling out a new $225 million aid package for Ukraine.And now, very soon in Normandy, Biden is going to attempt to underscore the threats that he says democracy faces from the likes of Vladimir Putin in Europe after the invasion of Ukraine, as well as probably the subtext, Donald Trump at home. The speech is going to take place at the same site where Republican President Ronald Reagan 40 years ago delivered what's regarded as a most memorable speech on these issues, freedom and democracy. For Reagan then it was a crucial moment during his reelection campaign. That connection definitely not lost on Biden.

And for that President Biden apologized to Zelenskyy. Here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I apologize for the weeks not knowing what's going on in terms of funding and because we had trouble getting the bill that we had to pass that had the money in it.

With me now, CNN military analyst, retired Lieutenant General Mark Hertling, former commanding general in U.S. Army Europe in Seventh Army, and David Sanger, CNN political and national security analyst. It's good to see you both.David, I want to start with you because, look, the president is stepping into this moment and this setting 40 years after Ronald Reagan also delivered a speech here in what many have described as one of his more iconic moments. What are you going to be listening for in this speech today? DAVID E. SANGER, CNN POLITICAL AND NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST:  Well, there's a political element to this that comes from the fact that he is speaking from exactly where Reagan spoke at the 40th anniversary, and that looms over everybody as a speech that was probably one of the most notable and memorable of Reagan's presidency. And it came just as he was running for reelection. And there are some around Walter Mondale, who was running against him, who thought that that speech actually did a lot of damage to Mondale along the way. So you can expect that the president will invoke the imagery, and then say that the battle for Ukraine is the successor 80 years later of this effort to keep Europe whole and keep Europe free. And he will basically turn Putin, I think, along the way into the force that needs to be contained here. The question is, how far he's willing to go in a moment that, of course, the momentum in the war has turned toward the Russians. The president hasn't really given a speech in Europe on this since that happened.",

When we look at today in particular, and this climate in particular politically, and David, I know you alluded to this a little bit, when Reagan spoke, he was also viewed by some as tools to be the running for election. And then again, it turned into one of his more iconic moments. That's obviously a criticism that has been lobbed at President Biden as well at this point.

You're right, the Reagan age issue was there, though, of course at the time, he was a lot younger than President Biden is today, or than former President Trump is.The second element, though, of this is that the president has got to figure out how to make this about Donald Trump without naming Donald Trump. And I think the answer to that is to associate Trump with the isolationist movement that he alluded to when he talked about the conservative Republicans to President Zelenskyy who had held up the Ukraine aide. Basically, at this point, a segment, a large segment of the Republican party that had been the most anti-communist, the most anti-Soviet Union, and even the most anti-Russia has now turned basically to say this is not a war and a conflict for us. And I think you can expect to hear the president basically say, we have voices like this in the United States, in the America First movement, the Lindbergh American first movement of the 1930s. And we're seeing it again today.",
