Well,flags are flying at half-staff at the White House and across the United States today, as the country remembers its 39th President. Arrangements for a state funeral are underway now for Jimmy Carter, who died on Sunday at the age of 100 surrounded by his family. He'd been in hospice care for nearly two years. Well, before becoming President in the late 1970s Carter was a peanut farmer and a U.S. Navy Lieutenant. He was elected Governor of the State of Georgia and then went on to serve one term in the White House. But it was Carter's work after leaving office that made him one of America's most celebrated former presidents. Current President, Joe Biden, knew Carter for decades, he declared January the 9th National Day of mourning and paid tribute to the man he called a dear friend. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

One of the things that the Department of Education has consistently done has leveled the playing ground when it comes to distributions of funds, things like Block grants, Pell grants, that have made it much easier passage for students of color, in particular African-American students, students of African descent, to go to not only to exist as students in their respective country, counties and towns and cities.

STELLINA MARIA RITA LOMBARDO, NON-SMOKER: I've never in my life been a smoker. I strongly agree, because smoking causes a lot of pollution. In this era, when we suffer a lot from climate change, such a measure can help to scale down the effects of pollution that's devastating the planet.

It's part of an initiative by Milan to improve the city's air quality, which on Sunday, was labeled as unhealthy for sensitive groups by an Air Quality Index.
