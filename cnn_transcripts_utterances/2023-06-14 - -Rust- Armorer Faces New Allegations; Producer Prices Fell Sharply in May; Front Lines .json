But in the filing they also say that they have the right to bring charges back against Alec Baldwin depending on what they find out about the gun.Now, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, who is going to be facing this trial in this new filing from Friday, I'm going to read to you a little bit of what the special prosecutors have written here. They say, witnesses in the current case will testify that defendant Gutierrez was drinking heavily and smoking marijuana in the evenings during the shooting of \"Rust.\" It is likely that defendant Gutierrez was hung over when she inserted a live bullet into a gun that she knew was going to be used at some point by an actor while filming a scene with other actors and crew members. So, what's significant about this is that all along the way, for the last two years, almost two years, when we've been trying to figure out, how did a live bullet get on the set.",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PLEITGEN (voice over): Ukrainian forces firing at Russian troops holed up in Blagodatnoye (ph) in south Ukraine. This video, the brigade says, shows the Russians making a final stand here. Much of the area near the front lines deeply scarred by combat. PLEITGEN (on camera): This is the area of Ukraine where the heaviest fighting is currently taking place. And you can see what it's done to a lot of the buildings in the cities and villages around this area. And that fighting is set to get even worse. PLEITGEN (voice over): We're with the 68th Jaeger brigade which has been making important gains here. The soldiers, confident and grateful for U.S. supply gear. A lot of the times it saved my life, he says. It saves our life every day from shrapnel, shelling and bullets. But some of the vehicles have already been lost and the Russians continue to fire back. Constant artillery shelling and even air strikes too close for comfort as our crew had to duck for cover. Still, the deputy brigade commander says his soldiers are just getting started. Our counterattack will definitely be successful, he says. We believe in victory. We are moving forward towards our goal. We are advancing.

It's also the reason why we're going to hear less and less information from people who might be in the courtroom in the sense of, we didn't know that Jack Smith was going to be there till the very last minute inside the court. There's safety considerations for that as well. As the rhetoric becomes increasingly more toxic, watch for the prosecutors to be more on guard about the divulging of information, the appearances and whatnot, which really is a problem for not only the sunshine laws but also what we, as the public, would like to hear about an open and transparent court proceeding.

So, why are they boosting it up to $17.96 per hour? Here's the reason why. So, this is the math behind New York City's decision. These delivery workers were only making $11 on average per hour after you take into account both tips and expenses. It's quite expensive to be a food delivery driver, right, in the city. And that, of course, is well south of the $15 minimum wage for the city's non- tip workers. So, they're boosting it up to actually get people up to the minimum wage.",
