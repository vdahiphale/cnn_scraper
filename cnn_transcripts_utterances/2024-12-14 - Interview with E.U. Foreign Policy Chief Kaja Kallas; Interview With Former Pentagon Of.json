And as the high representative acknowledged there that has not really happened. Germany, for instance, has cut below the level that the Bundeswehr was asking for. It's cut aid to Ukraine. France has cut aid to Ukraine. The U.K. is also in a parlous (ph) situation. So, I think, look, we can talk about all of this stuff till the cows come home, but the right course for Europe is really to step up, maybe move away from some of these green initiatives, move away from some of this over regulation on industry, build back up its own defense industry capability, move back towards conscription. I don't know, those are decisions for Europe. You know, liberalize the ability of Europe to issue bonds for greater defense spending. To me, those are all things that Europe should put on the table.

I think this is a -- as President Trump rightly puts it, it's a dose of common-sense. And here's the thing, Christiane, I talk to Europeans all the time. They know what they need to do. How does it make sense for Germans to have spent between 1 and 2 percent of GDP on defense for decades and Americans to have spent a lot more? How does it make sense for the country that the current secretary general of NATO ran for a very wealthy country to have spent well below 2 percent? This is not equitable.

Do not get involved.\"So, look, ok, fine, but so what do you think that actually means when we peel that apart? For instance, there's several hundred U.S. forces that are based there purely to fight and to make sure that ISIS doesn't raise its head again.

It sounds kind of common-sense, but common- sense has been exceptionally uncommon over the last generation, and we've managed to fritter away our enormous military advantages and the support of the American people, especially those who've served in uniform, as I think Pete Hegseth has really spoken for them in a very eloquent way, as well as J.D. Vance and others, really eroded the willingness of the American people for these kinds of conflicts. And so, I think basically saying, hey, we're not going to get involved here is a really important starting point. That's the baseline. And I always like to point out, I mean, Christiane, during the Cold War, Syria was basically always in the Soviet sphere and yet, we won the Cold War. It's not something that is strategically vital for us, and we really have to husband our resources. On the issue of what U.S. forces in Syria is going to happen. I mean, I certainly supported President Trump when he was attempting to pull them out last time. I think we're going to have to see. That's his decision. I think there's a sort of bizarro element to our posture in the Middle East, where we're bombing multiple groups and possibly supporting, according to reporting, multiple groups on varying sides. I think the better course here is to, as President Trump said, to stay out of it directly, to empower and back our allies like Israel that are taking matters more to their own hands, and some kind of equilibrium will hopefully arise. And then, of course, keeping a weather eye on the possibility for transnational jihadis to emerge from that. That's really a core, of course, American interest coming out of that area.",

And many times, I saw people that I knew, personally, but because of the horrendous torture that had happened to them, it was hard for me to recognize them. The types of torture were the worst that I've ever seen. Very bloodthirsty regime. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Netanyahu is in the courtroom, so to speak.It's pretty good timing for this film. ALEXIS BLOOM, DIRECTOR, \"THE BIBI FILES\": Yes, it is pretty good timing. I mean, we've been saying that for a year, every time you think something's going to happen or that he's going to say something substantive or have to face the charges, it turns out that he sort of shirks them. The first day of the court hearing was a little disappointing in that he used it mainly for grandstanding, I would say. He was saying that there's an attempted coup against him. The media is out to get him. That the judicial system is biased, and he used it very much to sort of attack what he calls the deep state.",

I mean, one of the things about these interrogation videos that I think needs to be clear is that you sort of see Netanyahu not exactly in an unguarded moment, he's very much aware of the camera, but it's a very vulnerable moment or a series of moments. And then, you see Sara his wife and his son Yair, show this kind of unbelievable contempt for the rule of law and the state, which is, I think, for Israelis, really shocking to see. And in the leaks that have happened outside of, you know, official channels, they're getting a look at it and it's causing quite a stir. From an international perspective, I think, you know, for years and years and years, we've been fed, in part because, you know, Netanyahu controls his image so assiduously, this idea that he is the grand statesman. Well, there's a kind of seamy, corrupt petty criminal underbelly to this man, which these tapes really show in a way that I think many people will find shocking.",

I went into this film not being as critical of Netanyahu as I ended up being just because people -- I mean, the number of people I can't count who said there should be a term limit in Israel.

And there's one sort of appalling moment in the film where families of, you know, hostage families, Israeli hostage families are sort of brought in to kiss the ring of Sara Netanyahu in order to hope that maybe she'll, you know, exert some influence on her husband to try to get them back.
