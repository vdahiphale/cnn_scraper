      "sentences": "Yes, this is a real dilemma here for top Republicans here in Washington because they actually don't want him to resign right now because, if he were to do that, it would set up a special election in a district that Joe Biden carried by 8 points, something that could flip to the Democrats. But they also don't want him to run for re-election in 2024, because if he does, there is real fear that he could impact the other Republicans in the ticket. Could essentially sink some other New York Republicans. So, they want him to decide not to run at all for a second term.Now we are learning behind the scenes that Santos is considering running for reelection. He has told that to Republicans previously signaling he wasn't going to do so. But he has changed because he believes he can beat all of the allegations of wrongdoing. He believes his treasurer will face scrutiny over his campaign finances. And he believes he will essentially deal with to push back again any looming indictment that could come down. Now there's a different view in New York. New York Republicans, including some who are here in the House delegation, say that George Santos should not be the nominee. And they're prepared to defeat him in a primary if he decides to run. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MARC MOLINARO (R-NY): George Santos will not be on any ticket in 2024.",

And leadership and constituents in his district on Long Island have had enough. I don't see a scenario where he runs for reelection or quite frankly even completes his term. (END VIDEO CLIP) RAJU (on camera): Now there's a time element here that is significant. By March 14th the Federal Election Commission has asked Santos to declare whether or not he is running for reelection in order to allow him to continue fundraising going forward. So, he has to make a decision there. And if he decides to run again, even if he were indicted on federal charges -- we know he's facing investigation -- that does not force him to resign. He has to make that decision on his own, or the House could vote to expel him. But to do that would require two thirds majority of the House. That Congressman right there, Marc Molinaro a freshman Republican from New York, told me that he would support voting to expel him. But remember, the House Republican leadership are not there quite yet, including Kevin McCarthy who believes the investigation should play out. And of course, if Santos would resign, that is a thing that he would have to defend in a special election potentially tightening McCarthy's already very narrow majority -- guys.",

He cannot beat a GOP challenger and he's not going to potentially beat legal action that is coming his way.And I applaud the Republicans in New York state and others who are saying it's time for him to move on. It's time to look for a valid, credible primary challenger against George Santos and make sure that that seat is held by a Republican. I've spoken with the Nassau County GOP where his district is. They are frustrated. Because they feel as though they were duped and they're also discouraged because the constituents in that district are not being served. They are not getting the value of a member of Congress that is there to help the constituents. He is so busy with his own fights against all these lies that he's not serving the constituents.

Because I remember during -- I think is was one of the early debates for the Democrats when representative Eric Swalwell made a hard generational argument. They booed him not only off the stage but out of the primary race. So, for her to suggest this test for anyone over 75 when Republican voters are historically older than the Democratic base, older than Democratic voters, primary older in general and older overall in these races, is she hitting that age thing a little too hard?",

I mean, 60 percent of Republicans votes in the general election -- the presidential election -- now come from white voters over 45 roughly. That's kind of the share. And as I said, in these primaries in states like Iowa and South Carolina and Georgia, in Tennessee, we're talking about somewhere between two thirds and three quarters of the Republican voters are over 45. Obviously she's aiming primarily at President Biden in that, butDonald Trump gets caught in the blast radius as well. There will be some audience, Victor, I think in both parties to the idea that we do need a generational transition. I mean, the idea of having Trump against all Biden again, 160 years candidate age, with is long ability Emancipation Proclamation is an unappealing prospect for many voters. I think the question for Haley is more, can she expand beyond a kind of a narrow -- a relatively narrow beachhead of almost on the country club Republicans in the past.",

Look, she gave a very positive, uplifting message of looking to American pride and looking to the future. And often times it's hard to gauge what really resonated with the crowd if you're not there. They were specifically pleased with how the audience responded with her talk about a generational change, saying it's time to get away from the stale names and ideas of the past.And also a key point of applause in the group was when she talked about American is not past its prime, but many politicians are past their prime. And that's the key message that she will have moving forward. Look, I think it's great to have more people in this race, a robust Republican primary is great for democracy. And it's also great for the party. The key is to make sure that everyone go out to these early states, test your message, test your ability to connect with the people and in the end galvanize behind one candidate that is not Donald Trump.
