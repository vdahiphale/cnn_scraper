Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. Outrage overseas as foreign aid workers feeding starving people are the latest to be killed in Israel's war on Gaza. Prime Minister Netanyahu called the deadly airstrike \"a tragic accident,\" which \"happens in war\" and vowed to investigate. The seven who lost their lives work for World Central Kitchen. It's the organization founded by the famed chef Jose Andres. Now, they came from all over the world to help, Poland, Canada, Australia, the U.K., one was Palestinian. As U.N. humanitarian chief, Martin Griffiths has been a key figure in pressing for vital aid to Gaza. But after three years in the role advocating and acting all over the world's conflict zones, he is stepping down in June due to ill health. His career with the U.N., the British diplomatic service, and many Humanitarian organizations has spanned decades, from the Balkans to Syria to Yemen and all places in between. He joined me from Geneva for the first interview since announcing he's leaving his U.N. role.",

And Al-Shifa Hospital was, as WHO has described, the kind of health institution which people have become used to relying on when they need health care, now no longer. I don't know the truth or otherwise about whether there were Hamas militants there, fine. But the fact of matter is, this is a hospital, it's protected under international law, and importantly, it's essential for the welfare of the people of Gaza who are suffering so much. I think we're down to 10 hospitals, partially operating in Gaza, out of total originally of 36. We are seeing the health center in Haiti brought to a standstill by the fighting in Port-au-Prince. We have seen health institutions targeted in Ukraine and also in Sudan.

And I understand it's partly because people went there to raid it to get supplies, medical supplies because, of course, in battles, you get hurt and you need medical care. But none of this comes close to justifying the idea of shutting down hospitals and attacking them. And that Red Cross, that for all our lives we have associated with protection and safety, has become a target. And as humanitarian aid workers, another breach of law. So, in the last, you know, two or three days in Gaza, we have seen the activity of having the worst targets, aid workers, hospitals, and those trucks, which are affected by lawlessness.

And of course, expressing grave concern aboutthe possibility of this law being applied to Al Jazeera and others. But in addition, particularly, as you say in Gaza, for example, where we have claims and counterclaims as to who's delivering aid and who isn't, the U.N. is often accused by Israel of not delivering aid. And our response in part is, allow the journalists in, allow the press in to see the reality. What the media does, what you do, is providing a window, a witness, for people across the world so that we can all make these proper judgments. And the freedom of the press is integral to that. It's a human right, it's an entitlement, it's protected by law. And to ban media is no help to the people of Gaza, as it is no help in other places where that's happened. So of course, we deprecate it. But it's particularly important in crises. Getting media, for example, Christiane into Sudan, as you know, has not been easy. It's very difficult to get the visas for journalists to go there. But you shine a light, as we try to do, but you shine a light on suffering, which I am absolutely convinced, from my three years now in this particular job, is an essential component of pushing back this pattern of war decisions by heedless men.",

And I think I'm in a position to know if that were to be true or not. Secondly, perhaps more importantly, UNRWA's mandate comes from the General Assembly. And it is only the General Assembly that has the right to amend its mandate. We believe passionately, and I have spoken out yesterday on this, UNRWA is the backbone, as we have often said, of the humanitarian operation. We need it in Gaza. It is essential to the welfare of the people of Gaza and elsewhere, where Palestinian people reside. But in fact, the idea that it could be simply dismantled at the request of one member state is simply not paying attention to the origin of its mandate. And I think, frankly, the courage of its staff and its leadership. So, it's a fool's game to think that UNRWA can be dismantled. UNRWA is essential for us, more so now perhaps than ever in its history. And we must protect it, preserve it, defend it, fund it, and allow the people of Palestine to have from UNRWA what they have always needed. And that is a way of life and a future.",

So, while we have more wars, more recklessness, more heedlessness from leaders who choose war, we do not see any change, any diminution, in the humanity that binds communities across the world. And I have seen this in Gaza, I have seen it in Sudan, you will remember the extraordinary courage of the emergency rooms, civil society in Khartoum, who are still there, even in this fighting, delivering aid to their neighborhoods. I've seen it in Burkina Faso, where mothers go across lines of al-Qaeda fighters to get leaves and salt for their children to eat, because food is not available. So, the humanity which binds us has not diminished, even while the tendency to war has increased. So, my life's work, I think, as I see it now, is to work on the side of humanity to push back on the decisions of war.

We see it happening, indeed, not far from those borders when you look at Sudan and Darfur. So, the world has become a more polarized and divisive place since Kofi Annan's time.

KARA-MURZA:  The last time I talked to my husband was last summer, in summer 2023. My kids were allowed a 15-minute phone call with their dad at the end of December of last year. And since we had three kids, it meant that each of them got five minutes on the phone with their dad. And that was the first call in over half a year. And I obviously had to measure those minutes with a timer because I could not allow one of our kids to speak to their father for longer than five minutes. So, in the conditions in which Vladimir is being kept now, and that is a punishment cell in so-called special regime prison colony in Western Siberia, he's not allowed any visits by family members. He's not allowed any calls and only under exceptional circumstances. So, in mid-February, we celebrated our 20th anniversary and Vladimir requested a phone call with me and was denied. The Russian -- the prison authorities told him that this was not an exceptional circumstance. As was not our oldest daughter's 18th birthday.

He then survived yet another one in 2017.

And in the past, the regime used every terrorist attack in the country to its own interests to strengthen repression in the country and to launch aggression.

And originalism says, yes, we agree with that, but in the constitution, there are some rather vague words, the right to keep and bear arms is not actually specific, not very specific, and the freedom of speech is less specific yet. So, what we do is go back in our minds to the time that those words were written, 1788, 1787, 1869 for 14, 15, 16, or around that time after the Civil War or at the founding of the country, and say, what would an ordinary person have thought they meant at that time?",

Look at the consequences. Look at the values that underlie it, because that's the better alternative. What about trying the right to bear arms? We had a case involving a New York law. I was in dissent. But the majority said, here is what we'll look to. We'll look to what the founders intended at the time. They wrote these words. That was Madison. In an earlier case, they said what they'd intended. They intended to allow you to keep a pistol under your pillow. I dissented in that because I don't think they meant that one little bit. But what I'm objecting to now is not that first case. I'm objecting to what they're saying at this moment. Just look at the history, in the 18th century, earlier, maybe a little later, the history of what that phrase, what kind of weapons was it addressing itself to? So, I said, OK. I'll look it up. You know what -- Hildebrand (ph) or a Hildebrand (ph), that's it. A scale ladder, an Asian fire, which you threw over the wall to burn people up on the other side of the wall. I mean, is that related to or not related to a pistol or artillery, or ought to tell you the truth? I have no idea what those weapons were that were being used in 1710 or something, or in 1650, or during the Hundred Years' War. You see, you, Mr. Textualist, are asking me to turn awfully important cases upon matters where I am not an expert because I'm not an historian. I'm a judge. I can do this. I can go look at a couple of other things. Did you know, Mr. Majority, that 400 million guns are floating around this country? And those 400 million guns puts us, number one, on gun ownership. And those 400 million guns, a lot of studies show cause an awful lot of trouble. They can cause deaths, they can cause illness, they can cause harm of all sorts to policemen, to spouses, to everybody under the sun. Now, I think that that fact and facts like it are relevant when you're deciding whether the New York gun law is or is not consistent with your idea of that Second Amendment.",

Andthat's a whole arena of affirmative action and race-based thinking. The text of the Civil Rights Act is pretty clear. It says there cannot be discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. And so, if you have affirmative action, perhaps that's discriminating based on race. On the other hand, the purpose of that law was to bring African- Americans more into society. How do you balance that when you take a more purpose or pragmatic-driven approach?",

There is a difference between discrimination, which keeps people out, hurts them. separates the races, and that kind of discrimination which is designed to bring them in, because bringing them into society and creating one society out of a world that had been divided, slavery and non-slavery, Jim Crow, et cetera. Bringing them in so we have one country where we get along together, that was an objective of the 14th Amendment. And when you have something, discrimination, maybe call it discrimination, maybe say as Lewis Powell said in Bakke, he said, there's room here. There is room for a town, a city, a state to work out a good way to bring these different races together in a world that previously had been divided legally. You see, that's the job. And what do you want? You want a mathematical rule? You won't get it. Law is not hard science. It is not calculus. You have human beings who are looking at the facts, the figures, yes, the statute, the constitution, the values that underlie them, and you often have cases that require that judge to think, in terms of those values, does this statute go too far? Too far. That's the skill or the effort.",

I think the Taft Court, you go back to 1900, and you'll see a United States of America that had justgrown from one of the poorest countries in the world to one of the richest, through inventions, through methods of marketing, through methods of finance. And I think the Taft Court was worried and emphasized the words property and contract, unless they fair, first two words in the constitution, because they didn't want to kill a goose that they believed was laying a golden egg. Nobody thought that. By the time of the Great Depression, by the time of Roosevelt's New Deal court, and that New Deal court did not believe, because very few people in the United States believed that what this is all about is keeping laissez- faire and letting companies do whatever they want. And so, they decided the cases somewhat differently. The person who described what was going on there, Paul Freund, another great constitutional scholar. And he said, as far as politics is concerned, he's talking about, no judge, no judge decides according to the temperature of the day, but every judge is affected by the climate of the season. And I hope, but I can't prove, that three years from now, four years from now, people will see that this textualism and originalism pushed to a pretty strong extreme where you can't use other things, that it doesn't work, that it doesn't take any account or enough account of the fact that women didn't have the right to vote in these words in the constitution for the most part were written, that trying to follow textualism in some of these statutes and some of these constitutions and looking to nothing else but text is going to undermine the values that this document sought to keep and work into the future, that it's going to make it more difficult for Congress to pass laws using sometimes abstract phrases so that you can adapt those laws more easily to a future with changing problems and changing circumstances. I think they'll discover that that's a pretty hard road to follow, a pretty hard road to travel. And so, it will diminish.
