There are only 11 days to go until the Iowa caucuses. So, good evening everyone. I'm Erin Burnett. Now, of course, you just heard from Governor Ron DeSantis moments ago. This hour, the former South Carolina governor and former U.N. Ambassador, Nikki Haley joins us. And, tonight, Governor Haley comes here in the midst of a heated rivalry with Ron DeSantis. It's just days before their first one-on- one debate, which will be right here on CNN. And, tonight, Governor Haley will answer questions directly from Iowans. I will have some questions of my own as well. But in the audience are voters who say that they plan to participate in the Iowa Republican Caucuses, both registered Republicans and voters who plan to register as Republicans, which, it's important to note, is allowed as late as caucus night right here in Iowa. So, to find tonight's questioners, we cast a wide net. We reached out for help to various organizations, including business groups, farm associations, parent groups, young professional organizations, religious groups, and conservative advocacy organizations. Now, guests of the Haley campaign Grand View University are also in the audience tonight, but I do want to note they will not be asking questions. We have asked everyone here to be respectful to each other and to Governor Haley, so that everyone here in this room and everyone watching at home has a chance to hear from the candidate. Now please welcome Governor Nikki Haley. (APPLAUSE) NIKKI HALEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Thank you for having me. (APPLAUSE) HALEY:  Thank you.",

That's the reality of it.So, in a time where we're seeing a lot of lawlessness on our streets and in our cities, we can't go and take away people's rights to protect themselves and protect their families.

You're going to continue to see us be strong in South Carolina. And really, what it's been is it's been about, let's talk about where this is.I personally think President Trump was the right President at the right time. I agree with a lot of his policies. But, the reality is, rightly or wrongly, chaos follows him. And we all know that's true. Chaos follows him. And we can't have a country in disarray, and a world on fire and go through four more years of chaos. We won't survive it. And you don't defeat Democrat chaos with Republican chaos. Now is the time we need to have a new generational leader, one that's going to leave the negativity and the baggage behind and start focusing on the real issues that we have in the future. But, more than that, Americans don't want another nail-biter of an election. And that's what we'll get. Look at any of the polls head-to-head against Joe Biden. Ron doesn't beat Biden. Trump head-to-head with Biden, on a good day, he might be up by two. [22:10:06] The Wall Street Journal had him up by four. I am in every one of those same polls. I defeat Biden by 17 points -- 17 points. That makes it bigger than the presidency. That's governorship; that's House; that's Senate; that's down to school boards. But more than that, you win by double-digits, you're going into D.C. with a mandate -- a mandate to stop all the wasteful spending and get inflation under control, a mandate to get our kids reading again and take education back to the basics, a mandate to secure our border, no more excuses, a mandate to bring law and order back to our country, and a mandate of a strong America that we can be proud of. That's what we're doing. That's what I think we need to do. It is time to move past President Trump, and it is time to start focusing on how to strengthen America, and do this for our kids and our grandkids. (APPLAUSE)",

And then you see some that he is going to have to answer for. But, look, I'm not telling you anything -- I used to tell him. I used to tell him he is his own worst enemy. And so, I think at the end of the day, we don't need anyone who's getting in their feelings. We don't need anyone who is getting personal about anything.We have a country to save, and that means no more drama, no more taking things personally. I mean, you look at the situation, the differences I have with him is, first of all, I'm an accountant. We have got to get our economy back on track. And everybody wants to talk about the economy they had under Trump. But at what cost? At what cost? $8 trillion in four years. Our kids will never forgive us for that. We are having to dig out of it. So you may have had a good four years, but look at what we're paying for now. As of now, in a couple of years, we'll be paying more money in interest payments than we are in our defense budget. You know who notices that? Russia, China, and Iran. That's what happens here. The second thing is you look at how he deals with dictators. I think it's completely wrong. He praised China's President Xi a dozen times after China gave us COVID. You don't do that. He congratulated them on the 70th anniversary of the Communist Party. We don't do that. When Israel fell to her knees, you're going to go pick a fight with Israel's Prime Minister because of some issue, personal issue you had with him before, and you're going to praise Hezbollah?

It is truly a dereliction of duty what Biden is allowing to have happen. And to now think that Governor Abbott of Texas is trying to do everything he can to save Texans, and he is putting barbed wire up. And Biden is trying to go against him to cut the barbed wire? Are you kidding me?Like you can't go and risk people's lives. America right now is acting like it's September 10th. We better remember what September 12th felt like, because it only takes one. So, you have eight million people that have come to the border, and they've only sent 140,000 back. That's it. And so, we're left with taking care of the health care of them, the education of those kids, law enforcement having to deal with them. What we will do is -- I passed one of the toughest illegal immigration laws in the country when I was Governor of South Carolina. We'll take that national. We will do a national e-verify program that requires businesses to have to prove to people that they hire in this country legally. We will defund sanctuary cities once and for all. No more safe havens for illegal immigrants. [22:15:2] We'll put 25,000 border patrol and ICE agents on the ground and let them do their job. That's not happening right now. We will go back to the Remain in Mexico policy so that no one even steps foot on U.S. soil. And instead of catch and release, we'll go to catch and deport. That's how we will close the border and get that to stop. But legal immigration, our legal immigration system, is completely broken, too. It shouldn't take someone 10 years to become a citizen. And we need to be smart about how we do it. Presidents in the past have always said, set quotas. I'll take this many this year, this many next year. Instead, look at what does our economy need? I came from an agricultural state and a tourism state. Our farmers needed workers. We need to make sure we are focusing on the businesses that they are not struggling to find workers. And that's the part. When you do it on merit, and that's how we need to bring people in. Based on merit, not just a random quota, then you're building up your economy. You're supporting your businesses. You're making sure that we can all grow together. But we've got to make sure we deal with that. I mean, think about it. We have students that come from overseas. We educate them, and then we send them back home. I mean, that's lunacy. We've got to start using some common sense when it comes to that.",

We were the only Indian family in a small, rural southern town. We weren't white enough to be white. We weren't black enough to be black. They didn't know who were, what were, or why were there.So we dealt with our own challenges. And I remember when I would get teased on the playground and I would come home, my mom would always say, your job is not to show them how you're different. Your job is to show them how you're similar. And it's amazing how that lesson on the playground played throughout my life, because whether it was in the corporate world or as governor or as ambassador, when you're first faced with a challenge, if you talk about what you have in common, people let their guard down, and then you can get to a solution. So when you talk about slavery, it was not just slavery that was talked about. It was more about racism that was talked about. It was more about, you know, we had friends, we had black friends, we had white friends. But it was always a topic of conversation, even among our friends. And in the south, we're very comfortable talking about it, because we know that's what it is. But the goal was always to make today better than yesterday. And even though that there was, you know, a lot of hardened thoughts on that there. I mean went through it. I had -- I dealt with my share of dealing with race issues. We had the tragic shooting of Walter Scott. He was an unarmed black man that was shot in the back seven times by a dirty cop. And this was on the heels of Ferguson, South Carolina. Could have caught on fire, but we didn't do that. I talked to the Walter Scott family, I talked to law enforcement, and a month to the day at the bill signing, we had them both there, and we signed the first body camera bill in the country. A month later, we had the horrific shooting at Mother Emanuel Church when a white supremacist went into a bible study and took nine amazing souls. The entire national media came in wanting to make it about gun control and racism, and death penalty. And I said at the time, there will be a time and place we have those conversations, but right now we have nine souls we need to lay to rest. And I didn't have that luxury because two days later, the killer came out with his manifesto and he was draped in the confederate flag. And the confederate flag had always been either on top of the state house or right in front of the state house since the year 2000. And it is incredibly sensitive and a personal issue in South Carolina. And I focused that next day, I said, I want to have four meetings. I want to call republican leadership, I want to call Democrat leadership. I want to call the congressional delegation, and I want to call community leaders. And I told my staff, don't tell them what this is about because I knew they wouldn't show up. And when they came, I said, at 3:00 today, I'm going to call for the confederate flag to come down. And if you will stand with me, I will forever be grateful. And if you won't, I'll never let anyone know that you were in this room. And it was a tough thing, Erin, because we had to have two-thirds of the House and two-thirds of the senate and to bring a divided state together and avoid riots and protests the way we did that was I knew half of South Carolinians saw the confederate flag as heritage and tradition. The other half of South Carolinians saw it as slavery and hate. My job wasn't to judge either side. My job was to get them to see the best of themselves and go forward. And South Carolinians showed what true strength and grace looked like because we didn't have protests, we had vigils, we didn't have riots, we had prayer. And South Carolina led the way. But that is the way we have to work on issues that try and divide us is don't go and pick who's right and who's wrong and who's good and who's bad. That's what leaders are doing now. And it's caused us to be completely in political disarray. A leader doesn't decide who's right. When you serve the people, you serve everybody. And your job is to give them all the information you have and let them know where you want to going forward.",

And when you look at the situation that happened -- and for anybody that says, why should we care about Israel -- and my opponents have said it's Israel's issue. No, it's our issue too, because 33 Americans were butchered that day. We have American hostages now as we speak. But Israel is a bright spot in a tough neighborhood. They're the tip of the spear when it comes to defeating terrorism. It has never been that Israel needs America. It has always been that America needs Israel. And on that horrific day, when they beheaded those people, and burned those babies alive, and took those girls out of the concert, and raped them, and dragged their naked bodies through the streets of Gaza, what did they say? \"Death to Israel, death to America.\" We have got to do three things when it comes to Israel. We need to give them whatever they need whenever they need it. We need to eliminate Hamas, finish them, so they can never do this horrific stuff again. And we need to do whatever it takes to bring our hostages home. In order to eliminate Hamas, it requires them to go into Gaza. Hamas does not care about human life. They use women and children as human shields. There's a reason that they have all of their areas underneath hospitals and schools. I have been there. I have been in those tunnels. They're very sophisticated. That's probably where the hostages are being held now. Gazans would be so much better off without Hamas. But I know and I trust that Israel will do whatever it takes to make sure they save as many people as they can. You have to know the difference between terrorists and civilians. That's what civilized countries do. America is a civilized country. Israel is a civilized country. Hamas is not civilized. They don't value human life. And they keep trying to put people in harm's way because they don't want it to happen. What I will say is, when everybody is putting the onus on Israel and on America to do something with helping the people of Gaza, where's Egypt? Where's Qatar? Where's Turkey? Where's Iran? Where are all the pro-Hamas countries that say they care? Why is it on Israel? Why aren't they getting Hamas to stop? Why are they forgiving that brutality? Let's put the accountability where it needs to be. Don't put it on Israel. Israel watched their people get butchered that day. If that was us, do you think we would do a cease-fire? Do you think we would stop? We would do whatever it takes to make sure that Americans were taken care of and that we had our say. And so I will tell you, I think Israel is doing what they have to make sure it doesn't happen again, because what did Hamas say? They're going to go back and do it again. They're not finished.",

Any military family will tell you, the last thing you want is for your loved one to go to war. My number one goal has always been preventing war. And let's talk about what's caused this. The rest of my opponents think that we shouldn't be in Ukraine. Don't need to do anything with Ukraine. Trump, Ron, all of them has said, let's leave Ukraine. Let me tell you why Ukraine is important.First of all, you should know, at the United Nations, Ukraine was one of our good friends. They voted with us on almost everything. They supported all of our initiatives, whether I asked them to or not. But, here you have this pro-American freedom-loving country that was invaded by a thug. Half a million people have died and been wounded because of Putin. Now, I don't think we should give cash to any country, friend or foe, because you can't follow it. And you can't hold it accountable. I don't think we need to put troops on the ground in Ukraine, and the Ukrainians don't want it. They want to win this themselves. But, I think we need to give them the equipment and the ammunition to win. Why should we care about Ukraine? Anybody thinking that, that's a legitimate question for you to ask. And I am sorry that Biden and no member of Congress is explaining that to you, but I will because you deserve it. When I was at the United Nations, I saw that terrorists, dictators, and thugs, always tell you what they're going to do. They're amazingly transparent. Hamas said they were going to go into Israel. They did. China said they were going to take Hong Kong. We watched it. Russia invaded Ukraine. They told us they were going to. China says Taiwan is next. We better believe them. Russia said, once they take Ukraine, Poland and the Baltics are next. Those are NATO countries, and that puts America at war. This is about preventing war. It has always been about preventing war. We don't want our men and women to go have to fight. And so, supporting Ukraine is actually preventing war, and seeing it for what it is. And Putin has hit rock bottom. We know that. He has lost 87 percent of the troops that started the war. They've raised the draft age in Russia to 65. They're getting drones from Iran and missiles from North Korea. We know they've hit rock bottom. But now, let me tell you something else. It's really important, Erin. I told you about that brutality on October 7 in Israel. Right? October 7 is Putin's birthday. Who is the happiest man in the world right now? Putin. Why? Because the U.S. and the West took all our eyes and our resources off of Ukraine. And what we do? We started looking at Israel. And did Putin go and call Netanyahu in Israel? Nope, not for 10 days. You know, he did call? Hamas. Invited them to Russia and they held hands and said they were friends. See this for the connection that it is. China and Russia held hands before the Olympics and named themselves unlimited partners. There is an unholy alliance of China, Russia and Iran, bound together in their hatred against freedom, democracy, and above all things, United States of America. Our job is to always prevent more and protect Americans.",

      "sentences": "It's a great question. And the tone at the top matters, right? You know, when I talked about how we could have been completely devastated in South Carolina with the shooting of Walter Scott. How we could have been completely devastated in South Carolina with the murder of those nine amazing souls at Mother Emanuel Church.How we could have been divided on so many other things. South Carolina always held strong and held together. And it was because I knew I served and represented all of them, not just a select group, all of them. And that means I didn't think of any of the South Carolina as good or as bad or as right or as wrong. I just knew I needed to over communicate, tell them everything I knew. And that's how I'll be as a president. You'll know more than you want to know because I think it's important that you know everything. And then tell you about where we go and move forward. But more than that, on my first day, you start by controlling what you can control first. And that is, I will focus on my agencies. We'll replace the head of every agency, whether they're doing a good job or not, to freshen it up. I did this as governor. The second thing I did was I sent people into every agency to clean it up, pull down old programs, pull down any old regs, pull down bureaucracy, get it working again, and mission focused so that it's not too big. In some case, and get rid of problem children. Trust me, agencies have problem children. In some cases, we tweaked agencies. In other cases, we gutted agencies. And then I required them to start doing 90-day benchmarks. I wanted them to show a return on investment to the taxpayer, so that they saw what it was like to work again. And then we saw that they were spending money because they thought they weren't going to get the same amount the next year. So I put all the spending online for every taxpayer to see. And then I incentivized them to give money back to the taxpayers. And magic happened because they started to compete to see who could be the most effective and most efficient. And then I went to my legislature and said, it's your turn. And I started by giving them a couple of things that were easy so they could remember what it was like to win again. We need to do that with our congress. They need to know what it's like to win again together. And then you give them things that are harder and harder. That's important. We have to get government used to producing and giving results again. And I'll do it by starting with myself and starting with our agencies and getting them to work for the people again. And then going to Congress and saying, you know what? No more peacocking on TV. No more sitting there and pointing fingers to anybody else. The buck starts here and it's time to get things done for the American people. And it's an amazing thing. I have called out Republicans. I've called out Democrats. I've praised Republicans. I've praised Democrats. Legislators love to be praised and they hate to be called out. It's a magic tool that has always worked for me. Whether I was calling out China or Russia at the U.N., they didn't like to be called out. No one does. But when you do it for the right reasons and you know who you serve, that's when you get things moving again.",
