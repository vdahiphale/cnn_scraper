But National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan made it clear that President Biden signaled that the next two months are a period of transition for the United States with an incoming administration. He said that he wasn't going to front run the new administration's policies toward China, which are still in formation, but made it clear that he wanted to hand over the relationship on stable terms. Now, that was a theme of the meeting. They wanted to focus on the stability between the two nations over the course of the last four years. President Biden has worked, he said, to try to stabilize the relationship to keep from competition spilling over, veering into conflict between these two global superpowers. And while at times that has seemed an impossible task, that was really what they focused on. They had an expanded team of both of their bilateral officials working on some of these issues, ranging from climate, to trade, to more military focused issues. And they tried to focus on keeping military level communication to discussing some other things they worked on. But it was very clear, Sullivan said, that this was a meeting to try to tie up the relationship, to try to bookend the discussions that they've had over the last four years. So we will see whether that works and whether China decides to retain some of those negotiating chips for when they meet with the Trump administration once they take office in January. Guys?",

Thanks for being with me. Let's talk -- so you're covering, obviously, the President's final foreign trips. He's in Peru, headed to Brazil, Angola next month. What's the tone? Give us more about the tone, especially in this conversation between President Biden and President Xi. ZOLAN KANNO-YOUNGS, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Yes, that's right. I think Kayla hit it, you know, really on the nose when she said that President Biden's aides are saying that they are trying to bookend, you know, the relationship with President Xi, but also a part of sort of the president's legacy here. Foreign policy has really been at the center of his political career through Congress as vice president and as president. But make no mistake, whether it was the meeting with President Xi of China, whether it was really just wherever he went throughout APEC meeting with various allies, as well as now going on to the G20. What's hanging over this is the fact that President-elect Trump will soon be entering office. Even before he entered his meeting with President Xi yesterday, he was faced -- I asked them both questions about President-elect Trump soon entering office. This is a period of monumental transition for the United States and the way that it approaches the world. President Biden, who has said that prioritizing allies and global partnerships in order to achieve foreign policy goals, he's leaving office and with him his vision for the world. Meanwhile, President- elect Trump is coming into office and bringing with him an isolationist America First Policy. And President Biden and his aides are going to be faced with questions about that vision, both at APEC as well as the G20 in the days to come.",

I mean, yesterday in the case of President Biden talking to President Xi, you know, Xi did say that he was ready to work with the incoming administration but, obviously, there's anxiety surrounding the forthcoming promised tariffs that the president elect has promised. But, you know, look, this is a pretty sprawling region with many different governments. If you look at the case of Argentina's new leader in Malay, you know, he's visited Mar-a-Lago, right? So there's some optimism there for President Trump's vision of foreign policy. But I would say that really, when you look at, you know, the broad range of leaders that have come, there is some anxiety. Look, a major theme of both of these summits is a commitment to combating climate change. That's why President Biden is going to the Amazon today. He's going to sort of mark that moment as for the commitments that he's made, the money that he's issued on the global stage. And he'll talk about that at the G20. But how much credibility does that have when the president-elect is coming into office and promising to gut the Inflation Reduction Act, which is President Biden's signature climate bill? So, of course, there's going to be anxiety when President Biden on this swan song, if you will, is going to talk about these goals of combating climate change and economic agreements. But the incoming administration, in some cases, has talked about going the complete opposite direction. There's definitely going to be anxiety at that point.",

There are some really legitimate arguments for appeal in the case, and that is what evidence was presented to the jury and you know now that we have the Supreme Court immunity ruling we know that there's certain evidence that might should have been withheld from the jury because that conduct the Supreme Court has deemed to be likely immune. If the judge thinks that that somehow tainted the conviction and then I think it's likely he -- he may put this off. If however he thinks that that was limited enough or that the conviction should stand on its own that he may move ahead.Remember New York's a little different than federal court. That is Trump's already actually a convicted felon there even though he hadn't been sentenced and so this would simply allow him to sort of finish the case as far as he was concerned. He could sentence the President- elect to some type of probated sentence meaning that he wouldn't do any jail time. He would simply have a conviction and some sentence to do. He could even stay the sentence really, but then it moves to the to an appeals court. Either way I think you're going to see this move toward an appeals court. It's just hard for me to imagine the judge is totally ceding the state's authority to do anything with the case simply because former president was elected.

But really, much of the eastern U.S. is going to see something from this system over the next several days. Here's the best potential for those severe thunderstorms today. That does include some damaging winds and, yes, even some tornadoes possible late this afternoon and into the evening. By tomorrow, that shifts a little bit farther east, now spreading into states like Louisiana, Arkansas, and into Missouri as well. Here's a look at that timeline. Again, late this afternoon, you're really starting to see a lot of those showers and thunderstorms fire up. But it's also slow moving on the south end. So even as we go through the rest of the day, it really doesn't do all that much. You've got to wait until later Monday and especially into Tuesday before we start to see that spread into states a little bit farther east. Now, behind that, you're going to see the temperatures drop. Take a look at St. Louis, for example. Almost 70 degrees by Monday, but then that front comes in. And now we're looking at highs in the 40s as we finish out the rest of the week. And again, this same system is going to make its way across the east. So we're not only looking at the potential for those temperatures to drop in severe thunderstorms, but also some flooding, too, is going to be a concern, especially across Texas and Oklahoma, where we could end up getting as much as three to five inches of rain in just the next few days.",
