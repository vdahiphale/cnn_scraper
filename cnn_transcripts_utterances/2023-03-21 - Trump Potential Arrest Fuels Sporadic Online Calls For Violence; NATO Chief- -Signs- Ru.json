The Manhattan DA meantime is not commenting about any arrests, but it does appear his investigation into what Trump may have done to keep an alleged affair quiet during his 2016 campaign is winding down.",

He provided prosecutors more than 300 emails and documents that he said he thought that the prosecutors had cherry picked their questions to him and he said that he would have liked them to ask him other things. Now, Costello afterwards had said that his main purpose there, his goal was to undercut Cohen and Cohen later on MSNBC defended himself. Take a listen.

I wouldn't have touched the guy like Michael Cohen, especially if he's convicted perjurer. MICHAEL COHEN, FMR. PERSONAL ATTORNEY FOR DONALD TRUMP:   I have truth. I have the documentation.

We've certainly never seen a president under indictment, this would be a first for an American president and obviously, you played that key role during Watergate, but that didn't even go up to kind of this level to escalate this far.

So while it's unprecedented, it's not really unusual. They've had vice presidents who have been charged, Spiro Agnew during my time. Many members of the House and Senate have been charged.

DeSantis just in case things go in that direction. So I think the former president is showing that he's concerned and he wants at least in the court of public opinion and his own GOP base for the legitimacy, the merits of this possible action to be undercut before it even happens.",

And he talked about how he really pushed back against the investigation itself, but then he also kind of took a chance to kind of take some digs at Donald Trump and kind of essentially the baggage that he's carrying with him.

So it has a different flavor and feel, it's making some Republicans quite nervous, including Lindsey Graham, who's been a longtime backer of former President Trump, but saying, vote to Trump and DeSantis, guys, because this really the way you want to start. It could be very damaging internally, but I think if Donald Trump hangs in there in a primary and Ron DeSantis gets in as expected, it - that is going to be the tenor and the volume.

They're getting to be a partnership, challenging the Western narrative of democracy. And as that idea that Xi Jinping put forward his plan for a peace deal over Ukraine, he says it recognizes the central tenets of the charter at the United Nations. I think that's something that many countries would disagree with. But this is a narrative that Putin and Xi are pushing not just to their countries, but in other nations, the Global South, if you will. Gulf States, Arab Gulf States who look upon the conflict in Ukraine, not the same way that we do.
