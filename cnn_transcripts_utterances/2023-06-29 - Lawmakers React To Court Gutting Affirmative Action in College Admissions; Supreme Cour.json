      "sentences": "That's right. Today's historic decision had a specific carve-out for military academies. It actually allows them to continue considering race in admissions.Our next guest signed onto a friend-of-the-court brief supporting affirmative action programs. Joining us now is CNN military analyst and former NATO supreme allied commander, retired General Wesley Clark. Sir, thank you for making time for us today. You explored this in the amicus brief with other top military leader leaders. How do you see this affecting military readiness and national security? GEN. WESLEY CLARK, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: I think there are national security implications to this. The military academies are excluded from the Supreme Court ruling, and that's clear. But about 70 percent of our officer corps comes through ROTC, through ordinary colleges. Some from Harvard, some from Princeton, and some from all over America. And there's no lateral entry into the officer corps. Whatever comes out at the top as colonels, brigadier generals, full generals, started at the bottom as lieutenants and ensigns. That's the way it works. And so the ruling does impact these civilian institutions, which are providing us the majority of the junior officers that later go on to lead our armed forces. So there is an impact.",

And we also want the leadership to be representative of the force.So it's a wonderful thing when you have 40 percent of your NCO corps, let's say minority, they can look and see a Colin Powell at the top. So they know they've got people there who understand some of the issues that they face, not necessarily in uniform, but maybe out of uniform or outside and off base. This is important. And so we don't want an officer corps that's unrepresentative of the force. And that's why there's a national security impact from this.",

There's no way of knowing if it will. But we do know it -- we do know it is a change from the current system. And we've got some great young men and women coming up through the armed forces in junior officer ranks, in part, because of the system that was put in place to look at people's backgrounds, as well as their academic qualifications.",

We're feeling it here in Washington. And Detroit also at times today holding that title. More than 100 million people are under some kind of air quality alert right now across more than a dozen states. The bad air is again coming from the smoke caused by Canadian wildfires. Meteorologist Chad Myers is in the CNN Weather Center. Chad, the Midwest bore the brunt yesterday, the northeast and even parts of the mid-Atlantic bearing it today. CHAD MYERS, AMS METEOROLOGIST: I know, and right now, I have behind me Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The parts per million in Pittsburgh now, 230. That's unhealthy for anybody to be out there at this point in time. Here in Atlanta, our number is 130. But inside the building -- I bought this on Amazon, like $20. It will tell me what my number is inside. I know that's hard for you to read, but it's 14. That's like 10 times less air product quality here outside than here. So we're 10 times better air inside than what you expect. And that's exactly how that's going to go. This is what Pittsburgh looks like right now. And it is going to look like that for a while. There's major, major weather, though, rolling through Illinois right now. And that's pushing a lot of this smoke away. We have a live picture from Chicago right now. A little bit better, especially to your southwest. This big event, this big, severe thunderstorm event rolling through Illinois and pushing all of the smoke away. That is at least some of the good news. Back to the heat across parts of Texas, it is going to be another hot day there. It is going to be a dreadful day with temperatures again over 100. The feels-like temperatures in parts of Louisiana are going to be 130. Here are the air quality numbers from D.C. to Chicago and Detroit, all above 100. Pittsburgh, obviously you're higher than that at this point in time. It comes and goes. The wind mixes it up. Visibility is down in many areas. This is what the smoke's going to look like here over the next couple of days. The wind will blow much of it away and into the northeast from the Midwest. For your tomorrow and for your Saturday, a lot of the haze gets pushed off to the east. The heat stays down to the south where the heat dome is just right over Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, all the way through Atlanta. Excessive heat warnings for millions of people here. It feels-like the temperature in Shreveport is 111. In Grand Isle, Louisiana, a little bit ago, I saw a number of 117. And remember, these numbers are in the shade. You step out into the sun, it's going to feel warmer than this. So, yes, the smoke is here, the humidity and the heat is down to the south. I'm afraid both of them here to stay for a couple more days. But I think this might be the worst for everyone today. It gets better from here, except maybe Mobile, Pensacola, going to still be hot down there -- Boris?",
