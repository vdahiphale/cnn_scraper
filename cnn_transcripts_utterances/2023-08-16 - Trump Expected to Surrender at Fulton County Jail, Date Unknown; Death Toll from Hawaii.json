Prosecutors say because the chief U.S. probation officer in Delaware did not approve the now withdrawn agreement, it, quote, never went into effect and therefore none of its terms are binding on either party.That comes after Biden's lawyers argued to the judge that it was a valid and binding agreement. The deal would've resolved the felony gun possession charge if Biden adhered to certain conditions, including not possessing a gun or using drugs or alcohol for 24 months. The dispute comes as Biden's longtime defense attorney, Christopher Clark, asked the judge to withdraw from the case. Biden's lawyers saying that he could now be a witness to the now contested to deal. One thing both sides to agree on is dismissing the tax charges filed in Delaware.

But number one, his argument is that the state shouldn't be prosecuting in the first place, that he was acting in his official capacity and under the color of law and that ultimately, it could move it to federal court, that there is a better jury pool, too, should he have to get to that point, it's not going to solely be out of Fulton County, which may be more blue for him.It will be in federal court, which will be a further and greater jury pool that will include people of all different shades of red and blue. So, absolutely favorable to him to say that this should not be prosecuted, it should be dismissed as a matter of law. But, if it does have to go forward, it should be in a federal court.",

I was acting in a manner consistent with my role as president of the United States and furthering my objective and goals as a president.The problem is, for that defense, you're assuming that he is doing things that he should be doing as a president and we know that a president's job is not to certify an election, to tabulate and count the number of votes, to challenge Electoral College. So he is doing things well beyond, certainly, if you truly the indictment and is proven beyond a reasonable doubt, it's also not accurate to say it's a president's role to intervene and get involved in the election itself, as he did to perpetrate this supposed fraud. So, there is a major problem with that defense of the First Amendment. It seems to be clear that anyone can say whatever they want, that's one of your rights. But that's not true either. The First Amendment does have limits and it can't be the core criminal conduct. Just like, for example, you can't yell fire in a crowded theater. Certainly, that's not the same here. But you can't use those words along with actions that are part of a criminal action or criminal transaction. So, he's going to have some very serious difficulties.",
