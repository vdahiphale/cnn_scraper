      "sentences": "Good morning. You are live in the CNN Newsroom. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.We're following two major stories unfolding this hour. Vice President Kamala Harris races to gather support in what is now a brand new presidential race less than four months before the election. Next hour, she makes her first public appearance since President Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed her to succeed him at the top of the ticket. And at any moment up on Capitol Hill, the other story we're watching, the head of the Secret Service will be facing blistering questions about the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump. Kimberly Cheatle is expected to tell lawmakers she failed to properly protect the former president and takes full responsibility for the security lapse. But, first, in the hours after President Biden's stunning announcement, an outpouring of support for his vice president. A spokesperson for Kamala Harris says she raked in nearly $50 million from donors since yesterday's announcement. She's also secured endorsements from some of the biggest names in Democratic politics, including the Clintons, former Secretary of State John Kerry and Senator Elizabeth Warren, of course, a lot more there on your screen. Let's discuss now with Democratic Congressman John Garamendi of California is a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, of course, a fellow Californian. Congressman, thanks so much for being here. I guess, first of all, your reaction to President Biden dropping out, and I assume you are endorsing Kamala Harris. What do you say? REP. JOHN GARAMENDI (D-CA):  Well, first of all, let's start with an extraordinary president who made a decision for this country and for the future by stepping out of this race. I've known President Biden since 1988, where I supported him when he was running for president. And ever since then, I've worked closely with an extraordinary individual that put together legislation unequaled and set the nation up for a very good, solid economic future in which all Americans can participate. So, I'm sad about that, that that's happened. But also I'm very, very excited about Kamala Harris. I've worked with her since 1991 when she was the district attorney in San Francisco and I was the new insurance commissioner. We went after insurance fraud. We were down at an auto repair shop where some fraud was going on, made the arrest right there. She's an extraordinary person. And Trump is going to find his match far beyond equal here. This is a woman that knows how to go after fraudsters and criminals, and guess what? Trump is a certified felon. So, we'll see. This is going to be a very, very interesting match, and the issues are solid for the Democrats here.",

Apparently in the last several minutes, the House speaker, Mike Johnson, has been talking to reporters up on Capitol Hill. He said that President Biden should step down. And he suggested that state officials around the country on the Republican side are going to be challenging putting Kamala Harris on the top of the ticket. Let me play that, get your response to that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA):  And I think that's a real problem, and I think there'll be a lot said about that in the days ahead.",

This is not the way the system is supposed to work. There's a reason it's unprecedented. You don't just, you know, steamroll the rules in the process because you decide that your candidate is no longer suitable. That's what's happened here.

In the meantime, you are looking at live pictures up on Capitol Hill, where the Secret Service director is in the hot seat over one of the agency's biggest crises and debacles in decades, the assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump.Kimberly Cheatle is expected to tell the House Oversight Committee that her agency failed in its mission on July 13th. Committee Chairman James Comer has promised that the six-hour hearing would be both detailed and extensive with Comer and ranking member Democrat Jamie Raskin have just finished up their opening statements. Let's bring in our CNN reporters. Evan Perez joins me here in Washington. Whitney Wild is up on Capitol Hill. John Miller is in New York. Also joining us is Paul Eckloff. He's a former Secret Service agent, was a special agent in charge, assistant special agent in charge for former Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump. Evan, we just heard the Secret Service director, I mean, that she's going to be admitting that her agency failed. That's kind of stating the obvious here.",

She's done a couple of interviews, including with Whitney. But the fact that she says on July 13th, we failed, again, it's stating the obvious, but there's so many things that we've learned in the intervening days since that assassination attempt.There are questions about the assets that were in place, the preparations that were in place. How is it possible that knowing that there were threats against the former president, including one from Iran, that someone was able to get on a roof with a view and an access to a place where they could take shots at the former president narrowly missing him? And so the disaster that happened that day could have been so much worse. Obviously, someone was killed and two others were injured, but the Secret Service certainly has a lot of questions to answer over the next what we anticipate to be six hours here.",

I mean, should you just step aside, let new leadership come in? Is that ultimately where we're headed here?PAUL ECKLOFF, RETIRED U.S. SECRET SERVICE:  These are questions that need to be asked. And if we look back at incidents that we've seen in the history of the Secret Service, some directors have stepped down and others have not. In this case, I believe there is a need for new leadership. In just my personal opinion, it is not this moment, that a time should be decided in the near future, and there should be a smooth transition, and a training, and a thorough vetting of who that next director should be. For context, James J. Rowley is a legend in the Secret Service. He was director from 1961 to 1973. Any armchair historian can see that there was an assassination of two members of the Kennedy family during that time. Rather than assign blame, and I'm sure there was a lot back then, they established our training center that bears his name and eventually led to the federal law enforcement training center in Glencoe, Georgia, and in Maryland. He was kept on to apply lessons learned and help the Secret Service emerge a better and stronger agency. And I think what we saw, if anything, on July 13th, is that's what needs to happen. The Secret Service needs to adapt and improve its methodologies. Simply put, the Secret Service is facing 21st century threats with a 20th century budget and manpower stance based on 19th century assassinations. We need the United States Secret Service ready to emerge and face the threats of the 21st century and beyond. Current leadership needs to be adjusted and augmented.",

You know, initially, it sounded as though the Secret Service was trying to put this on local law enforcement. They backpedaled from that. I mean, that just has not been a great week or so for the Secret Service. I mean, obviously, as Paul was saying a few moments ago, lessons learned, yes, obviously those need to be applied, but the public seems to be calling out for a lot more than that.",

      "sentences": "Well, the Secret Service director stepping down is probably, as Paul said, a bad idea at a bad time. You're coming out of one political convention, you're going into another. She has been intricately involved with a large team and the massive planning of that. In fact, that is likely one of the things, if there are factors, that drew resources away from these campaign events on the road.But that said, there's a core question here today that we're going to listen to this hearing searching for, which is, is the failure that occurred in Pennsylvania, and the director has taken accountability for it at this point, a one-off event because people at that event didn't perform up to par, or is it a systemic problem throughout the Secret Service? And that question will be mined a little bit in this hearing, but then much later by the secretary of Homeland Security's independent panel by the DHS inspector general's investigation. So, they're going to be taking a holistic, basically an MRI, of the entire agency. What Whitney knows, what I know, what Paul knows is the Secret Service is too small. It's long been too small because its mission has grown beyond the size of the agency. This director has fought to make it bigger, to get it more money, to get it more resources. But there's going to be a real question going forward in today's threat environment. Does it have to be a much bigger agency?",

I mean, people in the crowd, that video, I'll never forget that video, people in the crowd pointing it out and saying, what's going on here?

And so when was the advance conducted? Who did it? What were the qualifications of the people who were leading that advance? Those are some of the more technical questions that may also speak to what John was talking about is, was this really at a time when you had these systemic problems that erupted and exposed major vulnerabilities within the Secret Service, either with their manpower or just their general orientation toward putting these high-profile events together. Because as what you're hearing from Evan and Paul and John, the reality here is that the former president's threat was very likely far outsized for what he was on paper, which was a former president.And so how do you balance those two realities? That is the major question for the Secret Service director and clearly something did not go right. That is what she is certainly going to be grilled upon today.",

Once again, I do believe there is a crisis in confidence, not just within the Secret Service, but within the American people's trust in the Secret Service. And that is an invaluable bond that the Secret Service operates under every day. It is only successful because the people that go to those sites believe they are safe because of what they know and believe about the Secret Service.The local police is the same. The Secret Service is successful because of the incredible work and heroism of the local police every day in establishing security zones that are far outside of the Secret Service's capability. Losing leadership right now, I believe, would create a vacuum in that confidence for the men and women that are standing opposed as we speak, that are standing by a rear entrance, standing a rooftop or standing by a stage as we saw those men and women collapse onto the former president on July 13th.. I don't believe you want to destroy their leadership during that time, but I do think they should immediately bring in outside leadership to help take an immediate look and not wait for the Blue Ribbon panel, which will do an excellent job, and not wait for congressional inquiries or hearings. They need answers now because there are men and women standing around the world relying on the protective model that failed July 13th.",
