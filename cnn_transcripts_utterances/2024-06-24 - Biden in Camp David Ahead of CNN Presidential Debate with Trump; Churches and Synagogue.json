I'm Max Foster, in London.Ahead on \"CNN Newsroom,\" we are counting down to the first U.S. presidential debate of this election season happening right here on CNN this week. Joe Biden and Donald Trump, how they're preparing. Plus deadly attacks on churches and synagogues in Russia. There's no claim of responsibility so far, but authorities believe they were coordinated. And the end of a PGA Tour event interrupted when climate protesters carrying smoke bombs invaded the 18th Green. CNN's historic presidential debate is now just three days away. U.S. President Joe Biden will debate his predecessor Donald Trump for the first time since 2020. Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump have very different approaches to debate preparations. Whilst Trump hit the campaign trail this weekend courting Christian conservatives, President Biden has been hunkered down at Camp David with his advisers. Now some Republicans are mocking the president's intense preparations. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. BYRON DONALDS (R-FL): He has to be in Camp David for seven, eight days to prepare himself to be in a 90-minute debate with Donald Trump. That does not bode well for a man who says he wants four more years. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: President Biden has now completed three days of debate prep out at Camp David. And we are getting some new insights into the Biden campaign's strategy heading into this week and heading into Thursday's debate in Atlanta. They've released a memo spelling out some of the things that they're doing to boost enthusiasm among their supporters ahead of this showdown. That includes 300 debate night watch parties and 1,600 events in battleground states to try and ramp up energy around President Biden's appearance on that debate stage against President Trump. And I think this memo really lays clear the three most important items that President Biden will want to hammer home on that debate stage. One is the issue of abortion. And this is one that the Democrats really believe will be galvanizing for their support supporters come November. President Biden really wants to lay at Donald Trump's feet the overturning of Roe vs. Wade. And in fact on Monday the Biden campaign plans 50 events around the anniversary of the Dobbs Supreme Court decision that stripped the nationwide right to abortion really trying to rally their supporters around this key issue. The second item on the debate stage that you're going to hear from President Biden is this idea of democracy and the threats that he believes Donald Trump poses to American democracy. Threats of political violence. This of course has been an underpinning of the entire Biden campaign and certainly he wants to hammer that point home on Thursday night. The third issue is the economy. The number one issue for many voters. President Biden wants to claim that Trump's record and agenda would only benefit the wealthy. Of course this is a vulnerability for President Biden. Many Americans don't see the economy as improving despite indicators that suggest the economy is doing well. It is something that he will have to talk about on the debate stage on Thursday night. Now the other items that I think are likely to come up and that we heard from Biden surrogates on Sunday is this idea of Trump as a convicted felon. We did hear from one key voice Mitch Landrieu who's a co-chair of the campaign. He talked about this idea of which Trump would show up on the debate stage. Would it be a restrained presidential Trump. Would it be a bombastic sort of ferocious Trump like we saw in 2020. Listen to what Mitch Landrieu said today. MITCH LANDRIEU, NATIONAL CO-CHAIR OF BIDEN CAMPAIGN: It really doesn't matter how Donald Trump shows up if he comes in unhinged like he is most of the time or he sits there and is quiet. People are going to know that he's a twice impeached convicted felon who's been found to have defamed somebody, sexually abused somebody and gone bankrupt six times. They will always know that. And that is something that the American people have to think about.",

Thanks so much for having me. I more expect the bombastic Trump simply because that's a Trump all Americans are used to. I think a lot of his campaign strategists want him to show a presidential side. But one thing that we've seen from Trump is that he just can't help himself. He loves the lamp limelight. He loves coming out hard and being an attack dog.

Abortion is one issue where he can really speak strongly to his own credentials and what he would try to do in office. We saw in the 2022 midterms that a lot of Americans said abortion was one of the biggest issues. It's why Democrats outperformed expectations. And we saw that also in a number of state referendum across the country as well. So abortion, abortion, abortion is definitely the issue that I think Biden is going to drive home.",

Now of course these comments from the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu suggesting that the Israeli military will be now shifting its focus away from Gaza and in particular away from areas of southern Gaza. We have seen intense bombardment over the last few weeks and doubling down on the military operation in northern Israel focusing on southern Lebanon. Take a listen to what he had to say to Israeli media. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): After the intense phase is finished we will have the possibility to move part of the forces north and we will do this first and foremost for defensive purposes. And secondly to bring our evacuated residents home. If we can we will do this diplomatically. If not we will do it another way. But we will bring all the residents home, all the residents of the north as well as the residents of the south. (END VIDEO CLIP) BASHIR: And we know that tens of thousands of people in northern Israel have been evacuated over the last few months. In southern Lebanon, nearly a hundred thousand people have been forced to flee their homes because of the intense violence that we're seeing. We've seen civilians killed in these airstrikes that are taking place including journalists reporting in the south. And of course, we're hearing those warnings from the international community that we're at a dangerous tipping point now along the border. But of course, we've heard from Israeli officials in the past saying that they can quote, \"copy and paste what we're seeing in Gaza in Lebanon.\" But Hezbollah is a very different organization. They have a much larger much stronger military arsenal. So that is certainly a point of concern. U.S. officials have told CNN there are concerns that Hezbollah could overwhelm Israel's air defense systems. The U.S. has also issued assurances that it will provide military and security assistance to Israel if there were an all out war. There are no U.S. boots on the ground. And of course we are expecting today to see the Israeli defense minister Yoav Galant in the United States meeting with his U.S. counterpart Lloyd Austin as well as the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken. The U.S. of course continuing to push for a ceasefire. They have framed this as the only way to not only secure peace in Gaza and secure the security of the state of Israel but also crucially to de-escalate tensions in Lebanon.",

It just kind of gets nudged a little bit while that front came through just for about a day or so. But then that heat starts to settle in again for more than 78 percent of the lower 48. That's 250 million people again with these temperatures at 90 degrees or hotter as we get into the workweek. In fact, we're looking at more than 300 records, both daytime highs and overnight lows falling as we go through the next couple of days as this heat just continues to swelter.

You can see D.C. getting back in some of that heat as we get into the middle of the week, 96 degrees by Wednesday. So that keeps the heat risk moderate, major and extreme in some locations.

The National Weather Service here a few hours ago just issued a red alert. They're a highest level of alert for heavy rainfalls to cover multiple provinces along the Yangtze River. That, of course, is one of the most populated and economically important regions of this country already over the weekend. In one eastern Chinese province alone, in Anhui, we have seen more than half a million people being affected by these floods. And with the authorities there evacuating some 64,000 people. Now these dramatic footage we've been seeing in state media showing both urban and rural areas submerged in muddy water with emergency responders rushing to rescue trapped residents using speed boats, rafts and in some cases carrying elderly citizens on their shoulders away from their submerged homes. And heavy equipment have been sent in to clear some of the debris and choppers being deployed to sending supplies as a growing number of residents now finding themselves being cut off from access to roads, communications as well as electricity. But the thing is, with this heavy rain and floods impacting southern China, many parts of northern China actually are experiencing severe drought and record high temperatures.

And we've seen an exponential increase in the escalation after the exchange of fire, the direct exchange of fire between Iran and Israel.Prior to that, Hezbollah had been careful to respond in a relatively moderate way. I say relatively, given the intensity of Israeli attacks in Lebanon. Hezbollah's lost more than 350 members of its party over the past eight months through targeted killing. Israel has been bombarding areas as far as the Lebanese-Syrian border. So Hezbollah has not responded in the same manner in a way to try and keep the temperature down. They don't want to provoke an all-out war, again, because of the cost on Lebanon, but also because Iran does not want to lose assets. It has spent the last four decades building up. Hezbollah is the primary line of defense as far as Iran is concerned. So now, with the intensification of the bombings, the kind of messages that Israel and Hezbollah are sending each other. We saw the drones of Hezbollah that took pictures of images of quite sensitive areas in Haifa and in other places in Israel. And the message is, if you're going to target us more heavily or conduct either a ground invasion or a more extensive aerial bombardment and start targeting civilian areas, then we're going to respond in the same way. We're not going to keep kind of a lid on it as we have so far. Let's also not forget that along Lebanon's southern border, the damage has been extensive. More than 100,000 citizens have been displaced. And we're talking about 90 to 100 towns and villages across that border that have been either destroyed or severely damaged. Plus, Israel has been using phosphorus to literally burn agricultural land in that area. So there is a de facto kind of buffer zone that has been created on the Lebanese side of the border.
