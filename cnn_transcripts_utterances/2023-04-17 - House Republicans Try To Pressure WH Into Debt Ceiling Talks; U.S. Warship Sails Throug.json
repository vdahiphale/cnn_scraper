Now, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy says that he wants to put this on the floor at some point in May, which is no easy feat, given that Republicans have largely been divided on how to approach these debt limit talks. And they have a very slim majority in the House. But, the broader strategy from Kevin McCarthy here is to try to get all Republicans on the same page and then use that to force the Biden administration back to the negotiating table, as well as argue that any sort of deal that they reach must include strings attached.Another big problem, though, underlying all of this is that President Biden and Kevin McCarthy have not held negotiations on the debt limit for several weeks now. They last met in early February. And currently, there is not another meeting on the books. We'll see if that changes with this latest proposal. Alayna Treene, CNN, Washington.",

We just received a communique from these talks, and expect to be -- expect a lot of discussion on the acceleration of moving into a green energy future. While no specific timetable has been established to get rid of coal, per se, there is a lot of emphasis now on alternative energies, such as increasing wind production by 2030, as well as eliminating plastic by 2014. That is a pretty lofty goal.Now, well, this seems like the right thing to do from an environmental standpoint. There is also a big political side to all of this. One of the discussions that will be taking place, the broader G7, is the impact of the war on Ukraine, and one of the big impacts, and it's certainly been on the energy sector, especially with oil, the price of oil to supply the demand. The goal is for G7 nations to be energy independent. So, they feel that by having these discussions about going to these alternative fuel sources such as energy, such as wind, and such as solar, it will allow them to be more energy independent, despite what the political wins may be. So, these are some things, Bianca, that are being discussed now, in anticipation of the broader G7 coming up next month in Hiroshima, Japan.",

They are allowed to go. They're free to leave if they wanted to. But, if they stay for less than three years in Russia, they'll have to pay back the state benefits that they've gotten, which is out of reach for most people.

And by then, will Ukraine even want them back?It's also impossible to note just how freely people felt that they could speak with us. But, you got the impression from some of them that they were on the side of Russia. One woman told us that she -- it's the Ukrainians who were responsible for what happened in Mariupol. Another one said that she wanted to go back but only if it was firmly in the hands of the Russians by then. Other people had more nuanced views or didn't want to talk about the war.

It's governed by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, and the chief minister of the state is Yogi Adityanath.Now, here is the sequence of events. You had two men being brought out of the police jeep, one of them being Atiq Ahmed, who was a former lawmaker from India. He is also an infamous gangster as well, and he has been convicted in several -- he has been convicted in a kidnapping case and he also has a lot of criminal cases against him. So, these two men were walking down from the jeep towards a hospital where they were due for medical checkups, which according to the local police is routine ahead of another case hearing which they were to be presented in. Now, within moments of walking, they had some journalists come over to question them, and this is in connection with a former lawmaker, Atiq Ahmed's son, who was killed in a police encounter in Uttar Pradesh last week. It was his funeral. The father wasn't allowed to go, and the questions to him were just about why he wasn't allowed to attend the funeral. Moments later, Bianca, you hear gunshots, not one, not two, but over a dozen gunshots. The next thing, Atiq Ahmed is on the floor. His turban falls off, and his brother is also targeted. And within moments, three men have been arrested by the police. A lot of questions being raised over the so-called lawlessness in the state by opposition members as well, opposition party leaders. A lot of questions being asked over how could this incident take place in the presence of so many police officers. All of this was caught on live television. And then, the police has told the media that three of the accused were actually a part of the journalist group that we're posing those questions to Atiq Ahmed and his brother. There has been a lot of security tightened across the state of Uttar Pradesh. There was internet -- internet services, rather, were pulled down for a while. They were suspended. But now, they're back in some spots. But, the worry really is the safety, the security and the lawlessness that opposition leaders talk about in the state of Uttar Pradesh after this incident.
