I'm Boris Sanchez coming to you live from Milwaukee.Brianna Keilar, my good friend and co-anchor is live for us in Washington, DC. Day two of the RNC Convention has kicked off, and at any minute, Donald Trump's newly minted running mate, freshman Senator JD Vance of Ohio is expected to do a walkthrough of the convention center ahead of his big speech. All of this happening as we are learning of an Iranian plot to assassinate former President Donald Trump, a plot with no known connection to Saturday's assassination attempt. Now, CNN's Evan Perez is going to have more details on that plot in just a moment. But first, we want to go to Kaitlan Collins, who is on the convention floor and Kaitlan, what are you seeing now? What's coming later tonight?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Boris, it is a little bit calmer right now. We're not being totally crammed here on the floor, which typically is the case when the delegates are actually here on the floor.I am standing in between Wisconsin and Pennsylvania right now. And if you can see behind me, you could see Donald Trump, Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle, they are two people who are expected to speak tomorrow. Donald Trump, Jr. is going to be one of those introducing the newly minted vice presidential nominees, Senator JD Vance when he gives his speech tomorrow. Of course that first formal appearance that we are going to see from him since he was picked yesterday as Donald Trump's running mate. And I should note that I am hearing from sources that Donald Trump and JD Vance are expected to appear every single night here at the Republican Convention together. Obviously, we saw all that moment last night, one of the biggest moments, probably that is going to come out of this convention where Donald Trump entered the hall here where I am standing, the VIP box is just behind the camera. And of course, you see that bandage on his ear, and so, just moments like that that remind everyone of exactly what happened on Saturday night, how that has changed what you are going to hear from some of these figures like Donald Trump, Jr. on the campaign stage who say -- on the delegation stage, I should note who say that they have changed and toned down their speeches. Of course, we will have to wait to see how those speeches are actually delivered. We saw Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson saying they put the wrong one in the teleprompter when he spoke yesterday, so we are watching all of these moments. And the other person that we are expected to see here to come out to also test out the microphone and the lectern is Senator Vance himself. There is a lot of security here on the delegation floor right now, Boris, as we are watching from them. The other thing though, to keep an eye on, on that stage behind us tonight is you're going to see two of Donald Trump's fiercest Republican critics now turned allies of his who are back on an endorsing him for the 2024 campaign. That's Governor Ron DeSantis and Governor Nikki Haley, who both were harsh critics of his during the campaign when they were challenging him for the Republican nomination with Ron DeSantis saying he did not believe Trump was pro prolife and Nikki Haley saying she thought that trump was unhinged and diminished. And so now you will see them coming out in support of him tonight just speaks to really what we are looking at here on the floor, how much the Republican Party has changed in the eight years since there was a last formal convention in Cleveland, Ohio.",

He is a state co-chair of the Trump campaign, and he was actually there on Saturday in Butler when the shooting took place. Congressman first, I want to get your reaction to this reporting that there was actually enhanced security at that rally in light of the Iranian plot to assassinate former President Donald Trump.Enhanced security at a rally in which the president was still talking by a shooter, roughly 150 yards away. What's your reaction? REP. DAN MEUSER (R-PA): Yes, the shooter's plan wasn't all that complicated, right? I mean, he went around the so-called perimeter. He climbed up on a building with a -- seemingly an AR-type weapon and was able to fire. So there was certainly a lot of security there, both Homeland Security, Secret Service, and local Pennsylvania State Troopers, and the local police. So there was ample security. The plan and execution clearly had some significant lapses in it. A hundred fifty yards outside of the staging area, able to get a shot off from a rifle. I mean, anybody who hunts knows that that that's an easy target to hit. And I'll tell you something, Boris, I mean, we were -- I was sitting with Dave McCormick and Mike Kelly, and many others. Christine Toretti, our national committee person, many others, was truly within the line of fire. We were right under it, and that's where the poor gentleman from Pennsylvania was hit because he was raised up and he was trying to be heroic and guard his children and his wife and tragically, he was murdered in this.",

I mean, just this past Friday, excuse me, Joe Biden was stating how Donald Trump was nothing short of Hitler. He is going to be a dictator. He is going to destroy our country. He is dangerous to our country. The bullseye comment that we heard. I mean, frankly the First Lady Jill Biden saying President Trump is evil and I am not saying it is one-sided, but those are pretty personal attacks and that is why I challenge the DNC and the Biden ministration to a policy debate. Let's avoid all of these mischaracterizations because that's what they are, they are really not based upon truth. They are based upon trying to get -- trying to fire up one side over another.",

MEUSER: Well, you know what? He is a very good messenger. He is very -- he speaks very, very clearly, and he makes -- I think he makes policies very common sense and sensible to people. I mean, I've noticed that in him over the last two years. I mean, if you look at his background, very humble beginnings, joined the Marines, then went to Ohio State. Then went to Yale Law School, had a successful business career. You know, I think as the American people get to know him as I do, and certainly as President Trump, because he is going to pick the best person he can under the criteria that he had, so I think he is going to impress the American people.",

It just means, let's make America strong as it can be so our allies and friends can be that much stronger, in my view, and I think that is stated.And so, you know, I think it is kind of impressive that President Trump can get past that and give him the most important job in his administration.",

He is getting a little bit of a tour, like all the speakers that you're going to see in primetime tonight and tomorrow and later this week are. We've seen all of them come out to kind of just get a test, see where they are, see where the prompters are, see where the cameras are, and practice coming in and off the stage.[15:15:04] Also up there right now with him notably is Donald Trump, Jr., who of course is one of Vance's fiercest advocates to make him his dad's VP pick. I am told that there was even a moment last week at Mar-a-Lago where Donald Trump, Jr., hearing that his dad was considering other people like North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum went in and made a personal appeal again to his dad to put Vance on the ticket believing that he would be the best for him. And notably, given that influence and said clearly how it, in part worked with his father. He was interviewed, Donald Trump, Jr. was by AXIOS earlier this morning. He was asked what his thoughts were on staffing for a potential second Trump term, what that would look like, if he would be recommending anyone else for his father's administration. He said he didn't necessarily want to pick people to be at jobs, but he wanted to have veto power over certain people that he did not believe should be in there and Senator Vance himself has also been questioned on this when he once wrote that he wanted to be able to fire every mid-level bureaucrat and replace them with people who are loyal to Trump, arguing that that was something that worked against him during his first time in the White House. That was something that ABC's George Stephanopoulos questioned him about. And so obviously, I think that's something to think about as we talk about what this pick is looking like and the fact that Senator Vance is going to be on Donald Trump's ticket as if they are elected to the White House as president and vice president, what that means for what the staffing of a second Trump term would look like, something that of course has had heavy and intense focus. And as we see, it does include at least one former Trump critic who says his views have evolved and Vance himself. And so Boris, yes, I will just note that we are watching them come up here, take a bit of a loop around the stage. We are going to see that a lot over the next few hours as then we get into the speakers tonight that does include that very long list of people who could potentially also hope to have a job in the Trump Cabinet, in the Trump administration. I talked to Doug Burgum yesterday, just a few hours after he learned he was not going to be the vice presidential pick, he said that when he connected with Donald Trump during the day yesterday, Trump called him, Mr. Secretary, hinting that he may have a role in a future Trump Cabinet if there is one. Now, that is notable because Burgum said previously that he did not want any Cabinet secretary position. It was VP or nothing basically for him. Yesterday, he seemed potentially open to doing so -- Boris.",

And to give you a sense how fraught this was, Lyndon Johnson, the president and Bobby Kennedy did not like each other and Johnson and was afraid that the delegates were going to draft Kennedy and make him the vice presidential nominee over Johnson's objections. So Johnson would let Kennedy speak until the last day of the convention after Hubert Humphrey, the senator, had already been nominated for vice president.
