Israel's promised operation in Rafah could cause the biggest catastrophe of this war. We're going to bring you his testimony. Then, a year ago, American journalist Evan Gershkovich was arrested in Russia and charged with espionage. Today, he is still behind bars. We're going to have a live report from St. Petersburg. Plus, a record-breaking fundraising event for U.S. President Joe Biden in New York. We're going to have the key moments from a historic night in U.S. politics. Israel is wasting no time responding to an order from the International Court of Justice. Benjamin Netanyahu's government saying it wishes, in its words, no harm to the civilian population in Gaza. Now, this comes as the World Court is calling on Israel to do more to get humanitarian aid into the besieged enclave. Now, the court says quote \"famine is setting in.\" At the same time, the Israeli Prime Minister says his military is preparing to enter Rafah in southern Gaza. Now, the U.S. has repeatedly discouraged an Israeli ground incursion there. We're also getting word from the IDF. The Israeli military operations are continuing for a 12th day around Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City. Palestinian health officials say patients and medical staff there have been killed. So, I want to bring in CNN International Correspondent Ben Wedeman for more on this. Ben I want to start with harsh comments from the UNICEF spokesperson today. He said hope in Gaza is drowned out by bombs. Bring us up to date there.",

So, he has actually seen what's going on, unlike journalists who cannot get in freely. But, what he is saying is that, after the UN Security Council passed that resolution, with United States abstaining, calling for an immediate ceasefire, there was hope in Gaza that the situation would improve, perhaps at least for the month left, the remainder of the month of Ramadan, just under two weeks, that Gaza would have a period of peace and quiet. But, he says those hopes were drowned out by bombs, that the hostages are still being held in Gaza, that the bombardment of Gaza by Israeli forces continues.And there still continue to be impediments to the entry of aid into the Gaza Strip where, of course, 80 percent to 90 percent of the population, as we know, have been displaced. So, he says the situation is really getting worse. And if Israel goes ahead with its plans for a full-scale military operation in Rafah, where about 1.5 million people have taken refuge, indeed, in his words, this could be the biggest catastrophe yet in this war that has killed more than 32,500 people. It's believed 70 percent of them women and children. Omar.",

And I want to warn you, you may find some of the images in this report disturbing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This video filmed 11 days ago at a northern Gaza hospital captured little Muhammad's (ph) final days, his labored breath and all but staff tried to do to keep him alive. On Thursday, six-year-old Muhammed became the 24th Palestinian child to die of malnutrition and dehydration in Gaza. And the fear is many more vulnerable lives could be lost. Hunger is in every corner of this besieged territory. The pain visible in the eyes of mothers like Michela (ph), who has helplessly watched her children go hungry for months. Her husband, Mehran (ph), has thought the unthinkable, throwing his children in the sea, he says, to spare them this torture of inexistence. Dante's (ph) family endured months of bombardment in northern Gaza, but it's a looming famine there that's pushed them out of their home. If you grab a bag of flowers, someone can kill you to take it, Mehran says. Our daily meal for our children became things we hadn't heard of before, like ground soybeans and a wild plant that we never tasted before, food that animals refuse to eat, we ate. What they'll do? Where they'll go? They don't know. All they want right now is to feed their little ones. My children were crying every night, asking for a piece of bread, Najlat (ph) says. We were dreaming of white bread. We were eating animal food. For the first time in five months, they say, the children are having real food, even if only plain bread. This is what Dante's family left behind in the north. scenes that tell of the desperation of so many who also just want to feed their children as they brush the little aid that's made it into this part of Gaza. More than a million Palestinians are now facing catastrophic levels of hunger, according to UN-backed reports, with famine projected to arrive in the north any day now in this manmade crisis where Israel has been accused of using starvation as a weapon of war, something it denies. People every day find themselves scavenging for food, forced to pick wild plants to boil and eat. This grandmother can't hold back her tears as she washes weeds and leaves. It's today's meal. What else can we do? She says it's the indignity of hunger, avoidable suffering, as the world watches on. Jomana Karadsheh, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The Journal is marking the anniversary in today's print edition by leaving a large section of its front page blank. You can see the copy there. The space represents the missing articles Gershkovich never wrote because of his detention. The Journalist headline says in part, \"His story should be here.

And so, one of the things they've been doing is kind of gathering U.S. citizens and putting them in jail to use as bargaining chips in any future negotiation, any future deal, a deal that could eventually see Evan Gershkovich, others like Paul Whelan, a former U.S. Marine, who has been in jail since 2018, accused and convicted, in fact, of espionage in Russia as well, we could eventually see them released.But, at the moment, those negotiations have not come to anything. And we don't know exactly what the terms are. We think we know what the Russians want in return, or who they want in return, rather, and that's someone called Vadim Krasikov. He is in prison in Germany. He is a member of the Russian Security Services, and he was convicted of killing a Chechen dissident in a park in Germany, serving a murderer sentence in that country. And the Russians really want him back. But, so far, it seems the Germans have not played ball. They've not been willing to exchange a convicted murderer for people in Russian jails. I think it would send the wrong message. And so, at the moment, the talks are ongoing, but they're also in a deadlock. Omar.",

We're learning new details about the construction worker who fell more than 185 feet into the water and lived. Jeffrey Pritzker, the Executive Vice President of Brawner Builders, says the Mexican national who worked for the company likely survived by swimming before being rescued by first responders. The man who was treated at the University of Maryland's Medical Center's Shock Trauma Center, but was released hours after the collapse. Pritzker added the worker is quote, \"very, very upset. He does have injuries and I understand he is very stressed out and is suffering from stress.\" A fellow worker from Brawner Builders told CNN Thursday, the team likely would have been on their break at the time of the impact, that worker saying he requested a last-minute shift change ahead of Tuesday, likely saving his life. However, less is known about the second survivor, who Pritzker said was not part of their construction team.

The campaign is touting this morning the fact that they raised more than $26 million from this one night event alone, really they hope adding to the cash advantage that they've already had against former President Donald Trump.But, President Biden, Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, spent nearly an hour in conversation with late-night host Stephen Colbert. They laid out the stakes of this election and specifically the threat that they believe former President Donald Trump holds for the country. They never mentioned Trump by name, but they each spoke about the man, and Biden warned that democracy is at stake. He said, quote \"We're at a real inflection point in history. This guys denies global warming. This guy wants to get rid of not only Roe v. Wade which he brags about having done, he wants to get rid of the ability of anyone in America to have the right to choose. All the things he is doing, they're so old. A little old and out of shape.\" Now, the Biden campaign today is also releasing a video from this event. We have to note that reporters were not allowed to record any type of video inside this fundraiser.

Hundreds of pro-Palestinian protesters, as you note, had gathered outside of Radio City Music Hall before and during the event. And the presidents were interrupted at least four times by protesters in the actual room. Most of those protesters were talking about Gaza. And it was interesting to see the way that former President Obama addressed these protesters. He said to them specifically, you can't just talk and not listen. That is what the other side does. He said that there are complicated issues in the world that need to have problems to solve them, and this will involve discussions about that conflict between Israel and Hamas. So, really, it's highlighting the fact that this issue will continue to linger for Democrats heading into November's election. This will be something that the candidate Joe Biden and his surrogates also potentially will likely have to address. But, the Biden campaign is really hoping that this will be a big momentum building moment, this fundraiser, and the President is expected to continue that push today. He will be meeting with his National Finance Committee in New York City where the top donors to the campaign, when I just hear from President Biden but also from senior Biden campaign officials I'm told, about the strategy and path ahead as they look to take on Trump in November.",

He could not catch up with that financial edge, a lot of it coming from the fact that he had to compete in a primary and also he has been fighting these legal battles as well. He has spent the last several weeks meeting with donors behind closed doors, talking to donors on the phone. And I talked to his campaign and they say that this is paying off. They believe that the checks are starting to come in, and if this fundraiser is as successful as they believe it will be, that will be a huge lift to Donald Trump. The other reason why this is so significant is because it shows that the Republican Party is really coming around Donald Trump. They are circling the wagons and they were saying that we're going to support this man, both in support but also financially. There were a lot of these big dollar donors who were sitting on the sidelines during the primaries. They were hoping for any alternative to Donald Trump, but clearly now that has changed, and they're stepping up -- stepping behind the former President. Omar.",

So, I used to wear hand me downs from Yusuke. Shohei-San (ph) also gave me a lot of baseball equipment to use, which I really appreciate. MONTGOMERY (voice-over): Sasaki is the projected number one pick in Japan's professional baseball draft, but this letter is for going all of it to, go to Stanford, a decision his father who has coached Ohtani, Kikuchi and now his son advised him to make. HIROSHI SASAKI, HEAD COACH &amp; RINTARO'S FATHER (Interpreted): In Japan, people tend to focus more on shortcomings, but in the U.S., they develop individuality. I think this is a very good choice for him. MONTGOMERY (voice-over): This unassuming high school tucked away among Japan's snowy Northern Mountains now boasts three baseball stars. So, what's the secret? Coach Sasaki tells me it's not about the power in the arm, but in the mind. H. SASAKI (Interpreted): I think the most important thing is to not blame others or to make excuses. Once I stopped doing that, my life changed. And the other thing is to set a firm goal. MONTGOMERY (voice-over): And of course, practice, practice, and more practice. Still, Sasaki has a way to go before reaching the heights of Ohtani, his dad tells me. H. SASAKI (Interpreted): I'd never seen such a level of athleticism before. The moment they joined the team, I knew they'd be tremendous athletes once they got stronger. MONTGOMERY (voice-over): Ohtani and Kikuchi, forever legends for this Japanese high school, and a source of motivation for Sasaki. R. SASAKI (Interpreted): One day, I want to be playing on the same field as Ohtani and Sasaki. That's what's driving me. MONTGOMERY (voice-over): Hanako Montgomery, CNN, Hanamaki City. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
