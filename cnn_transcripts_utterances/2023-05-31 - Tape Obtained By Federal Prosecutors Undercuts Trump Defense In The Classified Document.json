      "sentences": "Well, it's significant, Jake, because this is something that could significantly undermine essentially everything that Trump has been saying in defense to this documents investigation. And the reason that this is the meeting that matters so much is it was actually months before that effort that was underway to get so many of those documents from Mar-a- Lago back to the National Archives that were certainly back and forth.But this was back in the summer of 2021 and Trump is meeting with people who are writing a bio autobiography for Mark Meadows at his Bedminster club in New Jersey, they are talking about a story that just came out in the New Yorker that Susan Glasser published it was about General Mark Milley, who as you know, is the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and it was about his concerns that in those waning days of the Trump presidency that Trump was going to potentially take -- would potentially take military action when it came to Iran and Milley's efforts to push back on that. And what we are told is on this tape is Trump discussing a document that is classified that he says if he could show it to the people that he's speaking to that it would undermine what Millie's argument is, that Millie was the one pushing back against Trump's efforts to potentially take action, take military action in Iran. Now, we have not actually heard this recording, Jake. But we do know it is in the hands of the prosecutors who are investigating his handling of classified documents after he left office. We do know that you can hear paper rustling on this recording, we know that there are people laughing in the background. I'm told that this part only is about two minutes long that pertains to Iran, it's part of a much longer recording the prosecutors now have. The reason to though, Jake, that is significant is that Trump seems to indicate on this tape, as he is speaking with those that he has gathered with him at his New Jersey club, that he cannot show it to them, that he has taken something that is a classified document, and that he is limited in his post presidency ability to declassify something, which of course would undercut the argument that he's been making all along.",

That is how interested they are in this. Now, we are also told that this wasn't a document that Milley produced despite what Trump was arguing or making it sound like on this recording, that's not totally clear still.

And to me, from my perspective, it's remarkable that at every stage of this, that special counsel seems to be finding evidence of either what Trump himself said, what his lawyers himself said. And if there should come a day when this all gets presented to a jury, I think he's amassed a pretty powerful case of evidence against the president showing that he knew these documents were classified when he took them out of the White House.",

Obviously, we published the story about an hour ago, obviously, we reached out before then trying to get in touch with them asking for their version of this because they've pushed back on this repeatedly saying that he's had no wrongdoing here. His lawyers have made different arguments in court than what you've seen Trump always make publicly about how he's declassified these documents. But we still to this moment right now at 5And I think also what's important to note here is as we've tracked this investigation, and we've all been reporting on it for several months now, there have been moments where we've heard from sources close to Trump's orbit saying they don't think this investigation really poses a threat to him. This piece of reporting seemed to change that. We heard from sources who said they believed it was an important piece of evidence in this investigation, because it does go to the heart of his defense of whether or not he believed that he could declassify things of whether or not, as Paula was noting earlier, it was this rushed move from the White House and aides packed up boxes and they didn't know what he had at Mar-a-Lago or Bedminster, as Jamie notes there, on this recording. We don't know that he was actually holding the document on Iran, that's what he was indicating to those who are listening. But you can hear a paper rustling on the recording, so he knew that he had this document, obviously a plan to potentially strike Iran, as he indicated, it was that what it was would be classified. He knew that he had that and he knew obviously that he's no longer inside the White House. So I think that is also a significant part of this. And I should note, Jake, one other thing, we're told that a lot of these developments have happened recently. When it comes to General Milley speaking with investigators, I'm told that has happened recently. We don't know exactly when, but it does speak to the level of progress in this investigation and the fact that Jack Smith is very much still conducting this investigation.",

Thanks for joining us. So Purdue Pharma first introduced the opioid drug OxyContin in the 1990s. It promoted it aggressively as non-addictive. A couple of decades, one massive opioid epidemic later one that we're still going through, we know that's not true. Between 1999 and 2020, more than 564,000 people in this country died from an overdose involving any opioid obviously, that's not just the prescription drugs manufactured by Purdue. And it also includes illicit opioids such as heroin. What is your reaction is one of the world's authorities of this family and the crisis to the settlement? BETH MACY, AUTHOR, \"DOPESICK\": Well, I was really disappointed. First of all, when white collar criminals don't go to jail, the behavior continues, and to me and to a lot of the activists that I profiled, and my follow up both to \"Dopesick,\" \"Raising Lazarus,\" this is just another example of billionaire justice. They got, the family gets civil immunity in exchange for giving up the company and $6 billion of their wealth, which is roughly just half of what they may to get 18 years to pay it off, which means that the money that they have now can continue to build on itself. And, you know, they paid almost a billion dollars on legal fees throughout the case. So, you know, when you have a family that ran a company that micromanage a company, that basically was the tap root of this crisis, and at the end of this four years of litigation, they still retain much of their wealth. I mean, wealth is power in this country. What's the legal different, you know?",

So of course, we need more money, but you know, and it's good for this, the 750 million that are that is going to the families, that's great. But the average amount of the award is not even going to reimburse somebody for a funeral they had. And I just think it's not enough. When you look and see all that they had. I've been doing some reporting in my hometown in rural Ohio. And I was just floored by how like Foster Care has tripled. The graduation rate has gone down.

One, it kind of taught me about the economics of the family, because you -- as you pull up on the street, and you approach the house you're expecting, I mean, this is Supreme Court Justice. You know, normally the people that are seen that far up, you know, they're from affluent families already, and it's just a very regular one story home with three bedrooms on a fairly regular street in Savannah. So that was one thing.But the other thing is that, you know, Clarence Thomas has talked a lot about his grandfather. In fact, his autobiography is named my grandfather's son. But his mother was really quick to point out that his grandmother, Kristine, played just as much of a role in his life and, you know, the nurturing that he received from age six on. And, you know, a lot of people may have theories as to why, you know, Justice Thomas doesn't talk about his grandmother in quite the way that he talks about his grandfather. But either way, the woman's work was just been, you know, really overlooked in his life story. TAPPER: The first episode also touches on Justice Thomas, considering the priesthood, being radicalized by Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination, even embracing to a degree with Malcolm X's ideology.

And what's quite, you know, Clarence draws the seminary in high school and in college for a couple of years. You mentioned the Martin Luther King assassination.It was when he was at the seminary during the Martin Luther King assassination that one of his classmates implied that basically, it was a good thing that Martin Luther King got killed. So he drops out of the seminary and goes off to college. And when you talk about, you know, the radical piece of it, a lot of it is Clarence trying to find himself. You know, this is the first time that he sort of on his own, gets to make these decisions about who he wants to be and how he wants to present himself to the world. And in 1968, what many people cooler than like Black Panthers and like revolutionaries and radicals. And so it's kind of fitting in, it makes a lot of sense why somebody might gravitate toward that, because at least the look of it is like sort of arresting it, it makes you stand out.",

And you kind of forget, you know, over the years, you know, you just like, well, he is a Supreme Court justice, obviously, he went to these very prestigious academic institutions, you kind of forget that that's going to be a piece of it.But at every stage of his career, academic and professional, affirmative action played a really pivotal role.
