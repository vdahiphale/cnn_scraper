Women's equality, \"The unfinished business of the 21st century\" is an issue we cover often on this program.

Friday's event will bring together advocates, artist, political and policy leaders from around the world to address defending and advancing women's rights, they say. The agenda, including voting rights, health care, peace, the workplace and more. It is a fight that Hillary Clinton has led for decades, most famously with her call nearly 30 years ago at a U.N. women's conference in Beijing and often quoted and repeated ever since.

HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: Well, what I think, Christiane, is that we have come a long way since I made that statement back in 1995 on so many fronts. But we are also in a period of time where there is a lot of pushback and much of the progress that has been, I think, taken for granted by too many people is under attack. Literally under attack in places like Iran or Afghanistan or Ukraine where rape is a tactic of war, or under attacks by political and cultural forces in a country like our own when it comes to women's health care and bodily autonomy.",

As you said, they are human rights. At what point should these be enshrined even in the American law and constitution even. I mean, I'm probably exaggerating.

To try to enshrine at least a federal right to those fundamental human rights. And I think we have to have that conversation going because, as you could see, with that vote in the Senate, I think, a dozen Republicans voted with all the Democrats. That would not have happened 10 years, 20 years ago. I know. So, in a democracy when things don't go your way, when you suffer setbacks, you need to remember that there is no permanent political victory or defeat. You have to keep fighting for these fundamental rights. You have to try to enshrine them in law as best you can. And in our system, at both the federal and the state level. So, we'll see what happens in states like Arkansas and so many others when we face real world problems. As we have seen already where women with miscarriages go in for medical care and are turned away. When maybe, God forbid, a woman dies because that health care is denied her. I just believe that the fervor of the interests that are saying there should be absolutely no choice for women in half the states or more of our country will run right up against reality. As it has in elections in Kansas and Kentucky and Montana, California, and Michigan, where voters got to vote on these extreme measures or trying to prevent them from ever being imposed in their states. And right now, it's obvious that, you know, the great majority of Americans believe the Supreme Court, local states, legislatures, et cetera. Have gone way too far.",

Because, of course, there should be an absolutely rejection ofusing sexual attack of any kind as a tactic of war. But sadly, we have seen it not just in the past, but in the current times from the Congo now to Ukraine. And I think we have to continue to hold the leaders accountable and continue to speak out about what this kind of barbaric treatment says about a military and about a leadership of a country that would, at least, permit, if not, condone such attacks. But the real challenge for us is to keep supporting the brave people of Ukraine, especially as they fight back and pushback the Russian occupiers, the fewer Russian occupiers who are on their territory, the fewer women and girls who will be subjected to rape. And I hope that as we move into the winter, which we know will be especially brutal for the people of Ukraine, that we don't lose our commitment or our absolute passion to help them with every tool that they need, with military means, with humanitarian aid. And I also think it's time for the United States and NATO to take another look at providing more defensive weapons. Because what the Russians are doing is trying to literally bomb the Ukrainian people into submission by destroying their power generators, their electricity grid. They will not succeed. But the suffering will increase. So, anything that can be done to give the Ukrainian military more means of rebuffing these brutal bombing attacks, we need to be looking much more closely at doing that.",

And they are rightly concerned about Iran, and because they are, they need to understand that Iran and Russia have now made an alliance, where Iran is assisting Russia, particularly with drone technology, to reap even greater destruction on Ukraine. I now believe it should be understood to be in Israel's interest to try to undercut and prevent Iran from succeeding because of Iran and Russia deepen their military alliance outside of Syria, where they've also been working together for a number of years, that is very dangerous for the entire world, but in particular, for Israel. So, Iron Dome, other means of defense. I think defensive measures are called for and wherever they come from, the United States, other NATO nations, Israel, now is the time to send a very clear message to both Russia and Iran. That their behavior, their bombardment of Ukraine, they're learning lessons that they could maybe apply in invading, occupying or bombing other nations will be stopped right now. So, yes, I agree completely with those calls and I hope that there's a lot of conversation going on to try to move forward on that.",

Well, first of all, during the Green Revolution in 2009, we made a decision based on the best intelligence and information we had atthe time that overt American support for the protests would actually hurt those protests and the protesters themselves. So, behind the scenes, we tried to keep social media operating so that people could communicate and organize. Now, I think it's very different than it was 13 years ago. What's happening now deserves our full-throated support. And I think every time anyone speaks on behalf of the United States government, they need to be saying that they stand with the people of Iran, particularly with the women and girls. I also think we should continue to take whatever action is possible through international bodies. I was part of a group of women leaders who called for the U.N. to kick Iran off the U.N. Commission on the status of women. They should never have been on there in the first place. And I believe we're moving toward that actually being accomplished, at least it better be because it's the right thing to do. But I also believe that we need to keep the world's attention focused. I did an event last week with a group of Iranian American women and artists who were really pleading to keep eyes on Iran. Don't lose focus uncovering what is happening inside. And, Christiane, I want to thank you for refusing to put on a hijab to continue an interview with the president of Iran, because we need to be standing with the people of Iran. Now, you know that the issues are much more than even the oppression of compulsory hijab, but that is a symbol of what that oppression means to the lives, the freedom, the opportunities of the women of Iran. So, this is something our government needs to keep speaking out about. And finally, I would not be negotiating with Iran on anything right now, including the nuclear agreement. I think that, frankly, horse is out of the barn. When Trump pulled us out, we lost the eyes that we had on what they were doing inside Iran. And I believe that they started those centrifuges spinning again and I think it's unlikely that any agreement would be agreed to, and I don't think we should look like we are seeking an agreement at a time when the people of Iran are standing up to their oppressors. And we are giving them hope and heart. And I think we're doing something else. We're sending a message to whoever the few possibly concerned people are about what's happening to the tens of thousands of Iranians being imprisoned and the many hundreds who are being killed that maybe they are willing inside to speak out, not just within the government, but more importantly, with the clerics to say that this is not sustainable. We have to move back from this. You can't premise a theocracy on covering up women's hair. That doesn't mean we are going to overthrow the regime and they are going to leave peacefully, but I'm hoping that there can be some kind of internal discussion that might lead to, you know, more freedom, but also less oppression. So, all of that is going on at the same time. And the U.S. and others need to be on the side of the protesters and they're very legitimate demands for the freedom that they deserve as the human rights of them and their fellow citizens should be recognized.",
