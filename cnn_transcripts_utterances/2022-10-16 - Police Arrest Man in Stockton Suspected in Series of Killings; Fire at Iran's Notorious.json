They say he left his house, he was in dark areas, going to parks, stopping, looking around, then moving again and they decided to arrest him. They say that he was wearing all black, that he had a mask around his neck and also that they found a gun. He was carrying a gun.

Late last night, videos emerging showing plumes of dark black smoke emerging from Evin prison as you laid out there.A prison complex which houses political dissidents, according to human rights organizations. But we're talking about political activists, journalists, lawyers, professors, writers, some of Iran's best and brightest being detained by the Iranian regime in prison. This has been deeply worrying many people across Iran and across the globe, indeed. We have heard from human rights organizations overnight, 1,500 which has been documenting many of the protests we've seen, sharing amongst the first videos of what appears to have been that fire coming from Evin prison, as well as videos which appear to show the sound of gunfire in the background. They reported late last night Iran security forces had been seen being deployed to the prison. As you can imagine, the Iranian regime and authorities have been quick to quell any suggestion that this was perhaps linked or connected to the protests that have been taking place. They have confirmed that eight inmates have been injured but said this fire was caused by what they described as \"thugs\" in the prison rioting. It was quickly brought under control after that fire ensued in a clothing warehouse on the complex. But we've also heard from another human rights organization and from another -- IranWire, a pro-reform news outlet, they said they've been speaking to a source within the prison, who told them there was a revolt in the complex. So there were clearly details there to be confirmed. It is unclear exactly what caused this fire. But it is significant given the context, weeks and weeks of protests gaining momentum. It doesn't appear as though they will be stopping anytime soon.",

The candidates facing off in a debate Friday, perhaps for the only time before Election Day. The Democrat hoping to hold on to the seat is senator Raphael Warnock. In a poll last week, he had a 7-point lead over Republican Herschel Walker. Mr. Walker only dropped by 1 point from a September poll after explosive reports surfaced that he, an abortion rights opponent, paid for his former girlfriend's abortion and encouraged her to get the procedure a second time. And now we're learning that former president Barack Obama will campaign for Democrats in Georgia in these final weeks before the midterms. And in Pennsylvania, where the Democrat lieutenant governor John Fetterman is taking on TV personality Republican Dr. Mehmet Oz. Our CNN poll of polls shows Mr. Fetterman leading by only 5 points. Mr. Fetterman had an 11-point lead in one poll in August and in just a month, that got slashed to a 3-point gap. Mr. Fetterman is getting support from the country's top Democrat.

And that kind of sentiment is actually what's been bonding him and his Russian counterpart, Putin, to form that so-called no-limits partnership. That's also why Beijing continues to support Moscow on so many different levels -- deepening economic ties, coordinating propaganda campaigns, despite Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine was not mentioned by Xi Jinping either specifically. But the one word he kept using in that speech was struggle, sometimes better translated as fight. He talked about not only fighting unilateralism and hegemony but also fighting COVID, fighting corruption within the party, fighting subversive forces in Hong Kong, fighting separatists in Taiwan. I think that's a very telling word that reflects his philosophy and attitude.

The leaders who say they will not accept a unilateral reunification with a mainland that they do not feel should control them, should not control the future of the people who live here.

The author of the survey says the Americans are not alone in these views.
