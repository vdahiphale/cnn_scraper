And of course witnesses have talked about that. Now we're going to show you some video. It's blurred, but you can see the chaotic nature that is right there in front of us. And there were just people strewn everywhere and folks from balconies were looking down. Some folks couldn't get out because obviously they were trying to keep them safe. But you can hear people screaming and yelling for help. You can also see people who are not responsive. Pamela Brown did an interview about an hour and a half ago and it was just gut wrenching to listen to this one witness talk about what he saw. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

As the city works to clear this scene and also take all the evidence, you understand this is going to shake people for quite some time. So many people want to know why.

And CNN Law enforcement contributor Steve Moore, who's also a retired supervisory special agent for the FBI, joins us now. Juliet, I'll come to you first. The FBI have named an attacker. We know he was a U.S. Citizen. We also know he was carrying an ISIS flag and explosives in that truck. Just explain to us how that shifts and refrains the investigation on what happened here.

But things that indicate that it was to me that it was likely a lone wolf is that there was no immediate confirmation or claim of responsibility from ISIS. The other thing that groups like ISIS do is they tend to go in with more than one person and attack not just the people initially, but come in and try to keep first responders from getting there. I know this guy did that, but it wasn't the same as two or three people coming at the same time.This was a single attack. While ISIS generally likes to do larger attacks and they tend to like to use explosives more. And I know he had them in the car, but this was not and effective --",

First and foremost, I want to express my deepest condolences to the families and loved ones that were impacted by this tragedy on Bourbon Street and in the heart of the city of New Orleans. And I know that the entire New Orleans City Council agrees along right with me, no doubt about that. And our people and our families. My priority will continue to be to ensure that victims that remain on Bourbon Street now will be serviced and removed as soon as possible. But as stated, the FBI is in charge of this investigation and are doing everything necessary to make this happen.I also want to acknowledge hearing from President Biden, all of our federal partners, but most importantly, calling Governor Landry this morning responded with haste. And we do say thank you. And of course, a demonstration of a unified support is right here in this room. That's how we collectively responded to this tragedy in the city of New Orleans. The mission now is to facilitate, support, and coordinate safety procedures to keep our residents and our visitors safe. I've gone to the hospital along with Chief Kirkpatrick to visit, our police officers, and considering their injuries, they're doing well. As I mentioned, this investigation is ongoing and the FBI remains the lead in the investigation. It is an active crime scene as well. We are committed, no doubt, to uncovering all details surrounding this tragedy. And we are taking every necessary step to put even more safety procedures in place, especially given the nature of the investigation. I'm going to ask people to do not go around our secured area if there is no essential need to do so. It matters. And again, it is an active crime scene. I also want you all to know that the Greater New Orleans Foundation has set up a fund to assist victims and that information will be provided to you. Thank you, GNOF. Again, I want to thank this unified team. We're leaning in. We will be relentless and we will do everything that it takes to render real justice. This team will. I want to also just thank our citizens for your heartfelt prayers. New Orleans is a world-class city and I can say that I've heard from world leaders all this morning and up until now, in addition to my brother and sister mayors across this country. They're calling, they're responding, and they're standing with the city of New Orleans and what they always say and want me to reiterate, they understand the resilience of this community and we're strong in that regard. And I will say second to none. So with that, I'm going to turn it over to our governor and as I mentioned, who has not wavered any in leaning in providing the necessary support and standing right here with me. And I say thank you, Governor. And I know the first lady is standing with us as well.",

The Super Bowl committee has a 90-year history of being a good corporate citizen for the city of New Orleans. And that's why this tragedy hurts us as much as anybody right now. So our condolences, thoughts and prayers go out to the victims and their families as we all work through this.Of course, anytime we have a major event in the city of New Orleans, public safety is paramount. And we have full faith and confidence in the governor and the mayor and all the assets, the federal, state, and local resources that they've applied to this event so that we can ultimately bring those responsible to justice and carry on with the major events that we have in front of us. Speaking of which, were scheduled this evening to have a CFP quarterfinal played in the Superdome at 7:45, we have been in consultation with ESPN, with the College Football Playoff, with the Southeastern Conference, with the University of Georgia, with Notre Dame, all parties and all agree that it's in the best interest of everybody in public safety that we postpone the game for 24 hours. Work is fast about to set up a safe and efficient and fun environment for tomorrow night. There will be more details on that in the coming hours. But for now that's the plan that we're going to move forward and play the game. And again, we reiterate our thanks to everyone up here for the important work they're doing. We live in the fun and games world with what we do. But we certainly recognize the importance of this and we're going to support it 100 percent so thank you.",

This was a heinous act, a heinous, cowardly act, and we will find them and we will bring them to justice.My office will be providing both investigative and prosecutorial support to the City of New Orleans, to the District Attorney Jason Williams in New Orleans as I have done for months and we will continue to do that.

My title, official title is superintendent but my role is as chief of police.You know, you've heard some of the details today and over the last 24 hours, we had approximately 400 officers in the French Quarter. And as we know, this is not just an act of terrorism. This is evil and when we face evil, we have a choice. We can run in fear, or we can indeed stand in strength. In a time of crisis, people are looking for leadership. You are looking at the leadership. And I promise you as the Chief of Police of this city, this city has been tried by fire before but fire purifies. Fire makes things stronger. We have a plan. We know what to do. We are going to get these people. There is a path forward. I'm very pleased that we will be back to having a wonderful game tomorrow night. New Orleans police have proven their ability to make the city safer. Just two years ago, we were the murder capital of America. Today, from that time two years ago, we have driven our murder rate more than 50 percent down. So we have a track record, but this is different because it's terrorism. Now, I want to thank all of our law enforcement partners. You're fabulous, and we appreciate the partnership. But last night, three of our officers engaged this terrorist who shot at them. Three of the officers returned fire. Those officers did not run in fear. I liked what the mayor said this morning. New Orleans police and all law enforcement is built. We are built for dealing with evil, with things that would cause us others to be in fear. But instead, our officers, and last night, NOPD particular, stood strong. They did not run. They did kill the terrorists. We have two officers indeed who received gunfire. They will be okay. We have personally gone to see them. But this is leadership for you. And I promise as the chief of police of this fantastic city that I will be strong and firm and fearless. Thank you.",
