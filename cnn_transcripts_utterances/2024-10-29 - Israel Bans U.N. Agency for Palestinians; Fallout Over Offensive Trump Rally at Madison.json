We are watching, of course, the impact, not only on the population who remain, those who have fled, but also, of course, on the hospitals, including Kamal Adwan Hospital, where we saw Israeli forces actually go into that hospital and arrest dozens of what they said were suspected Hamas terrorists. But, of course, the hospital says that several dozen healthcare workers were also rounded up as part of those arrests. As the situation in Northern Gaza is rapidly degrading, we are watching some movement on the hostage and ceasefire negotiations front. On Sunday, we saw the Mossad director and other top negotiators head to Doha, Qatar, to resume negotiations that have really been frozen for weeks now. And there is an interesting new Egyptian proposal on the table, which is no longer looking at a multi-phase deal to ultimately try and end the war in Gaza and see the release of all the hostages. Instead, they're looking at something far more limited, almost a confidence- building measure, a two-day truce. Four Israeli hostages being released in exchange for an unsafe specified number of Palestinian prisoners. The question is, is that something that Hamas could accept? The Israelis seem quite keen on this idea, but Hamas has, of course, made clear, for the better part of the last ten months, that they will only accept releasing hostages in exchange for a pathway to an end of the war in Gaza and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Gaza Strip. But the question is, will Hamas's position have changed in the wake of the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar? That may be something we get a better sense of in the coming days --",

But more than 1 million people are still enduring a months-long water shortage, despite watching it flow through the streets because of poor infrastructure.Well, CNN's Patrick Oppmann is in Havana with more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Some days, in many parts of Cuba, it seems there's water everywhere but actually inside people's houses. Like the power grid that crashed across the island for more than three days earlier this month, the island's aging, poorly maintained water system is also barely functioning. Enough water spills in the street in some places to even wash your car. The day we first visited this hardscrabble neighborhood on the outskirts of Havana, residents tell us they've not had running water in over two weeks. Some people, like Ani (ph), say they walk to areas where water does come in, even if only for a few hours, to carry back to their homes. \"We carry water to be able to bathe and cook,\" she says. \"I have four tanks for water in my house, but there's not even a drop in them.\" Cuban officials blame U.S. sanctions, in part, for the failing water system, but acknowledge the crisis has grown to impact nearly 10 percent of the population. \"We have around 1,013,000, 1,018,000 people without water,\" he says, \"because of the pumps, energy cuts, pipe breakages.\" The water shortages have led some Cubans to take to the streets in protest, something the government usually does not tolerate. The worsening power situation has a direct impact on the water supply.",

It's what's known as \"El dia del aqua,\" \"water day.\"But when there's a power cut, you don't get any water that day either. OPPMANN (voice-over): The government says it sends water trucks to help with the problem, but there are not enough to go around. And residents here tell us you have to pay to get one of those trucks to actually come. That's an impossibility for someone like Ani (ph), who says the more frequently the power goes out, the less water she will likely have. She says the country's leaders need to remember how poor people like her here live. \"The power doesn't go out for them,\" she says. \"They need to put themselves in our place.\" Just down the hill from Ani's (ph) house, a small river of drinking water runs in the street where a pipe is broken. She says residents have reported the problem for years to the local government, but no one has ever come to fix it. Patrick Oppmann, CNN, Havana. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
