The short-term issue is -- and you talked about this in a previous segment -- would people -- would Republicans rally around Donald Trump in the wake of this report? And I haven't seen it either, which is I think good news. The longer-term issue will be down the road, probably in the middle of a Republican primary season -- who knows -- what will the DOJ do? Do they have the facts and can they make a case against Donald Trump that they can win in court? And then, the political impact -- what will that be if they don't pursue the charges, if they do pursue the charges and lose, or if they do pursue the charges and win?

We have to get this under control.I support the Trump administration's policy and, of course, we've had troops on the border supporting DHS for decades. But the bigger is the failure of Congress to act to come up with modern immigration policy laws to deal with this. To deal with the Dreamers. To make sure we have a merit-based immigration system. To secure the border. To finish putting border security up. So the bigger failure here is in Washington.

A newly-elected Republican congressman from New York is under scrutiny this morning because major aspects of his resume are being called into question because of a damning report in The New York Times that says key parts of George Santos' biography that were sold to voters may largely be fiction.Santos says he graduated from Baruch College in 2010, but neither the Times nor CNN when we later checked, could find a record of anyone with his name and birthday graduating that year. His campaign website also claims that after graduating he worked at big Wall Street firms like Citigroup and Goldman Sachs, but both companies say they have no record of his working there. That's not all. A previous version of his campaign website from April says that he, quote, \"...founded and ran a nonprofit called Friends of Pets United from 2013 to 2018, which was able to effectively rescue 2,400 dogs and 280 cats.\" But according to the IRS, they were not able to find any record showing that the group held the tax-exempt status that Mr. Santos claimed. The Times report says that he did not respond to repeated requests to furnish documents that would help substantiate the claims he made while he was campaigning. His attorney told CNN that the Times was, quote, \"attempting to smear the congressman with defamatory allegations.\" So joining us now with his reporting is Michael Gold from The New York Times, who broke this story along with his colleague Grace Ashford. This is -- totally rocks the political world. I wonder how this started. What made you look into and kind of try to double-check some of the things that, seemingly, people would not typically lie about?",

We were hoping to get a little more information about his background. There wasn't a ton out there other than his campaign biography. And so, we were hoping to speak to people who knew him from his Wall Street days to try to get a sense of what kind of businessman he did. And one of the first things we did was reach out to Citigroup and Goldman Sachs, two big firms where he said he worked, to try to get dates of employment so we could start to find some of his former coworkers.

First, I should stress students and staff were never in any danger. This was a test. It was only a test. But what they did was they went to three different schools. They won't say what schools in the Uvalde school system. And there was a person who was posing as an intruder -- an auditor -- who tried the doors. Two of the schools passed -- we're not able to get in. But at a third school -- at a cafeteria -- at a loading dock area there was a door that was supposedly locked, but when this intruder yanked on the door he was able to get in. And when he got in, he was quickly confronted, the interim superintendent says, by cafeteria staff -- by workers and the staff. But if he had been armed -- if this had been real, the consequences could have been disastrous again. Also at last night's school board meeting, they discussed, of course, new security doors. They talked about security cameras, and they talked about a reformed police department.
