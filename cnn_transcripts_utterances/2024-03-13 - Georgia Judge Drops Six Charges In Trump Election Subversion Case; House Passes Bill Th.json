Six charges dismissed in the election subversion case in Fulton County, Georgia. A judge saying a lack of detail led to his decision. What does this mean for the rest of Fani Willis's case? A Georgia legal expert and a close associate of District Attorney Willis, join us to break it all down. Plus, TikTok takedown. A bill forcing the social media giant to cut ties with China or face a ban in the U.S. passes the House with huge bipartisan support. But will it go anywhere in the Senate? And should the U.S. government be in the business of banning private companies? I'll ask a member of the House Select Committee on China. And a question so many people are asking today, do you feel safe flying on a Boeing plane? Major new revelations about the airline manufacturer's work on that door plug that blew off during an Alaskan Airlines flight. The NTSB today saying its investigation is being held back by a lack of paperwork and video footage. (MUSIC) TAPPER: Welcome to THE LEAD. I'm Jake Tapper, a big blow today for District Attorney Fani Willis in the Georgia election subversion case against Donald Trump and his allies. Judge Scott McAfee, has thrown out six charges in the 41-count indictment against Trump, and some of his co-defendants. All of those charges relate to multiple instances of the co-defendants allegedly soliciting the violation of oath by a public officer. Three of the six charges tossed were against Donald Trump. One of them tied to that infamous phone call that Trump made to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger in January 2021 after the 2020 election. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT &amp; 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: All I want to do is this, I just want to find 11,780 notes, which is one more than we have because we won the state.

The judge has not yet decided whether to disqualify her. But that major ruling is also expected this week. Let's go to CNN's Nick Valencia in Atlanta, outside the Fulton County courthouse.

The judge writes, quote, as written, these six counts contain all the essential elements of the crimes, but failed to allege sufficient detail regarding the nature of their commission, i.e., the underlying felony solicited. They do not give the defendants enough information to prepare the defense as intelligently as the defendants could have violated the Constitutions and thus the statute in dozens, if not hundreds, of distinct ways, unquote.What do you make of that? Do you agree? J. TOM MORGAN, FORMER DEKALB COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY: Absolutely. Jake, the Sixth Amendment and the due process clause. So the 14th amendment state that a defendant must be put on notice of the charges against him and what he did to make them a crime. These counts are very convoluted to begin with, and at the end of the day, the defendants were not put on notice. But, Jake, let me just say this deference to Mr. Shakespeare, this is much ado about nothing. As Mr. Bailey said, this is routine. These six counts, I think most prosecutors, including this former prosecutor, would never have included them in the indictment. In the first place because they're already in the RICO count, and the judge in his orders said that they can stay in the RICO count.",

There are so many edicts right now coming down from on high at Boeing to the workers saying they must keep in on quality control, that they must assemble everything per the directions that the spotlight is really on, even the workers.But the big question is this now, will there be changed at the top, like we saw after the MAX 8 incidents of 2018 and 2019, 346 people killed in two crashes abroad. That caused a whole host of changes at the executive level, including new CEO. We've not really seen much in the way of any indication of that. The only thing that has changed as the head of the 737 MAX program, and he was largely a person who is unknown to people off the street. So, one has to ask if that was really a scapegoat change. And will there be significant change at Boeing.",

And then the bolts were not re-installed. Boeing simply not been able to produced that paperwork.

So he's specifically announcing to the street what projects that will pay for. His slogan here is rebuilding communities. He's also trying to rebuild the coalition for his campaign. This is about the sixth battleground state he's hit since the State of Union address. The question is, are people listening? And, Jake, talking to Democrats here, talking to voters? Many have said they in fact, have been inspired and energized by that speech, lowering my voice here as he is still speaking. So the question is, this, Wisconsin will be at the center not all battlegrounds. That is the center of that big blue wall. Wisconsin, of course, Michigan, Pennsylvania. So that's why the president is here. And Jake, as you said, Donald Trump will be here to accept his party's nomination next July. Wisconsin is so key, even more important in this year -- Jake.",
