We begin with new developments four years after the killing of journalist and Saudi critic Jamal Khashoggi. The U.S. has determined that the Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman should be given immunity from a lawsuit filed by his fiance. The human rights group adorn which the journalist founded alleges that a team of assassins murder Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul back in 2018. U.S. intelligence has said it believes the Saudi Crown Prince approved the murder. Well, I want to bring in CNN Senior National Security Correspondent Alex Marquardt, who joins us from Washington D.C. Good to have you with us, Alex! So the Biden Administration not suggesting that the Crown Prince is innocent. So what does this immunity call me?",

      "sentences": "Yes, they're not going back on their assessment. Remember, this was an intelligencecommittee assessment, sorry, intelligence community assessment that Jamal Khashoggi was murdered at the direction of the Crown Prince MBS. What they're saying here is that he deserves immunity in this lawsuit that was brought against him here in federal court in Washington D.C., by the fiance of Jamal Khashoggi. And they're saying that he deserves immunity, because he is now a head of government. He had been the Crown Prince. He still is he is the Defense Minister. But he just recently got a new title added, and that is the title of Prime Minister. His father made him the Prime Minister and therefore, Lynda, he now becomes the Head of the Saudi government. And under past precedent and international law, the State Department said heads of government and heads of state are given immunity. That is the argument that was made in an 11th hour court finally by the Department of Justice last night, at the urging of the State Department saying that he deserves to be granted immunity because he is Head of the Saudi government. Here's a little bit more of what the State Department told me. This suggestion of immunity does not reflect an assessment on the merits of the case. It speaks to nothing on broader policy or the state of relations. This was purely a legal determination. Now across administration, there is an unbroken practice of the United States recognizing immunity for heads of government while they are in office. So they are pointing to this unbroken practice this legal determination. That is something that we understand the Biden Administration wanted to stand by, they were under no obligation to weigh in, but they're saying, well, what if the tables were turned and an American Head of State or Head of government was in legal jeopardy? They would want immunity for American officials as well, Lynda.",

She blames Biden himself saying Biden betrayed his word he betrayed Jamal history will not forget. And then she tweeted out to for the world to see that Biden saved the murder MBS by granting immunity. He saved the criminal and got involved in the crime himself. Let's see who will save you in the hereafter. We're also hearing some anger on political hill, particularly from Democrats.

What North Korea does at this point, when it's testing these missiles is fire it straight into the air so it lands not far from where it was launched. This is how they can make sure they can test the range without it firing over any other countries. It was also confirmed by a Senior Administration Official that they believe this is the capability that they have. And they also spoke about Vice President Harris calling together this very hasty emergency meeting with the Leaders of Japan of South Korea, also Australia, New Zealand and Canada. All of those countries sat down and condemned the missile launch by North Korea. They also started to talk about how they could work together in the future? This was widely condemned Vice President Harris also saying it destabilizes the security in the region, and unnecessarily raises tensions. Now, as you mentioned, Lynda, there was a fairly swift physical reaction as well. Japan's Ministry of Defense says that they sent jets into the air quickly, in fact they also say that they fired - they filmed what they believe is the contrails or the vapor trails of that ballistic missile from North Korea. And we also saw joint drills from the air forces of the U.S. and South Korea. What they were doing is simulating an aerial attack on a mobile missile launcher. The Joint Chiefs of Staff here in Seoul saying it was to show North Korea that they were able to find out exactly where a launch came from, and then pinpoint and attack that area if they needed to Lynda.",

As - save his sister was at COP at those meetings gave an emotional plea to people there for the safety of a brother which for many, many months and weeks, they were unable to ascertain whether Abdel el-Fattah was even alive. He's been on a hunger strike, as you say, in and out of jail. For much of the last decade, he is one of the best known activists and writers who really gained prominence in the 2011 uprisings in Egypt. Now the family was able, according to them to see him on Thursday at a Cairo cell in Cairo prison. They gave this very raw description, very disturbing description of some of the events that he went through. And I'm quoting them as he was being carried out, he lost it had a meltdown and promised to kill himself if taken back to his cell. When they put him in his cell, h started to smash his head against the wall. He was restrained and then tied down. Now it seems according to the family that he was given an IV drip when he came to that that at least for now, hunger strike is broken somewhat by force. The Egyptian public prosecutor's office said last week that he is in fact, \"good health\". And when we put the question to the foreign minister at the COP meetings, he said that Abdel Fattah had had a free trial. This is a serious indictment, say activists of the human rights record in Egypt. The discussions between the British prime minister and Egyptian authorities appear to have gone nowhere.

WHITEHEAD, PROFESSOR OF BUSINESS LAW, CORNELL LAW SCHOOL: If you're a celebrity, you regularly do endorsements, you endorse sports drinks, you endorse tennis shoes, financial instruments are different. And so going out and saying that a financial instrument is great isn't the same thing as going out and saying that a sports drink is great and that creates liability.

The decision is coming at just two days before the start of the huge event, reversing an earlier pledge to allow some beer sales in the stadiums. Well among those stunned by the decision was Budweiser, which is paid millions of dollars to be the official beer of the World Cup. Budweiser's Twitter account said simply, well, this is awkward. And that tweet was later deleted. Well, Amanda Davies of world sport is in Doha covering the World Cup for us.

So Bud will still gettheir name at the grounds and of course, there will still be the ability to buy alcohol at the fan zone and also at the bars and restaurants in hotels here in Qatar. But I think you know what this says so much about is the relationship the dynamic that we have between World football's governing body FIFA and the Qatar Organizing Committee for this tournament. Usually, whatever happens inside the stadium comes under FIFA rules. But this is a first for football and the World Cup, a first ever Middle Eastern world cup of first World Cup in a Muslim country and Qatar have said all along, everybody is welcome. But we ask you please, to respect our culture and our rules. There's certainly a whole lot of people talking about sit here this evening.

There is no doubt they are here at this World Cup, the fact that Bud Zero will still be served inside the grounds, mean their name will be there. But I mean, you just have to look at the number of times we have talked about their name shown their logo over the last five or six hours or so since this announcement has been made. And it was only a couple of weeks ago, that Budweiser were talking about the challenge of getting the amount of beer for 1.2 million fans here to Qatar in such a short period of time. They were estimating that five weeks' worth of beer was more than would normally be consumed in Qatar over the space of a year. So that's a really interesting point to look at. But if you read something into the statement that was released by FIFA earlier it says this. The tournament organizers appreciate - understanding and continuous support and joint co-operation to cater for everyone at the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022. You can only imagine the discussions that are going on behind the scenes about who gets what, who has to pay what and what it means for those contracts.",

Well the waters of eastern Cuba are teeming with sharks and the island nation is letting visitors swim with the sharks so they can learn how important they are --the food chain would help boosted tourism as well. And Patrick Oppmann takes us underwater for the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Usually they are the last thing you want to see in the ocean. But sharks are the reason why we have come here to the waters of eastern Cuba. We're hoping to see the predators up close and with no cage. Local guides say this is the only place in Cuba perhaps one of only a handful in the world where divers can safely swim alongside bull sharks. We are taking them at their word, praying the sharks had a big breakfast. Bull sharks are considered some of the most aggressive in the world. But the ones we see see mostly curious, swimming around me for a closer look before gliding away. Guide - says they want to teach visitors to respect sharks and to protect them. The shark is the perfect machine, the perfect predator, he says, it's inspiring, emotional and satisfying to interact with them. Green biologists say robust shark populations are necessary to maintain healthy coral reefs. In 2015, Cuba placed restrictions on shark fishing, one of an increasing number of countries in the Caribbean to realize that sharks are not only important to the environment, but a way to track visitors. OPPMANN (on camera): People in the Caribbean used to commonly catch and kill sharks, either for food or because they were considered a nuisance. But warmer countries in this region are now taking steps to protect sharks. It's not just about conservation. Shark tourism visitors specifically coming to a country to dive with sharks can generate millions of dollars in revenue. OPPMANN (voice over): Just before her first dive with sharks, Canadian tourist Carrie tells us she's been terrified of them ever since seeing jaws.",

It's the myth of the shark being dangerous, a mannequin that is aggressive, he says then you manage to see a shark a meter and a half away from you. And when you come out of the water, they say this is the best time of my life. The sharks we swim with are undeniably powerful and also incredibly beautiful at the top of the food chain, but never seeming to threaten us. OPPMANN (on camera): And they said the shot of adrenaline in your arm they were not kidding. No admit to being afraid but they're very impressive creatures.
