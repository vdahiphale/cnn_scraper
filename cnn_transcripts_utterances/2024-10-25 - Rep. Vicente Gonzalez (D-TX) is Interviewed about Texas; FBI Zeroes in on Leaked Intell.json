The only thing that's different is they lost Maricopa County. 2012, lost Maricopa County, lost Arizona. 2008, lost Maricopa County, lost Arizona. '24, 2020, I could just keep going back and back and you get the story there. It all comes down to Maricopa County in Arizona. That's where the candidates are going. That's how to get victory there. And Arizona, incidentally, 11 electoral votes right there. It's kind of Electoral College insurance for Wisconsin, which has ten.

      "sentences": "All right, joining us now, Democratic Congressman Vicente Gonzalez, representing south Texas.Thank you so much for being here this morning. I want to talk to you about the - using Texas as a place to talk about abortion rights and reproductive rights. In polling done by the University of Texas at Austin, abortion rights though have consistently been pretty far down the line on the issues that voters think are the most important. The latest polling there finds it's fifth behind the economy, border security and immigration. So, do you think it's a good idea? Why focus on this message in your state if voters are telling you that it is not their top priority? REP. VICENTE GONZALEZ (D-TX): Well, I think there are a lot of top priorities. But certainly for - for women and young women, this is a very concerning issue. I - and I could tell you just what we're dealing with in south Texas. Just a few (ph) weeks ago, I had a 24- year-old woman who literally was losing the child inside of her. And she couldn't get the care she needed from any doctor or hospital in south Texas, or anywhere across the state. And she was forced to go across the border into Mexico to get the health care she needed to save her life. And I think when Texans hear stories like that, that is when people are appalled. I can tell you, in south Texas, most of us are Catholic. We're certainly not promoting abortion. But we don't want a national abortion ban with zero exceptions that creates conditions, like what this young lady just suffered here in my district.",

And he said that America is, and I'm quoting him here, a dumping ground, a garbage can for the world, referring to migrants, calling human beings garbage. What do you think polling shows - why do you think this is that polling shows he's gained with Latino voters?",

And I don't quite understand how he's gained.But I can tell you on the border, I've been one of the most vocal members in the Democratic Party on issues on the border. And we've gotten serious about it. And numbers are way down on the border when you talk about border security. And - and we had a great border bill in the Senate that he - he decided to kill because he was hoping to campaign on it. Right now, we don't have the surges that I've dealt with in my eight years in Congress on our southern border. It's pretty unremarkable these days. But he was - he was hoping for chaos around this period. And it's not happening. Because that's what he wanted to campaign. He also wanted to campaign on inflation. What did inflation do? It's down from 8.9 (ph) in 2001 (ph) to 2.4 last month. And we continue to move in the right direction. So, I think a lot of the expectations that President Trump had to campaign on, a lot of the issues that he was hoping would be viable issues have - have fizzled out. And there's a lot of excitement in - in Texas and across the country. And a lot of excitement to have a woman and a woman of color on the top of the ticket. And I'm glad she's in Texas, and we welcome her.",

We need to change our - if we're - if we're serious about slowing surges, we need to change your asylum laws. We need to talk about policies that will be impactful in other countries that will discourage people that want to come to our - to come to our southern border. We need to keep investing in places like Central America to create conditions that create jobs for people to stay in their native country. It's policies like that, that stop surges on our southern border. Even places where I have border walls, people, migrants, are coming to that section of - of the river and they - they go and look for a camera and they wave at the camera and tell Border Patrol we're here, come and get us. So, they still get to come in and come into the United States and have a - have a court hearing who knows when. And it's all because of bad policies. And until - and until we get together in a bipartisan way, this is not going to be fixed. Let me tell you, immigration and border security is not an American or democratic problem. It's an American problem that requires real bipartisan solutions. And it requires both parties to get together, regardless of who's in charge in the House and the Senate or the administration, and come up with common sense policies. What - what we hear now on the campaign trail is just campaign rhetoric, which is really discouraging for places like my district where the border is not a campaign topic. It's a place where we live and work and a place that we want secured and a place that we want to be a pleasurable place to live. And that requires good policies. And I hoping my friends on the other side of the aisle will sit with us this next session and hammer out some policies that we agree on and get them - get them through, get them on the floor, get them passed and get them to the president's desk.",

      "sentences": "Yes, so, Kate, the FBI has been really focused on trying to identify where these documents were printed. Remember, investigators had this one really big clue right from the get-go. At least one of these two documents appears to have been printed potentially as part of an official briefing book for a senior official and then scanned in black and white and ultimately shared on a social media platform last week.That was important because the Pentagon actually tracks when employees print classified information. And in fact, it's kind of escalated the internal surveillance that it does on this front as part of kind of a general tightening of security measures after a 21-year-old air national guardsman, Jack Teixeira, last year shared reams of stolen classified information on an online platform, Discord, last year. What my colleague Evan Perez and I are now able to report is that the FBI has really zeroed in on the government office where it believes that these documents were printed. Now, these two documents would have had wide distribution across the U.S. government. There would have been lots of people who would have had access to them. But according to our sources, the number of people who likely printed them, probably very, very small. So, that's been a really important jumping off point for investigators. U.S. officials have been really alarmed by these leaks, not so much because of the substance of what these documents contain. After all, Israel has said publicly that it intends to retaliate against Iran. And these documents largely described those preparations. But just the fact that this has become public at such a sensitive moment in U.S./Israeli relations has been really alarming. And we've now seen the top Republican and the top Democrat from the Senate Intelligence Committee just yesterday firing off a letter to FBI Director Chris Wray insisting that he, quote, \"act swiftly in the investigation and take immediate action to hold each individual involved fully accountable.\" Kate.",
