      "sentences": "OUTFRONT next, the fear goes global. The bank sell-off stretching across the Atlantic as another major bank is on the verge collapse. The question everyone is asking -- is our money safe? Suze Orman is OUTFRONT with answers.This just in, new video tonight of the moment a Ukrainian soldier takes down a Russian jet, as we are learning new details, we'll share with you, about Russia training elementary school children to fight. We'll show you this. And Georgia investigators have another recording of Trump pressuring election officials to overturn the election. This is new. We have not heard before. And it comes as Trump's former fixer, Michael Cohen, testified for a second time before a grand jury in New York. Trump's attorney is my guest tonight. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, fear going global, worry of banking collapse is now spreading beyond the United States with mega bank Credit Suisse shares plummeting, closing down 24 percent, a quarter of the value gone in a day. The Swiss Central Bank stepping in tonight, saying it's ready to bail out Credit Suisse with more funds if necessary. But that fear ricocheting back to Wall Street, with the Dow tumbled more than 700 points at one point, closed down nearly 300. Shares of banks taking another brutal blow. And just take the regional bank First Republic. We've all been talking about that name a lot lately, right? It lost more than 20 percent of its value today. Now, First Republic is a widely respected bank by people who no risk. As UBS analyst Erika Najarian wrote the other day, quote: We believe First Republic is no Silicon Valley Bank. She detailed all the map and the bank's reserves and its assets, but it just might not matter. Someone with money at First Republic, who trusts the bank and finally decided psychology may matter more than reality, told me that they finally called to ask for their money back. The banker on the other end of the line, apologetically said, okay, I get it, but they are 80,000 people ahead of you in line. Just to say, right, this is emotion. This is psychology. And in that environment, Credit Cuisse is ripe for crisis. Its reputation is being marred by scandals, top executives have been scandal following multibillion dollar losses. A grim story to Credit Suisse, but then, again, so is the story of the second largest bank failure in the U.S. story, Silicon Valley Bank. It failed after how poorly executives manage to surge in technology start-ups deposits. And so is the story of the third largest bank failure in U.S. bank history, Signature Bank, just the other day, of course. In this case, to make a leap of faith on crypto played a role. But these different specifics in each case well down to the same story. Scared investors, ready to jump ship in an uncertain world reeling from the fastest interest rate hikes ever. Eight hikes in a year. And only now are we starting to see the impact of that. On that point, personal finance guru Suze Orman is standing by to answer the questions we all have about what we should do right now, because everyone has those questions. Because analysts like Michael Feroli, who covers banking at JPMorgan, estimates that economic growth overall now, from what we've seen in this past week, we'll take a hit. He says, for every $10 of loans that are not going to be made by now scared banks, the economy takes a hit of as much as $5 -- the whole economy. So, think about that. These small loans from regional banks, these kind of numbers and ratios people are throwing around right now matter big time. And that's why Feroli is expecting a recession. A renowned hedge fund founder, Ray Dalio, calls this a canary in the coal mine moment. Dalio, speaking about Silicon Valley bank, warning, quote, it is likely that this bank failure will not -- followed by many more problems. And that's why what's happening day after day's worrisome. Well, President Biden did step in early. He made a huge statement. And that statement was loud and clear. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The federal government cannot step in and make all deposits good at all banks, like they did at Silicon Valley Bank or Signature Bank. They can't do it because there just simply isn't enough money to do that if it were required. And that worry has caused Americans to pull their deposits and startputting them into banks, if there's any that they truly see as too big to fail, like Citigroup. And we begin our coverage OUTFRONT tonight with the former CEO of Citigroup, Mike Corbat. He's now a senior adviser at the investment firm 26 North. And, Mike, really appreciate your time.

But I think they give the government flexibility to be able to step in and provide that liquidity in the system to make sure that each and every depositor that wants to take their money out or move their money has access to that money and ability to do that.

So, therefore, the vast majority of their deposits were uninsured.Their loan portfolios weren't typical to the industry. They had, in many cases, more esoteric, more illiquid loans.

But now, Yevgeny Prigozhin, once a Kremlin ally and nicknamed Putin's chef, is a man under pressure. He recruited tens of thousands of men from Russian prisons. But they have endured horrendous losses -- as many as 80 percent in some units.He is dreading Russian sports clubs for recruits. And he's more experienced units are stretched as they try to encircle Bakhmut. Western analysts say that Prigozhin has fallen into a trap laid by Shoigu. It's a trap designed to weaken both Wagner and its boss. Just when Wagner most needs the support of the Russian military around Bakhmut, it's curiously absent. Russia's elite are piling on the graph, outspoken oligarch. Commentator Aleksey Mukhin accused Prigozhin of political ambitions and said he was an incompetent commander, adding, he has exposed the Wagner fighters to a risk of encirclement, from the risk of counterattack. The Kremlin has long tolerated Prigozhin as Vladimir Putin's license disruptor. But a Wagner is dismayed in an unsuccessful bid to take Bakhmut, he might find himself out in the cold.
