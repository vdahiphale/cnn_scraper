      "sentences": "Well, Pamela, we are going to hear for the first time from president-elect Trump really as he begins to not only shape his administration -- of course, those nominees are well-known, and then confirmation hearings will begin next week -- but also his agenda.And we know, of course, what he intends to do, but how he intends to do it, particularly getting things through the House and the Senate, is something that is going to be discussed. We're told that the president-elect is going to be going to Washington tomorrow, actually, for the Jimmy Carter state funeral on Thursday, but he will be meeting with Senate Republican leaders tomorrow, and then House Republican leaders will actually be coming down here to Florida over the weekend. So, a reminder, in just less than two weeks' time, Republicans will be in charge of the entire branches of government, and they will have his agenda and try and work it through, but they are very narrow majorities. So the questions are, how exactly are the extension of the tax cuts, the immigration plans and policies and other agenda items going to get through, one bill, two separate bills? Now it looks like one large reconciliation bill. That's a budget process. But we will likely hear from the president-elect here shortly about that and many other questions. Of course, there are many questions about, in the wake of January 6 yesterday, that anniversary, what are his plans to pardon the January 6 -- the defendants? So many questions, of course. We will see how long he actually takes to answer those questions, if he does, coming up shortly in Mar-a-Lago -- Pamela. BROWN:  Yes, that's right. And on the pardons, you have the Proud Boys leader who was sentenced to 22 years in prison asking for a pardon. It'll be interesting to hear what he has to say about that. As we know, he's been looking at potential pardons on a case-by-case basis, a lot to discuss and hear from the soon-to-be-President Donald Trump. Thank you so much, Jeff Zeleny. And we have a panel here to discuss what we could hear, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia Larry Sabato, senior political analyst, and Republican strategist Lee Carter. Lee, I want to kick it off with you. What do you want to hear from Donald Trump today? He is expected to meet with GOP leadership on Capitol Hill tomorrow. He's been talking about this big, beautiful bill where he wants all of his agenda items to be in it. Of course, that reality may be a little tougher, but could this be a preview of their agenda?",

They're looking to hear about his plans on immigration and how to reduce crime, on the economy. And so my hope is that we're going to hear some of the things that he's planning to do to move the needle forward. I think a lot of people are feeling a little rudderless at the moment in the country. And I think this is a real opportunity for him to come out strong and give people hope again. Now, there's two ways this can go. We know that Donald Trump can come out with the make America great again Donald Trump or the one that comes out with a list of grievances. My hope is that we come out with a make America great again Donald Trump, who's going to lay out a strong agenda and show what his leadership plan is going forward.",

The margins are so small in the House, and they're not that wide in the Senate either. And it really is going to take a lot of those phone calls, a lot of compromise within the Republican Party itself in order to get his agenda done. And spending is going to be a huge issue, particularly with House Republicans. They have put their foot down already with the former president because he wanted to raise the debt ceiling in the bill that passed before Christmas. That did not happen. So we will see how he decides to turn the political screws, if he does, going forward in this next Congress to get his agenda through.",

Of course, Trump himself didn't have Biden into the Oval Office, the way that President Obama had had Trump into the Oval Office. And, believe me, Obama wasn't, I'm sure, very happy to have Trump in, but he did it because it was the right thing to do. And then Trump didn't even attend his successor's inauguration. It was really actions that are difficult to forget and ought to be remembered. So, by comparison, the Bush -- the Biden-to-Trump transition here has been terrific. And they -- many of the people associated with Trump say so. And Trump ought to say so if he wants to keep people, if not united, then at least not at loggerheads.",

But any anger that I had towards President Carter swiftly changed immediately once we were freed. [11:10:09] Yes, it took a long time, but those were extraordinary times.

It matches, I think, the outpouring of love and admiration that we have seen from all corners across this region for over a week now. Right now, this is a ceremony in the Circle of Flags here at the Carter Center. This is primarily Carter Center employees that are saying final goodbyes, as this is the final ceremony here in Atlanta before the body and the family go to Dobbins Air Reserve Base and then ultimately to Joint Base Andrews in Washington, D.C., before they go to the Navy Memorial. This is similar to what we have seen throughout the week. I mean, we were at the Carter Center all this time and we saw people emerging with tears in their eyes, holding hands on their hearts, just the enormity of the moment, and of what they witnessed in paying respect to President Carter. So, when he arrives in Washington, what we will see is really remarkable, because he is going to -- the late president will take the very same route that he did when he was elected president, when he very notably made that walk from the Navy Memorial to the Capitol. That is something that subsequent presidents have done and has become a bit of a tradition. But President Carter really wanted to be a man of the people, and he started that tradition foot. And now, today, we are going to see a horse-drawn casket make that very same journey, Pam.",

KEISHA LANCE BOTTOMS (D), FORMER MAYOR OF ATLANTA, GEORGIA:  Well, he certainly has given us an example of what it means to lead and to serve people, and not to be self-serving in so many ways. And he has also shown so many of us what it means to have a life after politics. I was born in 1970, just after the civil rights movement, and it was left to this next generation of leaders to help fulfill Dr. King's dream. And Jimmy Carter did that throughout my lifetime. He was sworn in as governor of Georgia in 1971. I was almost a-year- old, and he made us all so very proud. And I heard an anchor on CNN refer to him as an evangelical. I never thought of him in that way, because there are so many political connotations that we think of. But as I looked up the definition, he certainly walked his faith. He spread his faith.

But he cared about us as people, as human beings who suffered through a terrible situation. And there we were. There were many of us who were upset at the president, wondering why he admitted the shah into the United States. But once we saw him and listened to him while he was standing with Vice President Mondale and Secretary of State Muskie, everyone sort of melted -- all the angst that we had melted away. And we really felt so good and we hugged him. And it was an expression of true love in many ways. I think Jimmy Carter was very much misunderstood by many Americans. He really was a steadfast individual with a great deal of character and who really cared about me and my family. In fact, when Barbara, my wife, President Carter, she gave him a photo of my young son, Alexander, at that time, 3 years old, and my daughter, Ariana, who was just about 1. He took that photo in his hand and he looked at it. And I know he put it in his pocket. And I'm almost sure he spent the rest of the day thinking about our lives and the sacrifices that he made during that entire period of time. There's a funny anecdote that I just love to express. And that was -- there were phone banks all around us. And after we had our session with President Carter, I was talking to my mother-in-law in Brooklyn, New York, and Jimmy Carter tapped me on the shoulder. He said: \"Barry, I'd like to say hello.\" So he said: \"Hello, this is Jimmy Carter.\" And my mother-in-law said: \"Jimmy who?\" (LAUGHTER)",

And I believe he will say that he's doing it because of the fact that he was very inspired by the election. They wouldn't do it without that election, I can tell you. A lot of people wouldn't. You saw last week where we have somebody who's going to go from $100 billion to $200 billion. And we have many other people. And we will be bringing some of them out. Some of them like to do it somewhat more quietly and some don't. And they feel so strongly about the country that they want to let people know about it. But it's an honor to have such a great investor investing in our country. The investment will support massive new data centers across the Midwest, the Sun Belt area, and also to keep America on the cutting edge of technology and artificial intelligence. He's very big into the data centers. And that's going to be a very hot item in the coming years, as you know, with A.I. in particular. The first phase of the project will be in Texas, Arizona, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Ohio, Illinois, Michigan, and Indiana, those places. And, Hussain, I'd love you to come up and say a few words.
