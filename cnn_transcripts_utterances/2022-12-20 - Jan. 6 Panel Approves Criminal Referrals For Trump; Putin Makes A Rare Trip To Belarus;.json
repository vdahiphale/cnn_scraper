As you noted, the Kremlin has called this unacceptable and said that it interferes with the market. But it's not going to have that much impact on Russia. One because as I said, it's above where gas prices are currently trading. And two, because Russia's gas deliveries, Gazprom recently said to non-CIS countries, to countries outside the former Soviet Union are down 45 percent so far this year largely because of their own decisions to cut off gas to various countries.

The Committee held its final public meeting on Monday to publish the executive summary of its report and wind down its business before disbanding. Here's how one Democrat made the case for charging Trump.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD):  Ours is not a system of justice where foot soldiers go to jail and the masterminds and ringleaders get a free pass. We believe that the evidence described by my colleagues today, and assembled throughout our hearings, warrants a criminal referral of Former President Donald J Trump. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And he added, that what doesn't kill me makes me stronger.Now, President Trump -- or Former President Trump has routinely referred to any sort of legal peril, any investigations before he was an office as a witch hunt, as a hoax. And he is correct in that many of these instances, including the impeachment, including even as recently as this summer, the search of his Mar-a-Lago home have galvanized his base and caused Republicans to rally around him. But advisers that I have spoken to say, they are concerned that that is not what is going to happen here, particularly after Former President Trump launched that 2024 presidential bid. We have seen donors and Republican voters moving further and further away from President Trump, essentially saying they don't want to deal with his \"baggage.\" Now, his advisers are concerned that this is just going to add to that baggage. Now, this again comes as former president is launching his third campaign, we are expecting him to start campaigning on the ground in early next year. But it remains to be seen whether or not he still has that support from his base as we move forward. Kristen Holmes, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "I'm in Brownsville, Texas in the Rio Grande Valley, and what I've noticed that the Supreme Court decision to keep Title 42 in place has done is really bring down the temperature of the anxiety on both sides of the border. Now, on the other side of the border is Matamoros, Mexico. We have video of thousands of people who are camped out on that side.Here, on the U.S. side, there's been a lot of anxiety by both city officials and nonprofit organizations who serve migrants and welcome migrants into this country because they were worried that a huge spike in migrants entering the country could make it difficult for them to meet their demands. They, of course, have limited capacity. Now, what this means on the border, when it comes to operations, is that border patrol agents will be able to continue to do what they've been doing since March of 2020, and that is to return migrants back to Mexico very swiftly without legal consequences. But you've got to give this a reality check for the states that we're asking the Supreme Court to keep this in place. If you actually look at the data, since earlier this year, the United States has really been able to use Title 42 less and less. Why? Because the demographics of the migrants who are coming to the border has changed. Before, when the migrants who were coming to the border were from Mexico and Central America. The U.S. government was able to apply Title 42 very swiftly because Mexico would take those migrants back. However, a few months ago, the demographics changed. The U.S. government actually said that the surge was being driven by migrants from Nicaragua, from Cuba and from Venezuela. And Mexico was not taking them back. And because the U.S. government has fostered relations with these countries, the U.S. government couldn't deport them back either. And so, they had to take them in. Now, in regards to the news, this latest news from the Supreme Court that Title 42 is still in place, I was able to talk to some migrants who are in Matamoros, Mexico in those camps, and from that drone video that you're about to see. And what these migrants tell me is that they are happy, they are joyous, why? Because they want to come into the U.S. legally. And they say that that's the sentiment in Matamoros right now, because there have been so many exceptions to Title 42 that have been granted by the United States, and what all that means is that the U.S. government has allowed migrants to come to the port of entry that you see behind me and also a handful of other ports of entry and seek asylum, asked to be processed by federal authorities, and that has been done thousands of times. Thousands of migrants have been able to do that in the past few months. And so, the migrants that I was able to speak to said that they want Title 42 in place so they can enter the country under an exception to Title 42. But again, the latest news and the reaction that we're seeing here on the ground is that it has dropped the temperature of the anxiety here on the border. Rosa Flores, CNN, Brownsville, Texas.

Now, this case involved four women accusing him of rape and sexual assault charges for a total of seven counts to which he pleaded not guilty. But, again, the jury only found him guilty on those three counts related to the same accuser.For the second accuser, and the fourth accuser, the jury could not come to a decision and those were declared mistrial. For the third accuser, the jury found him not guilty on that sexual assault charge. Now, the fourth accuser, over the course of the trial was identified as Jennifer Siebel Newsom, a filmmaker and the wife of California governor, Gavin Newsom. The attorney for Jennifer Siebel Newsom released a statement saying in part, well, we would have preferred that those jurors had found them guilty in all counts, we understand that it was a complex trial made more difficult by the defense team's argument that a woman who was assaulted must forgo her chosen career or be accused of consent after the fact. That attorney also said that, you never know how politics may play into things, regarding her client's marriage to the California governor. The attorney for Harvey Weinstein also released a statement, specifically referring to this first accuser where he was found guilty on those three counts. The attorney said, Harvey is obviously disappointed. However, hopefully, because with this particular accuser, there's good ground to appeal based on time and location of alleged events. He is grateful the jury took their time to deliberate on the other counts, and he is prepared to continue fighting for his innocence. Now, this Los Angeles jury deliberated for 41 hours that is far longer than the jury deliberated in New York and his New York trial where he was convicted and sentenced to 23 years in prison. He is appealing that case. And so, what happens in this case becomes very interesting now with these three guilty counts he could be facing up to 24 years in prison on this trial. And the jury is supposed to reconvene tomorrow to hear more arguments about the sentencing and guidelines. Back to you. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
