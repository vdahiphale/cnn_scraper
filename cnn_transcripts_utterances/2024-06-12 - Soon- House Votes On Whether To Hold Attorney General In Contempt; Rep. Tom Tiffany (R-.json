How they're reflecting on 12 years since that terrible day. We're following these major developing stories and many more all coming in right here to CNN NEWS CENTRAL. Attorney General Merrick Garland has dedicated his career to following the law. And now he could soon be sanctioned on Capitol Hill for breaking the rules. This afternoon, the House is expected to vote on whether to hold him in contempt of Congress for not fully abiding by a subpoena. Garland has refused to turn over audio from President Biden's interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur, who in February chose not to charge the President over wrongfully possessing classified documents. Garland has said that he won't be intimidated and that releasing the audio could discourage future witnesses from being recorded. CNN Capitol Hill reporter Melanie Zanona is with us now on this. Mel, it made it out of the rules committee. Is the full House though going to pass this vote to hold the AG in contempt?",

And just as a reminder, this all stems from the DOJ's refusal to hand over those audio tapes from the Special Counsel's interview with President Joe Biden over the special classified documents case. Now, the DOJ did hand over transcripts of that interview, but Republicans say that is not enough. It's not the same thing. They want to be able to hear those audio tapes, to check it with the transcript and make sure it's correct. Just turn to Congressman Andy Biggs, a member of the House Judiciary Committee, explain it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. ANDY BIGGS (R-AZ): Because the transcripts do not reflect important verbal context such as tone or tenor or non-verbal context such as pauses or pace of delivery, all of which went into the decision by Mr. Hur not to prosecute a crime that he said was committed. That prosecutorial discretion is under review by our committee legitimately and constitutionally. We have the right to that audio recording. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We've heard Secretary Blinken, for example, saying that he does believe that the gaps are bridgeable, but it doesn't necessarily mean that those gaps will be bridged, being very clear that it does depend on certain people saying yes to this U.S.- backed proposal.So at this point, we know that it took Hamas 11 days to come back with an official response after the U.S. president, Joe Biden, publicly endorsed this proposal that was on the table. So certainly there is concern that that it could take even longer to get another response, even when a response is given back to Hamas. They have said that they want certain amendments. For example, they want a specific timeline when it comes to a permanent ceasefire in Gaza. And this is something that we know the Israelis - certainly the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has not been willing to put an exact timeline on the phase one of this three-phase deal is a six week ceasefire, and that is meant to evolve into a more permanent cessation of hostilities. But certainly from the Israeli standpoint, they prefer that that second part to be more vague. They don't want it to be an exact timeline. Hamas also saying that they want the complete withdrawal of troops from Gaza. But in phase one of this proposal, it is only meant to see the Israeli troops come back out of the populated areas in Gaza. So gaps still remain even after all these months of negotiations going back and forth, so I think you really do hear the frustration coming out from the secretary of state at this point.

Hunter Biden's verdict just came yesterday and this Supreme Court ordeal has been building for the past two years.And let me just bring you back to 2022, when it all started, when the Supreme Court really expanded Second Amendment gun rights and said that a federal gun regulation or state regulation could be upheld only if it's in keeping with the historical tradition of firearms regulation. If there's some sort of historical analog comparison dating back centuries to whatever the modern regulation is. Now, that's a really tough standard for governments to meet as their gun regulations are being challenged and it's also a very confusing standard. So the Supreme Court got lots of appeals up to it. And it's now resolving a case that involves a federal prohibition on firearm possession for anyone who would have been subject to a domestic violence restraining order. Now, that's not an issue in the Hunter Biden case, but it's another provision of federal firearms that prohibits gun possession if someone is an unlawful drug user or addict. And the test for historical analog comes into play in both situations. The federal government is urging the Supreme Court to rule. And this could happen as soon as tomorrow. And I'll explain a little bit of that - the timing in a second, Boris. [15:25:03] But the federal government is urging the Supreme Court to rule that when lower court judges and when the Supreme Court itself looks at a modern gun prohibition and is trying to compare it to some sort of historical tradition to look more broadly, to look at, you know, is this something that is aimed at people who would be dangerous to society. It doesn't have to be a complete match to something that might have existed back in the late 1700s, early 1800s. So this is a really important test that the justices are going to weigh in on. And however they decide the case involving this individual who was convicted because of a restraining order for domestic violence, it could shed light on all sorts of other gun prohibitions, including in Hunter Biden's case, somebody who would fall under the prohibition on gun possession if he or she had been a drug user, a drug addict. Now, for timing, Boris, you know exactly where we are right now. We're in June when the justices biggest cases are going to come down and we're going to see another set tomorrow on Thursday. And that case of United States versus Rahimi, that's the one that could clarify the 2022 standard that could come as soon as tomorrow or it could come as late as the end of the month. But whenever it does come, I am certain that Hunter Biden's lawyers and lawyers for plenty of other defendants involved in gun related offenses will be scouring the opinion to see will it help them on appeals, Boris.",
