      "sentences": "We're now just two days, 10 hours and 28 minutes away from a potentially devastating strike that could impact all of us.If there's no deal between the Big Three American automakers and thousands of union workers by midnight on Thursday, experts say the consequences could be far-reaching. One consulting firm says a strike lasting 10 days could cost the American economy $5.6 billion. It could plunge the state of Michigan into a recession and potentially even drive up inflation. Another report from J.D. Power says that a two-week strike could spike a 2 percent jump in new car prices across the board and cars aren't exactly cheap right now. What does the UAW, the United Auto Workers union, want? Its 150,000 workers are asking for protections against job losses and plant closing as their production shifts to electric vehicles. Also, limits on part-time workers and forced overtime. And a big issue, health care coverage into retirement as well as the restoration of pension plans. And here's the big sticking point, pay. Workers want an immediate 20 percent raise with additional increases that would bump up pay by 36 percent over the life of a four-year contract. Of course, negotiations are still ongoing. But Stellantis, the group that owns Chrysler and Jeep, says it's reached a tentative agreement on several issues. They're offering a 14.5 percent wage increase over four years, far below, as you saw, what workers want. Ford and G.M. offered a 10 percent increase, which the union president called \"insulting.\" This push and pull is not new. In fact, the UAW argues that it's fighting to restore many of the benefits lost during the 2008 financial crisis, concessions they made to keep the Big Three in business. And business for the Big Three has been booming. They posted a profit of $21 billion in the just the first half of this year. To put that into perspective for you, the union, again, calling for a 36 percent raise over four years. The CEO of G.M. last year was paid $29 million. That's roughly a 34 percent jump just from 2019. Stellantis CEO, he took in about $25 million last year. He makes roughly 365 times as much as the average employee. Now Ford's CEO, Jim Farley, he takes home roughly $21 million a year. Nearly $1 million of that is for, quote, \"personal use of aircraft.\" Brianna?",

The National Security Council spokesperson said the process is ongoing and sensitive.However, the issuance is a very promising sign that things are moving forward to bring these five Americans, all of whom have been declared wrongfully detained, to bring them home after some of them have spent years in Iranian custody. We saw this process start to move forward about a month ago when four of the Americans, Siamak Namazi, Morad Tahbaz, Emad Sharghi and a fourth, whose identity we don't know yet, were moved into house arrest in Iran. And the fifth American was already under house arrest in Iran. And in the weeks since, we've seen the steps start to be taken, including with the $6 billion in Iranian funding. This is going to be moved from those accounts in South Korea to Qatar. And the reason the administration had to issue this waiver was to ensure that the banks in Europe, who are helping to process the movement of this payment, don't have to fear getting sanctioned. Now the administration has come under some scrutiny from some Republicans lawmakers who are condemning them for making an agreement with the Iranian regime, which, of course, has committed numerous human rights atrocities against its own people and the detainee Americans. The State Department spokesperson, Matt Miller, hit back on the criticisms just a few minutes ago. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It's the first time ever that all 15 Israeli Supreme Court judges have sat for a case at the same time. They're going to decide whether to uphold or strike down a law passed by Netanyahu and his supporters that would limit judicial oversight of parliaments. Israelis have been protesting for months over the issue as critics say that it erodes the court's independence and harms Israel's democracy. In Spain, Luis Rubiales has been summoned to testify before a Spanish court Friday for that unwanted kiss on star player, Jennifer Hermoso, during the women's World Cup celebration. The former head of the Spanish Soccer Federation resigned over the weekend. He's now being investigated for alleged sexual assault and coercion. Rubiales apologized for the kiss. He described it as mutual. In China, authorities have quite the emergency on their hands. More than 70 crocodiles are on the loose after intense flooding in the southern part of that country. According to Chinese state media, the crocodiles escaped from a commercial farm when the flooding caused a lake to overflow. Officials are now warning residents to stay indoors as they launch an operation to try and recapture the reptiles. Jim?",
