President Biden is at the critical NATO summit in Lithuania right now. Hugely important for many reasons. One, especially because of the timing of the meeting, and also because of what is at stake in this moment. Biden and allies have already scored a win heading into the gathering with Turkey's about face. Turkey making the surprise move in dropping its opposition to Sweden's membership, meaning very soon there will be 32 members of the alliance. We'll see Biden sitting down with Turkish President Erdogan this morning. And tomorrow President Biden is scheduled to meet with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and is going to face a central question hanging over this NATO summit, which is what to do about Ukraine's quest to join their ranks. All of this all the more urgent as Russia intensifies its attacks on Ukraine. This morning several buildings were damaged in attacks on the capital in Kyiv. And at least three people were wounded in more Russian shelling on Kherson. CNN's Arlette Saenz is following all of this from Lithuania to start us off. Arlette, what have you - what is -- what have you already heard from leaders this morning, because it's been a busy morning already, and much more to come.",

But even as they are celebrating that win, as Turkey made that stunning reversal allowing Sweden into the alliance, there is already a major flash point emerging when it comes to Ukraine's possible pathway towards joining the NATO alliance down the road.Now, President Biden, heading into this summit, was very clear that now is not the time for Ukraine to join NATO. That there -- the war is still ongoing. They can't risk putting NATO countries into direct conflict with Russia. And also noting that reforms still need to be made on Ukraine's part before any type of entrance into the alliance. And earlier today National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said that the U.S. and its allies planned on sending a positive and united signal to Ukraine regarding that pathway towards membership. And President Biden had this to say as he met with Secretary-General Stoltenberg earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I encourage the president and his team to relook -- take a step back from kind of the rhetoric of the past, relook the situation and see if there is a much more robust approach far beyond what was articulated in 2008 in Bucharest where there was this idea of extending NATO membership without a concrete time line.",

So, number one, I think they actually probably can find a fair jury in a county of 1.1 million people. You can find 12 folks to do it. The other question is that, you know, Trump is quite literally the most famous person on the planet, or at least one of them. Whether he's tried prior to the election or not, whether he's a candidate or not, he - he's -- his fame is still going to be an issue.

And I think prosecutors and judges are often very careful on issues like this because the one thing that can mess up a conviction and get it thrown out on appeal is jeopardizing or violating a defendant's speedy trial - or just trial rights in general. So, I think they're proceeding with a little bit of caution.Now, look, it does appear that he's trying to slow these proceedings down quite a bit with the number of these pleadings and filings. At a certain point, the judge can just set a trial date and say - and document on the record, these are all the opportunities that the prosecution has given the defendant. This is when all of our hearings were. This is, in fact, a fair trial date, and put it on the calendar and see what happens. But, again, both - both the prosecutor and the judge have to proceed with a little bit of caution because this could really jeopardize the case in the end.",
