A special counselappointed to probe Joe Biden's improper handling of classified files, the fallout for the U.S. president and his party is live from Washington this hour. And remembering Lisa Marie Presley, daughter of Elvis Presley, dead at 54. I'm Becky Anderson. Hello, and welcome to the show. Is the prolonged battle for Soledar finally over? Now conflicting accounts against today. Russia's Defense Ministry claims its forces captured the town in eastern Ukraine after what a Ukrainian minister called a night of hot fighting. A Ukrainian military official denies that Russia is in control and says fighting continues. The taking of Soledar would bring an end to one of the war's deadliest battles, and marks Russia's first significant victory in months. The announcement from Moscow notably makes no mention of the claim by the Wagner paramilitary group that only its fighters have been fighting for Soledar. Wagner fighters posted a video disparaging Russia's claim that its own army conscripts took part. Ben Wedeman and his team are positioned just outside the town. Here is what he has been seeing there today. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WEDEMAN (on-camera): We're in a trench, just about two and a half miles or four kilometers from the front, from Soledar. Now the situation in Soledar at this point is not altogether clear. Ukrainian officials say they still hold part of it. Speaking to the soldiers, it's a mixed story. Some of them say it's either fallen or it's about to fall. Others say they still are making minor advances inside. Now what's interesting in these forward positions, we've spoken to many of the soldiers. They are fairly confident, and morale seems surprisingly high given the situation. They are confident that they can hold these positions, the rear position. But what appears to be going on is an organized pullout from the town of Soledar. We've been watching as they've been firing mortars in the direction of Russian positions, and rockets as well. You can hear, in fact, some of the thuds of some of that fire. Some of it, of course, going towards Soledar. Some in the direction of Bakhmut, and of course, there is fire coming the other direction. I'm Ben Wedeman, CNN, outside Soledar. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

He believes that the Russians' real goal is to get to the much larger city of Kramatorsk. And just quickly, I also asked him about this internal feud that we're seeing between the Russian military and the private military contractor, the Wagner mercenary group, which says that it captured Soledar without any help from regular Russian troops. And this soldier says that, look, that is not the case. There were regular Russian military paratroopers who were holding the northern and southern parts of the town. Their job, he believed, was to encircle the town, and the Wagner forces were doing the fighting in the middle of it. He says that the troops that they had encountered in the city, doing the fighting, house to house, the vast majority were Wagner but not all -- Becky.",

They have not had amajor win for the last six months or so, they lost a huge amount of territory in Kherson. They also lost a huge amount of territory in Kharkiv. And so now they have been relegated to positions that aren't, frankly, moving all that much. They have been trying and failing to take the town of Bakhmut for ages, and this effort has been led by the Wagner private military group, who's been throwing a heck of a lot of shade on the regular Russian forces, describing bureaucratic problems, internal disputes, logistical issues that continue to plague those groups. It was also regular Russian forces, Becky, who were in Makiivka that strike on the temporary barracks, Ukrainian strikes, that even the Russians say killed 89. And so the Wagner Group is trying to say, look, any success on the battlefield is coming from us, not the regular troops. Obviously, the Russian troops want to show that they are capable of taking towns as well, and so both of them, interestingly enough, are claiming to be doing a lot of the fighting in Soledar. But I think the reality is probably closer to what that soldier said that the regular troops around the outside and the Wagner troops doing the more dangerous work in the inner part of the city but it really does illustrate a rift, especially given that there is a brand-new commander just in the last couple of days that has been installed to lead this so-called special military operation -- Becky.",

This is a full blown criminal investigation now regarding classified information that was found at three locations connected to a sitting president. And the White House has made a strategic decision not to get out in front of this matter. Before the attorney general's press conference yesterday, pretty much everything we learned came from news reports and was then followed by these begrudging statements from the White House that were often lacking key details that we learned the next day. Now they stay that they are deferring to the Justice Department, allowing the Justice Department to do its work without interfering. But certainly the Justice Department does not comment on ongoing investigations, but the White House did have a choice here, particularly when they realized that CBS News had the story. They could've just come out. They could've come out, given a statement, released all the facts, but instead it's been drip, drip, drip. And it has created an optics in communication problem. Based on what we know now, it does not appear that the president is in some great legal jeopardy. There is also sort of norm of not indicting a sitting president. So it doesn't appear that the jeopardy is really legal right now, it is more political, and we have seen, particularly with the investigation in the possible mishandling of classified information in Hillary Clinton's case, we have seen that if the public thinks there is any kind of cover-up, it's going to become a real political liability.",

So he can actually request and then compel by law the State Department to provide information. Now the question here is what exactly he's going to find. They are casting an incredibly wide net with this committee asking the State Department for information, you know, related to the planning of the withdrawal from Afghanistan, anything about U.S.-Taliban meetings during the Biden administration, and they're also looking at the after-effects of the withdrawal. So they want to know things such as how was the processing of SIV is going? What is happening to Afghan women who are still in Afghanistan? So there are a lot of questions. This is a 10-page letter they sent to the secretary of State yesterday, and we will watch to see exactly how the State Department handles this. They have said that they recognize the role that Congress plays, of course, their oversight role, but they haven't fully committed to providing all of these documents.
