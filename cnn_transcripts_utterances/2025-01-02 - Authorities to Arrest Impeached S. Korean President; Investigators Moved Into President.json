And Mr. Lee is facing his own sort of legal issues as well. And he would like to secure that election victory and enter into the presidential office so he would be immune from those, you know, sort of legal challenges. Otherwise, he may also be invalidated for participating in the next election.

Well, lo and behold, on December 3rd, what Yoon try to engage in was arguably insurrection by declaring martial law and trying to sort of, you know, deny normal legislative powers of the National Assembly. So, if you're sitting on the sole municipal court and this case comes before you, there are pretty strong legal grounds to grant the detention warrant and that's following, mind you, three summonses that were previously issued over the last two weeks for Yoon to go and cooperate with this investigation and answer their questions in a more sort of civil manner.

We still have the open question of whether or not the presidential guards will allow suspended President Yoon to be taken into custody by a different law enforcement agency. This is the first time this has happened here in South Korea. And there was a cryptic note that was put out by the Presidential Guard Security Service, which said earlier in the week that they will follow procedures through due process, yada yada, very much paraphrasing, especially the yada yada. But it was very much a note that conveyed that they were going to wait and see and not definitively committing to handing over the suspended president. So, it seems as though, Richard, police overnight, as protesters seem to dwindle in number, set up a new perimeter, somehow, around the residents of suspended President Yoon Suk Yeol and are now having the Corruption Investigation Team go in through that way. So, what we're waiting to see in the next few minutes, if we get the shot of suspended President Yoon coming out to the nation in handcuffs or held by corruption investigators on route to a couple minutes south of the city to a detention center to answer questions about why he declared martial law a month ago tonight.",

So, there would be so many people who would say this is democracy functioning, holding an elected leader accountable for a martial law, which was declared a month ago tonight in the 10:00 p.m. local time hour of December 3rd, six hours later into the early morning hours of December 4th. What we're seeing right now is directly related to that, with South Korea's Corruption Investigation Office, different branch of law enforcement from the regular police, bringing -- trying to bring in the suspended president for questioning related to why he declared martial law, was he trying to initiate some sort of power grab? We have reporting here at CNN saying that based on the indictment of his former defense minister, the now suspended president, Yoon Suk Yeol, whose residence we see in these live pictures, ordered the potential for shots to be fired if lawmakers here in Seoul, South Korea did not accede to his demand that the functions of parliament be suspended. So, the functioning of democracy is very much on the line right here. But why this is so contentious, Richard, and for all of our viewers just joining us, this may not be just investigators go in and arrest the suspended president who the assembly has voted to impeach. This could be so many supporters of Yoon trying to block the detention of South Korea's suspended president. It looks like, based on reporting from Yonhap News, which is analogous to the Associated Press here in South Korea, has said that corruption investigators have entered the property, but we are waiting, Richard, wrapping up here, for the shot of Yoon Suk Yeol, the elected president of South Korea, albeit suspended, coming out held by investigators en route about an hour south of here for questioning and to be detained.",

So, why this is so important, this has never happened before in South Korea's history. A bastion of democracy in this corner of the world has never had somebody elected to the presidency, while they are in office, detained by law enforcement. So, for all of our viewers who are no (INAUDIBLE), as you say, Richard, with South Korean politics and everything is going on over here, this suspended president doesn't have any of his real powers anymore because a month ago tonight, he declared martial law to try to better move his agenda through the National Assembly. It was a plot that has been ridiculed, condemned by whole multitudes of people. Didn't work. It only lasted for about six hours. And what we're seeing now is a direct result of his actions a month ago by the Corruption Investigative Office to hold the suspended president accountable on criminal charges, which is separate from his political impeachment, Richard.",

And one of the things we were looking for was to see now that isreopened for the first time since this attack actually happened, what the scene would actually look like. Well, for starters, there are a lot of law enforcement that are out. Typically, there are a lot in this particular area, just given the amount of bars and the amount of attention this area gets, but clearly making their presence known. And just to give you perspective, as you look over my shoulder this way, down this area where you can likely see the truck that is blocking that intersection, that is where the white truck on the night of the attack actually made its way into the French Quarter where I'm standing, down Bourbon Street, this road here. As we understand from surveillance video that we've seen, that truck went around onto the sidewalk and then made its way down here where people were still celebrating the New Year just hours into it. And one thing you also might notice as well, just aside from this guy here is, on the sidewalks, these are new barriers that were added. You might be able to see these yellow types of barriers now on top of the vehicles that are blocking these roads. So, clearly some added precautions tonight. But once this opened, life kind of went back to normal here. People walking up and down, businesses back reopened, seating people, people eating, drinking like normal. There is a pretty big American football game going on right now. Once that is over, this is likely where they will come. But people walking along completely normally. And we were talking to some folks a little bit earlier today about how they felt, if it felt weird being back here. Some started with that, yes, but one bar owner here told me, we can't let them win. And for that reason, he wants this to go back to normal as soon as possible, as strong as ever.",
