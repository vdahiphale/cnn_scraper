The Ukrainian leader was quite candid with CNN's Erin Burnett, now nearly 500 days since Russia first invaded his country. Zelenskyy called Vladimir Putin weak. And he said the recent revolt against him only proves that Putin does not have control. Zelenskyy also addressed Crimea, the region now at the center of an assassination claim, as Russia overnight accused Ukraine of trying to kill the Russian backed Crimean leader. Zelenskyy is adamant that the war will not end as long as Russia is in control there.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINE (through translator): We cannot imagine Ukraine without Crimea.

We don't have any secrets from CIA because we have good relations and our intelligence services talk with each other. I don't know what were other contacts, I don't really remember which media I read it in. The situation is pretty straightforward. We have good relations with the CIA chief, and we are talking.

So what do you tell Putin in the midst of facing many revolts a short time ago? You tell him, look, you're vulnerable.There is a huge upside, I guarantee you, for the CIA behind the scenes, some of the best informants I ever saw, the CIA were what we call walk-ins volunteers. We didn't recruit them. They walked into a place like an embassy and said, I'm disaffected. I want to join up. There is a flip side to that, though, and if I were Putin, I'd be taking advantage of this flip side, and that is they're going to flood the zone, that is the Russians. They're going to find out how the Americans are trying to recruit people online, and they're going to send their own recruits in. We call them Dangles to see if we can frustrate the Americans.

But this is the ancient world of the spy business. Back before the digital age, a lot of people would walk into embassies. One of the best informants I ever saw in al-Qaeda, he was a walk in. He was ticked off at the al-Qaeda organization for killing too many civilians. He was a great, great informant, same thing with the Russians.But the Russians would send in Dangles to Embassies, and it takes a while to sort through that because they're going to have some good information to prove their bona fide. So you have to figure out over time whether they're a Dangle or whether they're true. I assume the same would hold true with the Russians trying to go after the Americans online.

They may have corruption involved, which means they're getting money from staying within the regime.What's the value to them of trying to overthrow Putin? There's also the hassle of dealing with the Russian internal security services, which are great. They're not going to arrest you. They're going to kill you if they find you.

We also learned over the weekend that Trump had Pence call. Pence talked to Ducey multiple times. And the question again was whether or not Pence applied this pressure.

But really, I'm only hearing one thing when it comes to this pretty bizarre video from Republicans, which is, why did he do this? And this does teeter on homophobic. I talked to several donors who were scratching their heads. These are people who support Ron DeSantis, who have given him money, who are wondering what exactly this was supposed to do, what this was supposed to mean. We also heard from the Log Cabin Republicans, they call themselves the largest Republican organization that represents the LGBT community within the Republican Party.They said that this teeters on homophobic. They said that this was divisive, destructive. And then, of course, we heard from the Trump campaign, but they have the most to gain from a DeSantis misstep. But I want to note one part of this video. It is in itself, again, bizarre. You hear the music playing, these oiled up bodybuilders. At one point, you see a Christian Bale from American Psycho. But there's also another message here, which is that top of the speech where you hear Trump saying he's going to offer his support to this community. That came just a month after the Pulse shooting. He was accepting the nomination in Ohio, and he was saying that he was going to support this community and support any community that was facing domestic terrorism. It is unclear why the DeSantis team, of course, we have asked, would choose that speech to kind of draw a line here about the former president's support of the LGBT community. But it was a moment in time when this group was really suffering. So there are a lot of questions about that as well. Did they know what this speech was even about when they put it out there?",
