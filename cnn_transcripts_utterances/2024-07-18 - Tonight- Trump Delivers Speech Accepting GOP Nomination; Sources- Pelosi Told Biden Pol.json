      "sentences": "Welcome to Inside Politics. I'm Dana Bash. Live from the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, where hours from now Donald Trump will accept his party's nomination for the third time in a row. It will happen before delegates who are energized and united behind their candidate like almost never before after he was nearly assassinated just five days ago.Now, in normal times, this would obviously be our lead here today on Inside Politics, but these are anything but normal times. So, we are going to start on the other side of the aisle because Joe Biden, the sitting president of the United States has never been closer to being pushed out of the race. While Republicans were celebrating here in Milwaukee. This was Joe Biden getting on Air Force One last night. He of course had to leave where he was in Nevada because he was diagnosed with COVID. It is a split screen that terrifies Democrats and has convinced more and more of them that Joe Biden cannot win. We're seeing what appears to be -- appears to be a carefully choreographed push by party leaders to show Biden that Democrats could be destroyed in November with him at the top of the ticket. One House Democrat told me last night quote, the walls are closing in. CNN's MJ Lee and Jeff Zeleny have both been at the forefront of critical reporting on this historic and very dramatic time about what is going on inside the Democratic Party and inside the White House and the Biden campaign. I want to start MJ with you at the White House. MJ?",

      "sentences": "Well, Dana, what we know is that some of the most important conversations about President Biden's future are still happening behind closed doors. We are learning about a conversation between former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and President Biden that took place as recently as in the last week or so. Where Nancy Pelosi told the president that polling shows that he cannot defeat Donald Trump in November, and that he could take down the House with him if he continues seeking a second term.And what our sources have told us is that the president responded with defensiveness and essentially saying to Pelosi, I have seen polls that show that I can in fact win and really just push back. And at one point in the conversation we are told Pelosi, asked that Mike Donilon, the president's senior adviser get on the phone so that they can all have a discussion about the data. None of our sources, Dana, importantly said whether Pelosi in this private conversation told the president explicitly that she believes that he needs to drop out of the race. And I will also say this marks the second known conversation between the president and Pelosi since the debate. We know that they also spoke in early July. And as for how the two camps are responding officially, the White House wouldn't comment on this conversation. But they did put out a statement saying, President Biden is the nominee of the party, and he plans to win. Pelosi's spokesperson interestingly said, Pelosi has been in California since Friday, and she has not spoken to Biden since. Now, one thing that is really clear from this reporting, Dana, that I think is worth highlighting is how the president has appeared really dug in when it comes to the pulling of the data. You know, we've heard him saying in public, look, I think I'm doing OK still in the polls. And it's clear that he genuinely does believe this in private settings as well. And, you know, you know better than anyone, Dana, how important of a force Nancy Pelosi is inside the party. She has such incredible sway. She understands exactly where the caucus is on any political issue. And she did sort of leave open the door recently, when she said in an interview, it's up to the president to decide if he's going to run. And I think the huge question right now is, will she get to the point at some point where she says in public that yes, it's up to him, but she believes that he needs to step aside.",

      "sentences": "Dana, as these calls for President Biden to reconsider his candidacy really intensive by both behind and the scenes and in public. We're getting a better sense of why that is and why these leaders are making the argument.In that memo that you talked about there from a Blue Research, a Democratic research firm really shared widely throughout the party. It talks about the damage this is having for Democrats down ballot. I'm told that former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi reads this polling very carefully, as of course do many other leaders. And as we've looked through this, yes, it talks about the expanding presidential battleground map, but it also talks about the potential damage that's been inflicted on individual Democratic candidates. And take a look at this really poignant sentence here inside the memo. It says defending Biden's fitness for office is an untenable position for down ballot Democrats. It goes on to say that the honesty and the trustworthiness of these Democratic candidates in the House will be questioned. And voters will start to have second thoughts about them if they keep defending President Biden. Of course, this is reflected also in the new Associated Press poll yesterday, showing just an overwhelming majority of people are questioning his fitness for Office. So, Dana, we know the calls are coming. But this is one of the senses of why that is, even as the conversation begins to look forward to what could happen next. Right now, at least, we should point out this is still President Biden's decision to make and he's in Delaware. Dana?",

I mean, the complete disintegration of the Biden candidacy at the moment, you know, in a split screen with the most unified Republican Party around Donald Trump in the nine years that he's been a figure at the top of the party. So, it's just an astonishing thing happening side by side.But I will say this about the Biden situation. I think we have to be clear what this is in this moment. The Biden candidacy is over as we know it, whether he steps down or not. So, if indeed, he doesn't step down, he moves forward in an entirely different kind of candidacy than the one that has existed to date. And so, as we have currently seen it, I just think this 2024 race is already irrevocably changed, even if Biden chooses, which again, the choice is up to him not to step aside and get into all this pressure.",

And you just did that so well. And just go back in time just to give that analysis even more of.It wasn't that long ago, like, I don't know, two days ago, that we were calling our sources and saying, what did Pelosi say to the president? It's a private conversation. What did Schumer say to the president. He was blunt, private conversation. Same thing with Hakeem Jeffries. And suddenly, the information was allowed to be reported. And that came after we got more reporting about a very tense call between centrist House Democrats and the president, which happened right before the shooting of former President Trump on Saturday. As Kaitlan said, Adam Schiff coming out. And nobody looked at that and thought anything other than the sort of three-dimensional chess of Nancy Pelosi, and then, of course, the reporting that our team and others did last night.",

And they were worried that if they came out publicly and said all these things, he would dig in further. But what was clear over the weekend, is that Joe Biden was going to be dug in anyway.So now this information is out there. And one detail that MJ reported that I thought was really key was that Nancy Pelosi asked to get Mike Donilon on the line. Because there is incredible concern not just among Democrats, but among Biden aides to that the people closest to Joe Biden are telling him what he wants to hear. And it's not out of sort of -- it's not of a conspiracy, it's because of great affection firm. They are not known for giving the president hard news. And that's Mike Donilon and Steve Ricchetti and Bruce Reed. They are friends with the president, in addition to being his closest advisers --",

Just as again, because I just think this pattern and the big picture of what has happened and where we are is important.Just to show you some of the headlines we're talking about just in the last 12 hours. Pelosi -- CNN's great reporting, Pelosi privately told Biden polls show, he can't win and will take down the House. Biden responded with defensiveness. ABC's reporting Schumer privately urged Biden to step aside. And then Semafor donors, cash is drying up. Katzenberg warns Biden in a private meeting, which he apparently is denying. But all of that, and then culminated last night with Jeff Zeleny, another piece of really interesting and telling reporting, that suddenly there was somebody saying, well, the president is sort of softening and becoming a bit more receptive, not that he's made a decision not even close, but he's opening the door crack.",

So even a softening might not necessarily mean that he is going to change his mind completely.But I do want to go back to two things that you said. One, now this race has fundamentally changed, no matter what he decides to do. And I think touching on the headlines you just read, they are going to have to run a very different campaign now than they were against Donald Trump. And one example of that, is the fact that one of their biggest arguments was your own people don't support you. They don't show up for you. How is that going to continue to be an argument for Joe Biden, when we have reporting that Nancy Pelosi is telling him that this could be a problem. When his own people are saying that. They are going to have to run a very much more defensive race and change some of their messaging.",

Their interpretation may be different than most people who are sitting at home and watching.So, I think you kind of have to just wait and see what it looks like when it's all put together. You know, they described what the J. D. Vance speech would be, and it wasn't fully that when we watched it last night. But I think the other thing about Donald Trump and him coming out speaking tonight, it'll be his first time in a lectern since Saturday, since that attempted assassination of him. You saw him speaking briefly this morning. But other than that, he has not done any interviews on camera or anything publicly. I was told by Lara Trump last night when I was interviewing her, Dana, the floor that that's on purpose. It's essentially letting the anticipation built for him to come out. And this is going to be his reemergence for the first time since then. And when you do talk to people, they say that it has changed him.
