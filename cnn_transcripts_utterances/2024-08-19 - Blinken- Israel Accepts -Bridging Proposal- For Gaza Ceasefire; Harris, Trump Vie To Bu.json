If you don't know who your State House representative is, your state Senator, your county commissioner, your city council person, when push comes to shove and you have a local problem that you need solved, you're not going to be able to reach out to those people. You need to hold your local officials accountable. So I've been going around trying to promote wonderful Democratic candidates in the state of Georgia, like my friend, Bryce Berry (ph). Bryce (ph) is a teacher in House District 56. He teaches middle school students.

We've got a lot of great down-ballot candidates.

I'm so proud to be a delegate for her. But I honestly believe in the bottom my heart, she is going to win Georgia. I know Georgia politics. I saw Joe win in 2020. I saw also Ossoff and Warnock, who won in 2021. And I know what Georgia cares about. I know our values. A majority of Georgia believes a woman deserves the right to choose.

He knew that it was time for someone else to carry on this cause. I've truly respect Joe Biden's public service. He was actually elected as the youngest Senator in the history of our country, at 29. They had to delay his inauguration. But his service speaks volumes. And I think what he did, giving the -- passing the torch speaks volumes, too, because I am extraordinarily excited about this nominee. I think Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are a dream team ticket. And I think they're going to win Georgia. And I think we're going to once again save the country and save our democracy. And we're going to fight for women's rights. I know they're going to have an amazing win. We put in the work and Americans make their voice heard. They're going to have an amazing four years of delivering for the working class. Her policy agenda has already just blown me away. As somebody who wants to buy a home, you know, a recent college graduate, that makes it much more feasible for me to think about financial mobility.

It was anticipated that up to tens of thousands of people from all around the country would descend on Chicago for, as you mentioned, the march on the DNC. And, Brianna, it's important to remember that this area is home to the largest Palestinian population in the United States. And what you're seeing right now is thousands of people listening to speakers. And if you look down here, in a few minutes, at least, protesters are expected to pick up these signs and then they're going to march. The city designated route is about a mile. But protest organizers, Brianna, say that is not enough, that they want to march a route that's about two-and-a-half miles. They've been battling with the city for weeks in court. They did not win. But they said, either way, they plan to walk a larger route. The larger the other question is what the police presence is going to look like. And so far, we've seen dozens of police officers, mostly on bikes, surrounding this area. And so far, this is extremely peaceful. Again, speakers at the moment, the expectation is that they we're set off for their march here in a few moments. As far as whether there are counter-protesters, there were,, I'd say, a handful, maybe a dozen or two dozen, Brianna, counter-protesters. But there we're no conflicts that we saw -- Brianna?",
