And we begin with a major breakthrough in Western military support for Ukraine as we learn both the U.S. and Germany appear poised to send sophisticated tanks to the battlefield. The German news outlet Der Spiegel is reporting that Berlin is now set to send Leopard 2 tanks after months of debate.In the coming hours, the German parliament is expected to debate the issue. That news coming after we learned the U.S. is finalizing plans to send about 30 Abrams tanks to Ukraine. U.S. officials say an announcement could come as soon as this week. All this just days after Germany had indicated it would not send tanks unless the U.S. agreed to send its own. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy discussed the need for modern western tanks during a visit from the Finnish president. Mr. Zelenskyy says the need is urgent. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translation): It is not about five or 10 or 15 tanks. The need is greater. We are doing what is necessary every day to fill the deficit. And I thank everyone who supports us in this. However, discussions must end with decisions. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Not yet official, but coming from U.S. officials familiar with the matter that D.C. is preparing to announce that they will send 30 Abrams tanks to Ukraine. Unclear how long that will take, that could be a lengthy timeline. It does take months to train on these tanks but that has eased, it seems, Germany stance.Germany has been reluctant to give the OK, the green light to send their own German-made tanks, the Leopard tanks, to Ukraine. There's been this growing pressure, piling pressure on Berlin from its European allies, particularly Poland, that want to see those tanks sent to the front lines as quickly as possible. But it's important to point out here, Rosemary, there's a stark difference between these two types of tanks. The Leopard tank, the German-made seen as easy to use, practical, whereas the Abrams tank by the U.S. much more complicated. Take a listen to how John Kirby, a senior U.S. official, described it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN KIRBY, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL COORDINATOR FOR STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS: We have talked about the fact that the Abrams are an incredibly capable system but it's a very expensive system to operate and to maintain. It has a jet engine. That doesn't mean that the Ukrainians can't learn it. It just means that we have to factor all that stuff in with any system that we're going to potentially provide to them.

And that means Ukraine's battlefield wish list is growing longer. CNN's Frederik Pleitgen has details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): Even as fighting rages in eastern Ukraine, Russian forces are making little headway. Vladimir Putin recently appointed his military chief, Valery Gerasimov, to lead the war in Ukraine. Yet another reshuffle in the hierarchy. The deputy head of Ukraine's Defense Intelligence tells me he believes Putin realizes his entire command structure is in disarray. VADYM SKIBITSKIY, UKRAINIAN DEPUTY HEAD OF DEFENSE INTELLIGENCE (through translation): He really does have problems with the command, both at the top level, the generals, and at the bottom level of platoon or company commander. That issue is generally very problematic. PLEITGEN (voice-over): Another problem, those marginal gains Russia is making come mostly from mercenaries of the Wagner private military company around Bakhmut, where Wagner has been gaining ground while suffering severe losses themselves. Wagner's boss, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has been highly critical of Russia's military leadership, calling them all but incompetent. The Ukrainians say he's made plenty of enemies among the elites. SKIBITSKIY (through translation): The leadership of the Russian Armed Forces are going to try to belittle Prigozhin's role and place however they can, so he cannot strengthen his positions in the Kremlin hierarchy. PLEITGEN (voice-over): While the Ukrainians try to hold on in Bakhmut, they say they urgently need western main battle tanks to take back more territory.",

SKIBITSKIY (through translation): Right now, they have moved the logistics and control, but mainly logistics systems further away from the front line, and that's 80 to 100 to 120 kilometers away. And to strike them, you need longer range strike systems. PLEITGEN (voice-over): That would include targets on Russian territory to choke off any future offensive by Moscow's forces. SKIBITSKIY (through translation): There are strong logistics hubs in the Rostov region. It is these very hubs and they need to be struck in order to disrupt the supply systems of all kinds. PLEITGEN (on-camera): For now though, the Ukrainians certainly seem to be very happy with that decision by both the United States and Germany to send main battle tanks to Ukraine. In fact, the chief of staff of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy saying that he believes Western main battle tanks are as he puts at democracy's punch against autocracy. Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Kyiv.
