And it comes after dueling orders from two federal judges. On Friday, a judge in Texas issued a ruling suspending the FDA's approval of the abortion pill Mifepristone. Less than an hour later, a federal judge in Washington State issued a contradictory ruling to keep that drug on the market in 17 states and Washington D.C.Joining us now is Minnesota Senator Tina Smith. I should note, she's a former executive at Planned Parenthood. She also sits on the Health Committee that oversees the FDA, so really a critical voice in this. good morning, Senator. SEN.

Think about what that means if you have somebody, who says I don't like vaccines, anti- vaxxer, I'm going to go to the courts and ask them to overturn approval of a vaccine, for example.

His team has been working behind the scenes to try to set the basic contours of what a campaign might look like once he does pull the trigger. Originally, advisers had suggested that decision might be coming this April. April is here. It is now looking like it might be pushed a bit into the summer. But there are still some big decisions that need to be made, such as who exactly is going to be running this campaign as the campaign manager, where it's going to be based, whether it's in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, or possibly in Philadelphia.
