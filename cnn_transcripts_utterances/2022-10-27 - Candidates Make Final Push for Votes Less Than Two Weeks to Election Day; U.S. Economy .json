GDP numbers show that this quarter was the first to show positive growth this year. Democrats sure to tout those new numbers on the trail today as Republicans hammer those continuing concerns over inflation. How do those two square? We're going to have much more on that in just a moment. Plus, happening right now, an investigation underway in Arizona after the Democratic candidate for governor Katie Hobbs said someone broke into her campaign headquarters. CNN Senior National Correspondent Kyung Lah is following this for us in Phoenix. More on that break-in. And, Kyung, police say there were some items taken. What more are we learning about this break-in and also what was taken from the office?",

There has been a police report filed and they are looking for someone.The campaign did manage to capture someone who they think did this on their security cameras. We were able to obtain these still images from that security footage, which has been handed over to police, as police try to figure out exactly who did this. The campaign did say that they think, while not maybe directly responsible, they pointed the finger at the heated rhetoric in this race for governor and Republican nominee Kari Lake. Here is a statement from the campaign manager of the Katie Hobbs campaign, saying, quote Secretary Hobbs and her staff have faced hundreds of death threats and threats of violence over the course of this campaign. The threats against Arizonans attempting to exercise their constitutional rights and their attacks on elected officials are the direct result of a concerted campaign of lies and intimidation. Well, Kari Lake responded to that statement. The statement does go on and she didn't take lightly to it. She had a fiery statement which essentially says that she thinks the Hobbs campaign might be making all of this up. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE KARI LAKE (R-AZ):  That is absolutely absurd. And are you guys buying that? Are you really buying that? Because this sounds like a Jesse Smollett part two. I can't believe that she would blame my amazing people, blame me for something like that. I don't even know where her campaign office is. I'm assuming it is in a basement somewhere, because that is where she's been campaigning. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "It is, Erica. And, look, this is natural. 35 races are up. The two national party committees and other outside groups don't spend in 35 races. That would be ridiculous. They spent in ten-ish, maybe a little smaller, and that number is getting smaller.Let's first look at races that maybe we thought might happen and now look a little longer shots. And I want to start in New Hampshire. So, at the start of the election, Maggie Hassan, the Democratic nominee, was seen as one of the most vulnerable incumbents in the country. Her numbers were soft and Republicans thought they were going to get Chris Sununu, the sitting popular governor of the state, as the candidate. They didn't get him. He decided not to run. They wound out getting Don Bolduc, a retired brigadier general who has made a lot of comments about election denialism. That race is now -- I don't want to say, out of hand, because, as you see, the average of the polls there, Hassan plus eight, but it is not where it should be and the Senate leadership fund, that's Mitch McConnell's super PAC pulled $5.6 million out of that race and put it in a place we're going to talk about in a minute, Pennsylvania, where we've been talking a lot about. The other one there is Colorado. Again, it is a blue-ish state but not a blue state. Michael Bennet has a solid but not -- he's not up 16 points, he is up 6 points over Joe O'Dea, who has run as a moderate. So, those are two races that I think Republicans thought might come online that are struggling. But, again, things change. Let's go on the Democratic side, races that Democrats thought they might have a better chance in. Well, let's start in Florida. You mentioned Donald Trump is going to be doing an event down there for Marco Rubio. It looks like Rubio is okay. Val Demings has run a very solid campaign. She is a former police chief. She is a congresswoman right now. She has raised vast sums of money. But it looks like Rubio is going to be fine. And then one that I'll say I certainly didn't think we would talking about, even at all, even as a sleeper race, is Iowa. Chuck Grassley has been in the Senate for 40 odd years. He's always won with 60-plus percent of the vote. But there is polling out there shows Mike Franken, the Democratic nominee, who has not gotten a lot of attention within three points of Chuck Grassley. So, those four races, keep an eye on them, but it looks like they are starting to fade as we get into these final 12 days where decisions have to be made about where money goes and where it doesn't go.",

      "timeStamp": "10:05:05",
      "speaker": "CILLIZZA",
      "sentences": "Yes. Look, I think you're going to see the bulk of the money spent in these final two weeks, in the same places that we've seen the bulk of the money spent before, which is three races, Arizona -- excuse me Nevada, Pennsylvania and Georgia. I'll get to Arizona in a minute, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Georgia.In two of those seats are Democrat seats. Catherine Cortez Masto in Nevada is running a solid campaign but the economy in Nevada is not in a great place, that's hurting her. Adam Laxalt, the Republican nominee, looks pretty strong. The other Democratic race is the one that I think everyone knows about, Raphael Warnock, the incumbent, running against former NFL star Herschel Walker. Walker's campaign, as you just mentioned, has been hit by allegation after allegation. It is hard to say polling-wise how big of a difference that makes. You see there the average polling there is Warnock plus five but that is within the margin of error. There is now clear leader there. There's polling that shows it closer than that. There's polling that shows it wider than that. And then I want to just talk about Ohio if I can for a minute, if we can just jump to Ohio. This is a race that is effectively tied. It is a race that is between Tim Ryan, the Democratic congressman, and Republican J.D. Vance. I don't think J.D. Vance or national Republicans thought we would be talking about this race when we are this late in the cycle. Mitch McConnell and the Senate leadership fund has spent almost $30 million in ads on the race, surprising that it is close. If Ohio turns out to be what it normally is at the federal level, Vance will win narrowly. But the fact that we're even talking about this close to the election speaks to the fact that it should be maybe included in those five or six or seven races where we're going to see the most spending, the most attention in these final days.",

They're now going to make a mistake in the other direction of moving too fast. And you're quite right, that the issues, that when they make their move, it could really be a year or two before it hits the economy. And so it is hard to calibrate.And I think as interest rates gets towards 4.5 percent or 5 percent, for sure, they need to slow down, but maybe even the pace. I'm not saying they need to raise rates. We have to fight inflation. But having a massive recession right now after the pandemic, after the global financial crisis, I just can't imagine the political fallout from that, much less the economic fallout.",
