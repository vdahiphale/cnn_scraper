At one stage, there was talk of moving it from the Seine for security reasons over to a Colosseum. That would be almost impossible to do at this stage. I was just on the Seine walking around, and music was playing, and it looked like people were testing systems. So I think they're all systems go with the opening ceremonies. But you are going to have two problems. One is, of course, lots of people can't get into the city who may have tickets. And then the priority for the Olympic Committee has got to get athletes moving. Athletes often stay outside of Olympic villages, you know, basically for comfort levels. And so each national team will be getting an inventory of where their athletes are to make sure that they can experience what's essentially an event for them.",

All of the days, weeks, months, years planning this. And it is raining, and it's raining harder now than it was an hour ago. It is a steady little drizzle. But how that will, as Juliet was just saying, how that will impact the events down the Seine, the dancers, all of the show, the music that is expected, we don't know yet. But clearly, this is their worst nightmare in terms of the weather. Hopefully, it will clear in the next few hours. And then, of course, the disruptions.

I have been doing this, too, talking about the Seine River, talking about, is this really a wise thing to do, to have the athletes of the world and all of these others gather on the Seine?Clearly, this is the first time ever an opening ceremony has not been in a stadium. And a stadium, of course, is so much more secure. You can actually secure an 80,000 seat, 60,000 seat stadium in a way you just cannot secure a river. And that is just a fact. And it's something I have asked over and over. And I wondered if they would ever want to move the opening ceremony to a stadium. They have said, every man, every woman I have ever spoken with, no, we are going to stick with the Seine River. So what that tells me is that the authorities here, and also in the United States, who I have spoken with, have been so aware that there could be disruptions and protests. They have been so aware of the security issues. And then here this morning in Paris and around France, this coordinated effort to disrupt the train system, it's almost amazing that it was able to happen because of the incredible focus, as I said, months and months, that I have been hearing in my phone calls and my reporting.
