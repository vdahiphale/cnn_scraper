To the West in Zaporizhzhia, the city declared Monday a day of mourning after 13 people were killed when a missile slammed into a high-rise building late last week. Meantime, Ukraine's energy minister says diplomatic efforts to return the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to Ukrainian control have stalled. The plant has now been under Russian control for a year. All this as Ukraine's president is thanking his forces for defending their country. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): I thank everyone whose life saved the life of Ukraine.

That's according to Ukrainian military commanders, who claim that there are still holding one of the main highways in and out of Bakhmut, and therefore, able to protect those crucial supply lines to the Ukrainian defenders, still doing all they can to hold a town that has been essentially besieged now for seven months.We're speaking to the deputy mayor of the town, who says that the heavy artillery fire and mortar fire has only got worse, with Russian forces re-throwing everything they have at Bakhmut. Explaining also that it is only about 5 to 10 civilians that they're managing to evacuate right now, compared to 6 to 500 at the height of the evacuations at the end of February. It is four and a half thousand civilians, of course, still trapped inside that town. And yet, according to Ukrainian commanders, a possibility that they have managed to hold the center and will continue to do so. One commander describing the scene as hell and saying one day feels like an eternity, but it is necessary to hold on for every day that we can. Melissa Bell, CNN, Kyiv. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

People coming out with flowers and leaving flowers at significant places. And two of them that are located in Moscow I actually know very well, because I used to live by both of them. And there are statues to two poets, Ukrainian poets. And so, Russian people are coming out, putting flowers. Sometimes they put little stuffed animals at these memorials, at these statues. And it is a way, I think, of protesting the war, no question. But also trying to somehow, you know, make up for the damage and the death that the Russian troops have caused in Ukraine.

You've had a lot of give and take and a lot of criticism coming out from various groups.

But the situation is not going to improve as the weather begins to warm, with just a fraction of humanitarian aid reaching those whose lives depended upon it. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) COREN (voice-over): Fresh snow blankets the hilltops of the Ghor province in central Afghanistan, creating the illusion of a winter wonderland. But for those who live here, there is no wonder, let alone glimmer of hope. Simply staying alive is a daily struggle. For this family, their young son lost that battle. Now, they huddle around his hillside grave, offering prayers to 6-year-old Waheed (ph), who, just days ago, froze to death. \"I miss my brother, and that is why I came to visit him at the graveyard,\" she says. Abdul Zahir (ph) moved his family to the township of Haruzkur (ph) in Ghor, looking for work as a laborer. In Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, he was unable to make ends meet. \"I had nothing to burn to keep the house warm,\" he explains. \"I checked on the children during the night, and their bodies were numb. I realized my son had died of frostbite.\" \"This is a photo of him last year,\" he says. \"And this is his dead body.\" An unprecedentedly brutal winter has claimed countless Afghan lives this year. But so, too, has extreme poverty. This has been exacerbated by the repercussions of the Taliban government's dystopian gender policies. And the response by the international community. Almost a year ago, the Taliban banned female secondary school students from attending school. That has morphed into a nationwide event on all female education. But it was the Taliban's decision in December, banning women from working for non-governmental organizations, that forced humanitarian aid groups to abruptly halt or suspend operations.",

For more security, we prefer to come to our embassy to register, to return to Ivory Coast. MADOWO (voice-over): Saied has since denied his comments were racist, saying legal migrants have nothing to fear. But reiterated his belief that illegal immigrants are causing the downfall of the country. KAIS SAIED, TUNISIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): This is a matter for the state. It must take its responsibilities. There is no question of allowing anyone in an illegal situation to stay in Tunisia. There's a state and institutions. MADOWO (voice-over): Saied's remarks are causing shock waves across the continent, the African Union calling them racist and shocking. Countries like the Ivory Coast, Mali, Guinea and Gabon are now working to have their citizens leave the country. But some migrants say they've got nothing to go back to in their home countries. Even though some are living on the streets after they say mobs have ransacked the homes, fueled by the president's words.",

This is not a place you want to sleep. We are suffering.MADOWO (voice-over): Tunisia is home to about 20,000 migrants from sub-Saharan Africa. The country has visa-free travel for many African countries and has become a transit point for many illegal migrants trying to cross to Europe. It's also a country sliding away from democracy to one-man rule. In 2021, Saied suspended Parliament, making way for a new constitution that took away many of the government's checks and balances; consolidating power with himself. On Sunday, Tunisian demonstrators gathered in the capital of Tunis, despite a ban on the rally, to protest against the president and the recent arrests of opposition leaders. A crackdown of critics, and a purge of migrants, signs Tunisia's time as a democracy may be ticking away. Larry Madowo, CNN. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

MELAS (voice-over): This is only part of what Chris Rock said. He made the jokes at nearly the end of this two-hour special that was livestreamed, and it was live on Netflix. There were a lot of comedians and friends of his in attendance. Some who opened for him. Some were just in the audience. But the crowd erupted into laughter. You know, CNN has reached out to Will Smith's camp for comment. In the special, he says that he's not going to be sitting down with Oprah or anything like that anytime soon. So for now, this is Chris Rock addressing a slap. And I can only imagine that it will still be fodder for jokes of Chris Rock to come.",
