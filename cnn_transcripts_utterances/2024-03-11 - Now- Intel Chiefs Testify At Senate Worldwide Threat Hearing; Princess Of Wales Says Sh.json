We're, of course, going to keep monitoring what questions she and others on the panel are asked.But briefly reviewing some of her remarks, she went through a series of overall threats to the United States, including strategic competition with China, the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine and we should note the conflict in Gaza. It struck me that during the beginning of her remarks, she was interrupted by a protester demanding a ceasefire in Gaza. She specifically said that that conflict has prompted complications and the dynamics across the Middle East. And she said that it would have a generational impact on terrorism. Obviously, a lot of threats to go over, a lot of hot spots around the world.   KEILAR: That's right. And she went on to talk about Russia and Ukraine. She said that when it comes to Vladimir Putin, his strategic goals remain unchanged. He continues to see NATO's enlargement and Western support to Ukraine is reinforcing his long held belief that U.S. and - the U.S. and Europe are trying to restrict Russian power, that they're trying to undermine him. And she, before Congress, was making the point that this aid to Ukraine is critical, that they're not going to be able to remain where they are in the war if they don't get it.",

It was missing last year. Last year, it was kind of a country by country thing. And this year, she really did say, look, this combined effort and collaboration between our adversaries is making each one of them stronger. And I think that that's something that we're really going to have to pay attention to for a long time.",

      "sentences": "Well, I mean, just generally, this is such a rare opportunity to see all these top officials who speak - I can count on one hand the number of times we hear from them publicly each year and to have them all together is such a rare opportunity.So to some extent, it is going to be a laundry list of the various threats that the U.S. is facing from nation state actors, non-state actors, but then other things like climate change, health, the economy, that kind of thing. And I think to Beth's point, it'll be very interesting to see how they bring all of this together. Now, I think they're really going to dig into the meat of these various subjects in the Q&amp;A when the senators get to ask the questions. Then, as we just heard from Haines (ph), there's going to be a classified briefing afterwards. But this is two days, tomorrow there's a House version of this, of really a rare glimpse into what these people are thinking.   And so what I really want to hear is their assessment of what has happened in the past year and what they expect to come in the coming year. Specifically, these two wars that are raging in Ukraine and in Gaza, their assessment of where they think Russia is going to go in the coming year on the Ukrainian battlefield, but also in other - various other fora like cyberspace and interfering with our elections. A lot of this will be through the prism of American politics. Of course, the Senate did approve supplemental funding for Ukraine. That is something that we have not seen in the House. And so I imagine these National Security officials are going to be encouraging these lawmakers to send more funding to Ukraine to ward off that Russian threat. And then, of course, the war in Gaza and where they think that is going. This is, to some extent, they're not just looking at the past year, but they're also trying to give the American public a sense of things to come. But they don't have a perfect crystal ball. I was looking at the report from last year, there is no mention of Hamas. There is a mention of threat to Israel via Iran and its proxies, but nothing to indicate that we're going to see the scale of the war that we're going through now. And then I think on the domestic front, they're also going to be asking Chris Wray about - the head of the FBI - about the threats that we're facing. And I would imagine that as a result of this war in Gaza, he's going to hone in specifically on the anti-Semitic threats and the Islamophobic threats as well that are so high right now.",

And what they're trying to do is force a divestiture to make ByteDance, the parent company, be owned by an American. And so a lot of this is about pressure tactics to get them to sell and I think that President Trump would support that. I think it's just - he knows how popular it is, and he's just playing the populist card, just like Biden is on TikTok. It's complicated.",
