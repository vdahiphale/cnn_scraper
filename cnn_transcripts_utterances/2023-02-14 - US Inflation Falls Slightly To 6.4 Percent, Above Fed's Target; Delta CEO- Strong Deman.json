And as you can see sharp losses, a bit of green and now paring those losses as the day moves on. I need to explain all with the markets and the main events of the day. US inflation is easing, but not as quickly as some had hoped, rates will go higher up. Delta's chief executive tonight, Ed Bastian, tells me prices are increasing every class of costs you can imagine, and so fares are, too. And the chief executive of Dubai Airports is here. DXP is crowned the world's busiest hub for international flights. There is a busy summer ahead. We are again live in Dubai where the clocks just struck midnight. For most of you though, it is still Tuesday, February the 14th, it is still Valentine's Day. I'm Richard Quest, spend your Valentine's Day with me as I mean business. Good evening tonight from Dubai, where it is Day Two of the World Government Summit, which has just wrapped up. Today, attendees heard from the UN Secretary-General, there was also the head of the World Health Organization, all of whom who spoke out on a glorious, if you will winter summer's day where the temperature was getting a bit toasty, but not too hot. Tesla's chief executive, Elon Musk will be here tomorrow. Back on Wall Street, there was only one story on everyone's mind, US inflation, which is slowing, but not fast enough and that seems to be the consensus on Wall Street. That dose of reality, as markets fell following the latest numbers this morning. CPI was up 6.4 on an annualized basis, in the 12 months to January, slightly lower than the previous month, and arguably higher than many economists had expected. And the reason of course, the concern, housing or shelter is one of the contributing issues. It is a so-called sticky categories, transport as well, and these sticky categories pose a particular problem for Central Banks. This graph, I want you to take a look, from the Atlanta Fed compares flexible prices, which react quickly to market conditions and sticky ones, which are slow to change. If you look at that graph, you see, the sticky inflation has not yet cooled off. Sticky inflation or entrenched inflation, embedded inflation, these are all words that the Central Bank really loathes and doesn't want to sing. Diane Swonk is the chief economist at KPMG. Diane is with me now. This is the worst scenario in a sense because you can get rid of the cyclical stuff, and you can lower a certain amount of transitory stuff, but the fear of Central Bankers is always sticky inflation, even wage inflation.",

That is a much harder battle. We have yet to hit the hardest mile of that marathon. And history is just littered with Central Banks who failed to cross the finish line on that and left for a more persistent and corrosive bout of inflation and that is something the Fed wants to avoid.",

I think what you're going to see is the Fed is really trying to hammer home the point of not just raising rates, but holding them there for much longer, so at least five and a quarter percent on short term rates, probably five and a half percent, if not a little bit higher than that. And through your end, because as inflation cools, that will further tighten financial conditions that real rates as we call them, will actually go up and that is what the Fed needs to see is more of a cooling economy. Of course, they'd rather not see a chill, but right now, we've got something like a simmering boil, which is still too hot, obviously for the Fed or for anyone else out there.",

And I think you know, what disinflation means in economics term is that inflation is coming down, it doesn't mean that we've won the battle. And that's what markets had heard was that the Fed had won the battle. And they might not even have to go as far as the Fed had thought, nor leave rates as high as long as the Fed had thought, when exactly the opposite was true, that this part of the marathon has yet to be run, and we have yet to hit that hardest now and we need to be able to get through it and cross the finish line.",

And we're at 3.4 percent unemployment rate today. That is terrific. That's great news. But if it erodes living standards over time, and causes a more sticky, a more prolonged inflation, that's not good news. And that's what the Fed is fighting against. And without other policies, like changes in immigration policy, more legal immigration, that's not going to be cured in any way. Also increases in productivity growth could help that, but it's not going to be cured without those other things. So I think it's very important to remember that the Fed has a very blunt tool, and that's hammering demand to meet a supply constrained world.",

There are cost pressures across every class of cost you could imagine, particularly commodity costs with fuel prices, still meaningfully above anything that we were dealing with pre pandemic. And as a result of that, we need to continue to be more efficient. We need to continue to ensure those costs of production make their way into pricing, and they do. At the present time, the demand has also been strong. So to some extent, they are connected.

The demand we are seeing here in the US is unlike anything I've ever seen in my 25 years in this business, and fares continue to be quite healthy because of that combined with the fact that it's also difficult relative to capacity, the OEM challenges of getting new planes, the training requirements to get pilot staff properly.
