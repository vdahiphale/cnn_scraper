CNN's special coverage continues with my colleague Rahel Solomon, up next.RAHEL SOLOMON, HOST, \"CNN NEWSROOM\": All right, Becky. Thank you. I'm Rahel Solomon live in New York. You are, of course, watching live pictures of the historic launch of Boeing's Starliner spacecraft from Cape Canaveral, Florida, successfully lifted off a short time ago at 10:52 Eastern Time with two veteran NASA astronauts on board. The crew now on their way to the International Space Station. With me now to discuss all of this is CNN Aerospace Analyst Miles O'Brien. Also with me now, former astronaut and retired Colonel Chris Hadfield. He is also the author of \"The Defector.\" Good to have you both, gentlemen. Colonel, let me start with you. Just your reaction to this moment. It is successful, third time. It's a charm, apparently. COL. CHRIS HADFIELD (RET.), FORMER ASTRONAUT, &amp; AUTHOR, \"THE DEFECTOR\": Well, it's not successful yet. The engines are still burning. I mean, it takes about 12 minutes to get to orbit and we're about eight minutes into that. But, so far, so good, and Suni and \"Butch\" are getting crushed in their seat as though big Centaurs are accelerating faster and faster. But, they've made it above the atmosphere. They got rid of that first stage. Everything is going perfectly so far. But, pretty soon, they'll be fast enough to stay in orbit, and then they can do that long 24-hour dance to go dock with the space station.",

Your reaction.MILES O'BRIEN, CNN AVIATION ANALYST: Well, it's -- this has been -- we've been waiting a long time for Starliner. There is no question. And it was -- got to the point of pretty embarrassing thing for Boeing, and Boeing, as a corporation, its other entities have had other reasons for embarrassment. This is a separate enterprise, its space program. But, nevertheless, some of the troubles it had getting this spacecraft to work right have left them a little red faced. And frankly, Elon Musk has pretty much lapped them as far as getting astronauts to the International Space Station. But, seeing is believing. We got to hedge our bets here. We are nine minutes into a 12-minute ride from zero to 20,000 kilometers per hour. They're feeling the force of three times gravity right now, not a big deal for these two Navy test pilots who've done 9Gs routinely in their previous parts of their career. But, once we get into orbit, it gets into sort of a symbiotic mode. We can breathe a little more easily. But, there are many steps ahead to make sure this is a viable way to get to the International Space Station. To say space is hard is kind of an understatement.",

They have orbited the world thousands of times. But, before they were astronauts, they were both test pilots in the U.S. Navy, Suni flying helicopters, \"Butch\" flying F-18s. That's a super dangerous and demanding job, and it's really excellent training for doing something like we've asked Suni and \"Butch\" to do today, which is they are the first two people to ever fly this rocket and the first two people to ever fly this spaceship. And that's a huge risk. The odds of dying during my first shuttle launch were one in 38. We don't even know what the odds are for this ship because it's its first flight. So, it's an enormous risk the two of them have shouldered on behalf of us all.And when you talk about the first, this is only the sixth new spaceship that can carry people that the United States has ever launched, starting way back with Mercury and leading right up now to Starliner. So, it's only happened six times in the whole history of the country that they've had a new human-rated spaceship, and it's the first time that -- just because of cultural shifting, first time that a woman has been part of the crew. But, Suni would be the first one to tell you that doesn't matter. What matters is getting the ship safely to orbit and then maneuvering it to go dock with the space station.",

It's not like to go take a course and then you fly a spaceship as a test pilot. It's the result of an entire life's work. Most of their training is for things going wrong. The engines have just shut off now. So, we'll check the numbers.[11:05:00] But, it looks like they're hopefully safely in orbit. But, most of an astronaut's life, and I served for 21 years as one of NASA's astronauts, most of your life is training for things to go wrong and be incompetent and ready enough with split seconds to be able to react to those things and make the vehicle do what it is that you want to do. So, they've been on the developmental side and in simulators and flying jets, and getting themselves to be the two most focused people in the world right now getting that vehicle into orbit.",

So, keep us honest here. But, talk to us a little bit about what happens next.O'BRIEN: Well, they're going to -- right now, now that we've had what's called nominal MECO, which is NASA parlance for everything is OK, main engine cut off. Very soon, if you -- as you look at the screen, there is a cartoonish-like animation, which offers up a fairly good rendition of what's happening in space right now, that long cylinder which is attached to the capsule, which is the Centaur second stage will be jettisoned. It did the final push -- well, actually, there is one more push to orbit with some of the rockets that are actually on board the Starliner. But, ultimately, there'll be a -- that will be jettisoned. There'll be one more burn and it will, as we say, circularize the orbit. So then there'll be just what amounts to a freefall around the planet, which puts them in weightlessness, the one buckle, relax a little bit, and take a few ganders at the Earth beneath them, and then they have about a 24-hour ride to catch up to the space station. It's not unlike, Rahel, kind of an American football player throwing a pass. As they launch, the International Space Station has to be right above them. So, you kind of leave the station with the rocket and hopefully the two of them arrive at the same place at the same time. And that's why the launch windows are what they call instantaneous. They have to launch at that moment or they have to wait another 24 hours, give or take.",

Hezbollah and Israel have exchanged cross-border fire almost daily since the war began. As Israel threatens open a new front, it is intensifying attacks on central Gaza. Health workers there say at least 65 people were killed in Israeli strikes overnight, including women, including children.

There is no sense yet that there is any kind of imminent breakthrough. But, we have seen them, of course, pop up in the region at key moments in these negotiations in the past.The key question right now is not only, of course, to see what Hamas' response will be, but also to see whether the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sticks with the proposal that his own government put forward, in particular, because of some of the people we're seeing behind me here, these types of Israeli nationalists, like Itamar Ben- Gvir, the National Security Minister, is a member of the government who is marching in this parade, very much opposed to a ceasefire deal, very much opposed to a deal that could potentially result in the end of the war in Gaza, because they want to see this notion of absolute victory over Hamas before the war ends, and they very much do not see that at the moment.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE (Interpreted): The problem is Gazans who were brought in are labeled as terrorists and it is very popular opinion over here that terrorists deserve to die, so they do not deserve the same medical care as everyone else. CHANCE (voice-over): Satellite imagery obtained by CNN shows how the Sde Teiman facility was expanded after the October 7 attacks, with detention facilities and makeshift medical bays being added after public hospitals in Israel refused to treat injured Gazan suspects. Eyewitness accounts describe a field hospital with 15 to 20 patients virtually naked and blindfolded, with hands and feet shackled to their beds and wearing diapers. One eyewitness told CNN, painful procedures were carried out by underqualified medics, treatment, the medical worker told us, amounts to punishment. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Beyond that speech he'll be making at the cemetery, there will be this time, unlike five years ago, the 75th anniversary, a big ceremony to be held as well on the beach itself over at Omaha Beach where of course the Americans lost so many men in the first few hours of the sixth of June 1944.

There is a possibility that this could be shut off if, for instance, officials say if those daily encounters get to a number that's averaging below 1,500 a day.But, yesterday, as President Biden announced this at the White House, he was joined by Democratic lawmakers, including some mayors who represent cities along the U.S. southern border, as well as Democratic lawmakers like Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, a key battleground state. That also happens to be a border state. Those Democrats offered their support for the President's plan. But, within the President's party, there is also a lot of frustration from progressive Democrats who say that Biden is simply borrowing a page out of former President Donald Trump's playbook. It's noteworthy that the President is tapping into an authority that Trump tried to use when he was President back in 2018, something that was decried by Democrats at the time, and ultimately was struck down in the courts.

The detainees were accused of offenses like disorderly conduct, shouting slogans, and assaulting police. It is no longer safe to commemorate Tiananmen Square in Hong Kong. The Chinese authorities have tried to scrub their violent 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy protesters from record. And an Italian court has upheld the slander conviction of American Amanda Knox.

The past 12 months, they say, have averaged more than 1.6 degrees Celsius above the pre- industrial average.

North -- northern hemisphere hotter than it's ever been since the birth of Christ 2,000 years ago. And so, the Secretary-General using the American Museum of Natural History as a backdrop, dinosaurs as a backdrop to talk about extinction level events that we are on a highway to hell, as he calls it, with the godfathers of the climate crisis. That is the CEOs and heads of oil and gas and petro states have their feet on the gas. And what we're experiencing in terms of just violent weather events is just the opening attraction.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WEIR (voice-over): Across the American heartland came a conga line of devastating tornadoes. deadly flooding from Brazil to Germany, a true drought that has millions rationing water in Mexico City, and temperatures close to 122 degrees in India, enough to kill at least 33 poll workers on the same day in recent national elections, all are snapshots from a planet overheated by human activity, where monthly heat records have been shattered for the last 12 months in a row.",

OF INSTITUTE FOR ENVIRONMENT AND SOCIETY, BROWN UNIVERSITY: I mean, they'll -- this is just a dizzying rate of change that we're experiencing right now. But, in the near future, 2023 will register as a normal year, whereas, in fact, if you look at those graphs, all you can see is a vertical line shooting upward from the very recent warmest years on record. So, really just a record-smashing year in 2023. ANTONIO GUTERRES, U.N. SECRETARY-GENERAL: Let me be very clear again, the phase-out of fossil fuels is essential and inevitable. No amount of spin or scare tactics will change that. Let's hope it doesn't come too late. WEIR (voice-over): Well, the head of the United Nations has been railing against polluters and petro states for years. He is using this report to plead with world leaders to cut dirty fuels faster than ever, to kick in more for unfair loss and damage in developing countries, and to ban all advertising from oil, gas and coal companies.",

So, these actions, as you say, to treat fossil fuel adverts, as if it would be we treat banning conversations around tobacco or at least warning signs, if you do smoke, these are the consequences. We need to get, I think, more savvy to do that around greenhouse gas emissions as well.WEIR (voice-over): To avoid the worst, scientists say global emissions must fall nine percent a year until 2030. And while they still went up last year, it was only by one percent, thanks to a boom and clean wind and sun power, a sign that humanity could finally be on the verge of bending the carbon curve.",

So, in fact, we are predicted to have peak fossil fuel emissions within the next year or two, which is something I frankly never saw coming even five years ago. So, that's real progress, and I think people need to really appreciate that.(END VIDEO CLIP)",

And the idea that we could finally stop making it bigger in the next couple of years, very much excites scientists. But, the question is, how much of a diet can we put that Godzilla on? How much can we starve it? Can we chop it up and bury some of it underground? And the companies that have become the richest in human history by making that Godzilla bigger, maybe stop giving them billions of dollars in subsidies from taxpayers and may be shift it to the companies that make energy and don't make carbon Godzilla bigger.Just some of the demands being kicked around here today. The Secretary-General very fiery in years past, fallen on deaf ears, from the big oil companies, Rahel. But, we'll see. The bigger Godzilla gets, the hotter we get.

      "sentences": "Well, Rahel, tomorrow's speech by Janet Yellen will be her most extensive remarks to date on artificial intelligence, and these remarks come as AI is evolving at warp speed. Investors and Wall Street firms are embracing AI. Tech companies are scrambling to try to come up with the biggest and most impressive AI tools. And regulators like Yellen, they're just trying to catch up.And so, Yellen plans to say that, yes, AI does open the door to some significant opportunities. But, she says there is also significant risks when it comes to AI in the financial sector. She is going to lay out some of her major concerns, including the risk around the fact that these are really black boxes, right? We don't actually understand how AI tools work. And that means it's almost impossible to understand how safe they are and how safe they'd be when they get introduced to the financial system. There is also this concern over how some of these AI models they can churn out biased results, that can obviously be problematic when it comes to financial decision-making. Imagine getting denied a loan because a robot doesn't like the color of your skin or wet zip code you have. One interesting thing is that the speech does not appear to lay out any sort of concerns around the fact that some of these AI models, they can make stuff up. It's a problem known as hallucination. It's something that's gotten some lawyers in trouble because they've cited case law that they got from AI chatbots, and it turns out that that case law did not exist. Now, earlier, this was about six months ago, U.S. regulators, they actually formally identified AI as an emerging vulnerability in the financial sector. Tomorrow, Janet Yellen plans to say that AI has moved to the top of the to-do list for financial regulators. Well, look, she does plan to lay out some of the positives around AI, some of the opportunities, talk about how it's already being used in forecasting. It's being used to fight financial fraud and power customer support. And then in the future, it could actually help make financing and investing and banking cheaper and easier to access. A Treasury official told me that Janet Yellen herself has experimented with some of these AI chatbots. We know the IRS has used AI to try to fight against tax cheating. Treasury is using AI to try to fight financial crime. And tomorrow, Yellen plans to say for the first time that U.S. officials are working with the private sector on how AI can be used to fight sanctions evasion and even terror financing. Rahel.",
