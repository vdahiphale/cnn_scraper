A man asked Mike Pence, the former vice president of the United States, who upheld the Constitution on January 6th last year, he asked Mike Pence, why did you commit treason on January 6th? That was the question to Mike Pence. There were some boos from the crowd. We have video of the moment, but really only the response. This is what Pence said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MIKE PENCE (R), FORMER U.S. VICE PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: There's almost no idea more un-American than the notion that any one person could pick the American president. I mean, the American presidency belongs to the American people and the American people alone. People deserve to know that on that day the former president asked me to choose him over my oath to the Constitution. I chose the Constitution. And I always will. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And it's actually been fascinating to observe Mike Pence ever since the January 6th indictment against Donald Trump became official because I feel like obviously this question of January 6th and the former vice president's actions that days, this is something that he had talked about on the campaign trail. But since the indictment came, I feel like Pence has really leaned into this and his role and how he was doing the right thing that day. He's really leaned into that so much more as it's become such a more public focus.I remember his campaign just last week released those t-shirts that said he is too honest, obviously referring to the former president's comments about Pence's actions that day. And certainly he's going to continue to get questions like these as he's out on the campaign trail. Which is why that big question of whether Donald Trump is going to participate in that Republican debate in the next couple of weeks -- in less than two weeks is a really important question because Pence has made that debate stage and, obviously, that looming question of January 6th, the election, the continued election denialism from Donald Trump and just sort of all of the questions and all of the politics surrounding that day is going to be such a more focal point if Donald Trump and Pence are both there.",
