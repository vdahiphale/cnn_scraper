And, you know, theNTSB lead investigator said yesterday that, you know, we also are aware of the ship's lights flickering shortly before impact, indicative of a power failure. And, of course, there was that Mayday call to officials on or near the bridge from crew members on the ship saying, we've had a power failure. We think we're going to crash into the bridge. But the NTSB is saying, look, we know all this, but we still have to confirm it. And so, that's one of the key things that this black box or the voyage data recorder, as it's called on ships, will be able to do. Zain, the other big thing that investigators with the NTSB are doing today is interviewing the people who were on board that ship when it slammed into the key bridge. That, too, will be a really key indicator and will hopefully fill in some key holes about what exactly happened. So, there is the ongoing investigation. There's also the investigation into the structural integrity of the bridge itself, even though the governor of Maryland said yesterday that it was up to code. NTSB says they're still going to investigate that. So, you have all of these investigations. But to be very clear, Zain, the top priority right now is still a recovery operation. We've moved from the rescue, the search and rescue phase, into the recovery operation, which means that the Coast Guard and other officials are presumably, they believe that these six individuals have now tragically died. And so, they're searching for their bodies in the water. And that effort has been complicated today by the fact that the weather is not nearly as good as it was yesterday. They're dealing with choppy waters, very windy conditions, and also quite a bit of rain. And then, as you can see on the right-hand side of your screen, just all of that mangled metal that's in the water, divers are having to dodge that, as well. So, yes, you have this investigation, multiple investigations ongoing. But at the moment, the focus at the scene continues to be on finding those six construction workers who were just trying to repair some potholes on the bridge when that container ship struck around 1:30 A.M.

Airtemperature here today is a little bit warmer, but we, as was previously reported, the winds have begun to increase and we just had a heavy band of rain move through. So, we have really dynamic weather conditions that our divers are up against. The other challenges that we have is once our divers go subsurface. So, once they go below the surface of the water, with increased depth comes decreased visibility. And, you know, that's an equation that we deal with all the time, especially in this type of an environment. But now we add to that equation, just the massive amounts of debris that are below the surface. You know, I had said earlier, what a lot of viewers see is above the surface is the same kind of challenges that our divers have to deal below the surface. The difference being our divers can't always see those obstacles. So, we have to be very slow and methodical and above all else, safe. We're using different sonar technologies to help guide our operation.

We're talking about the biggest vehicle handling port in the country that is now out of commission until that channel can be cleared and a bridge that took five years to build.

They could be temporarily laid off. And Baltimore is one of the busiest ports in the nation. It's the number one port when it comes to sugar imports. It's number two for exporting coal. It's also a leading port for farm and construction machinery -- machinery imports and then autos. That's huge. Eight hundred and fifty thousand vehicles last year alone went through this port. And we're hearing from some major companies that are saying they're at least monitoring what's going on. They're going through some contingency planning. Auto companies like GM and Stellantis, Ford. We know that Under Armor, Amazon, they all have a presence there. And Carnival Cruise, they're moving some of their cruise ships to Virginia. And then Domino Sugar is another big one. They have a refinery, a sugarcane refinery in the Baltimore Harbor. It's really a landmark there, but it's also the biggest sugarcane refinery in the Western Hemisphere.

The fact that his homes were raided in this way, the fact that Diddy was briefly interviewed, I guess, at the airport when he was about to board his private plane, the fact that his two sons were briefly again not arrested but detained outside his home, as well.

She alleged that he brutalized her, that he often would kick and hit her and that he actually did sexually assault her. So, those are the allegations -- the serious allegations in her civil complaint. She said that she was groomed, that he, you know, lured her in, gave her alcohol and drugs. And then following that complaint from Cassie, there was another complaint by an anonymous woman who said that she was sex trafficked at the age of 17, that she was lured to his home to have sex with other men, that she was given drugs and alcohol. And we just see this same pattern being repeated in multiple complaints. And the most recent one is from a male producer who said he worked with Sean Combs as recently as July of 2023. He recently amended his complaint to say not only did Sean Combs sexually assault him, but that Cuba Gooding Jr. also touched him, groped him and sexually assaulted him on a yacht that's owned by Sean Combs. That complaint by this male producer also alleges that Sean Combs and his son perhaps were involved in a shooting where another individual was shot by one of them, Sean Combs or his son. And there was a cover up of that shooting. So, there again in these four complaints that have been filed to date, very salacious and just horrifying allegations of sexual assault, rape and underage girls.

Seemingly powerless in the face of Israel that's accused of using starvation as a weapon in this war, a charge it denies, forcing the International Community to resort to dropping aid from the sky. Several countries carried out aid drops on this day, deliveries that have been criticized for being ineffective, insufficient and unsafe. Earlier this month, another airdrop disaster when a parachute failed and aid packages came crashing down, killing at least five people. It's a war that's testing humanity, and many say this is what failure looks like. Jomana Karadsheh, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE) (COMMERCIAL BREAK)",

      "sentences": "What is unique about the township market is that it is a very vibrant market filled with people whoare doing amazing things with very, very little means. It is a very young market that is growing very quickly. And for me, it is actually the engine of the South African economy. We built our technology and our solutions around what the market needs. I believe that this is the future of the continent. My name is Jessica Boonstra and I'm the founder and CEO of Yebo Fresh. Yebo Fresh is a business-to-business marketplace operating in South Africa's townships. Yebo Fresh started about five years ago, literally in my garage. And it was born from the observation that on one hand, the township market is absolutely massive and growing faster than the formal market. On the other hand, it's still severely underserved from an e-commerce perspective, with many parties thinking that it is too poor, too dangerous and too difficult to operate in. So, the problem that we're solving is that of a typical business owner like Zuzi having to close her shop and travel to a wholesaler, spending many hours shopping and then having to negotiate a deal with the driver, taking her back with her goods. Instead, we offer a simple order-to-delivery solution that allows her to place her order via WhatsApp and get her goods delivered 24 hours later. We've seen bursts of tremendous growth, so starting from literally a garage setup with three, four people to where we are now today, a fantastic team of about 50 people. We operate in 25 townships and we serve about 8000 business owners. So, that, for me, is a testimony that there is a market for what we're doing. There's demand for what we're doing and we want to be growing much faster in the future. We want to be the leading business-to-business marketplace in Greater Sub- Saharan Africa. What we're doing in South Africa, the problem that we're solving here, also exists in Botswana, Namibia and many, many of our neighboring countries. And there's a massive, massive gap in service delivery there, as well. So, we have got ambitions to take our concept across the borders and into many, many more areas. And most importantly, we see that this digital revolution is happening right now and that the pull is there from the market and we want to be the ones to give that revolution a little push.

      "sentences": "Well, one result is that, again, global warming has caused a massive amount of melting of ice fromGreenland and Alaska that spreads out over the whole ocean and that changes the rotation rate of the Earth. It slows it down. Now, the Earth in general has been speeding up because of other effects, and that would cause us to have to have what's called a negative leap second, which has never happened before. If we had not had this ice melt, then we'd be very close to the leap second. As it is, we're further away. I don't want to argue that this is a positive effect of global warming. The negative effects are so massive that this is just a small change. But I think it's surprising and interesting that the signal we're seeing is unprecedented and simply says global warming is unprecedented and is affecting not just certain things, but the entire Earth, the whole rotation of the Earth.",

We've had many of these where there have been 61 seconds. The problem is each time that it becomes more and more difficult to make sure that all computer networks are properly synchronized, that everybody does this correctly and at the same time. And since we've never had a negative leap second before, there's a lot of concern that it would not be done properly. Now, a second doesn't sound like much, but for the financial markets, they time things to a fiftieth of a second. Lots of things depend on very precise timing. And so, there's concern about the possibility of a negative leap second. And I think there is a good possibility that there will be one.",
