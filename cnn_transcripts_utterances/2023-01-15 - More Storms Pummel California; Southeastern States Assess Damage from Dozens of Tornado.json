How unusual and historic is what we're seeing in California now? J. DAVID NEELIN, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA/LOS ANGELES:  I'll give you one hand and on the other hand. California always gets big swings and extremes, always has. There was a huge flood in 1862 that swamped most of Sacramento. And the lake in Los Angeles was about 10 miles long instead of 100 miles long. We get all our rain in relatively few storms per year. So if the track of those storms coming across the Pacific swings a little to the north and hits Seattle, Oregon, we get less rain. If it swings south and hits us straight on, we get a lot more rain. So we've always had extremes. That being said, our extremes are gradually getting worse and that is substantially due to climate change.",

But explain to us -- we're seeing the drought map right now and how that has sort of been changed by all of this rain.But is there also that link between this opposite phenomenon, the extreme wet conditions and climate change? And how is that paradox possible? NEELIN:  Yes, the increase in droughts and the increase in extreme precipitation are linked to each other. The basic aspect is, warmer air can hold more moisture. And when you come to a strong storm, the circulation is bringing the moisture in. It holds about as much as it can. It holds more so there's more available to rain out in the storm's circulation. At the same time, you have to have a balance with the amount of water that's evaporated and with the global energy balance. So if you're raining more intensely in some spots, you're going to have longer between rain storms in other spots and in other times. And that, when you talk about longer times between storms, that means more inclination to drought from precipitation side. And at the same time, your land is warmer and it's losing water faster. So that contributes to drought in a very substantial way as well.",

My group and Alex Hall's (ph) group at UCLA were working on this.We were looking for a term that would convey the switch between extremes. At that time, we had moved from a drought to a situation where the orahole (ph) down had recently had a major spillway incident in large rain. And whiplash seemed to be the right term to capture just how strong this switch between extremes is. So not everywhere will get the same amount of whiplash. If you are further north in Seattle, for instance, the increases in rain tend to predominate the droughts, you know, the tendency to drought is there but not as bad as in California. If you go down to Mexico, Central America, the tendency to drought can be even stronger in that region. So it will vary from one place to another in the world. But the basic thing, warmer temperatures, more water vapor, greater swings between strong rains and longer periods between them, stronger evaporation losing water from the soil, leading to drought, that will be quite widespread in many parts of the world.",

Officials found more documents with classification markings in Delaware. Sources say none were marked top secret. CNN's Evan Perez has more on what was found and how the White House is reacting. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) EVAN PEREZ, CNN SR. JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT:  Lawyers for President Biden say they turned up another five pages of classified documents during a search of his home this week. That's the second time in two days that the White House has had to correct what it says was incomplete information about the number of documents that it has found in searches of a number of locations associated with the president. Altogether, we're talking about 20 classified records that the Biden team has found and turned over to the Justice Department. The shifting story line has created a major political and legal headache for the president, who is now the subject of an investigation by a special counsel ,appointed in recent days by attorney general Merrick Garland. This all began with the discovery of government records, including 10 classified documents from the Obama era at a private office in Washington that Biden used during the presidency of Donald Trump. The second set of classified documents was found at Biden's home in Wilmington, Delaware, on December 20th. But the White House didn't disclose any of this until just this week. And even then they told a misleading story, only mentioning the initial set of 10 documents. The president's lawyer, Bob Bauer, issued a statement. He said that Team Biden has tried to be forthcoming and cooperative. He said, \"The president's personal attorneys have attempted to balance the importance of public transparency, where appropriate, and the established norms and limitations necessary to protect the investigation's integrity.\" We should note that the Justice Department didn't prohibit the White House from disclosing everything that the president's team has turned over. We don't know the level of classification of the latest records found. We do know that among the initial batch of 10 were documents that were marked \"TS/SCI,\" sensitive compartmented information. These are among the most sensitive government secrets, which raise concerns about the exposure of sources and methods. One of the questions that the new special counsel, Robert Hur, will have, are there any more documents out there that have not been accounted for? -- Evan Perez, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
