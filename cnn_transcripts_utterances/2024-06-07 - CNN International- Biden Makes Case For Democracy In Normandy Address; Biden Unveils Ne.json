So, Biden is, of course, coming to speak in a very particular domestic context. But, it is also happening in a very specific context with regard to events in Ukraine.Remember that it is because of the pressure being felt on the Ukrainian frontlines increasingly over the course of the last month that there is this reaffirmation of Western support that's been coming, not just in the shape of bilateral deals of additional pledges of aid that had been given these last couple of weeks, Ukraine will continue, have continued again without latest American offer this morning, pledge, rather, this morning of $225 million and the additional French pledge of their Mirage fighter jets. It is also about how the allies can help more. And one of the things that we're looking ahead to here is how far President Macron will go when he meets with President Zelenskyy tonight and speaking to the idea of not boots on the ground that might do some of the fighting, I'm speaking about Western boots, but for instance, trainers that can be there helping Ukrainian forces better to fight. That's one of those red lines that President Macron has been calling for more courage from Western allies.

It's a very clear reference. It appears to Donald Trump.So, I think there was an appeal there as well, obviously, to a younger generation to cast themselves and see themselves following in the footsteps of these Veterans who are willing to sacrifice everything for the ideals that they live by, democracy, its freedoms, and the fact that those don't come for free. And we're reaching a point in history where a price may need to be paid again. So, while that would be very warming for allies to hear an American President espousing that, I think they will recognize the fact that four months out, three months out or so, from the U.S. election that the President needs to make this sort of speech from foreign soil, if you will, of the closeness of the race, and what's at stake, and President Macron and his ideas about how better to support Ukrainian forces. All of these resonate at the moment these days. They focus minds. I mean, President Macron may be one of the leaders who is carrying a lot of weight in supporting Ukraine this time next year. And he will be aware of that and the divisions in Europe that he will be trying to bridge and keep together. So, there will be things in there. I mean, President Biden spoke about, can you imagine America that isn't a beacon of these values for democracy? And unfortunately, for some listening in Europe, they are having to contemplate imagining that at the moment they don't want to. They expect that they will have a good relationship with the United States, but they are concerned about the policies if President -- if Donald Trump becomes President again.",

But, I think Biden is absolutely right, because I think we've done a lot of good for Ukraine by supporting Ukraine in its fight for freedom. But, unfortunately, that six months delay that Ambassador Bill Taylor was talking about had a catastrophic impact in Ukraine. It cost a lot of lives. And more recently, it's allowed the Russians to devastate the Ukrainian electrical infrastructure such that a lot of Ukraine is now plunged into darkness. They don't have power for a good portion of the day. That's the direct consequence of not having air defenses. And the reason they don't have the air defenses they needed because we stopped providing the ammunition. So, I think that the cost of that Republican delay in Congress was very heavy.

But then, of course, here in Normandy, what it was, we were commemorating Lent itself, given the framing of it by the American presidents, specifically, very clearly to the message that President Zelenskyy has been hoping to drive home now for a long time.In fact, that's what we heard him say when he stood between -- before French lawmakers earlier, very clearly drawing the parallel between Hitler and Putin and the fight for freedom at the time, and that of his people. Now, beyond those pledges of support, and there is the mention that you make of the French fighter jets that are -- he'll be able to add to his arsenal, specifically his air defenses that he has been seeking to strengthen for so long, but there is also the manner in which the West is able to help Ukraine. It is at the back foot on which Ukrainian soldiers find themselves in that northeastern front opened up by Moscow last month in Kharkiv, the pressure that the civilians are coming under. That is the important backdrop to President Zelenskyy's ever more urgent pleas, not just for more help, but for better help, for foster help, for getting the right equipment to the right pace is better than has been achieved over the last couple of years. And of course, for more leeway in how he conducts his defense of this country. We saw Western allies one after the other, and most significantly, the United States, announced that they were allowing -- giving the green light to keep long hauls for, finally given that they could use Western weapons on Russian targets that had been firing towards Ukraine. One of the key things that could come out tonight is much more on what has been a very fringe push so far, that allies of Ukraine look at other more imaginative, more creative. That's the word the President Macron uses over and over again, ways of helping Ukraine at this difficult time and potential turning point in his defense against Moscow truth. And that is the ability, something the French have been negotiating with Ukrainians the possibility that they might send trainers, military personnel who would be sent on the ground in Ukraine to train Ukrainian troops. The French are looking at creating what they call a French battalion, and these would be Ukrainian soldiers trained by the French, 450,000 of them, that would, it is believed by the French, be able then to use their Western weapons more effectively, and fight for the defense of their country more efficiently. That is, of course, extremely controversial, as we saw when it was first raised by Macron, the hackles raised, not these (inaudible) allies.

The defense is trying to poke some holes in what happened at that store with the paperwork. The paperwork is very important because after all, he is accused of lying on that form about his drug use. But, the bigger names that everybody is anticipating would be Hunter'sdaughter Naomi, and his Uncle James Biden, which would be the brother of President Joe Biden. The defense is expected to bring them in as witnesses. Not exactly clear when that's going to happen. But, that's part of their effort to rebut a lot of the previous testimony from some of Hunter's exes that he was rampantly abusing drugs around the time and the months surrounding when he bought that gun. The lead defense attorney, Abbe Lowell, said in his opening statements that Uncle Jimmy, as he called him, was a big part of Hunter's support system and even paid for some of his treatment around the time of that gun purchase, trying to give the idea to the jurors that maybe he wasn't using crack cocaine at that moment, maybe he was trying to move himself towards sobriety, because so much of this case, Rahel, turns on the question of whether he was a user of drugs or addicted to drugs at that time. So, the defense case is underway here, and they are hearing from the gun store employee now, but still waiting for those big names from the Biden family.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Rahel. Any minute now, we could see Mark Meadows appear virtually before a judge in Phoenix, Arizona, for the first time since he was indicted back in April for his alleged role in this conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election results in that state and in six others. This deals with his alleged role in the fake electors plot, trying to organize those electors from the six battleground states and have them sign those certificates that were falsely claiming that Donald Trump won those states, when he did not.So, Mark Meadows today is going to make that first appearance in which will be read the criminal charges that he faces, and that includes multiple felonies, one kind of a felony conspiracy of felony fraudulent schemes charges and multiple felony forgery charges as well. So, the penalty and the stakes for Mark Meadows on these state level charges is very high. But, look, this is just the latest court appearance from Mark Meadows. As you know, he was charged in Georgia on state level crimes there for his alleged role in trying to overturn the 2020 election and he is just the latest Trump ally to appear in court in Arizona. Also today, Mark -- Mike Roman, as you mentioned, a former Trump campaign official, he will similarly make his first appearance before an Arizona judge. And look, just like any other criminal defendant in the state of Arizona, we do expect at some point Mark Meadows, Mike Roman, and all the co-defendants in this case do have their fingerprints taken and a mugshot taken, similar to what we saw in Georgia. And you mentioned too that Donald Trump is not charged in this case. And that's correct, but he is clearly identified as unindicted co-conspirator number one in the charging document, which is interesting, because we've been told repeatedly, this investigation remains ongoing.",

Turning to the economy, there was a big question among investors at this hour. Will the Federal Reserve rate cuts, will they have to wait? I think most people think, yes. That's because U.S. s job growth shot higher in May, jumping to 272,000. That is a lot more than Wall Street economists were expecting, and it could make fighting inflation even trickier for the Fed. But, it's not all about that hot headline number, because we also saw a big drop in household employment with the jobless rate also rising to four percent. That's the first time that has happened in more than two years. Joining us now to break all this down from New York is Matt Egan. Matt, there is a lot here. Right? You got the household survey which shows that job growth is actually contracting. You have the establishment survey that shows job growth is actually accelerating. What do you make out of this report?",

      "sentences": "Yeah. I like that too from Bank of America. The labor market is cooling but it is not exactly cool. Matt, can we just for a moment explain a little bit about the relationship between -- can we explain the relationship between interest rate cuts and the economy? I mean, just the idea that a cut would, if you can hear me, Matt, stimulate economic growth, it might stimulate economic spending at a time when the Fed is actually trying to cool spending. Could you could connect that dot for us and the audience, please?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, absolutely. I mean, the Fed slammed the brakes on this economy, trying to get inflation under control, right? And inflation does seem like it's in a much better place than it was two years ago. The idea was, if you make it more expensive to borrow, harder to get a mortgage, a car loan, to pay off credit card debt, that's going to slow the economy down. And to some extent, it did. I think the problem for the Fed is inflation is supposed to be at like two percent, and we're more like three percent. So, the problem would be, if they cut interest rates now, that's just going to encourage people to borrow more, right? That means they're going to finance the purchase of that car, get a mortgage, maybe spend some more on their credit card. And that would, of course, increase demand, and could actually push inflation even higher.So, they're just in this delicate balance where they don't want to cut interest rates too soon because that could make inflation worse. But, they also don't want to wait so long that unemployment goes maybe from four percent to 4.5 percent or five percent. So, they're trying to get it just right. But, it seems like the idea of an interest rate cut this summer is unlikely, and even in the fall, it's looking less likely. I mean, who knows, Rahel. Maybe this is something that doesn't happen until 2025.",
