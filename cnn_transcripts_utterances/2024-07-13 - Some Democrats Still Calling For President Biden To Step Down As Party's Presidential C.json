Washington and the political world still wondering, who will Donald Trump pick as his V.P.? And check it out -- Targets new policy which does not make me happy. The panel is here and ready to go.

I just don't feel that same urgency, that same unity as I did back in 1968. LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, \"NEW YORK TIMES\" JOURNALIST AND PODCAST HOST: There is no unity.

You're also seeing a really interesting ideological cleavage. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is making no bones about being very supportive of President Biden. If you look at Ilhan Omar, she's being very, very clear. She is not equivocating. She's not playing footsie with the idea of booting Biden from office. It's really striking to see who is advantaged by where Biden is right now and where the Democratic Party is right now and who is disadvantaged by that. If you look at 2028 contenders, Wes Moore, the very charismatic new governor of Maryland, he's out there campaigning with Joe Biden. Gavin Newsom is nowhere near the idea that he is going to be the white knight who is going to save Democrats. I think a lot of folks have decided that they would rather have Donald Trump back in the White House, Democrats romped in 2026, and then a lot of these folks believe, hey, wait a second, I'm going to have a clear shot at the presidency myself in 2028, including folks on the left.

Well, it turns out that she has been pretty absent in this round of her husband campaigning, but she will actually be appearing at the GOP convention. It's not really clear she's going to have a speaking role, but she is going to show that they are still married, and she might perhaps still be willing, although that's unclear, to be the first lady if indeed he wins.",

Now, this seems pretty big of him, pretty magnanimous of President Trump. This is very much his show, right? And the fact that he had someone who was hated rival is a big deal. But he hasn't invited former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley for a speaking slot. I think it would be a really, really big show of party unity and strength were he to have her speak. Nikki Haley has released her delegates and encouraged them to actually back Trump this time around. I think that he should reciprocate.",

I think it's a heinous thing for a presidential candidate to threaten someone, and you know I'm critic of Mark Zuckerberg.
