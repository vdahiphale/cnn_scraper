If the deal wasn't reached in this kind of time window right now, entire seasons were going to be lost, productions were going to be lost. How quickly do things get back up and running? Do you just snap the fingers and go or is there a process here?CRABTREE-IRELAND: Well, I wish it were that simple. It's not quite snap the fingers and go. But I do know that the studio and streamers have already brought back some of the crew and other people who had to be involved in pre-production activities. So, there are some projects that will start up fairly quickly. But there are also others that have a longer runway. But the fact is, starting immediately, starting now, everyone can get back to work and the prep process for those projects can begin. So, I think, as a consumer myself, and like you, we can all be excited to know that our favorite content is probably on its way back as soon as possible.",
