His name is Gary Farro. Gary Farro is a banker who worked with Michael Cohen at the time that the payments were made to former Playboy model, Karen McDougal, and porn actress and director Stormy Daniels, both of whom alleged romantic entanglements of sorts with Mr. Donald Trump. This comes after Rhona Graff was called as the second witness in the trial. Rhona Graff, she's on the screen right there. She's a longtime Trump assistance. She worked for Trump since he hired her in 1987 after she called calls to Trump Organization. Rhona Graff testified two contacts she maintained at the Trump Organization were for Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels. Rhona Graff was on the stand for less than half an hour. Earlier today, Trump's attorneys cross-examined David Pecker, the former tabloid magnate and longtime friend of Donald Trump. Let's dive into all of this with my panel. So, Jamie, put Rhona Graff into context for us. A lot of people who know Trump world were excited about this testimony. She was a vice president for the firm. She was a very important player in his world. She testified today and very -- testified very briefly. JAMIE GANGEL, CNN SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT:  Right. So, loyal trustee, gatekeeper for those of us going back, who wanted to interview Donald Trump. That's who you call. She was -- she knew everything was going on --",

Or there were meetings where there were contexts. It's also smart for the defense at this point to keep it dull, to basically not spend any time cross- examining people, where you have no real reason to gain anything because they're not establishing criminality, or they're not establishing controversial points.

So that's all going to speak to some of the elements that tie this payment directly to the election. Now the other pieces, every single document and communication and transaction relating to this payment is obviously a key and critical part of the case. And to have these shell companies, this is all speaking to that idea of a conspiracy trying to mask these payments as something that there not. And remember, that is a fundamental part of the prosecutions case as far as this all being unlawful conduct because the payments themselves aren't unlawful.

It's probably just the DNA that I have being a defense lawyer. You know, you have to remember that the defense here is likely to be and I think we've seen a preview. Is that payments if they were made and if they were made to these individuals, Ms. Clifford and Ms. McDougal, they were paid to avoid a very embarrassing and shameful scenario that the defendant will encounter with his wife and family and that that sells to people. And I think that when you look at -- I wasn't in court today. I just know what I've read and what I've heard from you guys, but when you think about this prosecution, they have to get it to the other crime, to make the felony stick, they have to show that if these things were done, they weren't to avoid personal problems. We were to affect either campaign finance laws or the election. And I thought I read or heard that Mr. Pecker stumbled into some type of meeting in the White House where Director Comey and Secretary Pompeo were there and the prosecution seems to be saying, well, you're in the meeting with two big officials. I mean, that doesn't make him a coconspirator that makes some Forrest Gump. I mean, the guy stumbling around and walks into a meeting, that's proof of nothing. So I don't know that Pecker's testimony was that damaging so far. I suspect they'll fill in the gaps or attempt to fill them in with Cohen.

Jake, I was just thinking about the gag order and creative ways that Trump has found a way around it because we do expect him to speak after court really, possibly in a matter of minutes. We always currently subject to an expanded gag order where he can't -- as most defendants cannot attack witnesses, attack members of the jury. Now it's been expanded to include prosecutors and family members of the judge.Now, I'm also monitoring side stream while I'm talking to you. They're still talking about setting up that LLC. I agree with you, Jake, not the most exciting thing we've seen throughout the trial. But Trump has tried to find ways of working around this gag order because he according to prosecutors, just blatantly violated it multiple times, particularly going after Cohen. He's trying some workarounds like quoting other people, including a Fox News host to raise questions about the jury. He's also come out. We've seen him a few times at the end of court with a stack of articles and quoted attacks on people he's not supposed to directly attack. Now what was clear from the hearing earlier this week on a gag order that that is probably going to be a violation, something we saw this morning for the first time was him pointing to his allies on the Hill, GOP allies who are now making many these arguments for him. Now, again, I'm looking down at the side stream. Mr. Farro is just talking about the urgency that Michael Cohen had while he was setting up this LLC. But its going to be really interesting to watch as Trump comes out of court, if he continues this tactic because he cannot directly the attack people like for example, Matthew Colangelo, one of the prosecutors here, who formerly worked the Biden Justice Department, it appears that now instead he's having folks on the Hill do that, and then he and his allies will point to their reports, or their remarks. I'm also curious to see prosecutors reaction to this. So that's definitely want him to watch for in a couple of minutes when Trump addresses the press.",

And we sit here day after day after day, which is their plan because they think they might be able to eke out an election. But I got it, as the poll numbers are very good for us. I just want to say that I've invited Biden to debate. He can do it anytime he wants, including tonight. I'm ready. Here we are, find it up to the courthouse that he has tied up in, his administration. This is all being done through Washington. It's all -- it's a well-coordinated attack on a political opponent. But I'm here, I'm ready, willing, and able, and if he wants, I'll do it on Monday night, Tuesday night, or Wednesday night. We'll be in Michigan, a state that he's destroyed because of the auto industry. We're not going to have any jobs left Michigan, no other jobs left in Michigan. They're all going over the China and other places with his ridiculous EV mandate, electric vehicle mandate. But we're willing to do it, Monday night, Tuesday night, Wednesday night, Thursday night, or Friday night on national television, we're ready. Just tell me where I will do it in the White House. I would be very comfortable actually. But you tell me where, we're ready, he's obviously not showing up now. We heard nothing. But he said today that, oh, I love to debate, but he won't debate. I don't think of -- maybe he will, maybe he will. I'm not sure he has a choice but that's the story. So here we are. We're ready, willing, and able, and we don't see him and I don't think hell be here but maybe next week, he'll do it. I doubt it but maybe next week. So, I just to thank everybody for being here and now you have to suffer through this like everybody else. Nothing is done. This is a case that should have never been brought, every legal scholar, every legal expert, Andy McCarthy, Jonathan, Andy, every single one, Jonathan Turley came out with a scathing report in this trial today, Andy McCarthy scathing report, Mark Levin can't believe this is happening in our country.

There's no basis for any claim that President Biden had a personal role in it. The prosecutor behind it is Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who is a locally elected official, does not report to the federal government. Now, former President Trump has repeatedly cited the fact that a former DOJ official went over to work for Bragg. That's Matthew Colangelo, who'd been talking about, zero evidence that President Biden had any role in that personal employment decision. Colangelos and Bragg were former colleagues in the state attorney general's office. I think it's also worth noting, Jake, that when former President Trump says, every legal expert thinks this case is a sham and so on, the people he named today, he named Mark Levin, who yes, talks about the law, he's also a right-wing radio host who's a frequent defender of Donald Trump, Andy McCarthy sometimes criticizes Trump, but as also a conservative commentator. Jonathan Turley, a professor who defended Trump in the impeachment contexts and other things. So yes, there are even liberal professors anti-Trump professors, and so on who have questioned this case. But those names are the regular, the usual suspects defending Donald Trump. And then I'll note he talked about Michigan being destroyed no more auto jobs.

I want I want to talk about some of the takeaways from the cross-examination of David Pecker by Emil Bove, who is it was an interesting, interesting Q&amp;A. In this back-and-forth with Emil Bove who is a defense attorney for Mr. Trump, Pecker acknowledged that negative press for Trump's foes was generally good for business Pecker said that if the false door man allegations had been true, he would have run the story after the election. Bove elicited from Pecker that catch and kill, the term catch and kill buying a story in order to not run it so that it doesn't run anywhere else to protect Mr. Trump in this case, allegedly. Catch and kill was not discussed at the August 2015 meeting. The defense elicited from Pecker that he wanted nothing to do with the Stormy Daniels allegations and the defense made sure to spell out for the jurors that the Karen McDougal deal was reviewed by an election law attorney.

I heard Ankush lay out a scenario and certainly, he could be correct with regard to actions taken in furtherance of a political motive, but any married man in this position is going to be very worried about a jury of one and that's the person he lives with.And, you know, we had another former president who had been accused of a dalliance with someone not his wife and apparently denied it and then had to walk that back in -- from what I had read at the time, it was a tougher spill to his wife than it was to the country. So I think any married man on the jury, any married person, female on the jury is going to get that. And I also heard some talk about well, look at this, the Billy Bush tape comes out and the timing, and here's when Cohen's going in I challenge anybody to tell me a favorable time to have that come out if you're married and have children. And I really think that's going to resonate with the jurors. As far as Cohen and this banker, this also, I think validates the defense of not wanting to be embarrassed or to deal with his wife. Cohen wouldn't even tell his wife about the $130,000 loan. So I really think that there's a strong narrative that if this if it happened that it happened because the defendant was worried about the implications that would have on his family and his marriage and if that is what it's limited to when the prosecution can't tie it up to the other crime, the cases out the window.",

The timing, the timeline is really, really critically important for the prosecutions case. And of course, Peckers testimony that was his perception that this was all about the election that's what he testified.
