We can now confirm the suspect is Trevor Bickford, 19-years-old from Wales, Maine. That's according to multiple law enforcement sources, who also tell CNN he was carrying a handwritten diary, and in it, he expressed his desire to join the Taliban in Afghanistan and die as a murderer.Now, investigators also believe that Bickford arrived in New York City on Thursday and checked into a hotel in the Lower East Side. He then traveled to the Times Square area on New Year's Eve, and that's when, Police tell us, he approached one of the security checkpoints where thousands of people who were trying to get into the area were being screened for security. Once at that point, Bickford approached a Police officer and tried to strike him with a machete. He struck him on the head, injuring him. He then struck a second officer. That is when a third officer, who was also on the scene, pulled out his service weapon and fired a gunshot. The suspect sustained a gunshot wound on his shoulder, and he is recovering at the hospital. Now, multiple law enforcement officials also tell us federal authorities at the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, and the Manhattan District Attorney, have been discussing whether to charge the suspect federally or under state law or possibly both. So far, the suspect, Trevor Bickford, has not been charged formally. We also - it is also not clear to us just yet whether or not he has retained a lawyer. Now, law enforcement sources telling us investigators are seeking search warrants to look into his phone and other online activities. Those three Police officers that were injured near the Time Square celebration are making a recovery. And, I should just note that should this be deemed as a terror attack, it would mean that there was an attempted terror attack at one of the most crowded and popular events here in New York City, on one of the biggest nights of the year, New Year's Eve. There is a massive Police presence every year in the area of Times Square. And, even though Mayor Eric Adams said last night there is no credible threat to the City of New York right now, certainly, we will be looking to learn more about the suspect and exactly the motivation behind his attack.

However, some critical infrastructure in the capital was hit, and energy companies there are telling citizens to use electricity sparingly. This is a message sadly they become all too familiar with just the day before the first of January, the first day of the New Year. Again, there were multiple attacks on the city that day, 45 drones, according to the President, were fired on the capital, and it's been a holiday season, if you will, ramped up strikes by Russia.Now, the Ukrainians say that they hit a Military base containing Russian troops in the Donetsk region in the east of Ukraine, Russian- controlled area of eastern Ukraine, causing multiple fatalities there according to claims by the Kyiv - Ukrainian officials. Hundreds of Russian troops were killed in a strike using the U.S.-made Himars, very accurate multiple rocket system, on a Military base there or a base that was being used by the Military, a vocational training building is how it's being described on the Russian side. And indeed, some Russian Military bloggers are criticizing their own government for allowing so many troops on New Year's Eve itself to be congregated in a structure that wasn't safe. They're saying the death toll there in the tens of soldiers. Either way, that was a strong strike for Ukraine, and deadly, obviously, for those Russian troops.",

And, there is other people who can do what the former president did now, such as a Governor DeSantis, who might appear to be a safer bet. So, we'll see how he handles it.

As you can see, there is thousands of people who are already lining up to pay their final respects to Pope Benedict. I would say, the folks that are lining up here, a lot of them are affiliated with the church. There is some regular sort of Romans, Italians and tourists, but also some people coming in from Germany. The Pope, of course, was German, but very much affiliated with Bavaria, the southeast of Germany, where he came from. He was very much someone who really loved his homeland.But, you're absolutely right. He did leave behind that letter, and there were several pretty remarkable passages in that letter. But, first and foremost, there was the one that you were talking about, where he asked for forgiveness for anyone that he wronged. And, there is a lot of people who are sort of debating what exactly he means by that. He didn't further elaborate on what exactly he meant. But, some take that to mean that he possibly meant the fact that while he was Pope, and even before that, when he was a very powerful figure within the Vatican, there were, of course, those abuse scandals in the Catholic Church, and there are many people who did feel that Pope Benedict did not do enough to address that and to come to terms with that and to punish those who were responsible. One of the things, of course, that he did in the final months of his life is that he acknowledged that there were severe mistakes made, not just the time that he was Pope, when he was here in the Vatican, but before that as well when he was the Archbishop of Munich in the late 70s and early 80s. So, possibly, it has something to do with that, but pretty remarkable words in that final letter from Pope Benedict that was released after his death. And, of course, now, as we move along, things were all gearing up towards Thursday when we are expecting or when the funeral for Pope Benedict will happen. It certainly isn't going to be a huge event like when the funeral of Pope John Paul II happened, I was actually here when that took place as well. Pope Benedict himself asked for a smaller funeral to take place and that is certainly the wish that will be granted. That funeral, though, will be presided over by the current Pope, Pope Francis.
