All right, 5Ukraine can now use long-range American-made weapons inside Russia after President Biden gave them the go ahead. Two officials familiar with the decision tell CNN. According to one U.S. official, the weapons are intended to be used primarily in Kursk, a region in southern Russia where Ukraine launched a counteroffensive over the Summer. While Moscow has deployed nearly 50,000 troops to Kursk, thousands of North Korean troops have also deployed to the region, a move that has the Biden administration concerned. Yesterday, Russia launched their largest aerial attack on Ukraine in months, killing 11 people, including two children, according to Ukrainian officials. Overnight, Russia said they intercepted 59 Ukrainian drones including two headed for Moscow. Earlier this year, Biden secretly approved the transfer of long-range army tactical missile systems for Ukraine to use inside Ukrainian territory. But Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been pushing Washington for approval to use the weapons inside Russia as well. He responded to the news yesterday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT, UKRAINE (through translator):  The plan to strengthen Ukraine is the victory plan I have presented to partners. Long-range possibilities for our army is one of its major points. Today, there is a lot of talk in the media about us receiving a permit for respective actions. Hits are not made with words. Such things don't need announcements. Missiles will speak for themselves for sure. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Pete Hegseth is another one because as we kind of ran through there, there was -- there's been this reporting over the weekend here at CNN that he had this sexual assault allegation against him.There was a settlement where he paid the woman -- \"The Washington Post\" reported on kind of the overall mood down at Mar-a-Lago, and the headline is this, Trump won, the celebration started, and then the trouble began. And basically they chronicle that, of course, Trump won the election with this unified senior team that had brought some order and decision-making process to the campaign. But the structure eroded in the days after his victory, and is now beholden to Trump's whims. His team presents the names and presentations, he reacts in real time, other times, he suggests the names of people who had not been vetted by the transition team. They also went on to report that both Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita went to this donor meeting in Las Vegas for a few critical days, then LaCivita went on to go hunting in New Mexico, that's when some of these more controversial picks came out. Sort of -- we know how Donald Trump, you know, in moments like these, can basically go off and do what he wants. But does the rubber meet the road at some point? I mean, if he wants these nominees to get confirmed, I mean, where are the pressure points on the Hill? I feel like they're only going to have so much tolerance for bucking Donald Trump. But also, these two nominees seem so problematic. It's hard for me to see how they sail either.",

Yes, there's less pageantry, there's less people like trotting up to Bedminster and having to go before the cameras and all of that, that we saw. But it is -- I mean, at the end of the day, some of the vetting is being done live and in person through the press rather than behind closed doors with a transition team.I mean, these allegations toward Pete Hegseth came at -- reportedly shocked the Trump transition team because they weren't -- they didn't know that this was a thing. So, I would expect more of that. And if you're surprised by this, you weren't paying attention the last time, and we all were very much so. So, whether or not -- where the rubber meets the road is the U.S. Senate, which senators decide to -- I mean, we have someone like Markwayne Mullin who has made his thoughts on Matt Gaetz quite clear, now having to reverse himself, and we're going to see that in some corners, but at the end of the day, this is who -- will this person -- will Matt Gaetz eventually -- you know, pull back? That has happened in the past because he's a distraction. We've heard that many a time, or will he go headlong into these Senate confirmation hearings where he could face some pretty pointed -- we'll go with pointed because it's early in the morning -- questions -- we'll have to wait and see, but my goodness, what a January-February we are going to be facing --",
