The former president targeted Murkowski after she and six other Senate Republicans voted to convict him sat a secondary impeachment trial.Democratic Representative Mary Peltola is also projected to win her House race in Alaska ending Sarah Palin's political comeback bid, Palin also endorsed by Trump. Also news out of Georgia, the state Supreme Court rejects an emergency request by Republicans to block countries from offering early voting this coming Saturday. Instead, voters will be able to head to the polls this weekend in that Senate runoff election between Raphael Warnock, the sitting Democratic senator, and his challenger, Herschel Walker. Joining me now to discuss, Zolan Kanno-Youngs, White House Correspondent for The New York Times, and Laura Barron-Lopez, White House Correspondent for PBS Newshour. Happy Thanksgiving to both of you. Thanks so much for joining us this morning. LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST:  Happy Thanksgiving. ZOLAN KANNO-YOUNGS, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST:  Happy Thanksgiving.",

      "sentences": "So, Laura, first on this Georgia Senate race here, they will vote on Saturday. That appears to be a loss for Republicans not just in the courtroom but politically because the Democrats in the state have done their leg work in terms of getting the vote out on this Saturday.BARRON-LOPEZ:  That is right. This has been something that the Democratic Party in Georgia has been preparing for. We also know that there are a lot of organizations on the ground, get out of the vote organizations, and have really been focused on mail-in voting, absentee voting as well as early voting in Georgia. And one big difference here, though, Jim, for the Republican side, for Herschel Walker, is that this time around in this part of the election in the runoff, he has Brian Kemp, the Republican governor in Georgia. And Kemp has decided, even though he didn't outright endorse Walker ahead of the November election, he has now endorsed him and he is handing over all of his get out the vote operation, which is a formidable operation there in Georgia, is handing over his data information to Mitch McConnell's super PAC, which is funneling as much money behind Walker, because even though this won't determine clearly control of the Senate, it will determine whether or not it is 50/50 or 51/50. BARRON-LOPEZ:  And that has big differences on a whole host of things, including committee assignments. Zolan, so, where is best sense as to where this race stands? Because Republicans were also hoping that they would have -- well, they're not going to have the same advantage they had in the first round of this, right, where people were coming out to vote for governor, et cetera. Where do Republicans and Democrats think the chances are in this race? KANNO-YOUNGS:  Well, remember something else that just happened in this race that very much could resonate is this ruling as well on abortion. Just after six weeks of pregnancy, the restoration of this abortion ban, and we saw across the country in other races as well, Democrats really galvanizing when they could show that abortion was on the ballot. So, that is something to watch too as this race goes on. There is another report that happened, another moment that could be pivotal in this race, which is also this report on this tax break for Herschel Walker when it comes to the home he maybe owning in Texas as well. This is a candidate who has really, really touted his roots in the state, going back to his time as a college football star, representing. So, there will be -- it will be interesting to watch whether or not that runs the risk of undermining that image.",

      "sentences": "Look at super blue New York, for instance, the losses that they had there.Another story, Washington Post, granted your competitor, Zolan, but they have a has a new story today describing some tension within the January 6 committee, specifically that staffers there are angry at Liz Cheney, one of the vice chairs, Republican vice chair, because she's focusing on the final report so much on the actions of Donald Trump on and around January 6. I'm going to play a statement. Actually, I'm going to read a statement here from Cheney Spokesman Jeremy Adler responding to that criticism, quite a strong response. I'll read it. Some staff submitted subpar material for the report that reflects long-held liberal biased about federal law enforcement, Republicans and sociological issues outside of the scope of the select committee's work. She won't sign on to any narrative that suggests Republicans are inherently racists or smears men and women in law enforcement or suggests every American who believes God has blessed America is say white supremacist. I mean, do we know what is behind this, what's behind that tension? KANNO-YOUNGS:  Well, what we could say is that this tension around not just investigating the former president, not just looking into whether or not him and his allies, just how much they were part of the planning in the days ahead of this, what they knew. There has been tension between that focus and the security failures going to the forming of this committee, including, I think, interestingly, by also representing Cheney's own party. When this committee was getting formed, there were members of the Republican Party that were calling for more of a focus on looking at the law enforcement apparatus in some of the gaps that happened in the security planning. I do think it is worth noting that there was an investigation as well into the security failures of that day as well by the Senate committee, as well. So, we hadn't really had -- there was a void there of an investigation to actually look at what the former president knew. We had an investigation into the security failures of that day.",

This has been -- our situation has been unfolding probably for about five years with -- we had successive crop failures in Europe and Australia and Canada, and that followed up by the COVID pandemic really changed the way that U.S. consumers eat and it also caused massive disruptions in supply chains, labor availability, energy costs, you name it. Then on top of that, we had the war in Ukraine, right, which sent the wheat prices doubling over the summer, right? We've come down a little bit since then. And then, finally, we have what some scientists are calling the worst drought in the Western United States in the past thousand years. So, you add all of those things up together, right, and you get where we are today.

You know, just if the production aspects -- you've seen the destruction of the infrastructure and so forth, so Ukraine is not going to be able to produce the grain that it did before.And what I'm more worried about moving forward is the global supply for fertilizer, because a lot of the world's fertilizer has come out of Russia, Belarus and the Black Sea region, and a lot -- the natural gas is the number one input fertilizer production and that is pretty stopped in Europe because of the incredibly high price of natural gas. So, you have a global shortage of fertilizer, which could have a significant impact on grain supplies moving forward.",

And it erupted into violent protest this is week.To try and calm that situation, Foxconn said it's offering workers $1,400 to quit and leave. That might temporarily calm the situation but it puts even more pressure on Apple. This is where analysts estimate more than half of the world's iPhones are produced. So, these protests were driven by workers angry about wages, dirty living conditions and chaotic COVID rules. We've obtained new footage showing how those clashes turned violent. We know that squadrons of riot police rolled in. And one of the videos you're seeing there, you could see a group of police in white hazmat suits beating workers with batons, metal rods. Other videos show workers tearing down COVID barriers, masses of the protesters, throwing those metal parts towards police. Another video shows a group of workers working together to push over a police car, cheering and chanting. Now, we spoke to a worker who was at the protest. He said the scenes turned into a river of blood with police ruthlessly hitting workers. He also explained this pay issue. So, weeks ago, there was actually a mass exodus of workers after a COVID outbreak. People literally walking miles across highways to escape the terrible living conditions at the factory. So, to try and attract more workers, Foxconn went on this recruitment drive promising higher pay and bonuses, but this worker said when new people arrived at the plant, the pay package given was worst than advertised and they felt cheated. And, Jim, Foxconn, for its part, is blaming the payment issue on a, quote, technical error.",
