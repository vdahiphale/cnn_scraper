The main talking point wasgrain supplies, because, don't forget, wheat prices shot up around 20 percent after Russia withdrew from the Black Sea grain initiative amid a blustering war in Ukraine. The summit was an opportunity for Mr. Putin to appear stable, supported and surrendered by allies. But notably, only 17 African heads of states attended. Our CNN national correspondent David McKenzie joins me now. So many did not show up this time. How is this year's attendance signaling how much support Putin still has in Africa?",

And certainlythere is a big reduction in the numbers of heads of state going to Russia for this Russia-Africa summit, compared to 2019. But as the Kremlin puts it, they say there's been a brazen attempt to dissuade African leaders from going to Russia. This is even in the face of the invasion of Ukraine and the indictment of Vladimir Putin for war crimes. All of these leaders thought it was the right thing to do, to head to Russia and have these meetings with the Russian president. And, yes, you're right, the timing is awkward. It's on the heels of Russia withdrawing from the Ukraine Black Sea grain deal, which did provide an avenue for Ukrainian grain products to get out of that wartorn country. But Putin, as you might expect and as he has said before, blamed this on Western powers and said that Russia is available now to send grain to Africa to make up for it. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VLADIMIR PUTIN, PRESIDENT OF RUSSIA (through translator):  We sent almost 10 million tons to Africa. Obviously, in the conditions of the illegitimate sanctions, which makes it much more difficult for Russia to send food to Africa. We talk about logistics, banking and transfers. We have a paradox of pictures hee. On one hand, Western countries are limiting the supply of our grain and on the other hand in a totally hypocritical manner, they blame us for all the problems.

It has committed them to the front. They still have some strategic reserves that they can call upon. That's the assessment of both Ukraine and their allies, in the West. It's too soon to say that this is Ukraine taking territory and I think more than incremental gains. What gels here on the front line, south of Zaporizhzhya -- that long story east-west front line -- is that we're hearing from both Ukrainians and from the Russian side, that Ukrainians are making small gains. But we're only talking here about small villages. And those villages are still pretty close to where the front line was. So what success is going to look like, the Ukrainians overrunning those deep defenses over numbers, big numbers of miles, that the Russians have made, multiple trench lines, minefields. We don't seem to be there yet. But it was interesting last night that Zelenskyy said, in his presidential address, we've had good results on Wednesday. He said he'd speak about it more in the future and now he's heading south to Dnipro to meet with commanders. It does indicate that there is a bigger push going on. But we still have to wait to see the reality of success here, because this is not going to be won and lost in a day. There can be significant results in a couple of days.

So a short time ago it announced anew rate increase, bringing its main rate to 3.75 percent. And another one of the world's most powerful central banks has doubts that inflation is under control. This time, in the world's biggest economy, the U.S. Federal Reserve hiking its benchmark rate to its highest rate in 22 years. Jerome Powell says inflation numbers have improved but not enough. And here is how the U.S. and European stock markets are faring right now. Let's take a look at how they're doing. It's a Wall Street rally for the parent company of Facebook and Instagram as well but Dow Jones is up a quarter of a percent, Nasdaq up 1 percent. Overall, we're in the green, it's looking good, even in Europe. FTSE and DAX doing good. (INAUDIBLE) shares of Meta and Facebook surging. The tech giant reporting 11 percent rise in second quarter revenue. That beats Wall Street expectations. Its third quarter outlook is also above estimates, as you can see, Meta is up almost 7 percent. Now the box office success of the \"Barbie\" movie is good news for more than Hollywood, the iconic toymaker Mattel is also enjoying the results. During an earnings call, the Mattel CEO said, the global box office success has created a cultural event. It also plans to leverage this renewed interest in Barbie heading into the holiday season. Let's bring in CNN business reporter Nathaniel Meyersohn. Great to have you on. I don't think we have to wait to the holiday season, just over the weekend, because there's been so many Barbie posters everywhere. My daughter forced me into buying her yet another Barbie. Then momentum is there, the nostalgia is there and we see Mattel earnings as well, interesting numbers. Perhaps more to come.",

Mattel's revenue is down 12 percent last quarter and Barbie sales were down 6 percent. This is because there are a lot of folks that have shifted their spending from buying physical goods, like toys, into travel, entertainment and leisure. So all of the talk of Barbie and the \"Barbie\" movie is not translating into higher sales yet.",

They've been trying to up their revenue, get more sales coming in, rejig their product offerings so it speaks more to what the consumers want as well. But the point here is, the fact that people are still talking about Barbie so much, I think it'll be fascinating to see how that translates into actual numbers. What is the prognosis in terms of what analysts are predicting right now?",

And if you think about all the competition for toys right now, it's not -- kids can't just buy toys. They can go to streaming, so many different options. So Mattel really is trying to broaden its offering to compete.",

Some of them leaving before the end of this encounter. It was a brilliant match against Nigeria, who are nine-time African champions. They've got five-time African player of the year, who came off the bench, and scored Nigeria third. Australia threw the kitchen sink at their opponents, desperate to get something out of this game. But you have to say, it was a really well deserved victory for Nigeria, which sets up a brilliant final day in that group. And that wasn't the only, I think, surprise result is going a bit too far. That does Nigeria a disservice, because they were very well deserved winners. But also a fascinating draw taking place, rematch of the final from four years ago between the USA and the Netherlands. The U.S. definitely left disappointed with a whole lot of questions to be asked. They now know Portugal could cause an upset in their final group match on Tuesday. We've got plenty of reaction coming up, including from former a World Cup winner in just a couple minutes.",
