This may mean just a setback. We may even see Trump on the ballot if the Supreme Court takes up the case before January 5th, which is the day for certification of candidates on the ballot. But on the other hand, it is historic, because it is a preview of what is to come. That this is something that is part of this kind of -- these ideas about insurrection, about overthrowing democracy, about accountability that is all step stemming from the Trump presidency and January 6th. This is, I think, a defining case in terms of thinking about how these things are going to play out over the course of not only the next year and this next presidential election but also even beyond that. So it's opening the door for other cases. It's opening the door for the courts to establish what does it mean to be an insurrectionist? What does it mean for the presidency, a person who is in the office of the presidency, to take part in an insurrection? Does that amount to disqualifying in some way, shape or form?

I think quite clearly. We still don't know, even as we sit here now, we don't know how this works.We don't know who gets to decide whether a person engaged in insurrection. We didn't know 100 years ago. We didn't know yesterday. We don't know now. The problem is, the Constitution tells us how we're supposed to know, the 14th amendment says Section 5, Congress is supposed to pass laws telling us how this works. Congress has not done that. And so what Colorado did is they sort of made up this procedure. They had this quasi-hearing over five days. And now the Supreme Court of Colorado by a 4-3 margin is saying, Good enough, he's out.

Because they inevitably will take it up.And the question is, when will they take it up? What will they say? And how does that fall? And so I want to say, perhaps think about what happens when the Supreme Court takes it up. Because as much as we want to kind of divorce it and think about the Supreme Court as this kind of objective body that is, we all can sit here at the table and know that the Supreme Court is not that right now. The Supreme Court has been politicized. The Supreme Court has three Donald Trump appointees on it. And I think this does have implications for not just the question of, you know, can he be on the ballot, but all of these other kind of questions that surround Donald Trump and criminal charges, Donald Trump and insurrection. And that's going to be, you know, I'm sure Jack Smith, for example, is watching this with baited breath. People want to know.

The ruling happened just a few moments before he took the stage last night in Waterloo, Iowa. His campaign had already called for the Supreme Court to review this decision. They said it was un-American. But the former president did not speak about this. We asked his aides why, and they said they were simply digesting this information. But what was clear is, as we've seen this pattern happen again and again throughout this primary season, is that this is something that the Republicans, essentially, circle the wagons around him. His own rivals: Nikki Haley here in Iowa campaigning, she said, we don't need judges to make these decisions. We will win this the right way. Even Chris Christie, of course, who has made criticizing Donald Trump the centerpiece of his campaign, he said judges and courts should not be making these decisions.

So while it would -- they would love for things to come together, there are still huge differences between what Hamas wants and what Israel wants, which is why Israeli officials are telling us this morning that any final deal is still far away for now. But basically, one of the sticking points is, what kind of Hamas prisoners would be released? Heavy-duty prisoners is what Hamas is asking for, as opposed to the mostly teenagers and women released by the Israelis last time. Israel, let me just show you onscreen here, the deal that Israel is proposing to Hamas, being presented by Qatar. It would include, as you mentioned, Poppy, a weeklong pause in fighting the release of some 40 hostages, prioritizing women, the elderly and those in need of urgent medical care. Now, when you look at the numbers, these hostages are -- are the leverage that Hamas has. And it's believed that right now, there are around 129 hostages remaining in Gaza, around 108 of them believed to be alive. The remaining hostages, 21 of them, believed to be dead. So the number of hostages is dwindling, and Hamas had said that a permanent ceasefire could be needed for all of those hostages to be released. However, Israel, of course, is calling this -- would call this a temporary humanitarian pause before the fighting resumes. Because again, Poppy, their main objective is to eliminate Hamas leadership. And they say they have not done that yet, even though there's growing international pressure to stop this bombing and the military activity, which is taking civilian lives, including accidentally over the weekend, three Israeli hostages.",
