I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.We begin this hour with the rising death toll from the tornado outbreak that has ripped across much of the south and Midwest. Just minutes ago, officials in Illinois confirmed that four more storm- related deaths, the overall death toll over the last 24 hours now jumps to 21 lives lost. More than 50 tornadoes have been reported in seven states. In the south and the Midwest the state of emergency now blankets much of Arkansas and the National Guard is rolling into devastated communities. There are reports of at least a dozen tornadoes touching down in the state. These images are of the hard-hit town of Wynne, Arkansas, and that's where we find CNN's Derek Van Dam.",

I mean, just look at what we have with this destruction coming out of Wynne, Arkansas, that is a church steeple that was blown off by this tornado.Look at the incredible damage in front of that building. Just in front of us here we have electrical poles, light poles, trees completely snapped off. Behind us we've got the Wynne High School. I managed to capture a very powerful moment when a gentleman was walking through the parking lot with an American flag draped over his shoulders, and he told me that he had found it several 100 yards behind this structure, the high school, and it had been blown off of the flagpoles there. So he wanted to hoist it back up in a sign of unity and in a sign of determination that Wynne, Arkansas, will rebuild. They will stand tall through this devastation. Look at this building behind me, a business. You can see the X's there. That is from the first responders going to door to door to confirm that there are no people trapped inside and we've got the familiar sounds of a disaster zone. The sounds of chainsaws, the sounds of sirens coming from the ambulances that continue to race by. We have utility trucks that have been moving throughout this area. You can see the bobcats here. There was larger construction vehicles pushing some of this debris out of the way. This is the scene in Wynne, Arkansas, where the devastating tornado came through this area Friday evening, terrifying residents. It was over before a few moments, but it left this amount of damage in its path. Jim, back to you.",

One person was killed and 28 others were rushed to the hospital with injuries. 260 people were inside the venue when the roof came crashing down. Just unbelievable destruction there in Illinois. Former President Donald Trump is expected to make history on Tuesday as he voluntarily surrenders to New York authorities after becoming the first current or former president to be criminally indicted. Trump advisers and his allies say there's no way the former president and longtime New York resident can possibly get a fair trial, that's what they're saying, in the mostly Democratic borough of Manhattan. CNN's Kristen Holmes joins me from outside Trump's Florida state Mar- a-Lago. Kristen, what should we expect to hear from Trump's lawyers? Are they going to push for a change of venue here?

But this is something we do expect to hear from a number of Trump's allies as they continue to talk about how unfair this is to the former president.And as of course we have noted here for the last two weeks, the former president has painted this as a political witch hunt. He has attacked Alvin Bragg, saying that he is a Democrat, linking him to Joe Biden. He's even gone after the judge who he is expected to appear in front of on Tuesday. He said that that judge, quote, \"hates him.\" So clearly a narrative that they are spinning and it's not just the former president. It's not even just the former president's team, but this is something we are repeatedly hearing from Republicans. So one thing to keep an eye on is whether or not these allies start picking up on this talking point that it would be unfair for Trump to have a trial, excuse me, in New York.",

You know, we've been saying this over and over again. The arrest of a former U.S. president is unprecedented. And a lot is unprecedented with Donald Trump, of course, and that's an understatement in many ways. But this is going to be something that the American people just haven't seen before, and the Secret Service will be on hand Tuesday, expected to be on hand Tuesday to ensure his safety.

But from the Secret Service standpoint, you know, sources have told me, you know, for now a few weeks as they prepared for, you know, Tuesday's event is that, you know, they really want this to be administrative from the point of view of the Secret Service, right?They want to remain in their primary remit, which is the protection of the former president. And to that point what the Secret Service has not done is they have not asked for any special accommodations within the court in terms of their standard processing. Why? Because the Secret Service is not taking a full coordinating role in the security plan on Tuesday, and I think that's a really important role. What they want to do is they want to just actually focus on the primary responsibility of getting the former president to the courthouse. Let him do his business before the court and from the courthouse safely, and not have, you know, any incident. They are heavily relying upon the NYPD to provide the primary security coordinating role around the courthouse, and the New York state court officers will be inside and they'll be maintaining in escorting the former president throughout the entire booking and appearance process until they go. So this is really unique for the Secret Service. Typically, Jim, you've been around them for years. You see them taking the primary role, whether it's an NSSC special, you know, your political events. They control every aspect of the security plan. Here they are not. They are informed by the security plan, but they are not dictating it. They are not leading it, so it really is going to be an interesting day on Tuesday for the Secret Service, and really everyone that's involved to ensure the safety, not only the former president, but the city at large.",

Among Republicans, 78 percent say the allegations are not at all not too serious. And the vast majority look at that. And 93 percent say the case is mainly motivated by politics. So I'm not thinking, at least in the initial run, that at least the case in New York is going to have much of an impact on his standing among Republicans.",

We see that just 7 percent of Republicans believe he committed a crime trying to overturn the election and more than that they believe he was righteous in his efforts to try and overturn the election. Because - get this - 55 percent say he only lost due to voter fraud. So you know, when you combine that New York case with those potential other cases, I don't see how it really hurts him among Republicans. It may in fact, help him.",

You know, Maris had this great question, do you believe that these investigations are fair or are they witch hunt?Look at that, among all voters, 55 percent say their fair. Just 43 percent say that they believe they're a witch hunt. Look among Republican voters, on the other hand, 18 percent say their fair, 80 percent say that they are a witch hunt. The vast majority believed there are witch hunt. And I just want to go forward and look at the polling in terms of the elections, right? The primary and the general election because I think you see that vast divide there as well. Look at that. Among Republicans and the GOP primary, Trump is leading Ron DeSantis by 16 points. So it works for him in the primary. But look in the general election. Joe Biden's up by three points. So what may work among the primary electorate doesn't necessarily work among the general electorate. These charges against Trump may work for him in the primary. But among the general electorate, there's a far more skeptical crowd. And I think Democrats, for this particular reason, say, bring on these indictments are this particular indictment. Because I think it probably doesn't hurt, does not help Trump at least in terms of the general electorate - Jim?",
