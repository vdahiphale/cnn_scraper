The U.S. military is asking for your help in trying to find an F-35 fighter jet that went missing on Sunday near Charleston, South Carolina in what they're describing as a mishap. So how did this happen? The military isn't really offering too many details, only that a pilot was able to safely eject and then taken -- was taken to a local hospital. The plane's location though remains unknown as joint base Charleston says anyone with information should immediately reach out.CNN Pentagon correspondent Oren Liebermann has been tracking this story.

Two pilots identified as Nick Macy and Chris Rushing were killed. Organizers are said to be cooperating with the NTSB and they cancelled the remaining races. This is actually not the event's first fatal crash. A pilot was killed last year in a plane crash there, and in 2011, eleven people were killed when a plane veered out of control and actually crashed into spectators. Also, nine teenagers who escaped from a juvenile detention center in Pennsylvania have been captured. The teens fled after a riot at the detention center. All nine will be charged with escape, riot and aggravated assault. The juvenile facility is just 15 miles west from where escaped murder convict Delano Cavalcante was captured on Wednesday. And a bittersweet moment for Tampa Bay linebacker Shaquil Barrett. He dedicated his pick six in the team's win over the Chicago Bears to his late daughter. Barrett's two-year-old child died tragically after drowning in a swimming pool back in April. His family was in attendance as his interception helped seal the win for the Bucks. Watch this.

That is a big reason why -- as you can see on your screen -- we have U.S. oil prices above $91.00 a barrel, world oil prices above 94.A few other factors here. Demand in China has rebounded as they lift COVID restrictions. There's been this extreme flooding in Libya and fading recession fears. All of that is driving up oil prices. But Brianna, I just want to leave you with one piece of good news. And that is that Citigroup is telling their clients that they think that $90.00 oil, it's just unsustainable. And they're betting that oil prices are going to fall sharply in the coming months, falling below $70.00 a barrel before next summer. Of course, Brianna, that cannot come fast enough for consumers.",

And SAG, after the Screen Actors Guild, American Federation of Television and Radio Artists joined in July. They are fighting for better wages from streaming shows, new staffing requirements, and protections from artificial intelligence.We have seen CNN senior entertainment reporter Lisa France with the details on this.

And lots of people did not believe her apology. They felt it was inauthentic, and there was even more backlash. And I think we have a little bit of what Deborah Messing said to her. Deborah Messing made a very public plea to her, asking her to please, you know, just follow suit and be in agreement with the rest of, you know folks who have paused on their shows.This has kicked off a bit of a domino effect actually. Other shows including \"The Talk\" and Jennifer Hudson Show also have decided not to come back. Now Drew has issued a public apology again and she's apologized multiple times. And she pretty much has said that you know, she's sorry. She tried to do the right thing. She apologized to the writers. She said that, you know, she they just wanted to do -- to lead the way and be as effective as possible in terms of, she said: I have no words to express my deepest apologies to anyone I have hurt, and of course, to our incredible team who works on the show and has made it what it is today. We really tried to find our way forward. So she really has owned it from the beginning. But it's just been an incredible bit of backlash in terms of people saying, you know, there's a strike and you should be in allegiance with the writers and with the actors. And in terms of other people following suit, like Bill Maher now is going to pause his HBO show. He said that he had made the decision when it seemed like they weren't going to return to work, he said: My decision to return to work was made when it seemed nothing was happening and there was no end insight to the strike. But now he says that because it appears that the two sides are coming together to negotiate once again, he's decided to also pause now that both sides have agreed to go back to the negotiating table, he said, I'm going to delay the return of \"Real Time\" for now and hope they can finally get this done. So, what I think we're seeing is that the public has really risen up in support of these strikes and the celebrities are feeling the heat. And so they're trying to give the public what they want.",
