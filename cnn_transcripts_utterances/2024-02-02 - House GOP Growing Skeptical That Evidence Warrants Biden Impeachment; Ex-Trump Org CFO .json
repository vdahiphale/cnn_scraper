Court officials suggesting a verdict in former President Trump's New York civil fraud case could come in the next few weeks.A judge is deciding how much Trump and his co-defendants owe in the case, and whether the former president can still do business in the state of New York. We are also learning that Allen Weisselberg, who spent decades as Trump's chief financial officer for his real estate empire, is on the verge of pleading guilty for the second time. CNN's Kara Scannell is joining us now from New York. Kara, give us the details on this.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Brianna. Sources tell me Allen Weisselberg is in negotiations about a possible plea deal, where it would relate to a perjury charge in connection with some testimony he has given in the New York attorney general civil fraud investigation and trial.He is in talks with the Manhattan district attorney's office, which prosecutes those types of cases. And these talks are early, I'm told. It's possible a deal is not reached. But what is important is that, as they are negotiating over this, that Allen Weisselberg is not expected to cooperate against his boss, former boss, former President Donald Trump. That is not a condition of this deal. So he is not expected to be testifying against Trump in the criminal trial that is currently scheduled to begin in New York next month. In that case, Trump is charged with falsifying business records to cover up a hush money payment made to silence Stormy Daniels, the adult film start about going public about allegations of an affair with Trump just days before the 2016 presidential election. Trump has pleaded not guilty to those charges. That trial currently looks like it could be the first one that we see of these multiple trials that Trump is facing from these tragedies. So it's important that Weisselberg, who has been this lieutenant of Trump's, who has worked with him for 40 years, is not going to be a key witness in that case. If he does -- if this deal does work out and he pleads guilty, it will be the second time Weisselberg will have pleaded guilty. He previously pleaded guilty to tax charges and did testify in a case against Trump Organization entities. Those entities were convicted and fined. It's not exactly clear what testimony Weisselberg may end up saying was false, but it does come, the timing here is interesting, with the judge set to rule soon with a verdict in this case. As you said, we expect the decision to come this month -- Brianna?",

Officials say the fire spread overnight to a warehouse and homes. Officials also say the company behind the explosion is going to be shut down, calling it illegal and unlicensed. In the meantime, here in the United States, another recall from Tesla. This time, over font size that is affecting 2.2 million vehicles. Federal regulators say the font size for the warning lights is too small. This issue is going to be fixed via an over-the-air software update. So far, there have been no reports of any crashes or injuries. And the FDA is looking to improve health readings for patients with darker skin tones. Pulse oximeter's use light meters to gauge blood oxygen levels, and pulse rate through your finger. But the pigmentation in darker skin tones can actually lead to inaccurate results. A study published in 2022 found that readings for Asian, black or Hispanic Covid patients showed higher oxygen levels than white patients, likely leading to delayed treatment or no treatment at all. An FDA committee is meeting later today to discuss the matter. Still ahead on CNN NEWS CENTRAL. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
