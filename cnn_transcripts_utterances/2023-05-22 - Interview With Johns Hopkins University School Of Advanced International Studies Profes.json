But I don't think President Zelenskyy's message is going to carry very far because countries in this region, some of them, need Russia, some of them have economic relations with Russia. Saudi Arabia itself has an oil deal between OPEC and Russia that is vital to the price of oil. And secondly, I think President Zelenskyy's attempt to shame them into getting off the fence and not supporting Russia does not quite address the way in which the region looks at this conflict. They see it as a European conflict for which the region, as well as the rest of the Global South, is paying a disproportionate price in the form of higher energy prices, food shortages, recession. And there is no western help for countries like Egypt, Jordan, smaller Arab countries that are suffering because of this war. And just to say that -- and so, a message that works with European leaders or with western leaders does not necessarily resonate here. However, you have to log (ph) President Zelenskyy for trying, for trying very hard and for reaching out to the Global South and trying to, at least, engage them in a conversation about what this war means to his country and to the rest of the world.",

And in fact, Ukraine is one big reason why that is shifting because the United States and Europe is nowovertly preoccupied with Ukraine, militarily speaking. As well -- and then with China. So, in a way, the Ukraine war is encouraging these countries not to rely on the United States for their security. But also, these countries are supportive of Ukrainian principle. They don't think that the war -- that Russia's waging on Ukraine is justified and should have happened or that it was wide. But in the midst of this, they have interests, and their interests are sometimes economical, like Saudi Arabia has an oil interest with Russia or UAE has an interest in terms of the money that a lot of the oligarchs have put in this country, and even other Arab countries sitting around that table, Egypt, Jordan, you know, Morocco, they have their own interests. And what they want to see right now is not that Ukraine wins unilaterally and Russia uses -- loses definitively, this doesn't mean anything for those interest. They want the war to end. And the conversation we heard in -- by President Zelenskyy was not a pathway to how the war ends and therefore, the pressure of food prices, recession and economic pressure on these countries comes down. But it was rather an argument that you need to support us unconditionally even when your own interests are not served by it. And meanwhile, we also do not have any sort of a solution for the economic problems that have a landed on you. And so, what these countries are doing, in a sense, whether it's the rich Saudi Arabia or the much poorer Arab countries, is really look after their own interests in the wake of the economic sets of issues that this war has unleashed on them.",

I mean, there is a lot of similarity between what Iraq did in Kuwait and what Russia is trying to do in Ukraine,invading a country against international law, trying to annex its territory, and that's why the Arabs are trying to portray themselves as being sympathetic to Ukraine's position. And so, none of them have said that they actually think that Russia's claims to Ukrainian territory is legitimate or that Russia should have waged war. It's rather to say that, while we accept that Ukraine is in the correct, but nevertheless, we have certain vital interest that we need to protect. And also, that our interest is for this war to end as quickly as it can so the price of food can come down, price of energy can come down, and our economies can get going. So, it's a really -- it's the principles clashing with certain reality that the Arab world as a whole is facing. And then, in the context that you said, that the United States is no longer even committed to their security and Russia and China matter a lot more in the very volatile region in which they live.",

And, you know, also said to the Saudis and to the Arab Muslim gathering that, you know, Russia's oppression of the Muslim Tatars in Crimea should be a matter of concern to them.

They're not supporting United States' position on the Uyghurs in China either. We don't see any of these Arab countries criticize China for its treatment of Muslim leaders. They think they have bigger issues with Beijing and Moscow than getting into a conflict with them over Muslim minorities. Again, you know, they're setting principles aside for what they see as their own national interest. And I think the Saudis, also when it comes to Iran, are very mindful that if they become too pro-western then the Russians may begin to give Iran capabilities and military assets that the Saudis don't want the Russians to give Iran, including advanced missiles and advanced jet aircraft. On the other hand, I think the breakthrough with Iran is important at the regional level. It just suggests that the Saudis are approaching a way about this region in which they want to deescalate tensions and threats to Saudi Arabia, in Yemen with Iran, with Assad in Syria. And Iran is obviously important to the relationship with Assad. And in fact, inviting Assad to the Arab League in a de facto way is victory for Iran. Even though the Iranians may be worrying about how close Assad gets to Saudis at some point. But right now, it's a vindication that the leader that the Iranians backed won the battle for Syria and is now being welcomed by the very governments that try to topple him. So, we're in an environment in which, you know, everybody is operating in this gray area. And of course, the success of Iran-Saudi rapprochement is very important to whether this Syria-Saudi, Syria-Arab League rapprochement will work as well. But right now, everything is slowly moving in that direction.",

So, you know, the world and in the Middle East are watching Ukraine very, very carefully to see whether the United States actually really, you know, continues to back Zelenskyy and the Ukrainians to the very end. And of course, the elections in the U.S. is also over the horizon. But at the same time, you know, they -- as I said, they have other sets of issues here.

But I think for me as a person who had previously been on the cover of \"Vogue\" in 2019 as part of the \"Forces for Change\" issue felt extraordinary proud. For me, I was very aware of the fact that being the first little person to be on the cover of any \"Vogue\" magazine ever was an incredible honor.

But particularly as little person, that when I sit in front of you in a custom tie-dye Prada dress, that gives me power and a vocabulary to explain a version of myself to the world. So much which is often a challenge or impossible based on the fact of my physicality and my disability alone. For me, I understood that fashion created and gave people that vocabulary and yet, the industry in and of itself was often exclusionary or invisible to disabled people and vice versa. So, for me, I understood that if we could embed ourselves within the fashion system and think about the ways in which representation could take shape, yes, on the cover magazines and on runways, but also in boardrooms, that the reality in which every single one of us wears clothes at different price points, and some of us make a conscious about the types of clothes that we wear and others do not.

But to give you an example, I think many people, when I started in my career as a teacher, began to question whether or not the children would respect me, particularly because many of them would be bigger than me. But what I did was redesign the classroom. The students all sat in a U shape so that we were each at eye level with one another.

I think asking about whether representation on five covers or 19 people included the portfolio was enough, it's never enough. But what you've talked about there is the importance of intersectionality. For too long, when we think about or have representation of disabled people, it is one type of this disability and one type of person. But as we look to disability through a global lens and look to the ways of which identities overlap. So, for example, we have Aaron Rose Philip who is on the cover who is a black trans disabled woman. Ensuring that we are always including those who are most marginalized at the heart of our conversation but as regards to how we think about the future of those norms, it's about continuously expanding the definition so as many people can continue to feel included. But I think it's also about doing this with disabled people and out for disabled people, and that goes back to as many different marginalized groups as possible. But as we think about the future of people and whether it's the internet, whether it's different forms that create biases and that ensure that people feel excluded, we have a collective responsibility to continue to extend the explicit invitation, because people are valid as they are, whether or not they're on a cover of a magazine.",

A couple of days later, she reports buying stock in New York Community Bancorp. And a few days after that, a subsidiary of New York Bank -- Community Bancorp takes over the deposits of Signature Bank, and that sends their stock up, something like 30 percent. So, her office says that she wasn't aware that that was happening, that New York Community Bancorp didn't not come in our discussions with private -- with financial regulators.

But for the most part, several members of both parties support banning members of Congress from trading and holding individual stocks and would require them to put their investments in some kind of a trust. And that would really help this issue, because, right now, there are no rules other than the ban on insider trading, there are no rules that require lawmakers not to trade in stocks that could be affected by their work or in areas where they might have some sort of private knowledge of what's coming. And Congress is, of course, in a unique position to be able to have a sense of what's coming for a particular industry or company.

The other argument is that if members of Congress are not able to trade stocks, that would, in some ways divorce them from the economic interests of their constituents. So, those are some of the arguments that have been put forward. But I think beyond that, it's also just an issue of coming to an agreement on what a ban should look like. So, this past fall, House Democrats introduced a proposal that would ban stock trading, would require you to put your -- would require lawmakers to put their holdings in a blind trust, but that proposal actually drew a lot of criticism from some ethics groups who said that the rules for creating a blind trust were so weak that it would actually make the current system worse.

So, when they first set out, we kind of expected that we weren't necessarily going to find all that much because the rules are so much stricter than they are for Congress. But what we found really did not -- show that there was a lot of, sort of, questionable trading. So, I mean, for starters, the disclosures that we -- that are supposed to be public, that you're supposed to be able to review were incredibly difficult to get. It's been -- we started requesting these forms for more than 50 agencies in January of last year and we still have not received the disclosures from some agencies. And more importantly, I think that these disclosures show there's rampant trading and stocks that are affected by the work of agencies and that the ethics officials are really sort of narrowly interpreting these rules to say you have to be kind of the deciding voice on an issue that would affect company in order for it to count as a conflict.",
