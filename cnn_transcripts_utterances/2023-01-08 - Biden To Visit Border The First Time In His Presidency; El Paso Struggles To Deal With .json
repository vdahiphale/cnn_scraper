And we saw last week with the delay in getting a speaker elected how any further delay in officially establishing Congress is really harmful. Members were not able to perform constituent services last week, they weren't able to receive intelligence briefing. So this is -- this rules package is a must pass piece of legislation. But there are a number of concessions in here that McCarthy made to the right wing of his party in order to help get him elected speaker. The biggest one in here is that any single member can bring a vote to the floor to try and oust McCarthy as speaker. And as we saw with the drama last week, that could be a real problem. But some of these other proposed changes to the House rules package, as you can see also include establishing a special committee to investigate the Department of Justice and FBI, a key target of House Republicans.

It's when some people give up alcohol for a month to atone for their over indulgence over the holidays, or at least they try to, right? If you do have the will power, there is new data that says you are setting yourself up for long-term lasting health benefits.Dr. Richard de Visser, joining us now. He is a psychologist at Brighton and Sussex Medal -- Medical School in England. Great to have you on. So, you canvassed thousands of Dry January participants -- first of, what were the benefits they experienced? DR. RICHARD DE VISSER, PSYCHOLOGIST, BRIGHTON AND SUSSEX MEDICAL SCHOOL: Well, we saw benefits in three times frames during Dry January itself. Within a few weeks, people report that they had better sleep. Their concentration is better. They feel like they've got more energy. By the end of the month, a lot of people said they have saved money. Some of -- half have also lost weight. Then when we follow up six months later, what we find is that people are drinking less. So, they're drinking on fewer days per week, and they're drinking less on the days when they do drink. And that's all because during Dry January, they also develop more of a sense of being in control of their drinking.",

I know you're not participating as well either. I mean, who is the best candidate? Who should be trying out Dry January?DR. DE VISSER: I think anyone who wants to see if they can have a different sense of control over their drinking and maybe try to reduce their drinking a little bit. One group, you know, that it's not for, is people who addicted, who are alcohol dependent because they need professional help. But what we find is there's a whole range of drinkers that take part. The vast majority succeed, and most of those people experience those benefits in the short-term but also in the longer term.",

DE VISSER: Yes, I think -- the thing about Dry January is that people, they try out new things. They realize that they can go and socialize with their friends and not drink. They realize also what they can do if they feel the urge to drink, they can do something else, they can drink something else. So, people find out new skills, they find out new recipes. And I think the important thing about Dry January as a campaign, is that people get to do that as part of a community. So, rather than them trying to do it by themselves, them against the world of drinkers, they're part of a community of other people not doing Dry January, and that's really helpful. And we find that the more the people engage with the campaign, use the smart phone app, use the e- mails, the more likely they are to succeed and to get those benefits.",

But we find that it's actually very few people do. The people that we do find that happens for, the people who, maybe, start of being heavier drinkers, so you don't make it through the month. But what we find is around about half of the people go back to what they were doing beforehand. Around about 10 percent maybe drink a little bit more. But 40 percent are drinking less, fewer drinking days and fewer drinks on the days they do drink So, overall, given that this is a, kind of, cost free intervention, 90 percent of the people benefit from that.

So, you're not in an alcohol-free -- you're not in an alcohol, kind of, context. If you feel like you might want to go out and have a drink, think about what you drink instead.
