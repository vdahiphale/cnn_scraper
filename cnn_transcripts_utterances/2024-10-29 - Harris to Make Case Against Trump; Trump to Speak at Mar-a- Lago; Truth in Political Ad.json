And this just in. We just learned 40,000 people are now expected to be at her speech. And this morning, we are also standing by to hear from Trump at apress conference at Mar-a-Lago. These have a history of going wild places. We'll see what happens this time. And it will happen, though, before he heads to Pennsylvania as he, this morning, still faces the fallout over his Madison Square Garden rally. Let's start with Kevin Liptak, who is at The Ellipses this morning. What are you hearing the campaign from the Harris side is going to focus on today?",

      "sentences": "Yes, the words that Harris advisers used to describe this speech are hopeful, optimistic. Those aren't necessarily the themes that we might have expected when we first heard that Harris would be delivering this closing argument speech from The Ellipse, from the place that Donald Trump rallied his supporters on January 6th, before they marched to storm the Capitol.But certainly the Harris team wants this speech to be bigger than that. This is not necessarily going to be a treaties on democracy, a dissertation about the state of the republic. They want it to be for more optimistic vision. And they've chosen this spot because you can see the White House in the background. This place where she'll be speaking. It's only about 500 yards from the Oval Office. And they very much want Harris to allow viewers and undecided voters to visualize her as president, to paint a picture of the type of president that she would be. So, you'll hear her talking about her vision for the economy, for reproductive rights. Certainly, she will try and draw a contrast with Donald Trump to emphasize the chaos that he brought to the White House when he was president. But they don't necessarily want this to be centered on the theme of democracy. It will be an aspect, but it won't be the thrust of the entire speech. And the real hope was that this can go after what the Harris team calls conflicted voters. Voted who aren't necessarily behind Donald Trump, who may be concerned about some of the rhetoric they've been hearing from him over the last several weeks but aren't necessarily sold on Kamala Harris, who want to hear more about what she would do in office, want to know more about her as a person. And this will be their opportunity to do just that. They're likening it to a closing argument in a trial. Of course, Harris was herself a prosecutor. They say she's been laying out the evidence to the jury, in this case to the voters, and this is her opportunity to bring it all together in a final tent pole moment for the campaign. Now, this speech is tonight. She is spending the majority of the day doing interviews, including television interview in battleground states. She did just speak on the radio show, \"The Breakfast Club,\" and sort of laid out her vision for the final week of the campaign. Listen to what she said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE U.S. (D) AND U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We are a week out and I am just - I'm in - I'm in the zone, right. We've got to cover a lot of ground. There's still a lot of people to talk with. And so I am traveling all over the country, in particular the swing states, to talk with folks and organize them and reminds folks of the power of their vote. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

This was not on his schedule. It was kind of a scramble for them to put on. They said that this was really Trump wanting to mark the one week out from Election Day. And then I also was told, and this was, they said, really the reason, which is that he wanted to draw a contrast with Harris with her speech on The Ellipse tonight. Now, again, I think there's a big question and there's probably, you know, a lot of people are anticipating that he is going to address some of what happened at Madison Square Garden on Sunday. But I do want to also talk about, you mentioned he's going to the battleground state of Pennsylvania later today. First of all, we know that Pennsylvania is home to a massive population of Puerto Ricos (ph). Allentown, specifically, where he's going to be having that rally this evening is - is - has a lot of Puerto Rican - has a large Puerto Rican population there as well. So, keep that in mind because this is all kind of going to play a theme today. Now, I do also want you to listen to some of what he said yesterday because we've been hearing Donald Trump. He did not push back yesterday at - in his events in Georgia on what had happened at Madison Square Garden, but he did push back on what he said was dangerous rhetoric from Kamala Harris and Democrats and tried to defend himself, arguing that he is the opposite of a Nazi. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The newest line from Kamala and her campaign is that everyone who isn't voting for her is a Nazi. I had a great father. He was a tough guy. He used to always saying, never use the word Nazi. Never use that word. And he'd say, never use the word Hitler. Don't use that word. And yet they use that word freely. Both words. They use it - he's Hitler. And then they say, he's a Nazi. I'm not a Nazi. I'm the opposite of a Nazi. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But we also know from years of experience almost, a decade now of experience with Donald Trump, is that the way he puts out a fire, five alarm fire, is to start another fire.

      "sentences": "Yes. One thing about that, you know, real quick, the focus on the language and the offensive language from the rally from multiple speakers about multiple targets. At the same time, the rally was happening, Tom Holman, you know, one of his top immigration advisers, was on 60 Minutes saying that as part of the mass deportation, they intend also to deport U.S. citizen children with undocumented parents. That's how they are going to avoid family separation, by also deporting the kids.There are 4 million Hispanic U.S. citizen children with at least one undocumented parent and about a million other nationalities. So, like while we're focused on the offensive rhetoric, the reality is that there are really sharp edge policies that go behind that rhetoric. Similarly to when John Kelly, you know, so much focus was on him saying that Trump admired Hitler's generals or said positive things about Hitler. I thought the most important thing John Kelly said was that, as President Trump repeatedly sought to use the U.S. military against U.S. citizens in American cities and had to be stopped. So, you know, there's a lot of focus on Trump saying offensive things, and people may be shrugging that off, but there is an agenda that goes along with that language that is not just, you know, showboating, or kind of offensive, you know, remarks. It is actual, tangible policies that affect the same communities that are being targeted with this language.",

For me, this is about making it a binary choice. It's a binary choice between a racist and a woman who wants to represent all Americans. It's a binary choice between a convicted felon and a woman who prosecutes criminals. It's a binary choice between a man who feels he is above the law and above democracy and a woman who wants to defend democracy in the room, in the place where it happened.So, I think I think the symbolism of it is great. I want her to talk about policies because people say, oh, you know, she's not offering plans. Where have they been? Just Google it, go on her website. Eight hours. Before the Madison Square Garden rally, where Puerto Ricans and Latinos and everybody else was being offended, she had released policy to help the people of Puerto Rico, very thoughtful, comprehensive policy.",

She hasn't had a pitch that has really hit home with them so far. She's issued some policy statements, but they're not really well thought out in a lot of ways. And so she needs some authenticity.And if she thinks it will help her in, you know, Detroit, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh or Milwaukee, then it's worth her time.
