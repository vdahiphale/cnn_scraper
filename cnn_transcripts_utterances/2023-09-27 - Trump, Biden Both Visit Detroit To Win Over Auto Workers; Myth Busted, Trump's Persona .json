      "sentences": "In the history of American presidents, the blue collar battle runs the spectrum. FDR was arguably the most pro- union president. He signed several bills aimed at empowering the worker. And one of his most recognizable slogans is seen on this famous poster.Now, Truman initially cited with union workers that he angered everyone when he took over the steel mills during the Korean War. And in a rare move at the time, Teddy Roosevelt invited labor leaders to the White House during the coal strike. And as for other presidents, the union was a dirty word. Grover Cleveland, he sent the military to shut down a railroad strike. Reagan fired more than 11,000 air traffic controllers during a strike, a move that a current candidate, Tim Scott, says he admires. Now, fast forward to 2024 and the two frontrunners in that race for their party's nominations are using the current auto worker strike to flex their union muscle. Good evening, everyone. I'm Abby Phillip. And one day after President Biden made his visit union picket line, his predecessor and rival is now in Detroit tonight. He's looking for votes. And if you look a little bit deeper there, there is a politically sound reason perhaps for this competition between the two candidates. Unions are popular. Two-thirds of Americans say they approve of them, three-quarter side with the UAW workers in the strike against the three big car companies, and approval of unions just in general has actually risen in the past 15 years. But here is the interesting part about all of this. Back in 2020, Biden carried voters from union households over Trump by 16 percent. That is actually a wider margin than Hillary Clinton held over Trump in 2016 percent. Now, here he was, that is Trump, just moments ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: Instead of economic nationalism, you have ultra left wing globalism. They hate our country. And the workers of America are getting, to put it very nicely, screwed, getting screwed. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He's elected for the first time by everybody. And Biden's showing up yesterday, I mean, that was so historic. I don't know if this has been reported properly. I mean, you just did a great job at the opening going through our history of presidents, most of them, with the exception of Roosevelt, maybe one other, did not do well by working people. And for Biden to come there and be there at that picket line, it was so moving. And so -- and the criticism is he was only there for 15 minutes. You know, they were so nervous yesterday. I'm just going to say this. I hate to put this out there, but they wouldn't even tell your reporters, the press reporters that were on Air Force One, where they were going. They didn't know what city of Michigan they were going to land in. They didn't know what factory they were going to go to. They had to keep this all for security reasons, very, very quiet, because Trump and his people have managed to turn violence, violence, into part of the political structure of this country.

So, Ford, for example, currently spends about $64 per hour per worker in the United States. That includes wages and benefits. Meanwhile, foreign automakers and non-union shops, they spend between $45 and $55 an hour. So, some analysts estimate that if the unions get that 40 percent wage hike that they've been pushing for, that that could double the cost per worker for these unions.

You're doing the same exact job. You should be paid the same exact wage. If they did that, if the automakers did that, and our car companies did not raise the price of a car by a single dime, they would actually not only be able to afford that, but still make their huge profits, which they've made almost $30 billion since the beginning of this year alone, $30 billion in profits. So, they're making all this up to scare people. It doesn't work. We're reporters. They go and talk to the local owners of businesses, aren't they hurting now because of the strike?
