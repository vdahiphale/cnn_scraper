Another U.S. official is pointing to Hamas and the fact that Hamas does control another side of that border, and it is unclear if they are letting civilians come in. So there are a lot of questions.

They can leave the area where they've been told to evacuate north in Gaza with a lot of difficulty and with Hamas in many cases forcing them to stay. But it's not like Gaza has open borders at all. And the Egyptian government is going to demand a lot of financial support. Some will come from the U.S., some can come from Qatar, from other countries in the Gulf. Gut if they're going to have significant numbers of Palestinian refugees from Gaza, that is certainly going to require much more than just a couple of moments with the secretary of state. And what I've heard from the Egyptian government is that they are in principle prepared to accept up to 100,000 Palestinian refugees. That is their, in a sense, quiet red line. In return, they expect very significant support, very significant humanitarian and financial support. Now, I suspect those negotiations are going to play out over not just days, but weeks.",

There's not going to be any restraint coming from Israel given what they've experienced, and the Americans aren't willing to push them on it. And so the humanitarian crisis that's going to come as a consequences, and we'll all be seeing it, we'll all report it, that's going to limit what the Gulf states are willing to do in this conflict because of pressures domestically. It doesn't mean the Americans aren't getting cooperation, cooperation to take care of Palestinians as they end up in Egypt, also, eventually in what happens in Gaza following an Israeli occupation. The Gulf states are going to be asked to play a role there in terms of governance and in terms of financial support. Qatar, you probably just saw in the last day, worked with the United States in refreezing the $6 billion of Iranian assets that the Americans had said that they were going to provide. That's been reneged. The Americans needed Qatar for that. So there's definitely a lot of collaboration happening at the top levels, but you have to understand that the big issue here is not that the Gulf states don't want to work with Israel. The Golf states are very interested in working with Israel. And if they didn't have to worry about their populations, they wouldn't be saying anything about Hamas at this point.

There were at least three intelligence reports, two American, one Israeli, in the days leading up to the horrific events of October 7th. On September 28th and October 5th, the U.S. intelligence community issued warnings of potential cross border strikes by Hamas with rocket fire, and then the growing possibility of violence around Gaza.Then on October 6th, there was a third report from Israel, that was the day before the attacks, saying that there was unusual activity by Hamas. Sources are now telling CNN that these reports looked nothing like what ended up unfolding in terms of the scope and the barbarity. A Biden administration official tells CNN, quote, there was no information warning about the terrorist attack in advance. Instead, sources tell us that the sense was that if something happened that it would look more like it had an in the past, perhaps rocket fire from Gaza, interceptions then by the Israel Iron Dome and possible responses into Gaza by Israel. But more profoundly, U.S. sources say, there was a general complacency that had taken hold in Israel, underestimating what Hamas could pull off. And given that Gaza and Hamas were in Israel's backyard, American sources say, the onus is primarily on Israeli intelligence to have detected the looming plot. Still, with regular warnings from the U.S. intelligence community and Middle Eastern allies as well about a buildup of Hamas weapons and growing Palestinian anger, this is also raising questions about whether the Biden administration was taking the Hamas threat seriously enough.

The Republicans are still in a state of disarray in the aftermath of Kevin McCarthy's historic ouster, which is coming up upon two weeks when the Republicans, eight Republicans joined Democrats, the first time in history a speaker being voted out of his position.Since then, nothing has happened. In fact, no legislation can actually move, whether it's significant issues, foreign policy issues like aide to Israel or keeping the government open, which they need to do by mid-November. None of that can actually passed. No legislation at all until they elect a speaker of the House. But Republicans have been so badly divided that they have not been able to figure out their way forward. First, they nominated Steve Scalise, the House Majority Leader, to replace Kevin McCarthy, but he backed out. He dropped out of this all together because of opposition within the ranks. Then Jim Jordan, the House Judiciary Committee chairman, was nominated on Friday to be the next speaker of the House. But when he put the question to his conference behind closed doors and asked them, how many of you would vote against me if I went to the floor for a House floor for a vote, 55 Republicans voted against Jordan. He can only afford to lose four Republicans in that vote on the floor. Over the weekend, he's going to try to flip 51 Republicans to his side. That is a very tall order. This all comes as there is growing concerns about how this is impacting the GOP, how this is impacting Congress and the ability to act on any of these key issues, including from the speaker, former Speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy.

That is also a big question. The Republicans are still divided over that question as well. So, so many things are looming over Republicans right now as their internal struggles and battles have left the legislative branch essentially paralyzed. The Senate can act, but the House cannot. But can they actually become unstuck. That is the big question as Republicans try to take the weekend off and try to regroup again when they come back into session on Monday. Victor and Amara?",
