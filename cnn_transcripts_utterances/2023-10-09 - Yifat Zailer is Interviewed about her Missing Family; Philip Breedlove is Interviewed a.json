And we've been talking today at length about just how complicated the idea of a ground incursion is, primarily as far as the Israelis are concerned because of those hostages, those more than 100 according to Hamas Israeli hostages who are being held in Gaza. Of course, there are 2 million Palestinians who are living in this incredibly congested area whose lives, you know, are also at risk at this point.We know that Hamas is holding these hostages, but we don't know where these hostages are being held. What we do know is many of them are women, children, the elderly. And it is a horrifying situation. Nic Robertson just reporting from the area of the music festival on Saturday where so many young Israelis were slaughtered and so many of those hostages, as we understand it, were picked up from. I've got a family member now on the line who has lost, at the moment, contact with a number of members of her family. She is from a community just on the Israeli side. Yifat Zailer joins me now. And, Yifat, just describe what happened to you and your family.",

And, General, I guess let's start with the situation that Yifat Zailer was just describing there. This is the region we are talking about here in Gaza. We can push in and see the towns around Gaza that were attacked. This is where the people were taken from back into Gaza territory. So, from a military perspective now, as the Israelis are talking about complete siege, a complete siege of Gaza, how will they do that and what consideration must they take with 100 hostages somewhere in the city? GEN. PHILIP BREEDLOVE (RET.), FORMER NATO SUPREME ALLIED COMMANDER EUROPE: Well, thanks for having me. And this is a tough problem. The Israeli military is extremely capable and very talented. But the problem of what we used to call military operations in urban terrain, this is hard no matter how good you are. That's what they're facing. Gaza is a very dense place with lots of problems for mechanized forces, et cetera, et cetera. So, I'm sure that Israel is getting things set, setting the conditions as we say, in order to not only blockade, but then to begin surgical insertion to pull their people out.",

Syria and the southern part of Lebanon are home to many black flag organizations supported by Iran and the terrorist network that extends out of Iran.

We have more coming in also on the still developing situation in Israel and Gaza following the terrorist attack by Hamas on Israeli civilians this weekend. Israeli officials are now ordering a complete siege of Gaza. Israelhas launched an overwhelming response to the attack, launching air strikes in Gaza. Video shows mosques and residential buildings have been flattened there. The Israeli Defense Forces claim the buildings hit were being used by Hamas to launch attacks into Israel. Palestinians in that area say over 550 people have been killed there. The Israelis say more than 700 people have been killed in Israel. Meanwhile, Hamas says it's fired 120 rockets towards the southern Israeli cities of Ashdod and Ashkelon in response to Israeli air strikes. Israel says, again, more than 700 people killed by Hamas since it launched the surprise attack, which includes at least nine American citizens. This is all coming as Hamas claimed it has taken more than 100 hostages into Gaza. Now that includes men, women, children, high ranking Israeli officers and possibly U.S. citizens. This morning our colleague, Poppy Harlow, spoke with a man who was on the phone with his daughter when she and her husband were killed by Hamas. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LIAN TROEN, DAUGHTER, SON-IN-LAW KILLED BY HAMAS: This is not a military event. It's not a military strike. The historic interpretation or explanation of a pogrom is when a military strikes at civilians. And this attack was rehearsed. Well-rehearsed, well planned, carried out. And then you look at what they're doing. They're taking hostages from infants to senior citizens, people older than I am, denying them their rights. Sure, this is a human rights outrage that really echoes what the kind of pogroms that made my grandparents leave Europe for the safety of America. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, I was concerned before I heard that. I think that we have to understand that Hezbollah represents even much more of a severe military threat than Hamas does. And, obviously, the assessments of Hamas's capabilities, I think, were underestimated prior to what we've seen them do over the weekend.In the case of Hezbollah, Hezbollah has at least 150,000 rockets. It could be hitting Israel with 3,000 rockets a day. Now, having said that, they also knows, Hezbollah knows, what Israel would do in response. Hezbollah is facing a reality where the country is completely impoverished, their own base, their own Shia (ph) base is showing signs of increasing alienation. I suspect that - that Hezbollah would like to signal the Israelis that if they do - if they go into Gaza, that they -- that Hezbollah may feel the need itself to act and to come into Israel. But I also think we should be looking at these current reports being mindful of how they could escalate, but also be aware that Hezbollah may want to look like it's supportive of Hamas, but it may not itself want to get involved. The best indication that that would be the case is that they would be signaling Israel by allowing the kind of actions that you're seeing right now, either allowing Hamas, which is located in southern Lebanon to take certain steps, or Hezbollah itself it could allow - could fire mortars or rockets in the northern part of Israel signaling, look, we want - we're going to show we're supporting Hamas, but we don't want an all-out war with you. That's an easy thing to signal. It's not necessarily an easy thing to control. But be mindful as Hezbollah may not be so enthusiastic about going to war with Israel. And the problem here is that Iran will be pushing Hezbollah to go to war with Israel. Iran would love to sit on the sideline. They don't mind fighting to the last of Hezbollah or last of Hamas. They want to bleed Israel as much as they can. No question that Iran has played a major role, I think, in terms of planning this. The leaders of Hamas have visited to Iran.",

But we're directly engaged because we have Americans who have been both killed and very likely are part of the - those who are being held hostage. So, it gives the United States a stake in terms of effecting what Hamas does. It gives the United States a stake in terms of not wanting to see the war expand. If the war expands, then more Americans will also again be exposed. So there's no - there's no escaping the fact that we have a stake in what's going on. We also have a stake in ensuring that the end result of this is not the appearance of a Hamas victory. Hamas wins or looks like it wins, this whole ideology of resistance and war and terror is given a huge boost.So, we have a stake in Hamas being defeated. Israel has declared war because what Israel has experienced is completely unprecedented. You have to go back to the Israel's war of independence 1948 to see the numbers of deaths of Israelis in Israel. No war since that time has exposed Israel in the same way that we've seen now. We've seen more Israelis lost in one day than were lost in any single day of the 1973 war. So, we are in unchartered territory. And for Israel, Israel is dealing with the need to not only re-establish security, but a sense of security, and to deal a setback to Hamas so that the Hamas ideology is also defeated in the process. BOLDUAN: Ambassador Dennis Ross, your perspective always important on this issue, and so thankful to have you here today. A war that they are now fighting, a war ignited by a terrorist attack on the Israeli civilians. Dennis Ross, thank you. John.",
