And with the countdown clock ticking, both candidates are barnstorming key southern states today, making their last-minute pitches to voters. In the last hour, former president Donald Trump held a rally in battleground North Carolina. It's one of two rallies he will hold in that critical state today and then he's moving on to Virginia. Vice President Harris just finished a get-out-the-vote rally in Atlanta. And now she is headed to North Carolina on that final day of early in- person voting. We've got a team of correspondents out on the trail covering both of these campaigns. Steve Contorno is in Virginia where Trump will be arriving for a rally in a few hours. And Priscilla Alvarez in Charlotte where Vice President Harris will rally later on today. Priscilla, you first.",

But I am talking to everyone and reminding people of the stakes in this election. I think this is one of the most consequential if not the most consequential elections of our lifetime. And there is a huge contrast. As I talk about it, to encapsulate the point, look, on January 20th it is going to be Donald Trump or me sitting in the Oval Office. He will be sitting there with an enemies list, plotting over it, stewing over an enemies list because it is all about himself. I will be there with my to-do list working on behalf of the American people to bring down the cost of living, bring down the cost of groceries and housing, invest in small businesses, invest in young American families. That's the work I plan to do and that's the work the American people deserve from their president. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

In battleground Pennsylvania, the court upheld a rule to expand options for voters whose mail-in ballots were rejected for technical reasons. If a voter there made a mistake in how they prepared their mail-in ballot, a provisional ballot may count as a backup option for them. It's a move that's seen as a major defeat for Republicans in that critical state.Joining me right now is CNN contributor and professor of law at Stetson University College of Law, Ciara Torres-Spelliscy. Great to see you. So can you explain why Republicans wanted to block that ruling? CIARA TORRES-SPELLISCY, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Well, Republicans have been very strict with voting in Pennsylvania. And it was Republicans who actually required the secrecy envelope in the first place. And this ruling is more forgiving to voters who make a really simple mistake. They forget their secrecy envelope inside of the bigger envelope that they use to mail in their mail-in ballots. So this gives those voters a chance to cure and have their vote actually counted.",

I was about to just go through all of them. All right, so first off, tell me about, you know, your behavior at the drop box. What's allowed? TORRES-SPELLISCY: OK. So taking a selfie with a ballot is legal in 25 states and either illegal or questionable in the other half. So you really need to check your local election rules. So for example in my home state of Florida, it is illegal to take a ballot selfie and you could face up to a year in prison. That's the same in Georgia and in Ohio.

That means you're going to have to bring in your I.D. later to a particular official. And so you need to get guidance on how do I make my vote count.

People often ask me, who is going to win, who are you supporting, yet at the same time there are other concerns facing Chinese citizens. The economy, their families, their health.Let me share with you some of the reactions we got when we took to the streets recently here in Beijing. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): I know about it, but I do not pay too much attention to it. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): I don't think it will make any impact on our life here. To us ordinary Chinese people, whoever becomes the president, whether it's candidate A or candidate B, it's all the same. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And another, there is no perfect system, but at least they allow people to question them.On this topic of the American election, social media isn't always censored when it shows the political tension in the United States. The Chinese government takes a neutral approach. You could argue there's appeal in Trump, as he's been critical of alliances like NATO. This as China tries to establish itself as the leader of a new world order. Harris could also be appealing because of the predictability and the ongoing conversations with China from the Biden administration. Yet, regardless of the winner, the issue of tariffs is likely to be a thorny issue between the United States and China. Marc Stewart, CNN, Beijing. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

We saw that the weekends were feared by many of the White House staff because the president would frequently tweet out new policy. We're leaving Afghanistan before Christmas he said in late 2020. He announced a withdrawal from Syria that he had to then backtracked on, not much earlier than that.We saw many examples of this where it was a policy by impulse. But, you know, there's one area in which I think the Trump campaign, I'm sorry, the Trump presidency and the Biden-Harris presidencies have had considerable consistency. And it's China. Just what you just heard in the last report. And for the Chinese citizens who said I think no matter which one gets elected, the policy of containment will continue. I think that that one got it just about right because many of the policies you've seen enacted in Biden's years had their start in the Trump years.",

When hear Vice President Harris talk about it, you hear her talk about it in terms of the human cost of this conflict on both sides. The terror attack that took place on Octobers 7th, 2023, and then the bombings in Gaza that have caused more than 40,000 lives now.But she's been very careful not to get too far apart from where President Biden is, even though she is under huge pressure from the left to basically announce that she's going to use American leverage to cut off arms to Israel if it continues bombing civilians.
