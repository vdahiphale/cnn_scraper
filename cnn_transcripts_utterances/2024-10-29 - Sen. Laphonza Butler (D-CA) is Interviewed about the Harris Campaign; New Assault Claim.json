I mean, I was just at the barbershop in Philly talking with very incredible and distinguished men who are leaders in their community and small business and education and these men, these black men, were talking about not only their support for me, but most importantly their support for my perspective. But the black men in particular who are at the rallies have recently been saying to me, don't you listen to that and they got to stop with all that noise. We support you. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Do you think that the polling is incorrect and what she's hearing from black men at her rallies is right? SEN.

And I think that this election is going to be no different. I - based on young black men and middle-age black men that I've talked to as I've traveled battleground states across this country on behalf of this campaign, they too are saying to me that they are supporting the vice president, that they stand in favor of the policies that she is promoting, and that they reject the division that is being promoted from the other side.So, I - you know, polls are a snapshot in time. We'll all know in the next seven days how they will - how they'll turn out. And I think they're going to be showing up for Vice President Harris.",

And you, back then, gave Kamala Harris some advice before she became vice president, that she actually took to walk a day in the shoes of homecare workers to understand the challenges.So, I want to get your take on this. This political PAC in a memo warned the Harris campaign against attacking Donald Trump for being a fascist, saying it turns off voters. But this morning \"The New York Times\" is reporting the Harris campaign quietly thinks it's actually working, the attacks, and it's particularly working with moderate Republicans. What are you advising on this issue?",

Nothing new from the - President Trump and those who have been supporting him. And, you know, for president Harris - for Vice President Harris, I think she's got to just let Trump's words and the words of his allies stand on their own and talk about what her plan is to unite the country. You know, when you look at the rallies all across the country that the vice president is having, these are coalitions and communities standing together, having a joyful time and knowing that the power of our country is when people from across different spectrums and lived experiences come together to do impossible things.

And we've just got to continue to tell that story. The vice president's had 13 weeks to introduce herself to the American people. I think she's done an incredible job. But she very much is a very - is a different person with a different lived experience from a middle class family, and she's going to center what she has learned from the American people all across this country. And I think that's - that has been apparent in how she has run and executed this campaign. The policies that she's put forth, being in everyday places where everyday voters are.

KYLE SCHROEDER, CHAIRMAN, WISCONSIN YOUNG REPUBLICANSI'll have to say, I wish Kamala Harris was impatient for change because she - if she was impatient for change, we'd have changed right now. We'd have a better economy. We'd have young voters that are graduating college with massive amounts of debts that her and Joe Biden promised to alleviate for them. They did not change that. We have a border crisis that she's failed on. She did not change that. We have an economy that's failing, and she hasn't changed that. So, I wish that Kamala Harris would change something right now. She can do that. But I think that young voters are ready for change. And that's why in seven days that they're going to elect Donald J. Trump and J.D. Vance, who is the youngest ticket right now on the ballot for young voters to vote for by, yes, six months, but it is the youngest ticket. And J.D. Vance speaks directly to young voters. And she can spout that at a rally by the University of Michigan, but in Wisconsin, here, we're hurting. Young voters are hurting. We can't buy houses. We can't buy groceries.

But really, as I think president - or Vice President Harris, soon to be president Harris, would even acknowledge that change starts from the bottom up. And so if we're going to be engaging with youth voters, we need to recognize that these third party entities, while maybe they seem attractive at first glance to some new people into the political arena, people quickly see that they just don't have the record to run on to be able to run country or anything like that. And that's why I'm really glad that all the work that we've done as the Colorado Young Democrats has positioned us to really be in a position later, you know, post- election to bring that change.",
