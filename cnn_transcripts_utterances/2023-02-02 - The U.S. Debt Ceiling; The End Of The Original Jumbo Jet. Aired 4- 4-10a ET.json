This will be the first time Biden McCarthy are meeting in person since McCarthy became House Speaker and both sides have said the debt limit will be on the table. Now both men have said that they don`t want to see the nation default on their debts but for the time being they disagree on how to get there. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has insisted that he believes there should be negotiations and that ultimately, they believe that there need to be spending cuts if the debt ceiling will be raised. But President Biden and the White House have insisted that there will be no negotiations over this, and that Congress must fulfill their obligation to raise the debt ceiling. A spokesperson for the White House saying in a statement, quote, the president will ask Speaker McCarthy if he intends to meet his constitutional obligation to prevent a national default, as every other House and Senate leader in U.S. history has done, and as leaders McConnell Schumer and Jeffries have pledged to do. The president, they add, will underscore that the economic security of all Americans cannot be held hostage to force unpopular cuts on working families. Now, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said that they are using extraordinary measures until this moment and that the nation`s debt limit must be raised by early June. So, certainly this could have huge ripple effects for the U.S. economy if the nation were to default on their debt. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Now,imagine the pressure when this tiny capsule is filled with a highly radioactive material. A capsule containing cesium-137 which can cause serious harm went missing as it traveled hundreds and hundreds of miles from a mining site to Perth, the capital of Western Australia. Authorities said this would have been like trying to find a needle in a haystack. So, was this search worthless? Was this mission just an exercise in floccinaucinihilipilification? Or did they find this elusive capsule after all? Here`s CNN international correspondent Marc Stewart with the latest. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "The radioactive capsule has been found and to give you some context, this is a Hong Kong coin similarin size to a U.S. dime. It`s that small. It is used in mining. Here is the history: the capsule was discovered six days after authorities realized it went missing, likely after falling off a truck. Eventually it was found off the side of a road by crews using radiation detection equipment. It was found not far from the Rio Tinto mine, suggesting it fell off the truck soon after it left on January 12th. But the potential search area was enormous a distance longer than the California coastline. A perimeter was set up and now the goal is to transport it in a lead container to a health department facility in Perth. This was concerning because human exposure could cause skin burns, radiation sickness. There`s even a cancer risk in some cases. Authorities felt the chance of finding it was slim now they must determine how this happened in the first place. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

With its first flight on February 9th, 1969, the 747 is your answer here. It was called jumbo jet as it was the first wide body airliner. And up next, we will salute the queen of the skies, the Boeing 747. This spacious and sleek aircraft that was once touted as the future of airplane travel when it took off in 1969 is now a plane of the past, as airlines are opting for more fuel-efficient alternatives. This week, Boeing completed and delivered the last 747 to ever be built. And on Wednesday, the plane flew a path spelling out on the flight tracker to commemorate the moment. Let`s learn more about the history of this jumbo jet and what`s in store for the airlines of the future. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "When it was revealed in 1969, it broke the mold and defined jumbo. It brought jet travel to the people, carried world leaders, culturalicons, and even spacecraft. For half a century, it was the queen of the skies. But now, the last model has been delivered, Boeing 747 is beginning to approach its final touchdown. Built to meet the boom in demand for air travel in the 1960s, the 747 was a giant that needed the world`s largest factory to match its jumbo proportions, 225 feet from nose to tail it had a wing surface bigger than a basketball court, and its innovative wide body double aisle and double deck design would allow it to carry up to 500 passengers, while ensuring it would also be a freight hauling behemoth with looks like no other.",

But spacious interiors, a trademark spiral staircase and superior service also had the world`s rich and famous flocking. Glamorous silver screen appearances cemented its lavish reputation, and it became the go-to transport for many of the world`s elite, a trend set to continue with the presidentially modified Air Force One. The 747 was so capable, it was even used to transport NASA`s space shuttles and it continues to be used to launch satellites with Virgin Orbit. But the queen of the sky`s days of carrying passengers are entering their final chapter. Sales of the redesigned 747-8 failed to take off, with airlines opting for more fuel-efficient two-engine alternatives. Pandemic travel lockdowns grounded much of the remaining fleet and the last made like most still in service will be used to fly cargo. And so, after half a century of service, the sun is beginning to set on Boeing 747. It`ll be remembered as one of the most important airplanes ever made. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
