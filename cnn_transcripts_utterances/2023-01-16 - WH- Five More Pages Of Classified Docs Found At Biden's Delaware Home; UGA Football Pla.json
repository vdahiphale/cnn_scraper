Alisyn is off.President Biden is facing renewed criticism and new questions today after the discovery of more classified documents at his home in Wilmington, Delaware. This weekend, the president's attorneys announced they found five additional pages of classified material on Thursday evening, and they found them on the same day that the Justice Department announced the appointment of a special counsel to investigate the other classified material found at that home in a private office in DC. And the White House Counsel's Office said today that there are no logs of visitors to Biden's home. Now, the House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer asked for those documents and answers from the White House. CNN's senior justice correspondent Evan Perez is following all of this for us. So, Evan, tell us more about these five pages.",

So, this timeline, this additional piece of detail told us also that the -- there's a White House Counsel, a lawyer, Dick Sauber, who went to Wilmington to try to facilitate turning over those documents.And so, what this means, Victor, is that you have additional witnesses that Rob Hur, the new special counsel, the FBI are going to have to talk to because you now know -- that we now know that, you know, the White House and the president's personal lawyers have allowed investigators to talk to a number of people who were involved in all of this. And you know, it just seems like because of the messiness in the way how they've explained this, they've now created new witnesses who will need to be talked to by investigators. Of course, Republicans view this as a huge problem of transparency. Here's James Comer, one of the chiefs of the oversight at the -- on the Hill, who was beginning to ask these questions. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JAMES COMER, (R-KY): We want to know the visitor logs of the resident. We want to know who had access to the Biden Center for Diplomacy because this is the same type of investigation that the Democrats were so outraged and launched and demanded happened to President Trump. We don't know exactly yet whether they broke the law or not. I will accuse the Biden administration of not being transparent. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Of course, the big outstanding question at this point, Victor, is you know, are there more documents? Are there additional places that need to be searched?And now that you have a special counsel doing this investigation, who does those searches? Are you going to allow the president's lawyers to do additional searches or does the FBI need to go in and conduct a thorough search to answer once and for all, whether the government has back all of the documents that it needs to have?",

How relevant do you think of the list of visitors to this home where classified documents have now been discovered? How relevant do you think that is to the committee's investigation? REP. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI (D-IL): It may be relevant, but I have to say (INAUDIBLE) he has not requested any similar visitor logs with regard to President Trump's residences. I think at the end of the day, Victor, we have to kind of go bigger here.

Police arrested 21-year-old Darius Miles in connection to a shooting near campus yesterday. CNN's Martin Savidge joins us now. So, what are investigators saying, Martin? MARTIN SAVIDGE, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CORRESPONDENT: Not much, Victor. We should say that Darius Miles was a third-year forward for the University of Alabama men's basketball team. Was because the team now has disassociated himself -- themselves with him because of the fact that he's been charged with murder. According to authorities in Tuscaloosa, around 1:45 a.m. Sunday morning, they were called to the scene about a half mile off campus to an area known as the strip entertainment district. There, they thought a young woman dead inside of a vehicle the result of a gunshot wound. The driver of that vehicle says that two suspects opened fire after some words were exchanged. And as a result of that, the driver says he fired back. Meanwhile, one of the two suspects was reportedly hit but non-life- threatening injury. Police were able through talking to eyewitnesses and looking at video, identified the two suspects which of course now include Darius Miles and 20-year-old Michael Lynn Davis -- 20-year-old who is also from the Washington, DC area. As to why? Well, here's the spokesperson with the Sheriff's Department.
