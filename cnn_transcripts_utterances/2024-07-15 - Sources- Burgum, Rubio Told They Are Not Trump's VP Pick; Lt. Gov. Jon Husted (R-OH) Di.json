Not everybody loves Glenn Youngkin, but nobody hates Glenn Youngkin in the GOP coalition. There are people who have very hard feelings about Nikki Haley. I think they could get over them, but -- and maybe they would if Trump picked her. Because the party would -- would unify around anybody. I agree with Amanda on Vance, though. The pick has never made much sense to me in that people always say, well, he can win over blue- collar people in Ohio and Michigan. The blue-collar people that are inclined to go for Trump are already going for Trump. And J.D. Vance is not the guy to win them over. And he's certainly not the guy to win over skeptical suburban housewives or any of those -- that crowd. But I've also always said, including a bunch of times on air, that the more the Trump team thinks he's going to win, the more Vance's chances improve. Because he's not a campaign pick. He's a governing pick. To put in much more serious MAGA people in all of those positions in government that -- like Mike Pence did a lot of good work doing. And that spells a real change in the Republican Party they're going forward if that -- if that's the case.",

Because if you are hoping that, after this near-death experience, we're going to have a kumbaya convention, this is not a kumbaya pick.And so this would signal that Donald Trump is planning on doing a lot of hard governing. He's got somebody in there who is a pit bull. He's an attack dog. He went to law school. He's going to be in there making a whole bunch of stuff happen. So if you're worried about the Project 2025 and all that type of stuff, this is the guy that's going to really keep you up at night. The only thing I want to say is that we've talked a lot about Biden not being healthy. Donald Trump is -- he eats cheeseburgers all times. He's got heart disease. That's been reported. This could be the president of the United States here. We talk about Kamala Harris. If J.D. Vance is next in line, either now or later, you're talking about a hardening of the Republican Party around a MAGA agenda with a very capable guy that does scare the crap out of a lot of Democrats.

Let's go to CNN's Phil Mattingly, who is with the Ohio delegation. Phil, do they know anything that we don't?

That seems to leave it to one. Although, people in the Ohio delegation say they're not of knowledge of anything at this point. But it's been fascinating.
