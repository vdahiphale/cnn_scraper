Overnight, police using tear gas and stun grenades to control the crowd. Hundreds of thousands of workers now on strike, hoping Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's hand will be forced into an immediate ceasefire deal. Among the six murdered hostages was Israel-American Hersh Goldberg- Polin. This morning, his funeral will be held and we are standing by for a critical meeting in the White House Situation Room to begin with negotiators. President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris will meet with U.S. hostage negotiators as Israel says 101 hostages are still being held by Hamas, including seven Americans and their families, four of whom are still believed to be alive. Kylie Atwood is in Washington. Kylie, what can we expect from the meeting this morning between Biden, Harris and the negotiating team?",

      "sentences": "Well, John, over the last 24 hours, we have been seeing an outpouring of grief, of anger, of frustration, so many different emotions since the news of the killing of those six hostages who were being held in Gaza. A lot of that anger being directed not only, of course, at Hamas, who the Israeli military says executed these six hostages just shortly before Israeli soldiers entered the tunnels of Rafah and found their bodies, but there has also been so much anger being directed at the Israeli government. I'm here in front of HaKirya, which is the Israeli military's headquarters. This is Begin Gate, and we are standing on Begin Road here.This is where you have seen those weekly Saturday night protests. But today, we saw something extraordinary. Not only after last night we saw large crowds of hundreds of thousands of people showing up in Tel Aviv to demand that this government reach a deal to secure the release of the hostages, but today, in the middle of the day on a Monday, we saw both sides of this main road blocked off by protesters. It was only just minutes ago that protesters moved and allowed buses and traffic to resume on this street. They've just removed the barricades that were blocking this road, but you can still see that some of these protesters are sitting down. They do not want to allow traffic to resume here as they try and make this point that they believe that these six hostages could have returned to Israel alive had this government prioritize a hostage deal appropriately. We know from our reporting to Israeli officials telling me that three of those hostages were on the list to be released during the first phase of a ceasefire agreement. They were in what is known as the humanitarian category that was set to be released. And so many of the folks that we've been talking to here today, as well as the families of those hostages, have expressed anger, that this is really government could be doing more to reach a ceasefire deal, and that if urgent action isn't taken now to change the position of the Israeli government, that many more Israeli hostages being held in Gaza could die as well and could return home in body bags rather than alive to be hugging their families.

He's been in that city multiple times for Labor Day over the last several years. And they really are looking to court the union voters. Democrats view them as a mobilizing force in the election.Of course, some of the rank and file union members have been tilting towards Donald Trump over the last several elections. And what they're trying to do today is to really try and galvanize support among a voting bloc that they think can pay dividends and kind of be an exponential force for voters going forward, whether it's talking to voters, volunteering, knocking on doors. And that is really the objective today. And it's something that I think you'll see President Biden doing going ahead. He has described himself as the most pro-union president in history and it's very much something that he wants to sort of translate to his campaigning for Kamala Harris.",

We'll try to help you get around some of that traffic too. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [07:20:00] BERMAN:  All right. This morning, millions of people across the country are on the road or at the airport. Gas prices are a bit lower, $3.33 a gallon. And the TSA expects as many as 17 million passengers to head through the airports through Wednesday. CNN's Pete Muntean will be there every minute from now until Wednesday at Reagan National Airport. Pete, give us a sense of what you're seeing.",

      "sentences": "You know, John, this is a huge day for air travel, the last to get away for so many this summer on what's been a huge summer for air travel. In fact, the biggest ever, a quarter billion people, 250 million people passed through TSA checkpoints between Memorial Day and Labor Day. We're averaging about 2.6 million people each day. Friday was an even bigger number than that, 2.9 million people. In fact, the TSA was anticipating only about 2.8 million people. So it's a 6 percent increase over this time last year.The good news is the cancelations really peaked back on Thursday when bad weather moved through the Mid-Atlantic. The numbers have been relatively low, although the FAA is warning of some possible ground stops today due to thunderstorms as the day progresses in Texas and in Florida. So, we are not totally out of the woods just yet. One thing that TSA is pointing out that is keeping things moving smoothly at airports is more facial recognition technology. They say, even though there's a bit of controversy around it, people have really taken to it. You can't opt out. And the way this works, is that you put your I.D. in the machine. The camera live on the machine matches your face with your picture on the I.D. and that gets you through security. They say it's more accurate than a human checking it. Right now, here at the Terminal 2 north checkpoint here at Reagan National Airport, this is about the busiest we're going to see. The live numbers about 17 to 20 minutes to get through standard screening here, about five to eight minutes to get through TSA pre-check. TSA used this analogy with me on Friday. I have to say it again. It's Chick-fil-A when the line is long, it is long, but it's moving pretty efficiently. They're just trying to get so many people through on this last getaway for the summer.",

You got to think about the beach destinations, the Chesapeake Bay Bridge, the Bay Bridge Tunnel coming back from Virginia Beach. Those places are going to be really jammed. The best time to go, according to AAA, is in just a few minutes, before 10:00 A.M. So, hit the road now maybe after CNN News Central ends.",
