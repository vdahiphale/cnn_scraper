He talked about how those Rangers never quit, how they put their mission and country over self. And without naming names, Biden took aim at his political rival, former President Donald Trump.

Now, the president in his remarks also commemorated the heroism of 1944, but he also tied it to the challenges of today.

And so you couldn't have a more stark contrast than what you see now. You see President Biden honoring our fallen heroes, not calling them suckers and losers, President Biden talking about how important democracy is and coming together to do something great as Americans.

And what he does consistently is give Americans somebody else to hate or somebody else to blame for why they're not reaching their full potential or why they're not satisfied in their plight of life. And we're not going to do that. We do not believe America is a zero- sum game. We don't think one person has to fail for one person to do better. And we're going to continue to lift up America from the bottom up and the middle out. And we're going to continue to talk about that message. And, look, you saw it today. We beat job expectations again, created 275,000 jobs last month, which is why you see things still trending in the right direction. But this is what campaigns are about.

But Putin's comments come during what allies fear could be a dangerous turning point in Ukraine. After spending the last two years inching forward in the east, Russia has opened a new front in the north near Kharkiv and is now ramping up attacks there. Today, we have learned Russian strikes have now damaged or destroyed nearly half of Ukraine's available energy, and that has led to forced blackouts. And Ukraine just recorded its highest monthly number of civilian casualties in almost a year. The U.N. says Ukraine saw a 31 percent increase in civilian casualties in May compared to April.

And that led to that significant shift that you have seen that what had once been a red line, the idea that Western weapons could be allowed to be used against Russian targets that had targeted Ukraine, that green light given by ally after ally, including the United States, in the wake of that opening of that front because of the pressure that's now being brought to bear, not only on the Ukrainian front lines, but you mentioned the huge civilian toll that was borne by Ukrainians in the month of may. That is, of course, because that renewed campaign has led not just to strikes on the critical infrastructure that we saw again overnight, but, of course, tragically, strikes on superstores, on shopping malls, on businesses. And it is the people in the Northeast of Ukraine, around the greater Kharkiv region that are bearing that extremely high price. The fear amongst Western allies is that, consistently, Ukrainians have told them, look, we're very grateful for the help, but it's coming too late, it's not coming fast enough, well enough to the right places. For years, they have been telling me on the ground, ammunition, ammunition, and we don't have what we need to continue fending off these Russian advances. And this -- what we saw in May with the sudden what seemed to be Ukrainian forces very much on the back foot and retreating for the first time in a long time in that part of the country has definitely set a cat amongst the pigeons in Western capitals. You saw that shift on the question of how Western weapons could be used by some countries. Now what you're likely to hear a great deal more about, President Zelenskyy is over at the Elysee Palace right now speaking to President Macron. I expect we will get before tonight, Brianna, much more clarity on what the French president means about urging other allies to go ahead and help Ukrainian soldiers on the ground with their training, not Western soldiers in combat roles on the ground in Ukraine, but certainly present in their ability to train Ukrainian soldiers, Brianna.",

She described visiting her dad in a rehab facility in the summer of 2018 and how he -- quote -- \"seemed really great\" and that she was proud of him. She also said that she never saw her dad do drugs in front of her. Now, sources tell CNN the defense is hoping that Naomi Biden's testimony would soften the impact of Hallie Biden's testimony. The widow of Beau Biden and former romantic partner of Hunter testified that she believed she saw Hunter high on drugs in October of 2018, but admitted that she never saw him doing drugs around that time that he purchased the gun that's at the heart of this case. Before the prosecution arrested its case this morning, it called a forensic chemist to the stand who testified that the powder found on the pouch with Hunter Biden's gun in it tested positive for cocaine. CNN chief legal affairs correspondent Paula Reid has been following the testimony from inside the courtroom. She joins us now live.

She walked in with her husband. And, immediately, the first lady, who was seated in the front row, turned around and motioned to her husband to come sit right next to her. The Biden family and some of their friends are taking up the first two rows of court right now. And she testified on direct examination by defense attorney Abbe Lowell about two instances where she saw her father in 2018. The first was around August or September 2018 after he had gotten out of rehab. He reached down to her and asked her to come to California. He would arrange the trip. He wanted to see her. She said that she brought her boyfriend and she met with her father and his sober coach. And she said she hadn't seen him in a long time. But she said, when she saw him, he was as clean and as clear as he had been since her uncle, Beau Biden, Hunter's brother had died. And she said she was so proud of him. She was so proud to introduce her boyfriend, who is now her husband, to her father. She next testified about seeing him briefly in New York in October 2018. Of course, that's a critical period, because prosecutors are focused on the time between when he purchased that gun on October 20 -- October 12 to October 23, when it was discarded. She saw him during that time period in New York, when she borrowed his car and he came up to get it. She said that she saw him during that time and she remained hopeful. Problem was, Boris, on cross-examination, she and the defense attorneys, they appeared a little caught off guard when prosecutors presented some text messages between Hunter Biden and Naomi Biden while she was in New York, that second trip that she testified to, where it appeared that her father was a little bit difficult to connect with, was a little erratic in his communication about arranging a time to pick up this vehicle. And, again, she is a graduate of law school, but she appeared very uncomfortable, a little surprised with these text messages, because her father comes across in these exchanges as, again, being erratic, texting at 2:00 a.m. about picking up this car, going MIA for long periods of time. When she finally got off the stand, she left the courtroom. She was wiping away tears, Boris. She was visibly shaking. It certainly is a stressful situation for anyone. She did briefly greet her father as she stepped off the stand. She gave him a brief hug, a brief kiss on the cheek and then exited the courtroom. But it's unclear if this achieved what the defense was hoping.",

We have seen physical evidence, namely the powder on the gun pouch. We have heard testimony from Hallie Biden and other people who are intimately close with Hunter Biden during the relevant time. And we have also seen in Hunter Biden's own words that he was using drugs during this period, his own texts, the excerpts from his own autobiography, which the prosecutors, I think, played to strong effect before this jury. So, although I understand why the defense wanted to put on Naomi Biden to maybe elicit some sympathy from the jury, and I think her testimony was sympathetic, I don't think it's going to overcome all the evidence going the other way.",

I think that the testimony that there was cocaine on the pouch, the fact that it may not have been a lot of cocaine powder doesn't change the fact that there was cocaine residue on the pouch.

You can see it cutting either way. You could see them having more sympathy for this case. But, on the other hand, you could also see them maybe appreciating the prosecutor's point that we have these laws for a reason, that people who are abusing cocaine shouldn't be purchasing firearms. These jurors understand the harms that addiction can cause and the dangers that it would pose if people who are using cocaine were walking around with firearms. So, again, I think it's a bit of a double-edged sword, but there's no question that these jurors, many of them, are going to be bringing their own personal experiences to deliberations.",
