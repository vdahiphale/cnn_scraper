Now, Hamas is calling the clash a -- quote, unquote -- \"field skirmish.\" This morning, plumes of smoke were seen over Gaza. Now, while this is happening, another group of Israeli hostages are expected to be released from Hamas captivity today. Their families were notified early this morning. Unclear if this exchange of fire in Gaza does anything to jeopardize those plans.",

And the families who are not having hostages freed have also been notified. Meantime, the U.S. continues pushing to expand this hostage deal, CIA Director Bill Burns in Qatar today meeting with Israeli and Egyptian leaders for a broader deal that would include releasing men and IDF soldiers. The trip comes as a number of Americans are still being held hostage in Gaza. Our Kaitlan Collins is in Tel Aviv for us. What do you know at this hour?",

The deal is very much still in place. You have seen those complaints from Hamas and from the IDF, but, so far, this is still moving forward. We're waiting any moment now to see this actual exchange of the fifth group of hostages get under way. We have not seen that activity yet. Of course, that involves a lot of activity that typically we have been watching hour by hour, minute by minute, every night as these hostages make their way from the hands of Hamas to the Red Cross, then to Egypt and then finally here in Israel, mainly here in Tel Aviv, where they're dispersed at a group of hospitals and reunited with their families. And so we're waiting to see the ticktock of that actual release start to happen. But as we're waiting on that, there is a bigger question looming. And that's what happens after day six of this temporary truce, because we did see it get extended by 48 more hours. We know that right now officials are meeting in Doha to talk about whether or not to extend it further. I'm told that the CIA director wants this to be extended not only for several more days, but also to start to include men that are being held in Gaza, IDF soldiers, both men and women, that are being held in Gaza. We know Hamas prioritizes them higher than the women and children. So, basically, it's a higher price for Israel to get them out. Whether or not that happens remains to be seen. There are still a lot of women and children that we are waiting to see who is on this list today. Some of these children, we know, are not going to be on this list. Everyone has seen the 10-month-old baby, Kfir Bibas. He is not expected to be on this list. Neither is his brother. So we're still waiting to see who is on this list, what that looks like. CNN's Alex Marquardt is also tracking all of this, as we are watching closely to see what it is that comes next. And, Alex, right now, based on what we're hearing from officials on every side of the negotiating table here, it's still an open question.",

It's quiet in Gaza right now. There is no fighting. They have time to regroup after that constant bombardment from the skies and then the Israeli ground invasion that happened in Gaza. But the question here, right now in Israel, there is support for an extension of this pause, because people want these hostages to get home. I think the underlying question is how long that support goes on for before Israel starts to feel international pressure to where they feel like they can't restart the ground campaign that they seem very intent on restarting at this point.",

So there is an expectation that it could continue into a 10th day. Now, Hamas has every incentive to do that. They get a break in the fighting to rest and reset, as you say. They allow for more aid to get into Gaza, for that aid to be distributed. And they allow for more of these prisoners to be released. But there is very much a question of what will happen if and when Israel relaunches this military operation. We're getting a sense from the Biden administration that they don't want Israel to go back to what they were doing before, senior administration official saying yesterday that they want Israel, if they're going to start their military operations back up again, to be much more surgical, much more tactical, more careful and cautious, Kaitlan.",

Now, we have heard this name before, at least the family name, and that's because his sister Doron Katz and her children were released at the beginning, on Friday, if I'm not mistaken, or earlier in this truce agreement. So, the family now learning the horrible news that Ravid Katz died inside of Gaza. He is the third Israeli hostage to be confirmed by the IDF to have died inside of Gaza. Within about a week several weeks ago now, it was 19-year-old Corporal Noa Marciano, whose body was discovered in Gaza and brought and buried outside of Israel, and then 64 -- 65-year-old grandmother Yehudit Weiss. Both of those, it's worth noting, were found, according to the IDF, within about 50 meters of Al Shifa Hospital, which Israel has long said was a Hamas terror compound and had Hamas infrastructure underneath. So they also said, at least when it comes to Noa Marciano, that she was injured in an Israeli airstrike that killed her captors. They then say Marciano was taken to Shifa Hospital, where they say she was then killed. Now, we don't have those sorts of details about Katz at this point, but that is something we will keep looking into to see what more can be learned. That was always certainly a major concern of the families of the hostages. What happens the longer this goes on? How many more will Israel discover?",

There is a body within Hamas that's participating in the negotiations and that has leverage with regard to the hostages and what happens with those hostages. But it's also the case that you may have different factions, different groups, hostages held in different areas where the command and control of what happens at those areas may not be centralized. And so I think there's a lot of work that has to be done here to figure out exactly why this happened, particularly during a time when we have this pause. But I think it's safe to say that this is outside of what those who are negotiating with the Qataris and with the Israelis and the United States, what those -- what they intended to happen here. I think this is probably what we would refer to as stray voltage with regard to command and control.",

With regard to the release of women and children first and then men, there's just a logistical aspect of being able to control the number of hostages you have and to use those hostages as leverage. So, I think that what we're seeing here is sort of -- it's a game of chess. On the part of Hamas, the whole idea here is, how do we maintain as much leverage as we possibly can based on who we keep and what affiliations they have? And for the United States, this really is about, primarily about one thing. The United States simply does not want to see hostilities resumed before all of those hostages are recovered. So, we just have to see how this plays out, but, really, this is a masterful game of chess here.",

It's often a shoestring budget kind of operation. These are engineers who operate the facilities. They're very knowledgeable about engineering practices, but not always cybersecurity. Now, in this case, the water facility did immediately call federal authorities, who, like you said, launched an investigation. This has the attention of senior U.S. cyber officials across the government, I'm told by sources, and it's very much an ongoing situation. The case that the hackers were apparently trying to make was more of a psychological one, just to get people's attention. I'm not sure, Sara, that they were actually after doing anything to damage the water facility itself, rather, to make a statement. That's what these types of suspected Iranian hacking groups do. They want attention, media attention. Obviously, this is a serious incident. However, we have to stress that there was no threat to the actual water supply.
