You just played some of those comments of him criticizing Nikki Haley's husband. I just want to point out as well. Yes, Nikki Haley's husband has not been appearing with her on the trail because he is deployed overseas. But also for -- the former first lady, Melania Trump, has not appeared with Donald Trump once on the trail, apart from his announcement back in 2020 when he announced he'd be running for the White House in 2024. So I just want to give you that comparison there, but they've been training barbs, him and Nikki Haley, repeatedly today. And I just want you to get -- listen to what he said about mental competency test. This is something that Nikki Haley has also been needling Donald Trump on earlier today, Haley and her campaign at a campaign stop into South Carolina, were handing out mental competency tests to supporters in the crowd. Donald Trump said, he supports people taking those tests and he thinks that other presidents should be doing so as well. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They are very optimistic about how he will perform here. And that's in part because of the polls that have consistently for several months now shown that he is overwhelming -- leading her overwhelmingly, but it's also because of the intensity they've seen on the ground even today in this venue.This room is packed. They had many people waiting to get in outside. They had to close it to other to other attendees early, not letting everyone come in. It just shows kind of how excited a lot of people in South Carolina are for Donald Trump. And it just adds to the fact as well, Jim, that they really do see this as a staple. They won't deliver the final blow to Haley's campaign. Of course, Haley, for her part, has said she's committed to staying in the race through South Carolina and even beyond mark-up Super Tuesday, excuse me, in early March. So we'll see if that is how this pans out, but they are very confident about how he will do here in a couple weeks.",

They're reminding people that there are no criminal charges here that were recommended, but they are also going after critics and Republicans who have been attacking the president over his age.Today, the White House releasing a memo saying this. And this undeniable record, referring to the president's accomplishments in office, speaks to why it's no surprise that Republican officials continue their desperate and inadvertently self-undermining age attacks after many years of failure. They're afraid of Joe Biden. And also goes on to talk about how alert the president has been described by General Mark Milley, as well as by House Speaker or former House Speaker, Kevin McCarthy. Now, of course, the reason for all of this is because this report touched on one of the defining themes for the presidential election. That being the president's age and his fitness for office. And so the president's aides had been fuming when this report was coming out. They also called him sharp and tireless. The president himself showing his own anger during the news conference, especially with mention that he didn't remember when his son died. So all of these themes coming together with this report, aside from the substance which is that the president did indeed willfully retain and disclose classified information, but again, no recommended criminal charges. Now, when you talk to campaign officials and White House officials about this, it all boils down to taking the president out of the White House for hitting the campaign trail and doing more of those traditional retail politics stops where voters can be the ones that engage with him one-on-one and draw judgment themselves over the president's age and whether he's fit to serve another term.",

Trump is out there today talking about the importance of cognitive tests. And, you know, back in 2020, he was bragging that he passed this cognitive test. I think he said something along the lines of a person, woman, man, camera, television, something along those lines. And that was all widely mocked at the time.

This is the president that just 10 days ago, confused Nancy Pelosi for Nikki Haley, both of whom are women. He knows. And we can see regularly. So -- but the great differences that while Democrats wring their hands and clutch their pearls about any word that Joe Biden might say wrong, Republicans don't care. They don't care that he's got 91 counts. They don't care that he's been found liable of sexual assault. They don't care if they heard him say, on tape and video and both, about grabbing a woman by her private. They simply don't care.

And this is what we have. And, therefore, you have got to pick the better choice. And the better choice is Joe Biden, who frankly is the most consequential, effective president of my lifetime. The face he has achieved with a very difficult makeup in Congress are amazing. But for some reason, Democrats, instead of pushing back with all of these accomplishments, get panicky because he mistook and he misspoke between Mexico and Egypt. Clearly, the man called the Egyptian head of state and did what he had to do to get the border crossing open for humanitarian aid. Instead of focusing on the fact that he achieved that, so many Democrats are buying into the Republican created narrative of sleepy Joe and Joe is too old, while they pretend that Donald Trump is some sort of, I don't know, colossus of roads.",

He is -- it's been reported he has referred to members of the military who die in combat as suckers and losers and so on.

Until someone who's running against him punches back and goes as low, when Donald Trump goes low, you need to dig a ditch. Until somebody goes there with him, he will continue to do it. Look, you were talking about someone who has five children by three different women, right? Who has -- who cannot have the audacity to ask, where is your husband when your wife is nowhere to be found on the campaign trail? Nikki Haley has to go there with him. Now it's a little late.

Like when Donald Trump says these things, you have to be willing to move some furniture for the people you love. And that's the problem with the Republican Party. They simply do not have the spine or backbone to stand up to a bully like Donald Trump. The question is, although it's late, does Nikki Haley have that backbone?

They've lost their -- some cases, they say it's been stolen. They've spent all their last remaining money on a bit of food for the family. There are reports of people in the north of Gaza even now resorting to making bread out of animal feed, eating off of grass. So the conditions that people are living in there are very, very desperate conditions. And for children, 600,000 of them, to be uprooted from already an insecure prospect to an even less secure prospect, for the U.N. that just, you know -- the U.N. already says some areas on the edge of famine.

Months of preparation have been undertaken here to get to this point.There will be hundreds of law enforcement officers protecting the hundreds of thousands of fans in and outside the stadium. Authorities rolling out a host of resources, including scanners for everyone that's going inside. There are explosive detection K-9s. There are also, similar to what you have in Washington, D.C., during special events, these sensors that can essentially sniff the air for any type of chemical, biological, nuclear threat. That's all happening on the ground. In the air, there will be a temporary flight restriction instituted an hour before kickoff. That will be enforced by U.S. military fighter jets. Now one particular area of focus for law enforcement pertains to drones. That's because drone technology is obviously so cheap and easy to obtain. Someone seeking to do harm with a drone can use that type of platform to do so. So the FBI, other law enforcement agencies have rolled out these counter-drone systems. I've seen them up close. They're impressive. Allows authorities to essentially take over a drone, either drop it out of the sky or, if there's a concern that maybe it has some type of concerning payload, they can vector that drone away from a large crowd. So a lot of work going on there, Jim. It's important to point out, at this point, authorities haven't discovered any type of information, any intelligence leading them to believe that there will be problems.

Here are the facts from Thursday night. It was Times Square and so many people there, the hustle and bustle around 7:00 p.m. There is a store in Times Square, J.D.s , which is an athletic footwear store and some clothing also. There were three migrants in there, two 15-year-olds, one 16-year-old. They were shoplifting, getting things ready to take them out. The 15-year-old came near the door, going to leave with his items. The loss prevention officer said, we'd like those back. That's when witnesses say he stepped back, took a.45 caliber gun out of his clothing, pointed it at her, shot, but he missed. He hit a tourist, a 37-year-old Brazilian woman here with her husband on vacation. Shot her in the leg. So she's rushed to Bellevue. He runs out of the store and the NYPD runs after him. And that's in the midst of this very large crowd. He gets the gun out again, turns around, and according to surveillance footage and the NYPD, he shoots two shots at the police officer, not striking him. The NYPD did not return fire because there were so many people there. But the chief of patrol, John Chell, said we have to look at the facts but we also have to look at the bigger picture here.

But last year, Oher alleged that Sean and Leight Anne Tuohy never adopted him but, instead, filed a conservatorship and profited from a false narrative, which they denied. The conservatorship has since been terminated by a Tennessee judge. But Oher's case and seeking information from the Tuohys about his finances is ongoing.
