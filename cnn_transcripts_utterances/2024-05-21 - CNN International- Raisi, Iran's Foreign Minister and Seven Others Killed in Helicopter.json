The northwest city of Tabriz is the first stop for these official ceremonies and that will, of course, be followed by other cities in the days ahead.The country meantime, is observing five days of national mourning.

One senior official warns they are running out of words to describe the humanitarian catastrophe there, calling it worse than hell on earth.

CNN's Scott McLean is live in Istanbul this hour for us. So, as we mentioned, some varied reaction there, but specifically what more are we hearing from Israel? SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENTAnd in particular, you have many Israeli leaders and politicians who are really taking issue with what they would call outrageous -- the outrageousness of comparing democratically elected leaders in Israel with a terror group like Hamas. The prime minister himself, Benjamin Netanyahu described it this way. He said it was like creating a moral equivalence after September 11th between President Bush and Osama Bin Laden. What is interesting is President Biden is essentially making the same argument about there is no moral equivalence here. But Hamas is basically saying the same thing in reverse, saying look, please don't associate us with the Israelis. They say that they strongly condemn equating victims with aggressors. In terms of the broader reaction, Erica, look, you touched on it a little bit already. There are varying degrees of outrage, at least in terms of the West, you have countries like the Czech Republic, like Italy, like Britain, pretty clearly condemning this decision to include Israeli leaders in this. Then you have some that are more on the fence like the Austrians and the Germans. The Germans for their part said, look, they don't understand, they don't agree with the equating Hamas and Israel, but they said that they support the court and they also support Israel's right to defend itself, but it needs to do that within international law. And then, as you rightly pointed out, you have these, maybe outliers we can call them, Belgium and France. The Belgians have said that crimes in Gaza must be he prosecuted regardless of the perpetrators and France says that it supports the court's independence and the fight against impunity in all situations.

You also have, as you pointed out, that U.N. official telling the Security Council that they don't have enough fuel to do much meaningful work inside Gaza. And they have complained about the border crossings that are open in theory, they say, but because of the difficulties with fighting around them and the difficulty with logistics and the coordination that is required, they are very difficult to use. There is also even difficult to using that brand new -- newly constructed U.S. pier to bring in aid. And over the weekend, we saw desperate people mobbing some of those convoys and looting whatever boxes they could get from inside.

And earlier in the day yesterday, he called it \"outrageous.\" The condemnation here in Washington has been that there is no equivalent footing here between these Israeli prime minister and Hamas. And it is notable that this is the first time that the ICC sought an arrest warrant for a top leader of a U.S. ally.This, for example, puts the Israeli prime minister in the same company as Russian President Vladimir Putin. But of course, Erica, this also comes during tense relations between the U.S. and Israel amid the continuing humanitarian crisis in Gaza. And of course, this also gave the president an opportunity to speak in favor of Israel, despite all of the tensions that have been -- have erupted over the last several months. Of course, the president and the Israeli prime minister have had very frank conversations about Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza. He also put conditions on potential offensive weapons that he would send to Israel if they were to continue with their major ground operation in Rafah. So, these arrest warrants and this announcement really coming at a critical time for the U.S. and Israel. But all the same, what we heard yesterday has been the underlying theme of this White House, which has been supporting Israel all the same. And that is exactly what we heard from the president in his remarks yesterday. And we have heard the same condemnation over on Capitol Hill from Republicans and Democrats. So, he is likely to continue to get questions on this. But to your point, Erica, this of course does still loom over the presidential election. But even though the president was condemning this, even though there have been tense relations between the U.S. and Israel, what continues to remain the same is the steadfast U.S. support for Israel.",

He was essentially rebuttal witness for the fact that the prosecution elicited this testimony that Michael Cohen was under a pressure campaign after that incident happened with the FBI raid.And so, the defense was asking questions here and essentially, he didn't like the fact that the judge was sustaining objections by the prosecution, so much so that he was audibly saying words like ridiculous, or jeez, he sighed, he rolled his eyes, to which the judge then removed jurors from the courtroom first, and then he essentially gave a warning to Robert Costello saying that you do not say jeez, you do not give me side eye, and you do not roll your eyes. And apparently then, Robert Costello gave the judge a bit of a long glare and that really upset Judge Juan Merchan. He cleared the courtroom of the entire press and everyone that was inside and basically gave a huge warning to the defense and Robert Costello, saying that he will remove him as a witness and he will strike all of his testimony if that conduct continued. And then, when everyone was brought back in, his testimony did continue.

There are two lawyers that we know of on this jury and one of the things that the defense team has said in court multiple times in their openings, even yesterday, in some arguments to the judge at the end of the day, is that they believe the prosecutors haven't proven the case. They haven't shown evidence of criminal intent, of hiding business records that were falsified, of breaking campaign finance violations by Donald Trump, that there was no criminal intent around the catch and kill schemes, trying to keep damaging stories from voters during the 2016 election. They say that there just isn't the goods that have been presented in court on Trump. How the law is explained to the jury though is going to be a crucial piece of what jury deliberations may look like behind closed doors when they do begin, potentially, as soon as next Tuesday.",

For a little bit more including on that tense confrontation between Judge Merchan and Robert Costello, (inaudible) of course, for the dissents, we are joined now by a former Judge in the state of Florida, Jeff Swartz, who is also Professor at the Thomas Cooley Law School. So let's start there. The fact that this judge, who is by all accounts, very mild mannered even tempered, even when he is upset doesn't raise his voice, the fact that he got so frustrated that he cleared the courtroom to have a moment with this witness and basically say, get your act together, this is my courtroom, what does that tell you about what was going on in those moments for him to be pushed to that moment?JEFF SWARTZ, FORMER JUDGE AND PROFESSOR, THOMAS M. COOLEY LAW SCHOOL: There's a number of things that are going on here. Mr. Costello is known as a very confrontational lawyer. He comes in and he believes that he is in control of a courtroom even when he is the lawyer there. He carried that same attitude with him when he walked in as a witness. He just could not believe that this judge was not going to let him say what he wanted to say and he didn't like it very much. And he wanted the judge to know it. And he wanted the jury to know it. You can get away with that to a certain extent, sometimes when you're the lawyer, but certainly not when you are the witness. This was done for a performance. It was done because that's what Donald Trump wanted to do if he took the stand. And I think Mr. Costello was just trying to make a point to, what we call, an audience of one. And that just wasn't going on (ph) with Judge Merchan. I think that he handled the matter absolutely perfectly. He took control of his courtroom again.",

I think they had a dislike for Mr. Costello. They always do when someone is confrontational with the judge. I think they appreciate the way the judge has been handling the matter. And I think they are going to come back and I think Mr. Costello, for the most part, probably could apologize when he gets the opportunity to the judge when he is testifying and try to get some of that back.

The real key here is for the judge to define for the jury where they can find evidence and what they say is, you can believe all, any part of, or none of the testimony of a witness. And this is where you look to, to get the evidence to determine whether the defendant actually exhibited an intent.He will also differentiate between finding the defendant guilty of a misdemeanor and guilty of a felony by just that one element of the offense.

The leader of that group is reportedly a German businessman, a minor royal, who had planned if this went off to become head of state. This is actually one of three trials involving more than two dozen people. Prosecutors say the group had planned to storm the parliament building in Berlin and arrest lawmakers. They were arrested in 2022. At the time, the group had amassed more than $0.5 billion in funding.Prince Harry will not be allowed to amend his lawsuit against the publisher of Britain's 'Sun' tabloid to include allegations against Rupert Murdoch. That is the ruling from the U.K. high court. The lawsuit was originally filed in 2019 that accused his news group newspapers of phone hacking and other illegal invasions of privacy. Prince Harry and dozens of others had hoped to expand that to include claims that Rupert Murdoch was personally involved in covering up the wrongdoing.

I think that's what we can read into that. So, Rupert Murdoch is not going to be implicated in this case.He also tried to push the date at which the evidence could be included back, if you see what I mean, going back further, so he could include more evidence. That was also thrown out. But he will be able to reach out -- include more journalists in this investigation, in this trial and so there is -- he has had some wins. It is not a big point in the trial, but it does sort of set the parameters of how the trial will look in January. He is claiming with other people, of course, it is going to be a big event because 'The Sun' has been Britain's top-selling newspaper. The publisher is the defendant here and this is just one of the cases that Harry is pursuing against the British tabloids. And it is about phone- hacking, which is really the sharp end here and how his privacy was invaded in many illegal ways. One of the other small chance he had today was the hacking of landlines, is also going to be included in the trial as well. So it does expand it to some extent.
