All right, the 2024 presidential race is rolling through the battleground state of Pennsylvania this weekend. Both candidates are campaigning in the Keystone State, which will be critical to winning the November election. Vice President Harris and her running mate Governor Tim Walz will go on a four city bus tour tomorrow before heading to the Democratic National Convention in Chicago on Monday. The bus tour will give Harris the opportunity to sell the economic proposals that she laid out in a speech in North Carolina yesterday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Two days ago, Donald Trump was here in North Carolina. He said he was going to talk about the economy. I think you all watched. You know what I'm about to say. But he offered no serious plans to reduce costs for middle class families. No plan to expand access to housing or health care.

And I say the start because his aides do say that he'll have a very busy remainder of his term campaigning for Kamala Harris, working on foreign policy.But at the same time, there's no question that this speech that he'll deliver on Monday is not the speech he was planning to give or the speech he was hoping to give. Obviously, there's still some scars left from that effort to remove him from the top of the ticket. The Democratic Party really still processing some of that, but I think his focus now is looking ahead. And that is what you'll hear from the President when he delivers this speech on Monday, really trying to make the case for Kamala Harris as the natural inheritor of the record that he had while he was in office. And certainly, he'll make the proactive case for Harris talking about her record, about her character, but he'll also make the case against Donald Trump, making the argument that Trump remains a threat to democracy and that electing Kamala Harris is necessary to ensure democracy is preserved. That's in the words of Biden aides. Now, that's a lot for the President to pack in this speech. When we did hear from the President last night talking about his message, he was a lot more concise. Listen to what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And no small part because of his decision to very quickly endorse her out of the gate.And what you'll see in Chicago next week is reminders of President Biden's record while he was in office, things like, you know, battling the COVID pandemic, the number of pieces of legislation that he was able to pass. You'll also see these sort of thank you moments for President Biden, some quotes of his featured on walls of the United Center, which is where the convention is taking place. The quote, \"history is in your hands\" will be projected on screens. That's something that he said in his Oval Office address, explaining his decision to withdraw. You'll see Bidenisms like \"spread the faith on those walls\" as well. Now, Vice President Harris will be on hand Monday night for this sort of formal passing of the torch moment, but that will be the last we see of President Biden in Chicago. He will depart and go elsewhere for the rest of the week, really sort of handing over the convention to Harris as she assumes this mantle as the Democratic standard bearer.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Fredricka, it's interesting. We just got a little bit of new reporting from CNN's Kristen Holmes specifically about the former president's plan to counter program the Democratic National Convention next week. And believe it or not, that will actually start with another rally back here in Pennsylvania in the Harrisburg area.Now, sources are telling CNN that what these counterprogram events will look like is they're called messaging events. They'll be in slightly smaller venues and say some of these arenas that we've been accustomed to seeing Trump events in. And they'll probably be focused on one or two policy issues each night. The first night will be in Harrisburg Pennsylvania -- or in the Harrisburg area, I should say. And then we'd see other events in Michigan, North Carolina and Arizona. But I think it's interesting that we're hearing from the campaign that these will be messaging and policy focused events next week, because frankly, that's one of the big questions that we have tonight in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. Will the former president be able to stay on message and continue to try and land attacks on Kamala Harris when it comes to her policies on the economy, perhaps on immigration as well. This is not been going particularly well for the campaign over the past week. His allies, his advisers have been trying to get him to stay on message. You saw that event in Bedminster earlier in the week, where the former president had a lot of grocery items on a table, but still the tone of that event took on more of the campaign rally type feel that we've still heard from the former president in recent weeks and really during the course of this entire campaign. One of the other distractions, Fred, that I'll mention that came up again over the course of the past 48 hours was a series of comments that the former president made, specifically saying that the Presidential Medal of Freedom was actually much better than the Medal of Honor. The Medal of Honor, of course, awarded to service members who have shown extraordinary valor. Those are the type of distractions that the campaign is trying to avoid today in events like this in Wilkes-Barre and then further on into these counter programming events during the DNC. And the one last thing, Fred, that I'll note is just where we are here in Wilkes-Barre today. We're in Lucerne County, it's Northeastern Pennsylvania. This is a county that president -- former President Obama won twice, and then former President Trump won twice. So really juicing the vote counts in these areas. These more white working class areas. This is the pathway that former president needs to win in order to ultimately win the critical battleground state of Pennsylvania. We'll see if he can continue on that track tonight here in this event in just a few hours. Fred?",

The U.N. says the safe zone space now in Gaza is down to 11 percent of the size of Gaza.170,000 people were told to leave or left their homes on Israeli IDF instructions on Friday. The sort of rate of people being told to move is leading to a sort of a, you know, an absolute level of frustration. We listened to what people there were saying today, they were just at their wits end. We don't know where to go. We don't know what to do. We keep moving. We want this to end. And even saying, you know, look, I -- you know, one of them describing himself as somebody who might've supported Hamas before and essentially saying not anymore. He -- every time Hamas fires rockets, and this is what the IDF is saying, the IDF will then go and target that area, and that's what led to the casualties overnight. So it's just a very desperate situation. But President Biden says he feels that the talks are getting close. Secretary of State Antony Blinken will arrive here over the weekend and be available and talking to Israeli officials expected on Monday. So that's a diplomatic push on top of those talks. More talks expected with both Hamas and Israel. Separate talks in Cairo at the beginning of the week. But despite that positivity, Hamas a signaling they're not happy with what they heard come out of the talks at the end of the week. So it's too early to say that there's real progress.",

She's doing that softly.And what we see in the polling is that she has tremendous room to grow. Whereas, most would argue on the Trump side, he's almost peaked too soon. And so elections are about coalitions and constituencies. They're about addition and multiplication, not subtraction or division. And those things are lining up. The tectonic place, the math, the map and the momentum have shifted in her favor. And so I think she just has to continue doing what she's doing.

What do you say about that strategy? SEAWRIGHT: The campaign is a combination of high tech and high tech. Being the $370 million announcement today, $170 million on television ads, reservations through between that between Labor Day and November 5th, as well as the largest digital ad reservation in American political history. It's 270 -- I'm sorry, $100 million or $200 million. So I think that is a combination of what you're going to see in this campaign. What was once uncertain ground for Democrats has now become fertile ground. Certainly, so goes the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, so goes the presidency. And so she's got to treat all these states, every single battleground state as an investment manifest. And certainly, in the campaign, in American politics, it's always a game of margins. So candidate quality messenger -- message, and investments, infrastructure matters.

The medal she received is not the same medal that Chiles was given nearly two weeks ago. But Barbosu says she is now looking ahead and turning a page on this controversy. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANA BARBOSU, ROMANIAN OLYMPIC GYMNAST (through translation): The resolution of the case was possible thanks to the federation and the law firm that did not give up on us, the sportswomen. I'm very happy to have this medal. And I hope to continue to represent Romania at the highest level and bring back as many medals as possible. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

You might recall -- recall, earlier this year, we talked to people in Wichita who were devastated after a bronze representation of number 42, the American professional baseball player who would be the first African-American to break the color barrier in Major League Baseball, unveiled last week a new statue of baseball legend, Jackie Robinson. It's an exact replica of the sculpture that first stood in its place. Back in January, the original bronze statue of Robinson was stolen from its pedestal, cut at the ankles there. Firefighters extinguishing a trash can blaze found burned remnants of the statue days after the theft. And earlier this month, the man convicted of the crime sentenced to 15 years in prison. Joining us right now, Brandon Johnson. He is a city council member in Wichita. Mr. Johnson, great to see you. I mean, this was a very big deal, right? Not just because MLB players attended the unveiling at the ceremony, but this statue has represented so much to the community there. How does it feel? BRANDON JOHNSON, (D), WICHITA, KANSAS, CITY COUNCIL MEMBER: Thank you for having me, Fredricka. It feels amazing. Our community is so excited. We had hundreds of people there that celebration. It -- having that beacon of hope back is even better. And now it's four foot (sic) higher than it was before. (CROSSTALK)",

So for kids there in this league to walk past this statue, I mean, what does it mean for them? Because I think, what, in the past, they would kind of touch -- many would touch it before play.

And I think, for them, it shows that, even when something tragic happens, we can come together and make something good out of it. So I think it means even more to them now, when they see it, when they go by it to play their games. And also, I've just seen some of them out there around it when I drive by every other day. WHITFIELD: Oh, that's so nice. It was crushing to so many when the vandalism took place. But then you had immediately a flood of both emotions and money, right, to replace it, Hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations, including $100,000 from Major League Baseball.

You know, that statue means a lot to many in the community, but this was directly stealing from kids. And we saw the city, the state and the country come together and reach out and support. And again, it just means so much to us and League 42 to have that support, that attention.
