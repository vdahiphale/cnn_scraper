All of this as CNN's exclusive new national poll shows the presidential race is dead even with 11 days to go. Plus, we're breaking down a new report that Trump's billionaire ally, Elon Musk, has been in regular contact with one of America's top adversaries, Russia's Vladimir Putin. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. We're following breaking news on fresh lines of attack in these, the closing days, of the presidential race, Kamala Harris sticking to her strategy of warning that Donald Trump and his rhetoric are dangerous and demeaning, Trump doubling down on his new characterization of the U.S. as a garbage can for the world. CNN's Alayna Treene standing by a Trump's next stop, a rally in Michigan. But, first, let's go to CNN's Rosa Flores in Houston, Texas, where the vice president is holding her first campaign event with Beyonce later tonight. Rosa, we've seen Kamala Harris hitting Trump today for ratcheting up his attacks on undocumented immigrants.",

She says that Texas is ground zero when it comes to the fight for abortion rights and for reproductive freedoms. And that is exactly what Texas is, when you talk about Texas being one of the states that has some of the strictest abortion bans in the country.And she will have some star power with her, Kamala Harris. We're expecting, Beyonce Queen B, to be here in Houston with Kamala Harris, but also some very strong and powerful stories that will be shared by real women.

They think that this is helping him. It's the same type of language that helped propel him, they argue, to the White House in 2016. And they think it'll help him again this time.

But there's been this kind of a narrative that Kamala Harris should not be talking about Donald Trump's unfitness for office. She shouldn't be bringing up General Kelly's comments about him praising Hitler among other things. I think she needs to be practicing an all of the above strategy. She needs to call out and define why Donald Trump is uniquely dangerous in a way that no modern candidate for president has ever been, while also proactively talking about what her agenda is and what she wants to do for voters when in the White House. That's where the message has to be. That's why I think it's smart, actually, that she's in Texas on this issue, that she's done so well with women on, talking about reproductive health, not just abortion, but access to IVF, among other things. So, listen, I think you're going to hear it from all of the above from her. And I think speaking on The Ellipse and reminding people of January 6th is incredibly important.",

People are fed up.And I actually think that this is a complete misreading of this subject by Kamala Harris and her campaign because the country is obviously very angry about it. If, again, you go back consistently and look at the polling on this issue, they are very angry. And I think the problem also for her is she has been inconsistent on her messaging. If you watched her at the town hall the other night, she went and laughed about the border wall, but then says that she wants to pass some bipartisan immigration bill, which has money for the border wall in it. But all of that is them assuming that the borders are -- that the voters are stupid and don't know that it was she and Joe Biden who undid all of the Trump border policies that led to the tens of millions of illegal immigrants coming into this country. So, no, I don't think it's Donald Trump's rhetoric that's bothering voters. I think it's that she is inconsistent on this issue.",

But I do want to mention this, to this point around border security, you cited that the vast majority of Americans support mass deportations. I have never seen that number in my life. The bipartisan border bill that Kamala Harris supports that most Republicans in Congress supported until Donald Trump tried to block it is where the majority of this country is.

I'm from Georgia, Wolf, and we saw just last month Republicans on the state election board seeking to change the rules around requiring hand counting of ballots across the whole state. Now, this was a move that the Republican governor, Brian Kemp, Republican secretary of state, Republican attorney general all came out against as saying that it was illegal. But yet the election board proceeded to vote in favor of those rule changes. Now, fortunately, the state Supreme Court overturned those rule changes, but I do think we're seeing this pattern of Republicans across the country seeking to change the rules to rig the rules around this election because they're afraid of losing.",

And if you look at the polling out across the country, voters are very clear-eyed about who Donald Trump is.

They write: Texts, precedent, and historical practice, they note that that's the Civil War, its soldiers voting, historical practice confirmed that this day for the election is the day by which ballots must be both cast by voters and received by state officials. They then send the case back to a lower court judge and say, we want that judge to look at making sure the status quo in the eve of this election is preserved, meaning it might not change anything for this election, but this reasoning is now out there from a very prominent appeals court, and it could matter if there are ballots that come in, in another state that has this sort of rule on the books that allows vows to be counted after election day.

Whenever the group that challenge this, the immigrant rights group challenged us and they looked into it, they found in 48 hours of canvassing people that there were 18 eligible voters that were taken off of the ability to vote in Virginia.And so the judge in Virginia just today said, we can't do this. The law that Congress passed in 1993 says you cannot purge voter rolls systematically within 90 days of the election, restore these people, make sure they know if they are eligible voters.
