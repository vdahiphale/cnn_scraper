The report indicates not only did Donald Trump know he had classified materials in his possession after he left the White House, but that Trump also seemed to know there were limits on what and how he could declassified records since he was no longer president.

Sources tell us, on this tape, Trump says that he has a classified Pentagon document, describing a possible attack on Iran. We're also told you can hear paper rustling. It appears that he might be waving something around. It's unclear if he's waving this document that he's referring to, or if he's waving something else. Now, perhaps more importantly for investigators, on this recording, you can hear Trump suggest that he would like to share this information with the people he's speaking with, but he acknowledges, there are limits to his power to declassify post-presidency.

He wanted to bomb around.And so, in this circumstance, Donald Trump is trying to tell Milley, or trying to tell the people, that are in the room, that he has a document that would undercut General Milley. There is something that would discredit Milley's idea that he was trying to talk Trump out of bombing Iran. And so, in his book, Mark Meadows, who is not in the meeting, but there are two people working on Meadows book for him, in this meeting. Meadows writes about exactly what Trump was recalling in this meeting. He says a four page -- Trump recalled a four page report typed up by Mark Milley himself, it contained the generals own plan to attack Iran, deploying massive numbers of troops. And so, the Justice Department is looking into what happened around that document itself? This document with Mark Milley, that maybe the classified document that they're trying to trace, as well as what happened in this meeting, which Donald Trump is acknowledging, he had to declassify it, and then he couldn't after the president.",

And third, this whole claim that he declassified, well, here he is, in 2021, after he's left office saying, these are still classified. So, I can't show you.

Mike Pence will officially become one of those next week. As will new -- the former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. So, the wide of the never Trump lane is growing. But the question is, does that actually help President Trump? As for the Pence strategy, I was with him in New Hampshire a couple weeks ago, his advisers tell me, he plans to talk about a deeply conservative record, his fiscal conservative record, trying to draw a distinction between just his vice presidency, but also his time as governor of Indiana, and his service in the Congress as an Indiana congressman, as well. So, of course, it's a tough road for him, there is no doubt about it. There are so many Trump loyalists inside this party.

No members of the minority party vote for it.This is different.

Senator, I know you want to talk about the debt ceiling bill, I'll get to that one second but you're on the foreign relations committee, so I do want to get your take on this new pattern of attacks on Russian soil. The White House has made it clear that it does not support any attacks by Ukraine or anyone else on Russia. But is that realistic? Considering what Russia has been doing to the people of Ukraine, innocent civilians, targeted for more than a year? SEN. TIM KAINE (D-VA): Well, Jake, that is the U.S. position, and it ought to be the U.S. position. But Ukraine is defending itself. Russia has conducted an illegal invasion, Russia is engaged in massive human rights abuses. We just came from a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing about the human rights abuses being committed by Russia. And so, you know, this raises concerns about escalation. But Ukraine is trying to defend itself. And I'm not going to stand here and be the judge of people trying to protect their homeland from an illegal invasion.",

You correctly point out, we're trying to do a debt ceiling bill. The White House in their negotiation added a completely unrelated provision, there is nothing about green-lighting the Mountain Valley pipeline that has anything to do with the debt ceiling.And I think it's a very bad policy. I think every project should have to go through permitting processes, if it gets approved, then you can build it. If it doesn't, you have to make it better till you get approved. But what Congress shouldn't do is pick one project in the country and give it a greenlight, and exempt it from all permitting processes. To build a pipeline, you got to take people's land, Jake. You got to take their land. And people in Appalachia, they don't give up their land for this. If there is a process that says the nation needs it, that's one thing. But Congress exempting the operators of this pipeline from the normal permitting rules, it's just not something I can support. Now, I made it plain to my colleagues and to the White House for months and months and months, why they would add this without talking to me about it is beyond me.

There's bipartisan support for permitting reform, that's where something like this should go. What you should do is make the permitting reform process better, and then make Mountain Valley go through that. And they can do it. Their big company, with resources they can do it. But exempted completely is just something this project runs through two states. My colleague and friend, Joe Manchin, think this is good for West Virginia.
