To bring all of this into perspective, maybe if they can do that, it's a tall order, former federal prosecutor, Jennifer Rodgers; and former Deputy Assistant to President Biden, Jamal Simmons, are here with me.

This is a President, who he loves his son. He's made that very clear. And the two big pieces of evidence that they have is that Hunter, whose last name is Biden, told people, his father was Vice President, when he was out pitching business. And secondly, that the President may have talked to some of those folks, on the phone, from time to time, and said, \"Hello,\" and talked to them about the weather. Those are the two big issues here.

One report estimates that a 10-day strike would cost the U.S. economy, more than $5 billion. $2 billion, in those losses, would be the result of drivers, who can't get their cars repaired, because dealers won't have the parts. The UAW is sticking to its demands, tonight, including a 40 percent pay hike, over four years, cost of living increases, and health care coverage, for retired workers, along with pension plans.

As somebody, who's in charge, of making sure the government doesn't shut down, in my State, we go -- that is really a last resort of failure, right? And that's all it is. It's just a failure. You get nothing accomplished by it. No one feels any more pressure or leverage. It's just a big fiasco. So, the hope is that, they can continue down these parallel paths.

For perspective, on these rulings, today, joining me now is former Georgia prosecutor, and criminal defense attorney, Sarah Flack. So good to see you now that we're both inside, in air conditioning. Last time, I saw you, we were sitting outside the Fulton County Jail. The judge here is basically, though denying what the District Attorney, Fani Willis wanted, which was to try everyone together. What do you make of the call that he made today? SARAH FLACK, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY &amp; FORMER GEORGIA PROSECUTOR: Well, it's not completely unexpected. I mean, what D.A. Willis was wanting was basically, to have everybody be tried, in the next few weeks, a 19 co-defendant, biggest case that she's ever tried, that office, maybe anyone ever, in this country, has tried, wanting to do that in less than two months, after an indictment. I don't think that that was realistic, for a host of reasons. Most importantly, the defendants have a right, and their attorneys have asserted those allegations, for those, who did not want the speedy trial, to be able to review these thousands and thousands of pages of discovery and evidence. And nobody can do that in really, two months. We're seeing that's going to happen, with these two defendants.

Those other co-defendants now have a right, under the Confrontation Clause, to be able to cross-examine those other statements, made by a co-defendant.

I mean, because I don't think it is necessarily an age thing.But what I'm frustrated by is, if we're talking about being honest, out there, there is no question, in my mind, that President Biden does not have the faculties that he had three, four or five years ago. And let's just acknowledge that. That doesn't mean to say that he is not a strong leader, that he's not a strong president, that he can still make sound decisions. But let's not gloss over the issues that are coming up, in some of these press conferences. I seem to recall, during the Trump administration, there was hours of discussion, in the media, about whether Trump was clinically insane, or mentally out there. And so, I think we need to have that discussion, and have somebody come up and say, \"Look, I get it.\" Senator McConnell has had some issues, and people are starting to talk about those as well. But Senator -- President Biden is having problems. And we need to understand why. And is it affecting his ability to be President? I'm not sure that he -- it is. But I'm not sure that it isn't.",
