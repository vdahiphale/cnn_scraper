I shall not be a candidate for re-election. I have served my country long and I think efficiently and honestly. I shall not accept a renomination.

They are starting their own messaging push, trying to turn the focus directly to former President Donald Trump by releasing a new ad focusing on that Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity. So, for the Biden campaign, they're really trying to re-center this as a debate around Trump, while so many questions swirl within the Democratic Party about President Biden's future at the top of the Democratic ticket.",

What are you hearing from Democrats around the country?EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER:  Not a lot of sleep for anybody these days, John. But what is going on here is a real mix of emotions and feelings about what should happen next. A lot of Democrats starting to get ever more concerned, pushing for a decision from Joe Biden to come quickly. Some wanted this week and the decision that they want is for him to step aside. The other Democrats saying that they are ready to try to move past this if they can. This is playing out. Let's take a listen to what Lloyd Doggett, the Texas congressman, said yesterday, which got a lot of people both excited to have somebody step out, but others saying this is not what they need right now. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. LLOYD DOGGETT (D-TX):  I salute President Biden. I just feel that it's time for him to step aside if we were to be able to protect what he allowed us to gain in 2020. He delivered us from Trump then. He could be delivering us to Trump this year. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We want to give him space to make a decision, but we will be increasingly vocal about our concerns if he doesn't.That is going to be the theme of the governors' meeting tonight. It's going to be the theme of everything happening today. People looking for reassurance from Joe, and noting that they still have not seen very much of him over the course of these days. He had that one fundraiser last night, one event during the day. We don't expect to see much of him today. And then there's Friday, this big interview that he has. That may be the watershed moment.",

There's no more rain anymore, but this is going to drastically change in the next few hours. And overnight, we heard from a Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness, who said that his country must take this hurricane very seriously.And the reality is that there's a great deal of anxiety among the population. People here have seen what happened in places like Barbados and Grenada and know the same kind of devastation can come their way in the next few hours. So, there's a lot of people who are very nervous right now, people who flock to the stores to get those necessities, food, water and other things. Also, we have heard from a top government official here who told us the main concern for the government was that they needed to warn people who live in low lying areas to move to safer ground. Senator Andrew Samuda said that the government is making available more than 780 shelters for people who may need it. And this is the earliest hurricane, a Category 5 hurricane, on record in the Atlantic, and it has already ripped through parts of the South Caribbean, killing at least seven people in three different countries. The prime minister also said that all government forces are going to be fully mobilized and they're going to assist in relief efforts and also to make sure they can maintain a public order once the hurricane has passed. This is what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And look at the history that they've had with major hurricanes. This is going back to 1980. You can see a lot have made passes, but only one has made landfall. That was Gilbert in 1988. We're talking more than 40 years since they've dealt with possibly a direct hit like this.We could see landfall on the southern part of the island. Even if that eye doesn't go on land, it will pass awfully close. We're talking about up to nine feet of storm surge, incredibly heavy rain for the island, and then it continues to pass as we get towards the end of the week, headed towards Mexico. Now, when we talk about heavy rain, we're talking about up to a foot possible in parts of Jamaica because the way this moisture is coming in, tropical moisture rushing up the mountains, that will enhance some of the rainfall totals and get them closer to a foot, so really worried about landslides and flash flooding. What we also need to watch is there is some wind shear or that wind energy that tries to kill hurricanes. It's nearby. So, we'll have to see if this can waiver that intensity at all. But we still have some record warm ocean temperatures as well. So we'll need to watch this very closely in the coming days. Kate?",
