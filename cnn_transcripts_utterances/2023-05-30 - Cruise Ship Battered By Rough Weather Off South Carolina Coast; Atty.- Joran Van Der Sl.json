But you saw that video there. That's scary. And for some cases, many people said they got sick during this as well. Carnival said they did have medics and medical attention for anybody who was ill because of that storm. Rough seas though, not how you want to end a vacation to the Bahamas for sure.",

So, Rahel, these children, they're teenagers, they're preteens, and the American Academy of Pediatrics says they should be severely obese before a doctor would consider doing weight loss surgery. Let's take a look at what severely obese looks like.So, for example, for a 17-year-old girl, if she were five foot two, she should be around 200 pounds before doctors would start considering doing this surgery. For a boy the same age, let's say he's five foot 10, he would have to be around 240 pounds before doctors would consider doing this surgery. Now, let's take a look at some obesity statistics in the United States, Rahel. If you look between 2015 and 2018, five million more children -- nearly five million more children fell into that severe obesity category during those three years. So, as we can see then, the rates of severe obesity going way up. That helps explain this number. What this study did was it looked at obesity surgery between 2020 and 2021. It went up 19 percent for this age group. Up 19 percent for children and teens in just one year, Rahel.",

And for children under 13, they said try diet and exercise.But I will say that oftentimes medical organizations put out guidelines like this, and then doctors you know, sort of stretch it.

Van der Sloot is set to be extradited to the U.S. on charges of extortion and fraud allegedly committed against Holloway's mother.CNN's Jean Casarez still following this for us.

Has been from the very first day.He is confirming with CNN that there was a prison fight. It was on Saturday at maximum security prison in Peru. And why do we care about this is because of the extradition that is days away. Now, here's what Mr. Altez says to CNN. He said. \"It wasn't a direct assault against him. It was a fight among some inmates. And my client got involved when he tried to defend his friend who was injured in the leg. As a consequence, Joran got injured on his hand.\" And van der Sloot, he says, has cuts on his fingers and he has bruises. He was taken to the medic area. But I think another headline is that he could also confirm with CNN Espanol that Joran van der Sloot said \"I want to go to the United States.\" He wants to be extradited out of Peru temporarily because that's what the president of Peru is allowing for. He would then return to complete his murder sentence. But the attorney also says that he does not know the timeline at this point because he has not been told the timeline. But we know by law, and by the president of Peru, they said that it would be within 30 days from that May date that the President came out saying this, confirming that Joran van der Sloot would be extradited to Alabama here in the U.S.",
