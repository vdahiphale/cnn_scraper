In order to get to murder in the first degree, they needed that terrorism enhancement and that changes the ballgame completely. He's also charged with counts of murder in the second degree. There is also an act of terrorism associated with that charge. There is the gun charge for the ghost gun that police found on him and there are other charges as well, but they are far minor and will really not have any role. But this is certainly a significant step here by the district attorney making a very clear message to what we're seeing out there on social media. And also just the gravity of this, the level of which these investigators moved in this case and now the DA bringing this rare charge in a terrorism enhancement tells you how seriously the district attorney feels about this case and really just what's going on in the country and just what has happened here to the CEO, Brian Thompson.",

JOHN MILLER, CNN CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT: I think the facts of the case, it's a unique case in that, you know, we have seen mob hits on the street, but I can't remember another case where we saw a lone gunman allegedly involved in extensive planning walk up behind somebody, the father of two, for the specific purpose of executing him because of his position as the head of the largest health care insurer in the United States, and that, according to the district attorney, is an attempt to coerce or influence the public or citizenry or an industry towards change, which is included in the terrorism charge.",

If I'm somebody, you kill a police officer, that's one thing. If you kill a witness to a crime, that's something else too, that would rise to this first degree homicide or murder. But this is, I think if I'm someone who's brother or sister or sibling was murdered on the street, why should CEO's murder be treated differently than my loved one?

So, talk to me about how, if you would be concerned about that and how these charges may be play there. JESSICA ROTH, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, Well, I think one reason why this charge was brought is because it does sort of up the stakes in terms of the penalty that he's facing. He'd be facing mandatory life imprisonment on this terrorism first degree murder charge or second degree murder charge with the terrorism enhancement. And so, by including that, the district attorney is setting up the conditions for a plea to a lesser charge, where he actually has the possibility of at some point getting out of prison. And so, it could be a plea to that sort of regular second degree murder charge that doesn't have the terrorism enhancement. If there isn't a plea, it's also setting up the conditions for a jury compromise on that lesser charge. And so if there are people in the jury room who either are not satisfied that the standard for terrorism is actually satisfied or in some way are sympathetic to the defendant, they might be willing to convict him on a lesser charge.",

It's hard to sort of reconcile both an insanity defense, which is a really high standard under New York law, requires essentially showing the person didn't know the nature and quality of their actions, or whether they knew what they were doing was wrong. And somebody who engages in this kind of very careful planning and execution, literally of that kind of plan. And so, I think that, legally speaking, he's facing an uphill battle in making out an insanity defense. On the other hand, it may be that the defense strategy is just to get it to the jury for consideration in the hopes that it will essentially find some basis for the jury to acquit him.",

And if they even knew about the existence of the t-shirt, did they know about the connection? Then, what did they know about the guns and how were they locking up the guns?

The relevance of the -- whether or not the parents, if this shooter was focused on or really, you know, really following the Columbine, the history of the Columbine shooters and the t-shirt is evidence of that. If the parents knew about that interest in the Columbine shooting, then that makes their -- and if they also allowed the student to have like free uncontrolled access to firearms, that makes that decision look more reckless, and would then make it I would say more likely that they would get charged for something.So as we saw with the Crumbley case in Michigan, it's a very complicated mixture of facts. It's not just that the student did the shooting. It's not just that the parents ultimately purchased and provided the gun to him, but also that the parents knew that he was struggling, knew that he needed mental health, but didn't get him that sort of health, knew that he was carrying the gun, you know, so it's the layering on of those facts that raises the specter of accountability or seeking accountability from the parents.",
