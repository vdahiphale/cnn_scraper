Prosecutors also grilling Cohen's banker who helped the former president's fixer wire the $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels. So did prosecutors make their case? Three witnesses today. Plus, Trump and his allies targeting a top prosecutor in the New York case, accusing him of being a plant for the White House. So who is he? Why is Trump so obsessed with this one individual? And Taylor Swift at the center of a wild conspiracy theory. It is spreading like wildfire amongst Trump's supporters. A special report ahead. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. And OUTFRONT tonight, the breaking news, Stormy Daniels in Trump tower. Trump's longtime assistant on the stand late today. She said she saw Stormy Daniels in Trump Tower and she testified that she maintained contacts for both Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal for Donald Trump. Trump's longtime gatekeeper, Rhona Graff, was in many ways to Trump's right-hand for 34 years. And this moment on the \"Apprentice\" accurately captures her central role in organizing Trump's personal and professional life. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And that was unique. She was always formal. He was always Mr. Trump to her, but she had stature and she controlled access to him. In fact, she wants told \"Real Estate Weekly\", quoting Rhona, everybody knows in order to get through to him, they have to go through me.

Gary Farro worked at First Republic Bank and he testified that Cohen contacted him just days after that \"Access Hollywood\" grab them by the p tape was released. Now, remember, at that time, Trump's campaign was in panic mode, and Farro testified that at that time, Cohen sat up -- setup not one but two LLCs and the second was called essential consultants. It was done on October 26, 13 days before the election, and that's the shell company that Cohen then used to pay Stormy Daniels. And remember, it is that it is that payment and Trump's reimbursement of that payment to Cohen that is at the heart of this criminal case. Paula Reid is OUTFRONT live outside the courthouse tonight. And, Paula, you know, David Pecker, crucial witness on the stand and continued and continued and continued, but then they were able to very quickly move through more witnesses.

The staunchly conservative prayer leader saying the Islamic republic will not back down. Iran has warned it will take an even harder line towards the U.S. and towards Israel in the future, saying that if Israel attacks Iran or its assets one more time, the Iranians will strike back from their own territory. Tensions in the Middle East remain at a boiling point after Iran launched a massive drone and missile attack against Israel in retaliation for the bombing of its embassy compound in Syria, killing several top Revolutionary Guard commanders. Israel, the U.S., and other allies managed to take down most of the Iranian drones and missiles. But Israel then hitting back with a limited strike against an airfield in central Iran. The hardliners flying massive Palestinian flags, ripping into Israel's operation in Gaza and the U.S.'s support for Israel. The message here, Iran is ready for a confrontation. That, in fact, we are even happy about this, this man says. We are praying day and night for a second and third attack. And he says, we've had these threats for a long time, but the difference is now the people are strong. The IRGC is strong and the army is strong. And we have strong tools. And this cleric says, if the Islamic Republic of Iran will have more conflicts in the future, it doesn't mean we are warmongering. We're just reacting to the bullies. But on the streets of Tehran, concern that current tensions could escalate and even turn into war. I believe the situation will get worse, this man says, as both sides are more combative, In my opinion, it will lead to war and the calamity for people. This woman says, we are definitely concern, worried but what can we ordinary people do about it. Iran's leadership says its military is ready for combat even as they say war is not in their interest.

      "sentences": "Well, listen, Erin, we had a wide ranging conversation. We spoke in part about the ongoing Israel-Hamas war and U.S. officials have said that they believe the way out of this war would be a historic deal that includes normalization of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia and a clear pathway forward towards a two-state solution between Israelis and the Palestinians.But they've also said a ceasefire needs to be in place in order for that deal to actually come to fruition. But I asked him if it would be possible to rule out the framework for that deal before there's any ceasefire in place in a way to push ahead towards a halt in fighting. And he appeared to leave the door open to that. Listen to what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And I think the more concrete it becomes and the more it moves from the hypothetical and theoretical to something that's actually possible, that's real then everyone involved is actually going to have to make decisions and make choices. And so we're doing this work and were trying to make it as real as possible so that people do decide.",

And as I said, there's also going to have to be a resolution to the Palestinian question, or at least an agreement on how to resolve it.(END VIDEO CLIP)",
