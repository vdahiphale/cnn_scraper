      "sentences": "All right, Oren Liebermann at the Pentagon for us, thanks.Let's bring in the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, congressman from Washington, Adam Smith. Mr. Smith, Congressman Smith, you've said China almost certainly launched objects shut down in recent days. And you think this is a case of China trying to come up with new ways to spy on the United States. Is that just a hunch? Or do you have evidence beyond that Chinese spy balloon that was the first of the four objects? REP. ADAM SMITH (D-WA), RANKING MEMBER, ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE: I would amend that slightly, almost certainly overstates the case. =I mean, basically, we know that China has been using these balloons, you know, here in the U.S. and also elsewhere for some time. We also know that they represent a gap in our surveillance, a gap that had existed for a number of years as we've gotten reports about after the fact determining that this had happened, gaps that we've now closed. And that's part of the reason we're starting to see so many of these objects more often is because, well, our radars in the U.S. were primarily looking for incoming missiles and incoming jets. A slow moving balloon was apparently more difficult to track. Now that we're tracking, we see them. And the main thing is, there's a lot of different reasons why balloons could be up in the sky. But typically, if that happens, if it's a research balloon, if it's a weather balloon, the people or person that owns that balloon, first of all, lets you know that they're going to send it up. And second of all, if it got shot out of the sky, you would presume that they would say, hey, you just shot down my balloon, I just want to let you know here's what it is, that hasn't happened. So it seems like whatever these things were, they were up there for something other than legitimate purposes. So, what would that be? You know, the only evidence we have at this point is China has done that. So that is certainly possible. But I think I did overstate the case, but it certainly seems like something that was not supposed to be there.",

If you're going to fire a missile at something over the continental United States or Canada, there is risk. So best to be cautious about taking that risk. And then, secondarily, as we've heard, because they waited to shoot down that the balloon that we know was from China in a place where they wanted it to, we were able to recover it because we shot it down in a recoverable spot.

They didn't get back to us for 48 hours to even offer an explanation. Maybe it took them two days to come up with the lie that they came up with, but they need to be more transparent with us. And also, as has been reported, there are similar balloons floating over other parts of the world, and they're not being transparent with those countries either. So we don't know exactly what's going on in China, and they could be enormously helpful if they would be more open and honest with not just the American public, but with the world about what they're doing.

And yet we are also still seeing and hearing stories about people being found alive in the rubble.This remarkable video shows the moment of survivor who had been trapped in the rubble for more than eight days, made contact with rescuers by waving at their camera earlier today. Also today, two brothers, ages 18 and 20, were pulled out of a collapsed eight story building in Kahramanmaras. In the same city, a few hours later, a 35-year-old woman was rescued alive. Many of the rescue teams who have come from around the world, including from here in the United States, are bringing their much- needed experience to this humanitarian crisis. Here's CNN's Jomana Karadsheh. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Deep in the heart of Turkey's disaster zone, these Americans are in a mission like no other they've known. As soon as the earthquake hit, volunteers from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department say they just knew they had to be here. MIKE LEUM, MONTROSE SEARCH AND RESCUE VOLUNTEER, LOS ANGELES COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPT.: The type of thing that we feel strongly about because we volunteered to do search and rescue back in America. And so, it's one of the things that's just burning in our heart to get out there and help people if we can. KARADSHEH (voice-over): They do mountain rescues, have responded to hurricanes and even traveled to Ukraine. They've never seen anything on this scale before. COLIN LIEVENSE, MONTROSE SEARCH AND RESCUE VOLUNTEER, LOS ANGELES COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPT.: I mean, the destruction here is incredible. There's -- we're in one city right now where there's -- you know, we could go to each and every building and just know that there's someone that needs help there, and there's not enough people to help them.

So what assurance are you going to give this community that it is, in fact, safe, which has been their concerns all along, and now we're hearing drink bottled water.
