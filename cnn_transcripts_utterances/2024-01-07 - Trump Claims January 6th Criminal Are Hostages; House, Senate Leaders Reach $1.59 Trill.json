Good evening.We begin the hour with a torrent of bizarre and hateful comments coming from Donald Trump on the campaign trail in Iowa this weekend. This weekend alone the former president mocked the late Senator John McCain for injuries he sustained while serving his country. He taunted President Biden for his lifelong struggle with stuttering, even said the Civil War could have been negotiated. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The Civil War was so fascinating, so horrible. I'm so attracted to seeing it. See, there was something I think could have been negotiated, to be honest with you. You know, without John McCain, we would have had it done. John McCain for some reason couldn't get his arm up that day. Remember, he goes like that. He was stuttering through the whole thing. He's going -- he's a threat to democracy. I'm a -- he's a threat to de-de-democracy. Wow. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It certainly matters to, you know, core Democratic supporters who I think respond -- responded to the president's speech very favorably, but I'm not sure that it's going to penetrate the Trump base. In fact, I would -- I would gather that Biden's speech probably aroused the Trump base.Listen, Donald Trump is tromping through Iowa doing his greatest hits, you know, about the election, about the hostages. You know, mocking McCain, mocking Biden, praising dictators, the whole nine yards. But the base is eating it up. And his role right now -- his job right now, Jim, is to just stir his base up to come out and participate in those caucuses. So, you know, look, I think that I've said for all the years that Donald Trump has been on the scene that the danger of Donald Trump is that he does not believe in rules and laws and norms and institutions, and that is no -- that's clearer today than it's ever been. But he does have a following. You know, 66 percent of Republicans in a CBS poll today said that they -- you know, that they support pardoning the hostages, pardoning the folks who were convicted in the insurrection. So he is -- you know, he has masterfully sold his story. He is a master brander. He sold this story to the base. But Adam's right, the people who I think are most shameful here are the folks who know better. Elise Stefanik was -- I'm old enough to remember when she was a kind of sensible center-right Republican. Adam probably remembers that, too. And then she got the smell of possibility here, of opportunity, and she threw in with Trump with both feet and now she's mimicking his point on -- you know, his characterization of insurrectionists as hostages.

He was the one, more than likely, in conversation with some of these nefarious actors out there, nefarious groups.And if he's cooperating with the feds, Donald Trump's in real trouble. And you know, just with this little bit of information we have, it reaffirms what we've already known but it's very impactful. For 187 minutes, for over three hours Donald Trump sat there watching his insurrection in action and did not act. So let's say you believe that Donald Trump wanted this to end, and you believe he's some man of action, all he had to do was literally put out a tweet. All he had to do was activate the National Guard. He's the commander of chief, by the way, of the D.C. National Guard. It's not Nancy Pelosi, it's not the mayor of D.C. He did not call people in the Defense Department. He did not activate the guard. He sat and watched, and only, Jim, when it became obvious that law enforcement was going to take back the Capitol, only then did he meagerly put out a statement to cover his back side. But until then wanted to see if it would succeed. And Dan Scavino is reaffirming what we already know and I'm sure he's got a lot more information, too, that Donald Trump doesn't want him to tell.",

We heard Donald Trump out on the campaign trail this weekend. He was saying FBI, Antifa, and so on, still peddling these conspiracy theories. Where did -- where did the effort to inform the public, get the truth to the public go wrong? The January 6th Committee did all of that work. It was broadcast to the nation, to the world.

Number one, FOX News and other news organizations like that that aren't telling the truth, that are allowing conspiracies to come on television.And the other big failure is leaders in the Republican Party. Everybody underneath the president, from these candidates for president to members of Congress to even like county chairmen, they all are staying quiet. Elise Stefanik is a great example. She's just trying to play the game now so she can get ahead in power. And when Republican-based voters see everybody they trust telling them it was the FBI, it was Antifa, or not even addressing it, then it really shouldn't be a surprise that they believe it because the voices they trust are too cowardly to go out and tell the truth. And I think that's where we are. But, look, have no doubt, if we quantum leap to 10 years forward right now, there would be nobody that believes it was the FBI. And I think these people that are answering that to the poll today would be ashamed to admit that they ever believed that. So I think we win in the end but it's going to be a messy year.",

But there are still very many questions about whether lawmakers will be able to reach a final agreement and pass some funding bills before that first January 19th deadline.Now this agreement was struck by House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer. The two men agreeing to these top line spending numbers totaling about $1.59 trillion for the next fiscal year. The breakdown of that includes $886 billion for defense spending and $704 billion for nondefense spending. There is also another about $70 billion that is part of a side deal that would include additional funding for nondefense issues. Now these numbers track very closely with what President Biden and then House Speaker Kevin McCarthy agreed to last spring. That is something that set off a lot of frustration within the Republicans in the House, and tonight we are hearing from the House Freedom Caucus who was calling this agreement a total failure, they are frustrated that it does not include more spending cuts. And there are some concerns going forward about whether conservatives will try to use this government funding deadline as leverage to try to enact and impose stricter immigration and border policy changes. That is something that we have heard recently from some Republican members. Of course there's also the timing issues, whether the lawmakers in relevant committees will be able to actually write these funding bills, a lot -- all of the funding figures before that first January 19th deadline where some group -- will some agencies will start to lose funding, including Veterans and the FDA. And there is that next funding deadline on February 2nd. President Biden in his statement tonight said that it is time for Republicans to act. He said, quote, \"Congressional Republicans must do their jobs. Stop threatening to shut down the government and fulfill their basic responsibility to fund critical domestic and national security priorities, including my supplemental request.\" That supplemental request is relating to aid for Ukraine, Israel, and border security. That funding has been caught up in those border security negotiations. And so many questions remain for where they could actually avoid a government shutdown, but some are hoping that this will be the first step in doing so.",

A part meant to plug a door in the cabin blew out at 16,000 feet over Oregon, leaving a gaping hole, which you can see right there. After a walkthrough of the disabled plane, investigators say it's fortunate nobody died. Federal officials are now asking for the public's help finding the part of the plane that fell to the ground.And CNN's Mike Valerio is following all of this for us in Portland, Oregon. Mike, what's the latest?",

That is still within the realm of possibility. But the evidence so far is militating towards this being an issue, she said last night, with just this single aircraft. That is their primary focus at the moment.So, you know, when we asked, should we be worried about this plane, she said at this point the entire fleet is not our concern, but we should get more information later tonight -- Jim.",

We're looking at a couple of tornadoes possible, maybe some on the strong side and damaging winds also a concern. That's on the warm side of the storm.On the cold side, that oranges, that blizzard warning where the gusty winds will meet the heavy snow and drop that visibility. And then in the pinks you've got the winter storm warning up into Omaha. Chicago will also have alerts by the time we get to tomorrow. So we're taking a look at this system that will really start to flourish going into tomorrow. You have the heavy winds and the strong thunderstorms along the Gulf Coast. The snow starts to pump in the Central Plains bringing that heavy snow up to Chicago as we head into Tuesday. The heavy rain continues to shift across the southeast. And then everything works into the northeast, posing a flood threat as we go into Tuesday. Again, coming with some gusty winds, the wind gusts here will cause some of these blizzard conditions over parts of the Central Plains just knocking around that snow.

So he's obviously going to have to make a decision on Belichick.He hasn't really said anything publicly regarding his future in New England as the head coach.

That's going to be a challenge. The Wolverines are also third nationally in passing (INAUDIBLE) defense. So it's going to be a challenge, but I like Washington in this one.",
