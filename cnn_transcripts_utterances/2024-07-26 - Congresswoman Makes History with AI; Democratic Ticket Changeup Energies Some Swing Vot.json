But this is an example of how it can provide some real benefit. So, what she did was she teamed up with this company called ElevenLabs. And what they first did was they basically just took lots of old clips of her speeches and started to feed these into the AI platform, trying to like break it down into these specific units of speech. [08:35:05] And they were trying to basically get her from the point where you'd - you'd have more of a robotic sounding voice to something that's going to sound much more like her natural voice. So, listen, first of all, to what it was like before when she was just using sort of standard software. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP.

Phonemes. I mean, when you hear speech, it's actually a - these individual units. And they're made up of very, very sort of specific things to the way a person speaks, the way that you speak versus the way that I speak. You can actually sort of start to create a formula for that. And it's a unique accent. It's the intonation. It's the rhythm of someone's voice. To get that right, it's challenging, but that's what these AI platforms can do. And let me just say again, you know, she tweeted out about this, Representative. AI, there's a lot of cautionary tales out there. Again, it can be scary in so many ways.

GUPTAFirst of all, within the title of this ailment, \"progressive.\" It's just what it sounds like. This does progress. And typically where Parkinson's disease is diagnosed later in life, this is often diagnosed earlier, in 60's, sometimes even as early as the 40's. She was, I think, 56 last year when she was officially diagnosed. But you can take a look at the list of symptoms up there. I mean some of them will sound like Parkinson's, loss of balance, slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, weakness of movements, even changes in personality. But, obviously, it's this real - it's the speech thing right now that this particular technology is trying to address.

So, what are you going to look for in Kamala Harris? How's she doing among white voters, especially white men. Hillary Clinton got low 30s. She lost those three states. Joe Biden got closer to 40. He won those three states. And older voters, like those voters in Pennsylvania.

      "sentences": "That's exactly right, John. Good morning.So, we are expecting pro-Palestinian supporters to come out here and protests the Israeli prime minister's visit with the former president at Trump's property here in Mar-a-Lago. These demonstrations will be the first since these new security measures went into effect around Mar-a-Lago following the attempted assassination of former President Trump. Over the weekend, law enforcement out here, they closed the street to the east of us that runs along the perimeter of Mar-a-Lago, and that road closure will essentially last, we're told, through at least Election Day. We're told that protesters will be kept on sidewalks on the western part of the bridge that connects the mainland out to Palm Beach. And that really no one is going to be able to get onto Palm Beach itself anywhere near the Mar-a-Lago property. Streets around here, we're told, will go into lockdown an hour before the Israeli prime minister arrives here at Trump's Mar-a-Lago property, which we're told will be around 11:00 in the morning. Of course, the concern going into today is what is going to happen when some of these pro-Palestinian supporters gather at the same location that we believe supporters of the former president, as well as supporters of Israel, will also gather here later today. Here now is the sheriff talking about the overall security approach going into today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Ambassador, thanks so much for being with us this morning. Haven't had a chance to talk to you before the huge political shakeup over the last several days. So, I want you to put your political hat on first. How do you see this race having changed in the last six days?",

I think she's probably back where Biden was at his most recent peak right after his State of the Union message. So, that's pretty significant progress.But the real question now is, can she sustain that momentum? That's basically a coming home of a lot of voters. And can she define herself before Trump defines her, which they're getting ready to do. So, it's plus so far, but it's still far from clear what's going to happen in November.",

      "sentences": "We've seen her a lot over the last week. And one of the things we saw yesterday was that the vice president met with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. Our friend, Barak Ravid over at \"Axios,\" is saying that he is hearing, and this is a direct quote that he has from an Israeli official, that Netanyahu was upset about the fact that Harris spoke about the hostage and ceasefire deal as an end to the war, while Israel maintains its position that it will be able to resume the fighting after the deal is implemented. The Israeli official also said Netanyahu was unhappy with the fact that Harris criticize Israel publicly for the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and for killing civilians.Do you think - how do you think Netanyahu views the difference between now Harris and maybe Biden and also Trump?",

      "sentences": "Right.Well, I think Netanyahu should be very worried about the way Harris behaved and what she said. She was very icy in her demeanor, showed strong discipline there, and her words were clear a signal. Harry Truman should be turning in his grave now because the Democratic Party's very special relationship with Israel, I think, has disappeared. And I think a Harris administration would be a whole different world in - in U.S.-Israeli relations. I don't necessarily think it means that the - Israel's relations with the Trump administration would be better. Certainly, if you look at Trump's performance in his first term, he was very pro-Israel, I think appropriately so. But - but he's just said -- Trump has just said in recent days, Israel's got to get this war over with. It's got to get the hostages back. It's PR is terrible. Why does Trump care about that? Because he doesn't want to be defending an unpopular Israel. This is a case for him of Israel's interest crossing Donald Trump's interest. And we know what will happen in that case.",

I think the emerging China-Russia axis is the real news for the United States strategically. China has helped Russia in multiple ways in Russia's war with Ukraine. Vance worries about Taiwan. I'll guarantee you, Russia will help China in multiple ways as China puts pressure on Taiwan. The idea that these are separate wasn't accurate a year ago. It's even less accurate today. And if the U.S. focuses on one place and ignores others, it's ignoring key American strategic interests. Core national interests of the United States to our detriment.",

What do you see as the potential risks really for any president in a period like this?",
