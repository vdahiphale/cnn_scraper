And that left a lot of judges scratching their heads, exactly what did you mean by that? And this has been something that has been making its way through the courts.

And that would, of course, include the Covid-19 pandemic. A three-plaintiff suit, along with two gun rights advocates groups, and they lost at the trial court level. But then the court of appeals, again, looking at Bruen, decided that this was actually unconstitutional. But here, the Supreme Court weighing in, overturning that. But as you noted, they didn't hear oral arguments. But this is significant because it does give judges some clue about exactly what the justices meant during that Bruen case.

So to listen to these two women have totally different responses to their breast cancer was eye-opening for me. And I felt like it was a time for everyone to learn a little bit more about what it's like to support people going through this. Take a listen.

And it is difficult when you hear your friends say something like that. But it's important for people to hear and understand how to be there. It's also worth pointing out that black women have the highest death rate from breast cancer. And there's several reasons for that. And that's why this also hits home so close to me. But on top of it, it's worth pointing out the good. And that is that the death rates from breast cancer have been steadily declining since 1989. And that is because people are catching their cancer earlier. So that's why we want everyone to go out, get tested. Because if this conversation saves one life, that's all that matters.
