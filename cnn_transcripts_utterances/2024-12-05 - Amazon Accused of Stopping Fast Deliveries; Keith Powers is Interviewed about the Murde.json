It isn't 1948. It's 2024.\" And he actually told a story about his time in Iraq, while he was the commander of CENTCOM, where he said that he wanted to move a command post to the front line, and he asked both his women and his - his - his female and his male troops whether they would be comfortable with that, whether anyone wanted to not deploy forward.

And, Marc, I have to say, I'm so glad to be talking to you because for the last 24 hours, since you and others started reporting, that the DeSantis name was being really, honestly, publicly floated toward Pete Hegseth, my major question has been, what the what? Like, what's going on here? MARC CAPUTO, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER, \"THE BULWARK\": That's a good question. And a lot of people around Trump are asking the same question. This seems to be a Trump idea. And exactly what he's going for here is unclear. There's just a bunch of speculation. I'm going to do something dangerous and say some of it. The chief one among Trump's circle of advisers, who largely were cut out of this conversation that Trump had with DeSantis, was that Trump is concerned that Hegseth is not going to cross the finish line. He's got these big plans that he wants to have for the Pentagon. He wants to get the woke out. Woke in air quotes there. And he also wants to reform it. He wants to cut some fat and find efficiencies. And if Hegseth can't do it, who does he want? Well, he wants someone who's a big personality and someone whom he believes has the ability to do this sort of thing and has a military record. And DeSantis' name came top of mind. Also, it's a way the floating of DeSantis' name to put pressure on Hegseth to step it up and either get the votes or get out. Hegseth, right now, is in the process of trying to get the votes. If he doesn't he's going to go the way of Matt Gaetz and he's going to get out.",

And the Defense Department is an attractive job. It's a big, massive, mammoth agency. What, an $800 billion budget. Florida's budget, just in contrast, is about 117 billion. This is a huge challenge. This is a - an agency, a department that needs reform. And the challenge of it would be attractive to Ron DeSantis. So, I think that's what he gets out of it. What does Trump get out of it? He likes to have big names. RFK. He's got Marco Rubio and a whole bunch of other people who are chosen to be on his cabinet. They're not, obviously, confirmed yet. And DeSantis sort of checks that box. Also, I understand, and there's a dispute as to when her name has come up in the discussions between Trump and DeSantis. But Trump's daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, is interested in filling that Marco Rubio Senate seat. And the two have discussed that I've been told. Now, the degree to which that discussion has been real and whether there's an actual trade, not very clear. There are denials there's a trade, but it's difficult to see how these two guys are going to talk about DeSantis coming into the cabinet, where another cabinet member has just vacated a Senate seat, Marco Rubio, and the president elect's daughter-in-law wants the seat.

Their nominations, or their appointments by Trump, has produced a lot of backlash, understandably so, from people concerned about RFK Jr.'s conspiracy theories, to Tulsi Gabbard's trip to Syria, where she met with Assad and made some pretty uncritical comments of the dictator.

Here's what I mean. Brain, helmet moving in one direction. All of a sudden it stops. So, you're accelerating, and then you decelerate. What you want to do is slow down the rate of that deceleration. And what that basically - so, think about a car that crumples when it gets into a car accident. You're slowing down the rate of deceleration. Can you do the same thing with the brain? There's this cap, Guardian Cap, you may have seen these, Kate, if you watch a lot of football. Some players are wearing them. They're sort of a soft exterior to the - to the helmet. And it's basically designed to do just that, to just slow down the rate at which the brain, within the skull, within the helmet, is decelerating. It's not concussion proof.
