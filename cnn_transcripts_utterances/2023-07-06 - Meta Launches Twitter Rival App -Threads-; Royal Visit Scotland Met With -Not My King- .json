It starts early Wednesday morning when the U.S. Navy says at about 1And according to the U.S. Navy, that's when that Iranian Navy vessel changed course and headed away from the scene. But that wasn't the end of these encounters. Only several hours later in international waters in the Gulf of Oman, so very near where this first incident happened, another Iranian Navy vessel approaches another commercial oil tanker. This time that Navy vessel drew even closer hailing on that oil tanker to stop. So, it could be boarded or seized according to the U.S. Navy. The oil tanker issued a distress signal and that same U.S. destroyer, the USS McFaul responded at full speed. Before it got there, personnel on board that Iranian Navy vessel opened fire with small arms, hitting the oil tanker and doing damage to the ship. No personnel were injured on board that oil tanker but according to the U.S. Navy, some of those shots landed very close to the crew living quarters. And in fact, you can even see some of these pictures where those shots hit and some of the shrapnel from those bullets in these images from the defense department. As the USS McFaul, that destroyer approached once again the Iranian Navy vessel changed its heading and left that incident. The U.S. has seen these sorts of encounters and attempts at seizures before. In fact, it was in late April early May after Iran seize two commercial vessels within days of each other that the U.S. and its partner nations increased maritime and military patrols in the area specifically to avoid incidents like this. But even after all of this, the Middle East wasn't done yet. Several hours later in the skies over Syria, three U.S. M.Q.-9 Reaper drones were conducting a mission against ISIS targets when according to U.S. Air Force Central Command, three Russian fighter jets came in. And you can see video of this encounter released from U.S. Air Force Central. The Russian fighters got in the way of the M.Q.-9 Reaper drones. Dropped parachute flares and even opened up full afterburner in front of the M.Q.-9 Reapers forcing the U.S. drones to take evasive action against the heavier, more powerful and faster Russian fighters. The U.S. called it unsafe and unprofessional, warning Russian not to continue in this sort of behavior. But we have seen Russia continue down this path. According to U.S. military, ignoring the deconfliction protocols, getting close to U.S. aircraft even in one case several weeks or months ago trying to dogfight a U.S. aircraft. And of course, it was several months ago that Russian military aircraft actually hit a U.S. M.Q.-9 Reaper drone over the Black Sea forcing it down. Oren Liebermann, CNN in the Pentagon.

It is a shift in attention from Instagrams historic area in the photo and video space to this sort of witty quip tech space that Twitter has long tried to control.But as Mark Zuckerberg has been saying, you know, Twitter has had over a decade to build up a billion-user public square, and it's failed. And so, with all of the kinds of tumultuous employment changes, bugs, driving advertisers away that's going on at Twitter right now. Facebook saw its opportunity to kind of seize on that, jump in with this new competitor called Threads and try to steal Twitter's future.

They can start with essentially all of their Instagram followers.And that makes it feel like you're not shouting into the void, like somebody's actually listening out there. And it gives an opportunity for you to have that Twitter style experience with people you actually care about or know in real life. And I think that is the most exciting part about this. It's a good enough product with your existing social graph. And if you remember, that's the exact same formula -- that Instagram used to steal stories away from Snapchat becoming one of Instagrams most popular features. But that time Instagram made stories, part of its core app is in fact, it's stuck it right at the top versus Threads is a fully stand-alone app. So, its ongoing popularity will in large part hinge on whether Meta and Instagram are willing to heavily promote Threads inside of Instagram, and maybe even give it a big chunk of the home screen.",
