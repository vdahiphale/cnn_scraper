And what I mean by that is there is someone who died without reason, without cause, he should not have died. And there are arguments to be made and we have only seen that one clip of the video, and it should never have reached that point.But at the same time, prosecutors really have to make sure this was a just result and ensure that whatever the charges is the right one. We don't charge someone with a crime above and beyond because there is a very genuine emotional piece to it. There is a crime. It's maybe manslaughter in the second-degree. It's a C felony as opposed to the murder, which is vastly different and more serious. So, I think they really have to make sure that this is really done right and well and thorough because you are controlling the public opinion and emotion but you're also doing what is right for the case, even if in the end it's tragic no matter what.",

So, let me bring in the Democratic mayor of El Paso, Oscar Leeser. Mayor, thank you very much. You literally are -- I mean, your city is the epicenter of this crisis. Can you tell us what has happened since Title 42 expired? MAYOR OSCAR LEESER (D-EL PASO, TX):  Well, we have been preparing and it's important that we talk about what we had done prior to. And we have been working for this probably for the last month. We declared a state of emergency on May 1st to be able to open temporary sheltering. We had a school that had been closed down and we've been able to open that and then prepared. We have a second school that's prepared and ready to go, and then our civic center. And we actually have great working relationship with the federal government, with CBP, Customs, ICE and the county and the city. So, we were able to work and be prepared for yesterday.

A lot have their own funding and some will be -- we'll assist with. Because, again, they are not coming to El Paso, they are coming to the United States.And if you look at the numbers back in 2020 in El Paso, we had 64,000 asylum seekers. Year-to-date today, we have 281,000 have come across. So, a community like El Paso and the community along the southern border couldn't take on this type by themselves.

These are enforcement officials handing out flyers to hundreds of migrants right outside a church in your city in El Paso asking them to turn themselves in. This is unique to see something like this happening in the middle of the night, Rosa tells us.And then later, there were vehicles, their own marked vehicles coming by, again, encouraging them to go.

And, literally, that number went from 3,000 to a couple hundred within a couple of days, and that was to help them.But our responsibility as leaders here in El Paso is to make sure the El Paso community and our visitors continue to be safe. And that was a perfect example that I went down yesterday. I have been there almost every day. And we have seen the numbers go down because they realize that somebody -- really, that this wasn't a trick, but we are working together to give them a pathway to become legal and go through the legal immigration process.",

And that really did helped and we will continue to do that. And we go in there twice a day to clean the streets to make sure our visitors and also our community doesn't get infected, doesn't get sick. So, we really have been very, very proactive and we'll continue to do that.And I think it shows by the numbers last night and everything, and the thing is we still need to continue to prepare for the unknown because we don't know what's coming in tomorrow, we don't know what will be coming in a week from now.
