Now, this will be the first time that a former Vice President testifies about his former boss in a criminal investigation.

It follows in the footsteps of that very controversial meeting last year with former Speaker Nancy Pelosi in Taiwan. CNN's Fareed Zakaria joins me next to discuss China's reaction whether these meetings are a good idea. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [20:31:00] COOPER: Breaking News, moments ago, China officially responded to the meeting today between House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, along with the bipartisan congressional delegation and the leader of Taiwan at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California. This was the first time any leader from Taiwan has met with the House Speaker on U.S. soil. Last year, as you'll recall, Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan and its president. China's Minister of Foreign Affairs now says that this latest meeting \"seriously violates the One China principle\" and that China \"firmly opposes and strongly condemns this.\" He also demanded the U.S. \"stop upgrading the substantive relationship between the U.S. and Taiwan. CNN'S Fareed Zakaria joins me now with more. Fareed, from what we've seen thus far, do you think Chinese response to the stateside meeting will be the same or at the same kind of level as it was when Speaker Pelosi visited Taiwan in 2022? FAREED ZAKARIA, CNN HOST OF 'FAREED ZAKARIA GPS': I think it's likely to be quite different. They recognize that the difference, you know, in terms of how provocative that was. But look, it was a bad idea for Nancy Pelosi to go to Taiwan. It is a bad idea for Kevin McCarthy to do this. The Congress should not try to get involved in something as sensitive as this and particularly get involved in what is really the domestic politics of Taiwan. You know, the important thing to realize is there are actually two Taiwan presidents going on trips right now. There is President Tsai coming to the United States meeting with Kevin McCarthy because he insisted on it, but the former president, President Ma Ying-jeou is going to China and he is meeting there with some Chinese officials. He is on a 12-day trip to visit his homeland. That party is much more comfortable with some kind of dialog with Beijing. In the old days, they used to be in favor of some kind of peaceful reunification. In general, Taiwan has been trending more towards the party that Presidents Tsai represents, the current president, who's meeting with Kevin McCarthy. But there are a lot of Taiwanese who vote for President Ma's party, you know? So you see what I mean? Kevin McCarthy is getting himself involved in something that an American politician shouldn't. This is a very sensitive issue and better to let the administration handle it.",

Her funeral was the last, took place this afternoon.Katherine's family wrote something really beautiful in her obituary that we wanted to share with you. They wrote, \"Relationships were treasurers to her and she invested herself in every person she met. She was a supporter, encourager, counselor, cheerleader, rescuer.\" They also wrote, \"She loved well individually, creatively, insightfully, tenderly, fiercely.\" That's how Christian music singer and songwriter Steven Curtis Chapman also remembered Koonce. He performed at her funeral today, and I talked to him last week. He was heartbroken. The whole family was. And he talked about Katherine stepped into his family's pain when they were going through a tragedy. She didn't shy away from it. She ran towards them to help. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
