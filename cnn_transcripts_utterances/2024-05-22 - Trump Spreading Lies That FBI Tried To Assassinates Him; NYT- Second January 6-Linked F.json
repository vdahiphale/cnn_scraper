Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, the breaking news, Trump claims deadly force authorized -- the quotes. The former president and his allies absurdly accusing President Biden of trying to assassinate Trump. And moments ago, Trump's team sent up this newsletter, just got came into my email.

The very first line under top news, falsely claims that deadly force was authorized against Trump during an FBI raid at Mar-a-Lago that, you know, the intent of that being possible assassination.

There was shouting as you pointed out. In the end, the judge didn't rule on any of the motions, the motions that were made by the defendants to dismiss some of these charges.The shouting happened because Stan Woodward, one of the attorneys, is an attorney representing Walt Nauta. He claimed that this is there is that there's evidence of a selective and vindictive prosecution of his client and he said that during a meeting with prosecutors, they mentioned the fact that he was recommended for a judgeship and he implicated -- he said, the insinuation was that this -- that he should try to get Nauta to cooperate with this investigation. This is something, of course, that got a very sharp reply from prosecutors. They said that this was pure fantasy. Now, the judge did not seem like she was going to grant these motions to dismiss but she did seem a lot more sympathetic to the idea that this is a complicated case and the jurors may have a hard time understanding it. Now, ahead of the hearing, Erin, we saw those hundreds of pages of new documents or documents we had not seen before, including those images of Walt Nauta moving boxes at Mar-a-Lago, according to prosecutors, this is in June of 2022, after the Trump team had received a subpoena for those documents to be turned -- to be turned over to the to the government.",

You, too.And now, on this -- you know, the echo chamber that is getting louder and louder about this assassination attempt as Trump and his allies are describing it, Rob D'Amico is a former FBI supervisory special agent. So, Rob, you know, you explain to us and others also saying and Ty's explaining that it is standard procedure in every FBI operation to authorize the use of force and the conditions that were laid out. So what do you say to Trump and those who are calling this an assassination attempt, even just an hour ago? ROB D'AMICO, FORMER FBI SUPERVISORY SPECIAL AGENT: I actually find -- if people weren't taking a serious, I'd find it humorous because it's so outrageous. It's so, so over the top that the FBI would assassinate anyone. It's one of those things that every op has this in it. Every op has a triage plan. Every op has a map to the trauma center. If you look at every single operation FBI's done, you\\re going to find the exact same thing in each one of them. It goes back to -- there was some during Ruby Ridge, there was a conversation about changing the rules of force and FBI got prosecuted for trying to cover that up because it wasn't legal. But you go back to this one, it's one of those cases that if Trump was there and they knew he's going to be 1,000 miles away. They knew he's going to be in New York anyhow. But even if he was there, he probably be the safest person in the planet if the FBI came in and did a search warrant there because they're not going allow anything to happen to him in their presence. It's one of those, like I arrested a Somali pirate in Africa and literally when were on a blacked out tarmac with a disclosed jet and he looked at me when I told him he was under arrest and he looked at me and said, are you going to kill me? And I said, you're actually the safest person on the planet because you're under FBI custody now. It goes back to the same thing to accuse and you can talk about politics of DOJ and FBI and a prosecution. But to go to the fact that they're going to assassinate a former president is just so outlandish that it just hurts that anyone in this country would believe FBI to do that.",

But then there is on top of this, again, shouldn't have to make this point, but that the FBI knew Trump was 1,000 miles away when they did the raid. He knew he was not there and he was given other accommodations, right, as the former president.D'AMICO: They're coordinated with the Secret Service, so they knew where its location was going to be. And then they did go into some things that were not on normal search warrants where they talked about not wearing a raid jacket, that it'd be a polo that you want wanted to keep your weapon hidden from plain sight and things. So the sensitivities of what they were doing was actually put into the search warrant, telling the agents like, hey, this isn't a normal one. It's we want to be a little bit lower key. We want to be a little bit more discreet on certain things. So the sensitivities of who we were, who -- who he is, were taken into account.",
