It could be a troubling sign for Democrats and the president's hopes for re-election in 2024. Biden's approval rating sinking to 39 percent. Nearly 60 percent of voters think Biden's policies are making the economy worse. And close to 70 percent of Democrats want somebody else to run for president. His overall approval rating among Democratic voters, that's slipping from July.

Three in ten Americans, that's it, say things are going well in the country. Seven in ten say things are going badly in the country. And 58 percent of Americans in this poll say that Joe Biden's policies have actually worsened economic conditions in the country. Only 24 percent say they've improved economic conditions.

He's not getting credit for what I think is a fairly substantial list of achievements, and there is real concern about his age, and that has been true for some time. It continues to be true. And the reality is, if this were a referendum, he would be in deep, deep trouble. The fact-- and David just noted it, the fact that he is competitive with the guy who is the runaway frontrunner for the Republican nomination, who has some significant problems of his own, is what he's looking and, you know, there's an expression in sports that sometimes you have to win ugly. And I think that's what lies ahead here for this president in this White House. MATTINGLY:  All right. Kate Bedingfield, when we both worked on separate sides of the West Wing, I learned very early on, wandering into your office and asking straight up about polling on any given day was likely not to elicit the most friendly response.",

So, you have voters raise, for example, that they would like to see someone else other than Joe Biden as the nominee, but then when they're asked specifically who that would be, that number drops down to 1 percent.And so what you don't see here is people being asked about where Republicans-- how they feel about where Republicans stand on abortion, on guns. And we saw that dynamic play out in 2022 when people went to the polls and largely rejected what Republicans were offering. So, I think what we aren't seeing here and what it's sort of easy to look at a poll and get really sucked into the numbers, although I'll tell you, the Biden White House is not going to be rattled by this because their view is they're going to be 500 polls between now and Election Day, but there's a lot of information that isn't here that's a reminder that campaigns don't happen in a vacuum and it's on the Biden campaign to make this election a choice and to make it about the contrast between what Republicans are offering and what Biden's offering. That's a challenge. I don't think anybody is saying that's easy. I don't think the Biden White House would. That's easy. But that's the challenge before them, is to really make this about the contrast. As Biden would say, don't compare me to the Almighty. Compare me to the alternative.",

She's the only woman in the field, and she has significant general election advantages. But she's sitting at 5 or 6 percent in the Republican polls.One of the issues here has been that Republicans themselves believe that Trump is the strongest candidate they have and there has not been a coalescence around any other candidate who could challenge him for the nomination. [07:10:12] She has a task in front of her to win a Republican primary. One of the paradoxes of our contemporary politics is what it takes to win a Republican primary often makes you less appealing as a general election candidate because you have to tack so far to the right. So, we'll see how she navigates. But, you know, right now, Donald Trump is the runaway frontrunner, and it's not clear that she or anyone can overtake him.",

Americans are unsettled by things that are not always visible in headlines or statistics but are easy enough to see. And I think that kind of defines the disconnect between legislative accomplishments, the current state of the macroeconomy, those types of things that the White House wants to talk about and how people are feeling.

He believes that it's important for a president to show that he understands that people are feeling doubtful or feeling dubious after essentially a once in a generation pandemic that kind of rocked our world, more or less. So, it is a challenge. I think for the President and for the Biden campaign, they have to continue to show that they connect with people's sense of unease, but also remind them about how much has been done and critically convey a sense of optimism, remind people that we are on a good path and that there's opportunity for things to get better. I think he has a lot of proof points. He can point to a lot of things that he's been able to get done in a very divided Washington. He's been able to accomplish historic job creation, a historic infrastructure bill that's fixing people's roads and bridges, obviously the Inflation Reduction Act. There's a lot that he can point to, to say, listen, I've been able to get things done to make your life better and there's so much more to do.

And he said-- he writes, easy to see is the frequent collapse of public order on American streets, easy to see is that our kids are not all right. And he points to social media companies. Easy to see is that the border crisis has become a national one. And then he writes, not all the rune mentioned is Biden's fault. None of it is irreversible, but there is much more rune than his apologists blinkered by selective statistics and too confident about the president's chances next year can admit.Should Biden definitely run again?

And the hearing we saw yesterday, as you said, is pretty much a standard motion that we see in co-defendant cases.The defense really had an uphill battle, because the guardrails that we have from case law in when a motion to sever is appropriate are pretty set. There's lots of case law that comes down to those three things, the number of defendants, whether or not it will be confusing, whether there's so much evidence against one that it would kind of engulf the other, and whether there were antagonistic defenses. And what we saw yesterday, the defendants, Sidney Powell and Cheseboro, they weren't pointing the fingers at each other. They admitted that that there were no antagonistic defenses. There's only two of them, right? So, we can pretty much keep that straight. And then the evidence is -- there's evidence against one. There's evidence against the other. That was their main argument is there may be days or weeks where we're just sitting here, and the judge did not find that persuasive. I think their strongest argument is that it is at the discretion of the court. Judge McAfee pretty much could have used his discretion to credit (ph) it, but he said that, really, you know, the law is not on your side on this one. So, I didn't find that surprising. What I did find surprising is what we're going to see moving forward in these weekly check-ins.

He's 34 years old. He was appointed to the bench in February. And there are questions of how -- what kind of presence he would be like in the courtroom in one of the biggest cases of our lifetimes. And, initially, he kind of sat back, listened. We didn't hear much from him at the beginning of the hearing, but then he made clear exactly of how skeptical he was of the D.A.'s timeline, and also showed that he knew that he had to move fast, especially when it comes to the Ken Cheseboro-Sidney Powell hearings in October. There's a real question now, are we going to be moving on one track or two? It looks very likely there's going to be two. So, I was really fascinated to see that. It was also interesting to watch the D.A.'s office tip their hand just a little bit, more than 150 witnesses, four months, not including jury selection, pretty remarkable timeline.

But it's important for Republicans to know that he and his imitators in this Republican primary make no such promise today.
