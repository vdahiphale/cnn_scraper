But we have to be always hopeful in order to get those hostages back. I think that the progress will be determined in the next few days, hopefully. And we will see if there will be a positive prospect for that. But you know, we are doing our best, our partners are doing their best in order to get them released safely. On our views on the Israeli response in Gaza, we have seen the amount of devastation that's hit Gaza, which almost now half of it's been disrupted, and the number of people who've been killed throughout this operation is significant. And we believe that human being are human being everywhere, whether they are on Israel or Palestinians. They have the same value and this is deeply painful for all of us. And we would like to see international law applied here on also the same standards that we apply to any war being applied in that we are trying our best in keeping the communication open in order to ensure that the humanitarian suffering doesn't continue. And moving ahead with the humanitarian passages for the aid to be provided to them. We cannot deprive the people in Gaza from electricity, water and medicine and all the means of life. We believe that the situation is very dangerous. On the future prospect of this, the entire situation is very worrying for the entire region. And we believe in the absence of any political horizon and hope for the Palestinians, this issue will keep on going, unfortunately. So, that's why we need to focus on how the day after will be dealt with and how we can create a political horizon and hope for the Palestinian people.",

He is criss crossing the region calling onWashington's Arab allies to use their influence with Hamas. Meantime, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv, Friday. Really extraordinary to have two top officials from the U.S. administration meeting with the Israelis shows you how crucial and serious the situation is. His message to Israel coming out of that meeting was unequivocal. \"The United States has your back.\" For more on this, let's bring in Michael O'Hanlon, Senior Fellow in Foreign Policy at the Brookings Institution. Michael, it is good to see you. So, let's follow up on these latest headlines that we're getting, that the IDF has now gone in small teams with raids focused on what appears to be terror cells in an effort to get more information on the hostages that are in Gaza right now. Walk us through what that tactically looks like. And from the Israeli standpoint, the last time they were inside Gaza was nine years ago. How well-versed are they today in where some of these cells may be? MICHAEL O'HANLON, DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH IN FOREIGN POLICY, BROOKINGS INSTITUTION:  Greetings. Well, first of all, of course, you're correct to point out Israel has got in before. So limited recursions are not new, but it's been a while. Of course, over that period of time, Israel has been doing a lot of surveillance from very close by. And so, certainly, anything that's visible from a drone or from a helicopter is something that Israel is not going to be surprised by the locations of streets, the locations of buildings, et cetera. But in terms of the locations of people or even hidden command headquarters, I think Israel's going to have to work very hard to figure that out, and hostages naturally could be just anywhere. So, trying to create some kind of human intelligence picture, even though the sourcing is going to be hard because presumably most Palestinians won't be happy to be talking to Israeli soldiers, it's a little bit of a search for a needle in a haystack under the best of circumstances. And so, they're going to try, but I'm skeptical. They'll learn much about the locations of most of the hostages with this approach.",
