This is Chris Lacivita, who runs the Trump campaign. \"You just ended your campaign.\" So, after that exchange with Lara Trump, I pressed her on whether the Republican National Committee, again, charged with getting Republicans elected, would financially support Hogan's Senate campaign in a blue state where basically he is the only Republican with any chance of actually winning statewide office.

It doesn't play well with swing voters. But does that mean that Donald Trump will decide he is going to put aside his desire for retribution, which is a lifelong thing that he has had? No, I don't - I - it's hard to imagine. But is it possible, sure. But there's nothing consistent with Donald Trump in his life that suggests he's going to say, this is fine now and I'm not going to look at ways to use the levers of government against the people who he thinks went after him. And I should note, Kasie, he keeps insisting, and his people keep insisting, that President Biden is behind the Manhattan district attorney's case against Trump. And there is absolutely no evidence for that.",

I understand that he - he has to -- feels like - he feels like he has to say that because he believes in not showing any weakness, but no, he doesn't want to go to jail. And I don't know anybody who actually wants to go to jail, number one.Number two, in terms of his language about people would be upset. It would be a breaking point. Number one, I think it's true that there would be some kind of a reaction just based on what we have seen, although he has said things like that repeatedly, most notably in the lead up to the January 6th attack on the Capitol in 2021 by a pro- Trump mob. And we've seen less of that sense. Remember when he was indicted in this case in 2023, he openly called on people to protest against this indictment. And the results were pretty mild because the mass number of arrests that have taken place of people who were somehow involved in what took place on January 6th has been a deterrent. We'll see if that changes here if he is to be sentenced to jail. I want to note one other thing, Kasie, just since you were talking on this show about the possibility that Trump gets sentenced, right - I mean he - the sentencing is currently scheduled for right before the Republican National Convention.",

You know, I mean, there was constantly this issue of what was going to be funded for New York City. He ended up cutting the - sum of the tax implications by which New York did well in his tax bill. There's - there was just a running back and forth. And then he changed his voting registration after talking to his tax lawyers. Since then, he has been investigated multiple times. And he is clearly very angry at the city.You saw him hold this rally in the Bronx. And it was a solid event. He got a lot of people.
