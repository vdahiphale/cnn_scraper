That's how the Pentagon explained an American soldiers highly unusual entry into North Korea. And now, the question officials are trying to answer is why? Zeroing in on Donald Trump? The former president likely facing new criminal charges over his efforts to overturn the 2020 elections. We'll discuss Trump's mounting legal battles ahead. And a power play that puts millions at risk. Russia's withdrawal from the Ukraine Grain Deal threatens food security for the world's most vulnerable nations. Now, global powers are working to secure a plan B. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Private Travis King was in trouble with the U.S. Army and had faced disciplinary action for assault. He was supposed to be sent back to the U.S. But according to officials, after his military escort left the airport, he left too. King then went on a civilian tour of the DMZ's joint security area, and dashed over the military demarcation line into North Korean territory. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And two years before, in 2016, that was when the American student Otto Warmbier was arrested for allegedly stealing a North Korean propaganda banner in his hotel in North Korea. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison. A year later he fell into a coma, was released, sent back to the U.S. and died shortly after. And shortly after that incident involving the student, the U.S. state department issued a travel advisory banning U.S. Nationals -- banning American citizens from entering North Korea. As to what could happen next is absolutely unclear, Rosemary. Because there is no talking going on. No talks have taken place in recent years between North Korea and the United States and its allies. There was a period of a brief thaw under the Trump administration. But since then, North Korea has plunged itself into isolation and nothing has been able to change its behavior, whether it was decades of sanctions, whether it's shows of power like we've seen with this visit by the submarine. It's unclear what can be done to resolve this incident. Back to you, Rosemary.",

And once the Special Counsel Jack Smith was appointed by the attorney general, it was only a matter of time before Donald Trump would have to face criminal charges and be held accountable for his actions related to the insurrection and efforts to overturn the legitimate election of Joe Biden as president.",

MARTIN: We say this is right out of Donald Trump's playbook, whenever he is held accountable, or efforts are made to hold him accountable. Rather than address the merits, he always attacks. He attacks the character, he attacks the process, he attacks, you know, anyone that dare, try to hold him accountable. So, his comments about Jack Smith, his comments about the Department of Justice somehow being weaponized. They're all meritless. They are all just efforts on the part of Donald Trump to deflect from his real conduct is very serious. What we now know to be criminal conduct. We know that Merrick Garland is not in charge of -- has not been involved in the investigation of the January 6th insurrection. He removed himself from that process, he walled himself off purposely so that he would not be subjected to these kinds of political attacks by Donald Trump and his allies. Jack Smith does not serve at the pleasure of the president in the way that Merrick Garland does. So, I think we can dismiss these comments as just pure deflection and efforts by Donald Trump to gain points or curry points with his base. But they do not go to the heart of these very serious charges.",

But I think there's a series of ifs there. It's not clear yet if Beijing is particularly worried about its own food security needs. Please remember, China is the biggest producer of wheat in the world. And so, it really needs this.

The impact on world markets, however, is likely to be more limited. And that's largely because there are a lot of wheat exporters out there, and many of them actually having bumper harvest this year.

One of the largest is burning north of Athens, 250 firefighters are on the scene.And southern China is surveying the damage from Typhoon Talim, tens of thousands of people were evacuated ahead of the storm.

BARBIE NADEAU, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, you know, here room we had 41.8 yesterday, that's a record -- a record was set last year. So, this is sort of a new normal summers are hot, but there's been a 20 percent increase in emergency room calls due to heat related problems. And, you know, that's where you start to get into the situation that the authorities are most concerned with the effect this has on the people, on the population, on the infrastructure. Now, these fires in Greece, especially those close to Athens are also very concerning. You can only imagine working those firefighters working under these conditions is extreme heat and protective gear with these hot winds blowing these fires. Now, the European Union has dispatched assets to help Canada, you know, equipment and things like that so that they can help put out these fires, but everyone's concerned about fires. Here in Italy, in Sardinia, they're especially concerned, there's an alert that on over the weekend, for fires, people are to be very, very vigilant. That's one of the big concerns is that a fire like that can start, you know, accidentally with someone, you know, flicks a cigarette butt or something like that. And authorities are warning people to just stay vigilant in terms of the fires and they're warning people to stay out of the sun, you know. We're looking at high temperatures also today.
