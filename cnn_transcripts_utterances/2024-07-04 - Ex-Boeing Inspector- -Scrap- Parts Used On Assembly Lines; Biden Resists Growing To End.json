CNN's Pete Muntean spoke with the whistleblower about this report.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PETE MUNTEAN, CNN AVIATION CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): If Everett, Washington is a Boeing company town, then Merle Meyers was a company man. A 30-year veteran of Boeing, Meyers says his job as a quality control manager put his kids through college. It's a family tradition. His late mother was a Boeing inspector. Able to unilaterally decide if a new airplane just off the factory line was fit to fly.",

He is the latest whistleblower to come forward with claims of quality control lapses at Boeing. This is his first TV interview inspired by the January 5 door plug blowout on an Alaska Airlines 737 Max-Nine. Spray-painted red, bad parts deemed not up to Boeing standards are taken from Boeing's Everett plant and sent to its scrap facility in Auburn. But then one day in 2015, Meyers says a crate of bad parts were improperly sent back from Auburn to Boeing's Everett factory. Meyers alleges the practice continued for years.

One mystery here is that we do not have an exact accounting of where these parts ended up. Meyers says they range from superficial parts like fasteners to parts on the critical wing flaps that are used for landing. These parts were not returned to the scrap yard. Now, whistleblowers worried that they ended up on new planes delivered by the airlines over the last decade or so.

Lyndon Johnson, who decides in March of 1968 that he will end his reelection bid. I had begun to think about this.By the end of 1967 and in early January of 1968, he gathers two friends. The governor of Texas, John Connally, and John Connally's wife, Nellie Connally, and Lady Bird, the First Lady. And they spend three hours talking about what Johnson should do. And Lady Bird wrote in her diary. We went round and round on the same hot griddle, finding no cool oasis, no definite time for an acceptable exit. And I made -- I mentioned that -- the note of acceptable exit because to the extent that President Biden and the Biden family are thinking about the difficult decisions he's facing, no doubt, they're wondering about an acceptable exit if indeed the president decides he's not up to this race. And it took Johnson -- Lyndon Johnson a number of months to figure out what that acceptable exit would be. And he couched his decision not to run again in the -- in terms of trying to end the war in Vietnam. In focusing -- as we heard him in the clip, focusing on a diplomatic settlement of some kind with Hanoi. And so, he built that executive -- that acceptable exit for himself in that way. The Washington Post in talking about George Washington, and then -- and taking advantage of the -- of the momentous moment we are in, signaling that indeed, July 4, is one of those opportunities to strike a chord for patriotism is in a sense arguing for an acceptable exit for President Biden. But the question is, how does he see it? How does President Biden see it? Lyndon Johnson had three months to think about an acceptable exit and to get his mind around it. If Joe Biden has been thinking about such things, it's only been for a matter of days.",

As I understand it, you started off on this journey, you wanted to learn from forgotten places in the wake of the 2016 election. And then in the wake of 2020, this really cemented the idea for you. What was it about those pivotal moments in this country that made you want to complete this journey? DANNY ZIMNY-SCHMITT, VISITED ALL 3,143 U.S. COUNTIES: Sure. I think I really wanted to better understand what America looked like, kind of at eye level. I think most of us, you know, learn about different places than our own through reading, through hearing stories from family members or friends. But to see it kind of on the ground is just a very different experience.

So, having those moments, was it tough initially to get out there and have those conversations with someone you thought you didn't have anything in common with? ZIMNY-SCHMITT: Yes. I think it's very normal for us to you know, be a little bit defensive or cagey around meeting someone new. Can we trust this person? Is this someone I want to have a conversation with? Am I going to -- am I going to feel safe or comfortable? And so, I think it does take a little bit of kind of a push to get out of that comfort zone.
