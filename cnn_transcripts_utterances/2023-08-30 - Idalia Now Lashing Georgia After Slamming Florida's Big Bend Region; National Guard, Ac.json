That's going to start shoving the ocean up these rivers in the form of storm surge. So these two forms of water are going to collide and produce very heavy rain and flood potential over eastern South Carolina. Then, ultimately, extending up into southeastern North Carolina.",

We are in Pinellas County, just on the other side of Tampa Bay where there's still some flooding concerns for a part of this city.The mayor tells me they are still waiting for the water to recede so that officials get a clearer picture of the kind of damage that they are dealing with here. Jerry, if you can show them, just up the street from where we are along the coastline, you can see one emergency crew is out here on a pickup truck. They have been driving up and down further up the street out here. We're told some streets up there are pretty blocked off. Cars can't get in and out of that area. We are in Gulfport, parts of Pinellas County where we expect that a lot of this storm surge to take hold. It's what it was the one thing really that emergency officials across the Tampa Bay area and Pinellas County were worried about. They didn't want folks to be out here doing exactly what they are doing because, still, we're going to have all this water coming off the coastline out here. We have had a little bit of rain, although much of that has clear cleared. So officials really were just telling them to stay away from this part of town. We are still dealing with significant flooding. The mayor tells me that a lot of the damage does seem to have been more storm-surge related than anything else. There was one bridge that reopened earlier today connecting Pinellas County and Hillsborough County, which is home to the Tampa Bay area. But again, Brianna and Jim, right now, at least where we are, restaurants have started to open their doors, although they are not serving food. They are looking at the damage. They are sweeping some of the water and debris out, as this part of Pinellas County tries to get on with things considering the last 24 hours -- guys?",

They can be used in any number of roles, from clearing trees to helping with power lines to helping local law enforcement with traffic or anything like that. It's really where they are needed. Because of the severity or the worry about the storm, Governor DeSantis made sure to have thousands of guard members on standby. Meanwhile, Governor Brian Kemp in Georgia also said he's put about 1,000 National Guards members from his state on standby depending on the damage there. So he, too, is ready for this. And if the damage is that severe in Georgia, there's the possibility, based on the agreement, to move some Florida guardsmen to Georgia or vice versa. They can help each other out. The question, let's see where the damage is and find out where the National Guard is needed. Meanwhile, the Navy moved several ships and aircraft out of Florida, including out of a Mayport Naval Base outside of Jacksonville ahead of the storm. Those expected back later this week. And two commands based in Florida, U.S. Central Command and U.S. Special Operations Command, moved some of their personnel to a different location just to get them away from the storms so they could essentially keep on operating. Again, we'll keep you posted on when that's expected to come back to normal. But you can see how seriously the military is taking this, not only with the National Guard assistance for the expected recovery efforts, but also active duty being careful on where this is going to hit and how severe it could be -- Jim, Brianna?",
