When we talk about a ceasefire today, we need to put these people at the center of the conversation because at the heart of every geopolitical crisis are ordinary people who bear the brunt of unimaginable suffering. In Lebanon, the scale of human tragedy is staggering. Over 1.3 million people have been displaced. The World Bank recently estimated $8.5 billion in damage and economic losses with over 100,000 homes damaged or destroyed. And just to give you a number, that's $3 billion worth of housing gone. But these aren't just numbers. Their lives turned upside down and as you just said, displaced families who do not know if they have a home to return to.

A growing number of Donald Trump's cabinet picks have been targeted this week by bomb threats and so called swatting incidents.

Others threatened include Pete Hegseth, who Trump tapped for defense secretary would be UN Ambassador Elise Stefanik, and even former attorney general hopeful Matt Gates.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF U.S. NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Some potential members of Donald Trump's new government facing threats in a series of incidents that took place at their homes this week. A spokesman for the Trump transition said several potential nominees were targeted in violent an American threats ranging from bomb threats to so called swatting incidents when police are summoned under the hoax some type of criminal threat at a particular address. The FBI and local law enforcement officials are investigating now. Several top officials were targeted, including Pete Hegseth, Trump's choice for defense secretary. He said Wednesday night his Tennessee home was the target of a pipe bomb threat. Others include John Ratcliffe, who's tapped to lead the CIA, Elise Stefanik, selected for U.N. ambassador and Lee Zeldin, chosen to lead the Environmental Protection Agency. Now, the FBI said it takes all potential threats seriously, but one law enforcement official who's familiar with these incidents and investigations told CNN these types of swatting calls are quite common and often target those of people who are in the news at any given time. President Biden was briefed on these threats. A White House spokesman said the president and the administration condemns all threats of political violence. It's unclear if all these incidents were linked and how credible these threats actually were, but the timing suggests some type of coordination heading into the Thanksgiving holiday.

These threats, which came all at once, said there are pipe bombs, there are, you know, guns, there are things. Some of them were bomb threats, some of them were what we call swatting calls, which are carefully constructed to make the police come with a SWAT team thinking that there are armed people present, which can be very dangerous, especially since police don't know when they're going, that it's a fake call.But it's a pattern of threats that came together either from one person, one group of people, or maybe some who saw the threat and decided to copy it. But I think the key is to keep the threats in perspective. They have a specific purpose.

And that part of the game is whoever loses the video game or online activity that they're playing has to go do the threat and prove that they did it.So you have a number of possibilities here. A lot of the times, these things emanate outside the United States, but sometimes they emanate from an IP address that is spoofed to appear to be coming from outside the country. So the FBI is going to have to go through a lot of layers and hopefully, from their standpoint, look for that mistake where somebody slipped up and left them a clue that is going to bring them to one or more suspects here. And, Anna, I mean, while the threats are not credible, and that's a good thing, the crime is very serious. Some of these are elected officials, some of these are government officials, and some of them are about to become government officials.

More than 2 million people in the country which borders Ukraine, chose a candidate vocal about his pro-Russia and anti NATO stance. His success in part attributed to a relentless TikTok campaign in which he showed off his love of riding and martial arts, church and country emulating Vladimir Putin, whom Georgescu admires and it's not only the Russian president's bare chested, virile image that's being copied, but his politics too. Traditional, anti-Western, anti NATO. To the right, even of the country's far right, Georgescu stood as an independent but now heads to the runoff after winning almost 23 percent of the vote.
