But clearly, he's facing more and more pressure from inside and from outside of Haiti to get out of office, to move out of office, and show what the plan of succession for Haitians will be. It is unclear, though, how Haiti could hold elections of any kind while the security crisis continues to worsen and worsen. All eyes are on a force of soldiers in Kenya, 1,000 troops, who have -- their government has agreed to send them to Haiti to take on the gangs, but no update as of yet when those troops will deploy.
