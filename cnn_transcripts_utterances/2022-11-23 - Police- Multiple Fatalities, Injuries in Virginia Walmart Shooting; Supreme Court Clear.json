BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Right, Whitney, we have some information tweeted out by the city of Chesapeake just a few moments ago. We have an update on the casualties. According to the city of Chesapeake, seven people are dead that includes the shooter in a tweet from the city of Chesapeake just a few minutes ago. We are also told through an affiliate WTKR who is told by a hospital spokesperson, that five people are being treated for injuries at Sentara General Hospital in Norfolk, not too far away from here. And we have a statement from Walmart that was issued just a short time ago. Quote, we are shocked at this tragic event and our Chesapeake, Virginia store. We are praying for those impacted, the community, and our associates. We're working closely with law enforcement, and we are focused on supporting our associates. That is a statement from Walmart. Now, as you mention a short time ago, we do have some sourced information about how this shooting unfolded a little less than seven hours ago, just to behind, me inside that story there, according to law enforcement source, through our colleague John Miller in New York, the gunman is a former employee, or possibly a current employee who walked into a brick room where other people or gather, and opened fire. The government leader turned the gun on himself, and is deceased. That is what we know now. And it took several hours for police to process, comb through the story. You can see behind me, it is a very large or more, store as many of them are, and they had to chrome through row upon row. One of the police officials told us they had to go and see if people were hiding in some of these roads, and a big story like that that is kind of what they were up against. It took hours to process, but we now know, Whitney, the afternoon processing the scene here, going through the store and looking for people hiding and other possible victims. We now have a casualty count at seven, that including the shooter, and at least five injured -- Whitney.",

And so, right now, a lot of the discussion focuses on Colorado's red flag law.So, I'm hoping that you can explain how that law works for us and looking back at the facts we do know about this case would enforcing that red flag had stopped the shooting?",

What we have in Colorado that we can locally call red flag law is really the extreme risk protection order and it's available to close family members or law enforcement to go seek from a judge when they have reason to believe that a person is an imminent danger of other harming themselves, more others through the firearm if they have access to it.Now, in this case, a lot of speculation and interest in whether or not this may have changed things one, what we don't, know the party information law enforcement, had the case with the -- what we don't know is, what actually happened with that case, charges never, filed dismissed by the DA, they don't proceed on to trial when something happened, we don't know yet. But your bigger question is this, would have made a difference? And the red flag law, as great as it sounds, it only works if everybody that's part of the transaction of the firearm is law-abiding. If this gun was obtained through a friend, a neighbor, a theft, a ghost gun, a non-licensed FFL, federally license firearms dealer, if it's obtained to any of those means, there's no background check, that red flag law is meaningless",

You have to remember that he did not disclose this tax returns when he ran for office both from 2016 and 2020.

Now, President Biden continues to receive majority support in terms ofapproval rating among Democrats and former President Trump continues to pretty strong numbers among Republicans so doesn't appear that they are in the likely position for those nominations but anything can happen. Two years is a long time. President Biden has not officially said he is in the race, so we will see whether or not there is another Democrat gets the nod.

We've seen Israeli police, you can see behind me still gathering evidence. They've been collecting evidence. We've seen things like nails and screws on the ground. Those may have been packed into the bumps for maximum injury. Now while it has already been a very deadly and violent year for both the Israelis and Palestinians, there's been a series of attacks targeting Israelis, and there have been nearly daily Israeli military raids into the West Bank. An attack like this has not been seen in years that is bringing back many memories to the second Intifada in the early 2000s where there were almost regular suicide attacks and bomb attacks of targeting buses, both stations. But Israelis have been used to not seeing these types of attacks in recent years. This is a new deadly escalation that is showing technological sophistication, and coordination. Now, the U.S. embassy has condemned these attacks, saying that terrorism is a means to no end, and the Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid at this moment holding a assessment regarding the situation there are fears that could be further attacks later on -- Whitney.",

They say authorities are holding bodies of those killed in protest, refusing to hand them over to families, and sometimes sending them over on the condition that these families not speak to the media and get false accounts of how their loved ones were killed.

A lot of concern over the situation is only going to get worse. The United Nations Human Rights Council's meeting in Geneva tomorrow, on a special session on Iran.
