However, the prosecutor, after clutching his or her heart, can certainly work to ameliorate this by showing that there were many phones calls at this particular time, that this was a conversation that could have happened in the midst of that same phone call and certainly can point to all of the corroborating evidence it may have to support other aspects of the testimony of Mr. Cohen.",

David Frum, what is your sort of big picture view on Michael Cohen and how -- how this is all playing out?DAVID FRUM, STAFF WRITER, \"THE ATLANTIC\": Well, the Trump defense is that everyone in the Trump Organization was a criminal and a liar and a crook, except for the boss, who was not. That seems like kind of a hard case to argue. But here's the thing I really worry about. As -- as you watch the cut and thrust of day-by-day, Donald Trump is both a squalid tabloid sleazeball and a dangerous constitutional criminal. And the mechanics of this trial drag us into squalid tabloid sleazeball world. And if he -- when, I think, the jury retires to make its deliberation, the question they're going to face is, they can say, obviously, Trump is a liar and Michael Cohen is basically telling the truth. Obviously, the records were tampered with. Does anybody care? Is this just a payoff? And the mechanic that resulted in a mistrial for John Edward [SIC], which is, of course, he did it. We're just not going to send him to prison for it, because it seems constitutionally unimportant. It seems like a tragedy in the man's personal life. Leave it alone. The trial was punishment enough. That's the -- that's the mechanism that I worry. And so we -- as we ponder these line by lines, we're missing the big task, it seems to me, that the jury faces is deciding whether these squalid tabloid sleazeball antics amount to anything that the public should care about.",

      "sentences": "Yes. I mean, the public is honestly confused. We've been asking voters and focus groups for the last couple of weeks, you know, if they're following the trial.And, you know, one of the most interesting answers I got was from a two-time Trump voter who's been trying to follow the trial. And she says, Well, I turn on FOX, 'The Five' on FOX, and they say this is going to get thrown out, that there's nothing there. And then I turn on ABC, and they say Trump's going to prison. And I feel like I'm watching -- because -- because they can't watch what's happening in the courtroom, it's being filtered through the media. And so I think the opinions about what's happening are so all over the place that the voters can't get a grip on it. And one of the things that the court -- the cases do is they direct people to look backward about Trump and focus on things that people have more or less processed, as opposed to looking forward about Trump and who he's going to be, potentially be as a second-term president and as a constitutional threat and very dangerous.  And so instead of talking about that, we are talking about these tawdry details. And the public has baked in that Trump is tawdry and a sleazeball. And so I'm not sure it's introducing new facts. And so yes, I haven't -- and like, they are just not able to follow the back-and-forth day-to-day on this clearly. HUNT: Yes. You know, I've got to be honest with you. I mean, I'm doing it in real time. I'm literally listening and watching from our reporters in the courtroom. And it is tough to do it, even when you are paying super close attention to every single tiny little detail. Is this how the Biden campaign team is looking at it, too?",

I'm not saying it's not important. It's super-important to the Trump family. But this isn't helping us make a decision if he should be president or not. This isn't looking at his agenda. We're not getting anything to have a contrast with what -- what President Biden is out doing. So it's like you're comparing something he did, you know, in the past to something we're trying to move forward. And it's just -- it's not fair to the American public.",

And remember, you know, you're all talking about how the public is getting in the weeds, you know, or shouldn't and can't focus on where this leads us in November. We've got to be careful at a trial, too. There's a lot of weeds you can get stuck in.

And one of the things we've learned, I hope, from the scandals and allegations of the last year is some -- the court can't be subject to Congress. It can't be subject to the executive, but it needs to find some way to convene its own disciplinary body that actually can enforce rules on judges and give them some advice in advance, where you can say, I'm thinking of flying the flag of a protest movement. Is this OK? I mean, there are things that presumably -- you can fly a pumpkin flag at Halloween. That would be OK. Is this OK? There needs to be some way to do that.

We don't know. But people who are in marriages are quite close. They know what the other is doing.

This was -- and these people are in the most important role and the least accountable role in our system of checks and balances. And now you have two of them where there are direct signals, direct sympathies with the insurrectionists. That is outrageous. That is insane.

Power outages a huge problem. People in the dark there in Costco yesterday. Winds up to 84 miles per hour at the New Orleans airport, gusts 75 to near 80 miles per hour across parts of Texas. And that's leaving many in the dark this morning, nearly a million people without power, most of which, more than 800,000 of those people, are in Texas. And we've got some heat ahead in the next couple of days, so that could be a burden, as well. Here's the rest of that line of storms. It has weakened some. Still intense lightning just off the coast there of Panama City, but it is dumping some heavy rain. We will continue to find that severe risk as we go through the day today. That slight risk, level two out of five, is a little bit less than what we had yesterday. But it could still pack a punch with some damaging winds, large hail, and a couple of tornadoes from New Orleans up into Mobile, and then up into Montgomery, as well, as the storms continue to push their way East, reignite with the daytime heat. And then we could have additional storms going into Saturday. So still a busy couple of days ahead -- Kasie.",
