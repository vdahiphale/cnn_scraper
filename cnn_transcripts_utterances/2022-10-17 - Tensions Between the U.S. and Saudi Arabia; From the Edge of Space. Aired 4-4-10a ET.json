Just think about it, when I started skydiving at the age of 16, this is where my journey already started without knowing where it goes, you know? But 35 years later, I`m standing there on top of the world outside of a capsule in the stratosphere, and I say what I had to say sometimes, you have to go up to understand how small you are. And then I said, I`m coming home now. I`m coming home now. And then I was on my way -- accelerating to 890 miles an hour in just a little bit more than seconds. It was a very breathtaking moment.",

How did I do this? By trial and error, you know? I was moving my arms and legs around trying to figure out what will stop that spin. But you have to keep in mind at that altitude, it`s almost a vacuum so there`s no air. It`s like sailing without wind means your skills do not work. And that at around 90,000 feet, there`s a thicker layer of air that helps you a lot. I was able to use the thick layer of air to control myself. Once I turned around, I was stabilized as a rock, and from that moment on, this was actually the first moment where I started to enjoy my skydive. And once I opened my parachute and I opened my visor, this was the first moment after seven hours where I was breathing outside air.

That`s why I was so worried about my landing. But I nailed it. You know, I was happy when I landed. The only thing that I didn`t know when I landed is did I break the speed of sound, because you know once you`re in free fall, you know you`re fast but you have absolutely no indication of how fast you actually are. So when I landed, the record verification guy showed up, he took my chest peg off. This was this big white box that I was wearing part of my chest and inside, that was the record verification device. He took it. He disappeared in a tent. He plugged it in the computer. It took about 10 minutes. I was waiting outside and after 10 minutes, he came out and said, hey, thumbs up. You were even faster than the speed of sound. And at that moment, I was really happy and satisfied because to me, breaking the speed of sound as the first human in history, that was definitely something. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
