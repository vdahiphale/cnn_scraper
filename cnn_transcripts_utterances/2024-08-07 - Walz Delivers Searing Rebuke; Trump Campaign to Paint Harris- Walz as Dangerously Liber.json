      "sentences": "Well, John, they're very much racing to define Tim Walz, especially before they think that the rest of the country can make up their minds about him themselves.Now, part of that plan is to attack him as someone who is radically liberal. They're trying to paint him as more liberal than Kamala Harris and Joe Biden. And, look, some of that's going to be a little bit difficult because if you look back to his record in Congress, he spent 12 years as a congressman from Minnesota, he was viewed more so as a moderate Democrat. Part of the things that he did were vote with Republicans on strengthening the border. He pushed for deficit reductions by trillions of dollars. He also had the backing of the NRA. Now, one thing that the Trump campaign is planning to paint him as is anti-cop and anti-gun. That is something you can probably expect Walz and his team to push back on. But I will say the NRA did ultimately pull their support of him when he was governor. And that's why you're going to see the Trump campaign really try to focus on his positions over the last four years. Walz was much more progressive as a governor. Some of the things that he did. He enshrine (ph) abortion rights into law. He protected the rights of gender affirming care. He moved to expand universal gun background checks. These are the things that the Trump campaign is seizing on. They are trying to paint him as being very progressive. They're trying to portray both Harris and Walz as being representative of California, San Francisco Democrats, not middle America, as you just heard Eva lay out. That is what Walz is trying to do. Now, I also just want to point your attention to some other notable things they're going to do. They're going to try to go after him for his handling of the protests when it came to the aftermath of the murder of George Floyd. Again, really trying to harp on all of the more controversial aspects that they can find. And this has really had kind of a struggle that they've had over the last several weeks in their efforts to define Harris. Of course, remember, they have spent their entire election cycle thus far up until about a month ago, or a couple weeks ago I should say, focused on Joe Biden. And so they're really racing to try and figure out which attacks stick, both for Harris and now for Walz. John.",

They raised taxes. But that's what Democratic governors do in blue states. And that's OK. What she did, in my opinion, was confirm her instincts. It's interesting to me that she has been trying to do away with the position she took in the 2020 presidential election. She never got out of 2019, but she took a lot of radical, liberal positions. She's been trying to walk those back. Then she turns around and picks Walz, who is a traditional liberal Democrats. So, I think it's a confusing message from the Democratic campaign. Is Kamala Harris moderating herself or is she confirming to us what she really is, which is a very, very progressive liberal, probably more so than most of the country. SIDNER: Van, I want to talk about, you know, abortion, which is also on the ballot anyway you shape it. Not the number one issue, certainly, for - for voters. They have said time and again it's the economy and potentially immigration that's on the issue - that is the biggest issue. But it's certainly on the minds of people. And here's how Tim Walz talked about his personal experience with IVF, which Democrats also saying is under attack as well. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. TIM WALZ (D-MN), VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: This gets personal for me and my family. When my wife and I decided to have children, we spent years going through infertility treatments. And I remember praying every night for a call for good news. The pit in my stomach, when the phone rang, and the agony when we heard that the treatments hadn't worked.

And you can say whatever you want to, Project 2025 is very clear. They want to take more freedoms away from women. And even if Congress doesn't vote for it, a President Trump can just have the FDA outlawed the drugs that are used for abortion, and you would have a ban on day one.

So, at some point, she's going to have to answer some questions. And it may be that a debate stage is the only place Donald Trump can get that done.So, if I were him, I would be saying yes to some debates. I would be trying to get those on the schedule now because if they don't, people are not going to know the real Harris record, other than through paid media, which has its limitations.
