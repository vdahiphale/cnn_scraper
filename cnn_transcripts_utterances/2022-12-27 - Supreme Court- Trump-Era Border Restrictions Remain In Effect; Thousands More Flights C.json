That includes the court hearing arguments beginning in their next session, which is in February of 2023.Now, this is a five-forward order that is ultimately a victory for Republican led states that wanted to intervene in this case to stop the termination of this authority. And what it means on the ground is that border officials will be able to continue to expel migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border, either back to Mexico or their native countries for the next several months. The administration, as you know, Wolf, has been preparing for this to end. Those preparations will likely continue to happen, but it ultimately won't end anytime soon.

The airline, of course, acknowledging a little bit that some of the failures that led to what happened over the past few days, but that is cold comfort for the many passengers who are stranded. And I should add, Wolf, while the lines here are a little bit shorter, the cancelations remain. And I think that is likely because a lot of folks aren't waiting at the airport anymore.

From what I can tell, Southwest is unable to locate even where their own crews are, let alone their own passengers, let alone baggage.So I conveyed to the CEO our expectation that they are going to go above and beyond to take care of passengers and to address this. They indicated a number of issues that they're having with systems, legacy systems for managing their schedule and where their crews are. But the bottom line is the rest of the aviation system has been on the road to recovery since the worst days of the storm going into Friday of last week. As of today, as I'm looking at the different airlines, most of them are in the low single digits in terms of cancelation rates, averaging about 5 percent for all of the other airlines. For Southwest right now, we appear to be north of 70 percent. So their system really has completely melted down. And I've made clear that our department will be holding them accountable for their responsibilities to customers, both to get them through this situation and to make sure that this can't happen again.",

They provided commitments in writing, including Southwest, that they would go above the previous level of what you would do to take care of customers with things like covering the cost if you get stuck and you need a hotel or a meal in addition to rebooking you to get you on your way.Now that we have those commitments that were made to us over the summer, we're going to be using that as a tool to hold them accountable. And I made that clear to Southwest leadership. Now, they did -- the CEO pledge to me that they will not only meet, but they will exceed the customer service standards and commitments that they have made to us in the past and that we're in a position to enforce. I also talked with union leadership from the pilots and from the flight attendants. They've made clear that they have been raising the alarm about these issues in their systems for some time, and that this really has to do with decisions and choices in terms of the investments that this airline has made or has failed to make over the years that seem to be catching up to them now. Look, we all understand when you have a major historic storm hitting the system and hitting hubs in every part of the country, we know that that's going to have an effect on the aviation system. But what's really concerning here is that while all of the other parts of the aviation system have been moving toward recovery and getting better each day, it's actually been moving the opposite direction with this airline.",

BUTTIGIEGWe're also in a position to use enforcement powers and fines to hold airlines to the things that they have now committed to us, pledged us, in writing that they'll do. Those increased customer service commitments that we extracted from them over the summer around things like vouchers. And you ought to know if you're a passenger in this situation right now, first of all, you're entitled to a cash refund if your flight is canceled and you're not traveling. Another thing you should know is that when you're in this situation and the airline is responsible, which is clearly the case right now, then you can get those kinds of vouchers for hotels, restaurants. But what I talked about with the Southwest CEO is that a passenger shouldn't have to request that. They need to be proactively offering that. He pledged that they would.

So there is information that the airline has provided.They've set up, as I understand it, a website that you can use to -- without having to wait on the phone to get your money back and to put in some of the expenses that you're experiencing. But I want passengers to know we have a website too. And when an airline is failing to meet its customer service commitments, failing to meet the responsibilities that we have in black and white for airlines to live up to, you can let us know and we will follow up. We have a consumer protection team. They follow through individually on these kinds of complaints and issues. So if you're not getting results with the airline, let us know and we will follow up.

That's a situation that, again, does not appear to be a system wide situation because we're seeing the cancelation rates with some airlines actually back to what we would consider kind of normal, fair-weather rates. It is concentrated in the systems and the issues associated with this one airline.

This is a company that needs to step up, needs to win back the trust of its passengers and its employees. And I want to stress, employees have been put in a terrible situation. I've talked to representatives of the pilots union and the flight attendants union. They are frustrated. They are often stranded. They themselves are often sleeping in airports.

Just released 13 more witnesses their transcripts, and that does include some significant names who had extensive insight and communication with the former president and his allies all around January 6.So some of those 13 witnesses, they include Ali Alexander. He was the leader of the Stop the Steal group. He helped organize rallies before the Capitol attack. Also Brad Raffensperger, the Georgia Secretary of State, who, of course, had that infamous phone call with Trump where he asked him to find more votes. Raffensperger did testify publicly for the committee this summer. Also, some new transcripts from then Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin. And notably, here two more transcripts from Cassidy Hutchinson. She, of course, was the star witness of that surprise hearing over the summer. She had that insight as the closest aide to Chief of Staff Mark Meadows. And in this testimony that we're getting from Cassidy Hutchinson, it's from May and June 2022. Interestingly, June 2022 was just eight days before she testified publicly. And in that testimony, behind closed doors, she actually had a new attorney because for the first three appearances before the committee, she was represented by an attorney who was paid for by Trump World. And she talks extensively about how she was so conflicted because she was represented by somebody from Trump World, felt sort of a duty to protect the former president. But in this June 20, 2022 transcript, we're seeing that her new lawyer, who was Jody Hunt, who represented her at that public hearing, he said to the committee that Cassidy Hutchinson wanted to correct some of her previous testimony. He said, \"In some respects, to correct, she wants to be clear about it.\" And this is important because in the testimony that we've seen from Cassidy Hutchinson, she had repeatedly said to the committee that she was told by her Trump world attorney, Stefan Passantino, to maybe say, I don't recall more often than she was comfortable with. And, Wolf, she really had some key details to share with the committee. We heard it in the public testimony. You know, she was the one who talked about how she heard the story that Trump lunged at his Secret Service driver because he wanted to go to the Capitol. He also, according to Cassidy Hutchinson, she had heard that he was not concerned about people with weapons at his speech before they stormed the Capitol. She also told that illuminating story from December 2020, when, right after the Attorney General Bill Barr, had given the interview to The Associated Press, saying that there was no widespread election fraud. Cassidy Hutchinson walked into a dining room after Trump had been there. She said she saw Ketchup up against the wall, and one of the valets had told her that he had thrown his lunch against the wall. So a lot of illuminating details from Cassidy Hutchinson that, Wolf, initially, she was very reluctant to give, even encouraged not to give a lot of those details. And finally, in this transcript, where our team is reading through now, June 20, 2022, eight days before her public testimony, she was finally spilling all of these details, Wolf.",

You know, it was more than 40 -- more than 4 feet, I should say, almost 50 inches of snow fell in the city of Buffalo over the course of two days. And so that snow has really piled up.On our way in, we saw huge snowdrifts blocking the doors to businesses and shops. And this is the kind of snow that a lot of snow that's going to drain. It's going to melt very quickly as the temperatures rise over the next few days. It's going to be near 50 degrees over the next few days. That is going to lead to a rapid melting. So that's another reason they want to make sure that they can clear these streets, to make sure that things can drain properly so that they can avoid flooding. Wolf?",

I can tell you 17 were found outside in the snow. Three were as a result of cardiac events from snow shoveling, snow blowing.Seven appear to have been from hypothermia for not having heat in their house due to the loss of power and the lack of heat. Three were in vehicles, as Athena noted, and one appears to have been for an EMS delay. In other words, our emergency responders could not get to the person because of the snow. They were blocked, and by the time they got there, it was too late. So we've lost 31 residents. The youngest, I believe 22, the oldest in their 90s. And I just have to offer my deepest condolences and sympathies to any individual who lost a loved one from this terrible blizzard.",

I'm very, very disappointed. At the same time, we're unfortunately finding bodies on the street and in snowbanks. People of our community, which is known as the City of Good Neighbors, have been involved in looting. It's disgusting. I hope to throw the book at them, whatever they can get to these people because we need to come together in these situations, not take advantage of them. So I'm very proud of our Buffalo PD for the work that they've done. The Erie County Sheriff's Office, all the local law enforcement.

CNN's Will Ripley is on the ground for us in Ukraine.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): So many tears for yet another victim of Russia's war in Ukraine. Mourners in Kyiv, paying their final respects to a fallen Ukrainian soldier, a husband, brother and son. He was reportedly killed near Bakhmut. Intense fighting has the city almost unrecognizable. Debris litters the streets. Buildings are on fire. OLEKSANDR, BAKHMUT, UKRAINE, RESIDENT (through translation): Our house is destroyed. There was a shop near a building. Now it's not there anymore. RIPLEY (voice-over): In this besieged city across the country, millions are still living without power. Ukraine accuses Russia of persistently targeting Ukrainian energy facilities, giving engineers little time to repair the grid before the next strike comes. Ukraine's energy minister describes the situation across his country as really difficult. Strikes have left Ukraine with a power deficit, unable to meet the basic energy needs of the country. Fears are growing among Ukrainian officials. Moscow could be planning large strikes around New Year's Day. In this small village near Kherson, people are bracing for a bitterly cold winter. A winter without power, collecting firewood and other supplies to protect against plummeting temperatures. TETYANA KOVALIVA, POSAD-POKROVSKE, UKRAINE, RESIDENT (through translation): We will get through the winter because we fixed the chimney and now we can heat the house. We will get through it. We do not have any other option. Where would we go? RIPLEY (voice-over): On top of all this, a war of words brewing between Moscow and Kyiv. Russia's Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, issuing an ultimatum. Ukraine must bow to Russia's demands, including giving up occupied Ukrainian territories, or else the Russian army will take matters into its own hands. Ukraine's President, Volodymyr Zelenskyy says that won't happen. He's vowing to retake all captured Ukrainian ground. Diplomatic negotiations seem just as gridlocked as the battlefield. Little sign of peace coming this holiday season in a conflict that continues to grind on. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And the lines have not moved. They're staying exactly the same. You have around 9 million people suffering from blackouts right now across this country. And, Wolf, the number of cyberattacks by Russia has increased threefold in the last two years. From the Ukrainian point of view, they think basically Russia is doing everything the Ukraine it can in its arsenal, except for nuclear at this stage. And it's really horrific to see.",
