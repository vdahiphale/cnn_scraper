Tonight, six are dead in a mass shooting at aJehovah's Witness gathering in Hamburg, and a pregnant woman lost her unborn child. We are live in Germany with the latest on the investigation. And then later, Donald Trump's legal woes. New York prosecutors have invited the former president to testify in a hush money investigation involving Stormy Daniels. What that could mean about possible criminal charges. Plus, we preview the glitz as well as the glam and potential upsets ahead of this weekend's Oscars a year after of course, that infamous slap. But first, this evening, I want to let you know that we are monitoring the White House at this hour. Ursula von der Leyen, that's the president of the European Commission is visiting Washington, very wet as you can see there this evening this afternoon here in Washington, are meeting this hour with President Joe Biden. We expect to hear brief comments from the two leaders inside the White House any time now. Of course, as soon as that gets underway, we will of course  bring that to you. Well, we begin tonight in Germany where the city of Hamburg is reeling from a deadly mass shooting. Six people have died and eight others are injured. Some critically after a gunman  opened fire at a Jehovah's Witness center. A pregnant woman also lost her unborn child in that attack. Now, this video shows the moment police entered the building during the shooting. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz says he's stunned by the violence. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) OLAF SCHOLZ, CHANCELLOR, GERMANY (through translator):  Last night, there was a terrible incident in my hometown of Hamburg. Several people have become victims of a brutal act of violence. In the district of Ostendorf, a person running amok opened fire in a congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses, killing several people and then apparently executing himself. It's feared that further victims will succumb to their severe injuries. We are stunned by this violence. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And of course, we are working with -- to connect with the journalist in Germany. Of course, as soon as we have connected with him, we will bring that to you. In the meantime, I want to take you to Ukraine, almost a half million people in Ukraine's second largest city are in the dark more than a day after a massive Russian missile attack. And this is Kharkiv, one of the many cities Russia targeted early on Thursday. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says Russia fired a total of 95 missiles right across the country, six people were killed in the assault. And as one of Mr. Zelenskyy's advisors told me yesterday, the country's air defense has struggled really, to keep up, intercepting only 34 Russian missiles. Our Melissa Bell shows us our Ukraine is facing the threat. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MELISSA BELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Every missile taken down means lives saved. Here with the German short-range Gepard or here. One missile taken down with a machine gun. (SOUND OF ARTILLERY) UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  It's a pity that I didn't shoot down three.

That is according to four U.S. sources familiar with the matter. They tell CNN that Russia's growing partnership with Iran is dangerous, not just for Ukraine, but for Iran's neighbors of course, in the Middle East. Natasha Bertrand joins me now from the Pentagon for more on this.

      "sentences": "Yes, Isa, so this has been going on for at least several months. And the U.S. has seen multipleinstances of it happening. Now, what is going on is that Russia is able to capture some U.S.-provided equipment on the battlefield in Ukraine, when for example, Ukraine is forced to withdraw rapidly or if they are overrun. And what they're doing with that equipment in many instances is they're actually giving it to Iran as part of this growing Russia-Iran defense partnership that we've seen really intensify over the last year. Russia has been giving Iran this western-provided equipment, which U.S. officials believe Iran is going to use to  essentially reverse-engineer it and try to reproduce it, so that it could then make its own version of the U.S.- provided U.S.-style equipment and proliferate it in the region. Now, these are things like shoulder-fired missile systems, things like javelin anti-tank weapons, stinger anti-aircraft systems. And again, this is not happening on a very wide scale and it's not systematic. And the Ukrainians do tell the Americans every time they lose some of that equipment to Russian forces. They are very good about kind of self- reporting those losses to the Defense Department. But look, the bottom-line here is that the Iranians are very good at reverse engineering U.S. equipment. One of the top weapons that they have in their inventory is an anti-tank guided missile, that is actually a reverse-engineered American-made missile that they have been using since the 1970s. Just a few years ago, the Iranians were also able to intercept an American drone and reverse-engineer that and create their own drones which then flew into Israeli airspace. So, the concern here is that because of this partnership that they have with Russia now, being able to have this kind of equipment, it could pose a broader threat to Iran's enemies in the region. Of course, a top concern among the U.S. and its Middle East allies, of course. Isa?",

Essentially, that they are seeing of course, these U.S.-provided weapons be captured on the battlefield because that is just the reality of war. However, he said that they're not seeing this happen in very large numbers. And as of right now, no U.S. official has been willing to respond on the record or even really on background to us about whether -- what the U.S. is doing about, of course, the transfer of those weapons to Iran, which of course is stoking a lot of concern among the Middle East allies.

There was a woman who had already got into her car, who was lightly wounded, but she managed to drive away. The gunman got into the building and just apparently by the accounts we've had so far, started shooting indiscriminately and killing people evidently at close range. He then went to -- closer to the building, as the special police units arrived, which they did pretty quickly it seems within a few minutes. And he killed himself. And so, that was the end to it.

Now, it seems that he left the Jehovah's Witness about 18 months ago, and there are conflicting reports about whether he did that voluntarily or whether he was thrown out. But at the very least, according to police, there were differences of opinion, arguments. There were some, you know, bad blood you might say between them. And of course, some people have begun to suggest that could be a part of a motive here. But, you know, what is evident about him was that he had got involved in guns. I think that's something that's in fact directly prohibited according to the teachings of the Jehovah's Witness. At any rate, he had got himself a gun permit and had this semi-automatic weapon quite legally that he used to carry out this attack. And now, an interesting detail there is that an anonymous tip off had gone to the authorities just a month or so ago, and suggesting that maybe this man had psychological problems and suggesting to the authorities they should look into him. They did that. Now, they paid him a visit, checked that his weapons were under lock and key, and they came away deciding that there was no further action needing to be taken. Well of course, with hindsight, that looks like the wrong decision.",

This is a -- you know, what one perhaps should say is that these kind of shootings or rampages rare in Germany, but they do happen again and again every few years. And every time, there's been concern about whether the right measures are in place, and in fact as it happens. The current government has a law going through parliament, going through the legislature at the moment to tighten the rules on gun ownership. There are already controls in place requiring certain levels of psychological evaluation, but people of course, are already asking, could more have been done? What could have been done? The police response, as I mentioned, were said to be very quick. Lives were saved, there were at least 30 or 40 people in the building at the time. So, the fact that six adults were among the victims, you know, you could say it's a success for the police. But clearly, questions are being asked in Germany again as it happens every few years when we get these types of killing sprees, and people begin to shake their heads. It's a real tragedy.",

      "sentences": "Well look, Isa, this is hugely significant. We're not just talking about diplomatic cooperation here or the reopeningof embassies, but this is going to be cooperation on a whole range of fronts including the activation of a security cooperation agreement which was signed by the two parties back in 2001 as well as trade and technology cooperation. The framework of which was agreed between Saudi and Iran back in 1998. And they both also said that they are committed to not interfering in each other's internal affairs. But of course, we've also heard from the Iranian foreign minister in the last couple of hours. He said that this isn't only significant for Saudi Arabia and Iran, but for the region as a whole and for in his words the Muslim world as a whole. He said that Iran is now looking actively, seeking to establish diplomatic relations or improve diplomatic relations with many of its regional neighbors. So this could mark a significant shift in the region of course. That rift between Saudi Arabia and Iran over the last seven years has had a significant impact regionally. We've seen increasing tensions in the gulf, we've seen a deepening of conflicts in Syria, in Yemen where both parties have thrown their backing behind opposing groups. We've seen even Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, we've seen their oil facilities coming under attack by groups and actors backed by Iran, namely, the Houthi rebels in Yemen. So, this will be a significant shift, and also of course, we sure remember, this was brokered in China, this was brokered in Beijing. And this marks a clear signal that China is expanding its diplomatic and also its economic interests in the region. The region which is typically been considered to be under the sphere of influence of the U.S. government. And of course, Isa, we have to remember the context in which this is all happening. Iran is finding itself increasingly isolated on the international stage, not only as a result of the brutal crackdown on the anti-regime protests that we've seen over the last few months. And the dire human rights abuses, but also of course, Iran's failure to adhere to its international commitments when it comes to it. So nuclear activity -- we've seen those efforts to revive the 2015 nuclear deal, completely frozen now and stalling. And so, Iran clearly looking for backing, for support from its closer neighbors. So this is a significant shift, and of course, we are expecting that this could have an impact on its regional neighbors. For now, both parties say this is a step in the right direction. It remains to be seen how this manifests for the rest of Iran and Saudi Arabia's regional neighbors. Isa.",
