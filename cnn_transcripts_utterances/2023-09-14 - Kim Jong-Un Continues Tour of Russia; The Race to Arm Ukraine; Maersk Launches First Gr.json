Plus, the humanitarian crisis in Libya, the floodwaters may be receding, that the human toll climbs after that catastrophic flooding, live report coming up next too. And armed and ready Softbank owned chip designer Arm going public today pricing its IPO at $51 a share that securing a $55 billion dollar valuation shares that trade on the NASDAQ. Shortly we'll be watching that hopefully that will lend a hand or even an Arm to stocks today Wall Street higher already pre market as you can see there. Europeans stocks higher two after the European Central Bank hiked interest rates by a quarter of a percentage 0.24 percent that well expected. That's the highest level since the Euro was launched back in 1999. And across the Pacific-Asia stocks closed in the green on Thursday, the NIKKEI and the KOSPI gaining more than 1 percent and the top performance there as you can see. Lots to get to as always over the next hour we do begin in Russia, where the North Korean leader continues his closely watched trip to Russia. Kim Jong-Un and Vladimir Putin met for five hours on Wednesday, vowing a closer military relationship raising concerns of course once again from the west. South Korea's presidential official suggests that North Korean weapons are already being used by Russia in Ukraine. Paula Hancocks joins us now. Paula, to add to that Japan also warning today that any Arm's deal between the two nations could potentially violate U.N. Security Council resolutions.

Now local authorities are saying that they are simply unable to bury all the victims. The country's rival governments are also providing deferring death tolls, ranging from at least 5000 to more than 6000 people with 10,000 still missing. Ben Wedeman joins us now on this. Ben, unimaginable this the scale of the wave that the people they're faced, I read also that the Mayor of Derna had suggested perhaps up to 20,000 people may have lost their lives.

But what's clear is that thousands of people have been killed ended this city and the government in Eastern Libya based in Benghazi, simply are incapable of dealing with the magnitude of this tragedy. We know that, for instance, they are struggling with just dealing with the sheer number of dead bodies in the streets of Derna. The temperatures are high, they're hovering around 30 degrees centigrade at the moment, and doctors are worried that with all of these dead bodies lying around. There's very much a danger of the spread of disease, and more bodies are constantly being found in buildings and washing up at sea. We've seen some very disturbing footage of -- large groups of bodies floating out at sea. So they're really just the health challenge of all of these cadavers is really mind boggling. Now, for instance, the International Committee of the Red Cross has announced it's sending a variety of relief supplies, medicine and other things. And among them 6000 body bags, the international community is starting to pick up in terms of its response this morning from the Italian port of Brindisi. An Italian navy ship has departed with more supplies, tents and blankets, mobile hospital and other equipment to provide for the situation in Derna. But given the fact that the country is divided, and that for years, these two governments have been at war with one another. What is clear, and what we heard from the Head of the World Meteorological Organization today at a press conference in Geneva, is that the meteorological infrastructure of Libya has basically stopped functioning, and therefore they were incapable of providing warnings to the population of Derna of the danger that Storm Daniel was bring in. And they were they simply didn't provide, they didn't put out any evacuation warnings or orders for the population. And in addition to that, because the government's if you can even call them that have been so busy fighting with one another, they've ignored the infrastructure. So those two dams, which according to one study put out by a Libyan academic needed to be maintained were not maintained and therefore that may have contributed to this catastrophe all of this human folly may have had a very large part in creating the situation where we're seeing this mind boggling death toll, Julia.",

It's considerably more though than what Softbank bought Arm for back in 2016. That was $30 billion, or would it try to sell it for to Nvidia only last year that was valued at $40 billion. You're right, there's only 10 percent being floated here and about a sixth of the shares, I believe have been set aside for some of those big investors, Intel, Apple, Nvidia, Samsung, TSMC. It has been so quiet on the IPO front that this has got a lot of attention, not least because there are a few in the pipeline like Instacart coming up. This is a different beast.

The second problem is the one that you alluded to is actually to get the fuel. The fuel is more expensive than traditional oil based fuel. And it adds up to a cost premium of about 10 percent on the cost of shipping, which so far hundreds of our customers have already signed up for in supporting also not only our decarbonization agenda but their own because our decarbonization of our scope one is really the decarbonization of the scope three of our customers.",

But also, to a certain extent in Europe, what's happening in China is a little bit different, because whereas the consumer demand both in Europe, and in the U.S. has always so far kept on improving, or at least surprising on the positive side, what we have seen is the opposite happening in China where consumer demand has surprised on the negative side. From a shipping perspective, that has a lot less impact, because a lot of what is being consumed in China is actually built in China, for China, and therefore, the impact that this is having on our businesses a lot less, but through the expansions that we have had across the supply chain in China, contract logistics, distribution, and so on.

There felt to be war criminals, by the United States and all of the top American allies. And there are a number of countries that will do business with Russia. But they don't want to be seen as Russia's friends. They don't want to be seen as supporting or promoting Russia's invasion of Ukraine. And you know, what that means is that Putin is becoming more like Iran has been in the Middle East. What does it mean to be a rogue state? Well, for Iran, it's meant supporting proxy war in the region, promotion of radical organizations like Islamic Jihad, and the Muslim Brotherhood. It's meant drone strikes, cyber-attacks, espionage, that behavior by Iran in the Middle East, is what I increasingly expect from Russia against NATO frontline states, Europe, and even the United States and Canada. That's what I think it means for Russia to become a rogue state. The Americans increasingly have no further way to punish the Russians short of direct invasion. They've maximized sanctions the Europeans have done 11 rounds. They're not they're saying he's a war criminal, they think he should be in jail for -- sake. So there's very little addition that the Americans can actually do. And that that puts the Russians in a position where they are acting like a pariah.",

And that's the sort of techno polar world, this shift between power between nation states and some of the Big Tech companies. And you got a perfect messy illustration, I think, in what we saw over the Walter Isaacson book on Elon Musk. And the questions, the enormous decision that seemingly was made over switching on Starlink satellites in Crimea. And at least from the perspective of Elon Musk, a decision of what the result of using that technology and what the attack potentially could mean for an escalation in the war. Whatever you think, on whatever side you're on, quite frankly, this is not a decision that any CEO of a company should be making surely.",

But I know that his business interest align very strongly with Mainland China, and not with Taiwan. In that regard, he's kind of more like LeBron James, for the NBA on Hong Kong, than he is a geopolitical actor. So he's going to do much more of what the Chinese government, Mainland Chinese government, Communist Chinese government wants him to do. And so, that means if Taiwan were to need a technology like Starlink, and no competitors exist, facing cyber strike, for example, first of all, Elon would not be in a position to allow them to have it. And secondarily, the Taiwan needs government would not be in a position to trust Elon to give it to them, and not provide intelligence along to the Chinese. By the way, a lot of Ukrainian officials were concerned about that. In their conversations with Elon, they were worried that that was going to get back to the Kremlin. So of course, if you're NATO, if you're the U.S. government, you have to be thinking, do we need to nationalize that technology? Do we have to invest in competitors domestically to make them national champions? I mean, we have a lot of American CEOs that are, you know, building very big businesses, they're entrepreneurs. They're very effective. They're world class. But that doesn't mean they're patriotic in the geopolitical decisions they make. I mean, when Elon Musk says I wanted to Netflix and chill, I didn't want to be a belligerent in the war. That's the position that a lot of American capitalists would be sympathetic to historically, except that when the war started, he was the one saying, I'm going to give this to the Ukrainians. I'm going to help them defend themselves. You can't do both. And that's the problem, of course that he's finding himself in today.",

The ticker tape is flying it's making the biggest public debut of the year so far. Its IPO was priced at $51 a share as we discussed earlier, giving it a $55 billion valuation, we'll let you know when that begins to trade. Meanwhile, here's a look at how the markets are trading at this stage. We've also had some data out from the United States this morning to the Producer Price Index, a key measure of price changes at the factory gate levels. This is the wholesale level rising 0.7 percent last month that is a touch hotter than expected. Good news, however, U.S. retail sales also coming in above expectations jumping 0.6 percent from July. That's pause for thought though, of course for the Federal Reserve and the possibility of future rate hikes. Now, if an industrial dispute between America's big three automakers and union leaders aren't resolved within a matter of hours, production lines across the country could grind to a halt. Both sides have until 11.59 p.m. tonight to reach an agreement or thousands of workers are set to walk off the job, the talks not necessarily going too well. And now the president of the United Auto Workers Union is announcing plans for a targeted strike at a limited number of plants. Vanessa Yurkevich is outside GMs headquarters in Detroit. Vanessa not sounding good, whether you expect the posturing to be at peak, I think at this moment? What are we expecting in terms of these targeted strikes if they do indeed go ahead?",

A targeted strike is a unique approach, something that we haven't seen used by the union since the late 1990s. But what it essentially means is that the National Union will call on local unions to strike at specific times, specific dates and at specific locations around the country. That is to keep the companies guessing, it's also a way for the Union to keep some workers on the job so that they don't deplete their strike fund. But of course, this is a risky tactic because when you don't have a contract, the company is also not operating under a contract. And it's important to note that right now the Big Three automakers have, less inventory than they did in 2019. Shawn Fain laid out this policy, the strike proposal that he's, that's going to go into effect tonight if they don't come to a deal. Listen first to how he put the state of negotiations.

And a new study Moderna says its MRNA flu shot generated a better immune response in a new study than a vaccine that's already on the market. The findings pave the way for the company to discuss a path to approval with regulators. The hope is that seasonal MRNA flu vaccines can be designed and manufactured more quickly than shots based on older technology. Our Medical Correspondent Meg Tirrell joins us now. Meg, I've lost the ability to say MRNA. It's been such a while and the price gouging.
