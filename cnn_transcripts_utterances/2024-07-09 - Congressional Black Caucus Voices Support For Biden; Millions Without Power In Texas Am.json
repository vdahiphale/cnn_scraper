The difference with this is given what an intense issue, some of these things have been for, Republican primary voters and delegates and certainly committee members are their issues on the floor not against Trump, but against some of the specific language.",

Look at my platform, not some document that's coming out of a think tank. My name is on the ballot, not some think tank guy you've never heard of.

President Biden asked for the caucus's support last night in a virtual call with members. It comes as House Democrats are wrapping up a make-or-break meeting up on Capitol Hill this morning with lawmakers still divided over President Biden's future.Joining us now is Democratic Congressman Gregory Meeks of New York. He's a key member of the Congressional Black Caucus and the ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the House. Congressman, thanks so much for joining us. This Democratic caucus meeting is apparently just wrapping up right now behind closed doors. You were inside. Give us your bottom line is set -- assessment right now. What is your conclusion about what President Biden should be doing? REP. GREGORY MEEKS (D-NY): Now, it's a great -- it was a great listening session, a great meeting, and I want to take my hat off to leader Jeffries for bringing the caucus together so that we can all talk with one another. And I think what was clear to me in the meeting was that we're all United in understanding. And what everyone -- you know, may have different positions but we understand one thing. The existential threat to the United States of America is Donald Trump. And the concern that anyone has is when you look at what's taking place with reference to decisions by the Supreme Court recently. Whether you look like -- if we look at some of the policies that existed by the former president, we know. And as we celebrate here the 75 years of NATO and we know the position of Donald Trump who feels that NATO is no longer needed and, you know -- and friendly with Russia on what's happening with Ukraine, who goes trying to wait us out. One of the things that I can say that came out in that meeting is we're united to try to make sure that we are focused together to make sure that we save the democracy in the United States of America.",

Thank, God, the Democratic Party is not the Republican Party. The Republican Party locks often in step with an individual who has been impeached twice who has been convicted -- as a convicted felon, as well as has lost in court about assaulting women. And yet, they go lockstep.It reminds me of the '30s, how you had Hitler and Stalin. It was because individuals just went in lockstep with them as opposed to expressing and hearing there -- the vast voices of people that would prevent that from happening. Thank, God, I -- you know, when I was in that room, I was saying I'm glad that we have the diversity that we had in our room. The diversity of ideology. The diversity of ethnicity. The diversity of religion. The diversity of Sachs. You know, (INAUDIBLE) that was important. And then we heard all of that and they made me proud to be in the room, to be a Democrat. And people are free to express because that's what democracy is about. Free to express what they feel to our leadership. Our leadership was sitting there and digesting all of it. And well then take with it to the -- to the president of the United States and to others to show how we can do and what we need to do so we can make sure that we win the presidency. And win the House of Representatives. And maintain the majority of the Senate. That's what this is all about. And that's what we are united on.",

So, how am I going to stay on to say that's a good editorial? If they are in fact want to talk about the facts, they should have done that the second that Donald Trump announced his candidacy because the New York Times knows what a disaster he will be to this country. So, to just -- to try to pick on the -- to pick on Joe Biden or to talk about Democrats, they should have been first focused on an individual who we know -- who we know (INAUDIBLE) from New York. There's not one businessperson that can say anything good about Donald Trump. Donald Trump has always only cared about Donald Trump. And we -- and the New York Times should be on the Republican Party for standing side-by-side with him. And -- you know, feeling that he is up nepotism of a king, which is exactly actually what the founding fathers did not want to do, is what they ran away from. And Donald Trump believed what he says in this even though he's a liar, as said by -- you know, many of his Republican colleagues plenty of times in 2016, you know whether it was Graham or Rubio or Cruz. They all have said, know who he is because they told you who he is. But here is the opportunity for the New York Times to let the people know who Donald Trump really is. We know who Joe Biden is. A good man. A family man. A man that has been compassionate and who cares about human beings. And he's done that his whole life. We also know about Donald Trump.

And it's only going to become more common as humans continue to heat up the planet, fueling stronger storms like Hurricane Beryl that came bashing into the coastline of Texas just 24 hours ago, knocking out power to millions.Here, just outside of Houston, what you're looking at behind me is a utility restoration. Multistate coordinated efforts to turn back the power to the people. But the race is on because a heatwave is descending in this area. So many people without power, not the opportunity to cool themselves off. If they're just doing basic cleanup from storm damage, going indoors is not going to bring any relief without electricity and air conditioning. Harris County earlier this morning was over 70 percent without power in terms of customers. I drove through it in the middle of the night darkness. Trees down. Power lines down. It was treacherous and very dangerous. Now, statewide, it's 2.2 million. But look at this next graphic because that shade of orange, that is a heat advisory. And that means heat index values here, Wolf, could top 105 degrees. It is brutal. And that means that the race is on to get back the power so people can cool down. Back to you.",

That can be helpful in terms of weight loss but could cause a sort of side effects here. And what we find is that most people will have some sort of side effect, although, for the vast majority, it's pretty minimal side effects. That is another point of distinction again between Tirzepapatides and Semaglutides. Again, I'm using these words because people have gotten to know these words. Some people are going to have more side effects with one class of drugs versus the other. And that's something you got to talk to your doctor about.",
