That's according to the Palestinian news agency WAFA, which adds a camp for those forced from their homes was targeted and it comes a day after the Israeli prime minister said a weekend airstrike on a similar camp in Rafah, which killed at least 45 civilians, was a tragic mistake.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NETANYAHU (through translator): Despite our best effort not to harm those not involved, unfortunately, a tragic mistake happened last night. We are investigating the case. (END VIDEO CLIP) VAUSE: According to one U.S. official, Israel says an early assessment indicates shrapnel from the airstrike ignited a nearby fuel tank, sparking an inferno, melting the plastic tents many were using for shelter. The Israeli military says two senior Hamas officials were killed in the strike and has begun an investigation. In a statement saying the IDF regrets any harm to uninvolved civilians during combat. In the hours after the strike protests were held at a number of cities around the world with U.N. agencies, aid groups, governments all calling for Israel to respect last week's ruling by the International Court of Justice for an immediate halt to the offensive in Rafah. All of this comes as Spain, Ireland, Norway each planning to make a formal declaration in the hours ahead recognizing a Palestinian state. More now from CNN's Jeremy Diamond on the aftermath and the attack in Rafah and a warning his report contains graphic images. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Their blood-curdling screams tell the story of the unfolding horror more than words ever could. But it is only as bodies are pulled out of the inferno that the scale of this attack becomes clear. At least 45 people were killed after an Israeli airstrike targeted this camp for displaced Palestinians in Western Rafah, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. Plastic tarps engulfed in flames, sheet metal walls crushed by the blast, a block of makeshift shelters flattened in an instance. The Israeli military says the strike killed two senior Hamas militants who commanded Hamas' West Bank operations, Yassin Rabia and Khaled Nagar. In a rare move, the Israeli military's top lawyer launching an investigation into the strike, saying civilian casualties had not been expected. \"It was assessed that there would be no expected harm to uninvolved civilians. The IDF regrets any harm to uninvolved civilians during combat.\" Mohammed Abu Ataiwi (PH) is one of those civilians, so badly burned that he cannot even open his eyes. But there are so many more. So many children writhing in pain. And then there are the parents desperate to save babies whose cries have been silenced, perhaps forever. For those who survived, whatever thin sense of safety they still had has now been completely shattered. We were sitting and suddenly there was a big blast and fire. People started screaming, Ranin (PH) says, describing how they spent the whole night pulling charred bodies out of the embers. While hundreds of thousands have fled Eastern Rafah after the military ordered its evacuation, many others like this man displaced from Central Gaza came here to Western Rafah, told the area would be safe. And then there are the mourners. The occupation army is a liar. There is no security in Gaza, says this man, whose brother was killed in the strike. [00:05:04] Here he is with his wife. They were murdered. They are gone. For one man, a brother, for another, his sister. She was the only one, he says, she was the only one and she has gone. Jeremy Diamond, CNN, Jerusalem.

Otherwise, I'm not sure he would have even said that.Now, as for the justification, look, this goes, and I think we've talked about this on your show several times, there is no justification. That is the plain truth. If you want to get rid of Hamas and eradicated it militarily entirely, assuming and that's, you know, that's a far, far reaching assumption that it is even possible and attainable, then you basically have to occupy the entire Gaza Strip and run it for months, if not years. That is something that Israel says it does not want. That is something that Israel pledged to the U.S. it would not do. As things stand now either you launch a huge military operation in Rafah, which would result in another tragedy like this, or you reached the conclusion, as you just suggested, John, that there is no justification for this continued onslaught or continued operation. Now, you know, this is tied to something much bigger. The fact that the war, from its outset, other than being a just war or retaliation for horrific terror attack on October 7th, the war never had any feasible, any attainable, any achievable, call it what you want political goals. The military means that usually need to be aligned with the military -- with a political objective are just not aligned. And so this is just a military operation with no end in sight. And I think this will bring about even more pressure on Israel for a ceasefire, even separate from a hostage deal.",

If they can convince one juror this and another juror that, and that creates reasonable doubt for those two jurors. Now they've got to holdouts and that could prevent a conviction.If that happens, usually the judge will prod the jury a few times to try to come to a unanimous verdict or verdicts and if they can't do so that any counts that the jury hangs on, the judge would declare those mis-tried, a miss trial on those counts, and it would be possible if the D.A. wanted to re-prosecute.
