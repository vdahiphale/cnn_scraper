Just ahead, this hour Hilary's fury, the fierce storm weakening overnight but still bringing record rainfall to the parched southwest. Millions remain under flash flood warnings. One person has lost their life in Mexico where the storm made landfall on Sunday. The very latest on Hilary's expected path coming up. Plus Russia's warning Moscow says Denmark and the Netherlands risk escalating the Ukraine conflict with their promises to send F-16 fighter jets to Kyiv Ukraine's President Zelenskyy hailing the move as historic \"During a visit to Denmark\" a live report ahead from Ukraine. And Beijing's blues; the Chinese Central Bank making another underwhelming cut in interest rates far smaller than investors hoped given the increasing challenges facing the country's property sector. And the steady drumbeat of weak economic data too, that disappointment reflected in the performance of Chinese stocks during Monday's session. As you can see there the HANG SENG dropping almost 2 percent steep losses for the Shanghai Composite as well, we'll take a closer look at China's credit and growth crisis and the ways to address it later in the program with Peking University Finance Professor Michael Pettis. A brighter picture in the meantime in the United States and Europe Wall Street sector bounce after a losing week the third in fact straight week of losses for the S&amp;P and the NASDAQ as raising bond yields hurt sentiment European shares, though as you can see for now in the green a lot riding once again on Powell's pronouncements.

Now it's also important to point out they've had patriot systems, those were considered a long shot when they were first requested. And now it seems to be the tempo of how Ukraine gets stuff after increased pressure. And it's fair to say here losses on the front line in the counter offensive that is not moving as fast as anybody had hoped in Ukraine's favor. They do appear now to be seeing a public flurry of activity to get those F-16s. The Danish sending 19, the Dutch saying well, we've got 42 some of those are going to need to be used in training we'll probably send quite a lot of the rest. I'm paraphrasing there. But this clearly a swift move after Ukraine's public statements last week that they weren't going to see anything this year at all. And possibly reflection too of certainly European anxiety that if we don't see a change in the front lines here, at some point in the months ahead, the Russians could dig in over the winter. And the boundaries we're seeing right now of occupied Ukraine could remain that way, potentially, for years. So these F-16s, Ukraine says would make a significant difference in the skies. I think it's fair to say from what we've seen on the grounds that would be the case, the biggest challenge now for Ukrainian troops is Russian air superiority, their abilities are up half metric ton bombs at will F-16s could challenge that and could too deliver similar blows to Russian front lines as well. But it isn't going to happen fast enough, because there's been a complex scheme suggested as to how this delivery could occur. The U.S. doesn't really seem to want its hands on it directly. It would happen through European allies those European allies would do training in their nation countries. Some seems to be happening in the UK, Sweden, possibly maybe Romania down the line, Denmark, Netherlands involve now too. And then the supply of jets would be approved by the United States. Indeed, they've already said they will. It's a lengthy process, potentially four or five months' worth of training of Ukrainian pilots. And then the ultimate question too if indeed, these planes get into the skies of Ukraine, who services them? It should be Ukraine, but its complex. It's a huge lift for the Ukrainian Air Force, certainly. And there is the possibility during that if they're going to keep the tempo up; they need to make a difference. NATO may get more involved in servicing and training. That's my speculation. But that may be also one of the reasons why we've seen NATO move relatively slowly on this. But once again, when the pressure is there, and too frankly at the recognition of how important Ukraine superseding, sorry, succeeding in this war is for NATO security, that we see a public change whether this had been long planned, we may never know. But it's certainly now publicly moving at a pace of over a certainty that we didn't see last week, Julia.",

But then, of course, as we saw with that Lunar module crashing, there were also other things that obviously didn't. Essentially what the Russians managed to do is very quickly they managed to shoot up a rocket with the Lunar Lander in it, and then they actually managed to get that Lunar Lander into the moon's orbit. So it was doing circles around the moon. However, in order to then land on the moon, it had to go into an elliptical orbit. And that seems to be where the error took place, either something with the boosters of the Lunar Lander or possibly some other miscalculation. Essentially, what the Russians say is that then that elliptical orbit that it had led it to crash into the moon itself, if you read the press release from the Russians, actually quite interesting. They say that the Lunar Lander ceased to exist when it crashed into the moon's surface. And you're absolutely right, right now it's not a race anymore at least it's a one horse race, if you will, with the Indians hoping to land their Lunar module unmanned, of course, on the moon's South Pole. That's the big thing about this because they hope to possibly find water on the moon's South Pole, which is of course the area of the moon that is in darkness all the time really a fascinating scientific progress, a process there. But the Russians no longer part of it. So for them, obviously a pretty big setback as they really wanted to use moon exploration to kind of gets back on the map really, of space exploration as well, Julia.",

Call it the summer of China's economic discontent; the Chinese Central Bank today cutting interest ratesfor the second time in three months though only slightly. Officials also unexpectedly keeping five year interest rates unchanged. There the peg the most mortgages in the country markets were expecting Beijing to offer more support for the property sector which makes up around a quarter of the economy confidence suffering repeated blows. The giant developer Evergrande filed for bankruptcy protection last week. A smaller developer Country Garden has just weeks to make critical debt payments. And the state owned firms Sino Ocean reporting debt troubles too. Then the pretense seems played out last week outside of Chinese shadow bank, investors demanding money said that they are owed. Shadow banks have been large investors in real estate and have enticed investors with high rates of interest return. Now to our next guest, these are just symptoms of China's investment led savings driven economy. And he says it's struggling to find productive ways to grow without ramping up debt.

And as a result, we've seen significant imbalances build up. We've seen that particularly in the area of debt, but more and more non-productive investment, weaker domestic demand, et cetera. And that couldn't go on forever. At some point, we had to reach the limit. Either Beijing would decide to adjust the model, or would be forced to adjust the model it's through the changes in the economy.

But if you look at the two biggest debt problems of the last 100 years, the United States at the end of the 1920s, and Japan at the end of the 1980s, it was all internal debt, there was no external debt. The problem is not so much the debt itself, the problem is to be very technical, you're capitalizing what should be expensed. So you take $100, and you invest it in something that creates maybe $60 worth of value. So you should take a $40 loss. But instead of taking that loss, you treat it as $40 asset. And these sorts of false assets have been continuing to build, or to put it in a different way. Local governments have billions of dollars on their books of assets backing those billions of dollars of debt. But the assets aren't worth billions of dollars they're worth much, much less. So there's a gap between the income coming from those assets, and the need to continue servicing that debt. And that gap has to be met somewhere somebody has to take the loss. And the problem in China is there hasn't yet been a decision as to how that loss is going to be allocated. But one way or another, it will be allocated.",

You could replace it with consumption, build up the consumer, replace it with traders we've discussed or do nothing and let grow dramatically slow. Is the technology sector that we're seeing and we obviously are seeing a lot of productive investment?

Probably the latter is worse economically, but the former is worse, socially and politically. Now, there is something else China could do. In theory, no one's ever done it, but at least it's theoretically possible. And that is if they were to transfer, about 1.5 percentage points of GDP every year, from local governments and local governments own a lot of assets to the household sector. Then in theory, we could get growth at around 4 percent and household income growing even faster than that. And many Chinese are now starting to talk about that. The problem is they're talking about one side of the transfer, transferring money to the household sector nobody's going to say no. But they're not talking about the other side of the transfer, which is transferring from some sector, in this case, probably local governments. And that's really the hard part. But that's not the part that we're discussing yet.

As long as the government has targets well, above that, as you know, this year, the target was 5 percent, then the only way to get there is by allowing debt at the local government level to build up and using that to fund you know, more bridges. There was very interesting articles in the Wall Street Journal yesterday that discuss some of the infrastructure that Guizhou, one of the poorest provinces in China has. They have more airports than many of the richest provinces in China. It's hard to justify that. But it was an attempt to sort of spend your way out of poverty. And one of the results is that Guizhou was probably the first province basically to go bankrupt. And so it's clearly not a sustainable policy.

And so that ability to catch it quickly is a really big source of leverage that can reduce fire risk.",

And if we look at the market cap of Novo Nordisk, and the competitors, the other big companies in Denmark, you can see that I mean, it is more than 10 times bigger than the second biggest company. And actually if you add those four companies, you see blow it together, that's still less than a third of the market cap of Novo Nordisk. Now, it has been big for a long time, but the drug that we're talking about has really boosted what we're seeing here. Hugely successful and so many of those sales of course, are overseas, particularly in the United States, and that means a lot of U.S. dollars being converted back into kroner. Now, a note from -- Bank last week was really interesting, it was saying essentially, this is pushing up the value of the kroner versus the euro, but the two currencies are pegged. So, this feeds into interest rate decisions for the Central Bank and actually looking at the Danish Central Bank, the main interest rate is around half a percent lower than the ECB.
