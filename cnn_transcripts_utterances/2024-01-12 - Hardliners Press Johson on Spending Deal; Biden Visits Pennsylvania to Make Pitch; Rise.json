Yesterday morning, however, he was met with a number of hardline conservatives who are pushing him to walk away from that deal. That deal, obviously, is a long-term investment in the country's funding deadlines. It's to ensure that there isn't a government shutdown. And yet, despite reaching that agreement, Mike Johnson had those members in to have a conversation.Now, Johnson emerged after that meeting saying he'd made no commitments to them. But this just shows you that he's really in the middle of this fractious Republican conference and in the middle of a fight between moderates and hardliners within his ranks. You are hearing from some moderate members who are saying, Johnson has no other choice but to stick with this deal that he cut. Here's Representative Don Bacon to me yesterday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. DON BACON (R-NE): The country's got to govern. We want stability. You know, the alternative is going to be a shutdown or, you know, this long CR, which is downsizing (ph) the military. The agreement is the best way forward. And I supported the speaker yesterday publicly and in the conference, and I'm going to ask him to hold on to the agreement. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "No question about it. And there is a very real reason why the Biden administration sought for weeks to avoid the very moment we're in right now. There were warnings, both public and through back channels, U.S. officials tell CNN, trying to get the Yemen rebels to pull back, the Houthis to pull back.The acute international focus, and now the U.S.-led action, is tied to that rebel group from a tiny war-torn nation. And it serves to underscore the complex and dynamic nature of an area that serves as a geopolitical and economic lynch pin. You see the scale of the strikes that have come from Houthi rebels over the course of the last several weeks. Now a response. Why? Well, let's starts with the global economy. Officials point to the waterway, the Red Sea, as the main route for roughly 12 to 15 percent of world trade. That is a huge number. But what does it actually mean? Since the Houthi attacks began, the largest shipping companies, you see them here, in the world have steadily moved to halt transit through the Red Sea. What has that led to? Well, that has led to a drop of 20 percent or more in Red Sea activity. That's according to Lloyd's List. It marks the start of a potentially cascading effect, which the World Bank outlined in a report this week. And this is important to know. Warning in that report that energy supplies could be disrupted, leading to spikes in prices, which would, in turn, spill over into other commodities that would heighten global tensions and, of course, at an inflation high moment, economic uncertainty. Now, in just the month before the U.S.-led strikes that happened last night, the volume of containers transported through the Red Sea plummeted. That's not a joke. That's not an error. That's the actual line. By more than half. Right now almost at 70 percent of the usual volume expected is where - is how much it has dropped. That has led to a dramatic increase in the cost to ship goods. Now, look at this spike right here. You see the spike to ship a 40- foot container. Now, again, that sounds a little bit in the weeds here. However, that is critical. Explain why in a second. And it has more than doubled since November. Now, it's true, consumers probably haven't seen a tangible effect at the stores they're going to right now, but economic officials warn it's only a matter of time. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "So, why were U.S. officials so wary of striking the rebel group directly despite increased pressure from allies and those who had concerns about how they were operating? Well, in a region that is already clearly aflame in the wake of the October 7th and the Gaza war, the escalation was viewed as particularly acute. The risk of escalation. The Houthi rebels, they are one of many Iranian proxy groups that have launched attacks since the start of the war. Obviously, there have been attacks in Syria, attacks from Iraq that the U.S. has responded to. Iran is suspected of supplying Houthi rebels with weapons, and, the U.S. says, Iranian intelligence has been critical to enabling them to attack U.S. and allied ships in that region.Now, key allies in the region, most notably Saudi Arabia, have quietly urged the U.S. to show restraint over the course of the last couple of weeks. And that's critical here because it gets to the geopolitical volatility that serves as the backdrop to all of this. This is why. Take a look at this. This was the scene in 2019. One of the best protected places on earth. One of the largest energy production hubs in the world. Houthi strikes on Saudi Arabia that resulted in this. It happened over the course of several years. One example of the group's reach that has, over the course of the last several years, not just included Saudi Arabia, has also included the UAE and Bahrain as well. Obviously, concerns here in Saudi Arabia. Those strikes, part of a war that had raged since 2015, a civil war, that was also a proxy war, killing hundreds of thousands, leaving 80 percent of Yemen's population dependent on humanitarian aid. It was the Biden administration that play a central role in a 2022 truce that has continued to hold since. The risk of that falling apart, now center stage. So too is the risk of Iran, which is behind not just the Houthis, but also those proxy groups in Syria and Iran, as well as Hezbollah and Lebanon, and the fact that they may escalate. And that, U.S. officials make clear, is the greatest concern in a moment when an unstable region sits perilously close to the brink. Erica.",

You know, we've said for a long time that how goes Ohio, so goes the nation, but maybe the phrase should be, how goes Pennsylvania goes the nation.It's also a space where he can come out and he can specifically talk about a number of different things, in part because Pennsylvania is a good representation of kind of the full diversity of the country, class, race, ethnicity, religion, all of these things, and he can talk very specifically about the kind of infrastructure programs, the job programs, you know, they have rehabilitation programs that are going into the streets and into churches and into public parks.
