But first, President Biden, do you freight rail workers deserve more than one day of paid sick leave like millions of Americans have?

      "sentences": "President Macron, here in the U.S., President Biden is asking Congress for $38 billion of additional funding for support for Ukraine. There's been some pushback from Republicans in Congress saying that they cannot continue to write a blank check.So do you have confidence that the United States will be able to continue supporting Ukraine's defense in the way it has over the past year in the months going forward? And did you talk to President Biden about trying to urge Ukraine to negotiate to end this war? Especially with winter bearing down and the effects on energy prices. MARCON (through translation) Look, I do thank President Biden and his administration for the great commitment they have to Ukraine and the Ukrainian people. And let me just say that our two nations are made of values and history. And what is at stake in Ukraine is not just very far from here in a small country somewhere in Europe but it's about our values and it's about our principles. And it's about what we agreed together in the U.N. Charter. Protecting sovereignty and territorial integrity. And this is why I do believe that having the U.S. strongly supporting the Ukrainians since that time is very important not just for the Ukrainians, for the Europeans we are. This is why we thank you for the solidarity. But for the stability of our world today. Because if we consider that we can abandon the country and abandon the full respect of these principles, it means that there's no possible stability in this world. So I think it's extremely important to have you so much committed. So I'm confident, because I think your people and your representatives do endorse and understand these objectives. We'll follow up our own support. We increased our military support. We increased our economic support. We are increasing our humanitarian support. And for the second question you raise, let me tell you that we will never urge the Ukrainians to make a compromise which will not be acceptable for them. Because they are so brave and they defend precisely their lives, their nation, and our principles. And because it will never build a sustainable peace. If we want a sustainable peace, we have to respect the Ukrainians to decide the moment and the conditions in which they will negotiate about their territory and their future.",
