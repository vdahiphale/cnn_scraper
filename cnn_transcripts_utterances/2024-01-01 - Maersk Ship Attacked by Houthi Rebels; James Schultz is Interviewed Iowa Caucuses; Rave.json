The shipping company, Maersk, is pausing all movement through the Red Sea after one of its vessels was attacked by Iranian-backed Houthis. U.S. helicopters responded to the distress call from the ship as it traveled through the straits near Yemen. And after coming under fire, the U.S. sank three Houthis vessels, killing, they say, everyone on board. The White House says this is not a U.S. escalation. They say they were just responding to what was happening in the water.CNN's Natasha Bertrand is following all of this for us from Washington, D.C. Bring us up to speed, Natasha. NATASHA BERTRAND, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY REPORTER: Yes, John, so this all happened late Saturday night Eastern Time around 6:30 a.m. in Yemen when a Maersk commercial ship, it was posing through a Bab el- Mandeb Strait, going up north towards the Suez Canal. It was in the southern Red Sea. And it was hit by an unknown object according to Maersk. And at that point they were able to continue on. It did not cause any significant damage. But later on, four small boats carrying these Houthi militants approached that vessel and attempted to board it and they actually opened fire. At that point, this vessel then issued a distress call. It was actually the second distress call it had issued in just under 24 hours to the U.S. Military which then responded with helicopters, as well as a U.S. Navy destroyer that is already in the region, in attempt, of course, to bolster security in the area given all of these Houthi-led attacks on commercial shipping there. That is when helicopters responded, U.S. Navy helicopters, and the Houthis opened fire on those helicopters according to U.S. Central Command, and that then prompted the U.S. to respond. They then killed all of the Houthi militants that were on board three of those vessels, which were sunk. Obviously, this is a pretty big escalation that marks the first time that there has been that direct confrontation between the U.S. and the Houthis in a way that has led Houthis to be killed. The U.S. saying that they don't want this to escalate any further and that they don't want a wider regional conflict. But given all of the Houthi-led attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea that have continued, even despite the U.S. setting up a multinational task force to try to combat this, they have not yet been deterred, John.",

But there are these moons orbiting the gas giants, Jupiter and Saturn, that have huge amounts of water in them. And we believe water is central to allowing life's shenanigans to happen. Molecular shenanigans.So, Europa has a hundred mile or sixty mile deep ocean, more water than all the oceans on earth, and it's covered by a layer of about maybe six miles of ice. And so that is a prime place we should be looking for life. And the Europa mission is, we're going to send a probe that is going to orbit Jupiter and do these fly-byes past Europa and give us a better view of what's going on in there.
