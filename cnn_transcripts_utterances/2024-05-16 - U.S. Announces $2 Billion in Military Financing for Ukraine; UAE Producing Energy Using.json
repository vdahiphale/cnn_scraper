The Ukrainians are acknowledging that the Russians have gained some ground there, while Moscow says that they`ve actually made some significant gains and wants to continue to press that offensive. Now, the clear message from Secretary of State Blinken in his meeting with the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was that the U.S. is back as far as military support for Ukraine is concerned and that the U.S. is back to stay. The Secretary of State saying that some of the U.S. weapons that have been pledged have already arrived on the battlefield and others are on the way. Now, for the Ukrainians, that cannot come soon enough. One of the reasons why their forces are under such pressure pretty much on all fronts right now is the fact that they`re quite short on ammunition and on weapons, especially ammunition though. Another thing that the Ukrainian President pointed out, he said one of the biggest issues for Ukraine`s forces fighting in the northeast of the country is Russian air power and the ability of the Russian Air Force to be much more effective than before. The Ukrainian President saying that Ukraine essentially needs two surface to air missile batteries patriots of U.S. make very quickly. Fred Pleitgen, Berlin. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

So brush and floss like a boss. Ever wonder why we brush with a toothbrush? It should be called a teeth brush. Anyways, enough of being facetious.
