      "sentences": "Yes, the latest from here is that, as you say, over the past 24 hours, 100 Hezbollah fighters have been killed at the border by the IDF. Over the past few days, since ground operations began this week, 250 were killed.We know the defense minister has been at the border today saying that the IDF -- IDF operating in several villages inside of Lebanon, and that there are more attacks to come. The IDF has also been spreading the number or increasing, rather, the number of villages that it is warning Lebanese civilians to leave in the southern part of Lebanon. That total now up to over 100 villagers. Those civilians have been warned to leave. And a new warning from the IDF for medical personnel in the south of Lebanon, warning them about being used by Hezbollah to transport Hezbollah or their equipment. Because we know that the World Health Organization has said at least a couple of dozen health officials have really been killed inside of Lebanon so far. So that's another warning that the IDF has issued inside Lebanon. But the warnings, if you will, coming from the Iranian leadership, that they are ready to strike back at Israel if it strikes at them. And very precise wording from the deputy military commander, saying, look, we in Iran have a big country, essentially saying it's hard to damage our infrastructure. But he said, in Israel, there are only three power-generating plants and a couple of oil refineries. He said, we can hit all of those at once. This seems to be a very stark warning as Israel is poised to respond to Iran's attack here a couple of days ago. And that does point to the potential for serious escalation still.",

The 29-year-old died just steps away from his home as he was calling out for his mother. CNN's Shimon Prokupecz joins us now. Shimon, prosecutors were unable to get a conviction on the most serious civil rights charges for two of the officers. Do they see that as a setback? SHIMON PROKUPECZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME &amp; JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Well, it certainly, Boris, not the outcome that they wanted or expected here, right? I mean, this charge, the top count here on the civil rights had to do with Tyre Nichols' death. And the responsibility basically at the hands of these office officers who are supposed to protect him. But they argued, instead, violated his civil rights in how they detained him, and how they treated him, and the fact that they didn't give him the level of care that he needed. So that jury decided that the prosecutors here, federal prosecutors in federal court did not meet their burden. And so they've acquitted these officers of the top count. The top count where, if they we're convicted, they could -- potentially would have -- would have spent the rest of their life in a federal prison. But instead, what you now have is these officers still facing a substantial amount of prison time, but certainly not on the top count. Today, this morning, the attorneys for the families are starting to react. Take a listen to what one of the attorneys said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BEN CRUMP, ATTORNEY FOR THE NICHOLS' FAMILY: His mother and father and their family are relieved to know that all the officers will be held accountable. They could face up to 20 years in prison. And now we're going to be focused on the sentencing. We want the same thing to happen to those officers what would have happened if the roles were reversed and Tyre was being convicted of killing them and them conspiring to cover it up.

Two of them pleaded guilty to federal charges and we're cooperating here with prosecutors.But there's still a state case where these officers are actually facing murder charges. That is set to go on trial at some point, perhaps at the end of the year. So the families will have to sit through this and relive a lot of that horrific video and a lot of that testimony yet again, as they continue to seek accountability and justice for their son.",

And these investigations take a really, really long time.And the Department of Justice could wait for the criminal investigations, the criminal cases to end before they take any kind of action because they don't want to obviously affect the jurors decision going forward. So we could be looking to sometime next year before we hear the results of any of that investigation. But I was on the ground, Boris, when this happened in the days after. And the community there certainly is playing a big role in that investigation. They certainly have felt for a long time that their rights are being violated by these officers, by officers from the Memphis Police Department and also the unit. Remember, these officers we're part of a plan-clothes unit called the Scorpion Unit and they would just drive around, really tried to stop crime. They were a very, very aggressive unit. And that is something that's certainly the Department of Justice is looking into. The unit has been disbanded as a result of what happened here. And there have been some changes at the Memphis Police Department as a result of what happened here.",

Now it's in 63 percent of the U.S. population's drinking water as an additive -- as an added substance to try to give this public health benefit. And it has been listed as one of the top-ten public health achievements of the 20th century. That's how important, sort of fundamental this has been as a public health intervention. However, since 1975, most toothpastes have started to include fluoride. And so the Cochrane Collaboration, which is an independent group that does scientific reviews, it started to look at the evidence of before 1975 versus after 1975, what is the impact on tooth decay of fluoride in drinking water in communities. And what they found is that the benefits seems to have decreased since fluoride became more widely available in other substances. In studies from before that period, they found that there was a decrease of about one baby tooth of tooth decay as a result of fluoride in drinking water compared with after 1975, that benefit reduced to on average, about a quarter of a tooth reduction in tooth decay. And so they are they're saying that it's important to take a look at what the situation is now and to start to weigh the benefits and potential risks of safety of adding fluoride to drinking water.",
