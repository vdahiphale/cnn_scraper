And that's one of the reasons why life expectancy in our country is actually in decline. People are overwhelmed. They've got to take care of their kids. They've got to worry about housing. They've got to worry about housing. They're worried. It seems to me that if new technology is going to make us a more productive society, the benefits should go to the workers. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I mean you look at Tesla. They're ultimately, I think, big winners on this because they're non-union, they're able to pay less wages and they don't have the legacy costs. I mean that's the other ingredient here, the legacy costs that the big three have. Add, I know, a thousand -- it used to be $1,000 per vehicle. That's a lot of money when the average car these days is getting pretty close to about $50,000. So -- but we have a worker shortage. I mean what business out there isn't looking for employees, whether it be - and from my old congressional district, we've got a lot of auto parts suppliers. Man, you drive - you drive down there, they've got yard signs looking for people, pretty decent wages that are out there. So, you know, this is going to take a little wile for this strike to end.

I thought it was notable that we've heard from American officials in recent times, do not go to Iran under any circumstances because they're afraid that, of course, they'll try to grab some more and get some more cash out of this.But that said, it's a humanitarian win.

Renegotiate the nuclear deal that President Trump took the United States and the world out of, to this calamitous moment that we're at, which caused the Iranians to keep, you know, jacking up their enrichment. You know, and Trump said, oh, maximum pressure, maximum pressure is going to work. Well, it didn't. It catastrophically failed. Didn't get the hostages out.

Tom Cotton, Lindsey Graham, Michael McCaul, they have all issued statements saying that this is only going to further encourage Iran to take more Americans prisoner.But the administration is pushing back on that. And they are saying that this money is not going to be going straight into Iranian coffers. It's not something that Iran can just use to spend kind of on whatever it wants, like its missile development, for example, or on its nuclear program. These are funds that are going to be closely monitored by Qatar, by the U.S. Treasury Department, and they will only be able to be disbursed periodically and for humanitarian reasons, like food, medicine, medical supplies, agricultural devices, things that Iran and its population clearly desperately need. And that is the administration's argument here, is that they are providing this money, which is not U.S. taxpayer money, it is frozen Iranian funds that were given to them from oil sales years ago that have been frozen in South Korean bank accounts that are now going to be sent into Qatari bank accounts, that Qatar will then be able to monitor and disburse, again, with the oversight of the U.S. Treasury Department. So, the U.S. is saying, look, this is the best deal that we were able to get. And, obviously, a less controversial part of that deal is the release of those five Iranian prisoners who have been in U.S. custody.

You know, the negotiations for their release or the deal and this and that are not going anywhere.
