I`m still here in Kansas City covering the NFL Draft. And can I just say that you all are awesome. I got to meet some students and teachers like Mr. Johnson, a big time Steelers fan.  And thanks for the love from Ms. Wilson from SM South High, Mr. Cordell from Leawood Middle, and the Horizon Academy, you rock. I`m Coy Wire. This is CNN 10, the best 10 minutes in news. Let`s go. In a narrow final vote the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill on Wednesday that would raise the nation`s debt ceiling. The debt ceiling is the total amount of money the government is authorized to borrow. The package raises the nation`s debt limit by an additional $1.5 trillion up from the more than 31 trillion where it currently stands. But the plan raises the ceiling in return for spending cuts that are effectively conditions that would take money away from President Joe Biden`s agenda. And while this measure was passed from the Republican led House, it is seen as dead-on arrival in the Democratic led Senate.  House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and Republicans, well, they`re looking to negotiate with Democrats and President Biden. But President Biden reiterated that he would not meet with McCarthy on extending the debt limit saying it`s, \"not negotiable.\" The White House says that Republicans are holding the economy hostage and slashing programs that hurt the American people. For his part, though, Speaker McCarthy has said the President is putting the economy in jeopardy and that the House has done its job by passing a bill to avoid default. So why does this all matter? Well, analysts believe that not raising the debt ceiling could be catastrophic where the economy can hit a freeze, millions of jobs would be lost and interest rates and loans would spike. In recent years, the debt ceiling debate has been seen as a political tug of war where the American people, well, they`re the ones always on the losing end.  Our Christine Romans has more.

      "sentences": "Every day the U.S. draws closer to the so-called ex-state when it runs out of moneyto pay all the bills. The debt ceiling of $31.4 trillion was hit January 19, unable to borrow more money. The Treasury Department is using so-called extraordinary measures, moving money around, delaying some investments to make sure everything is paid. And sometime soon as quickly as early June, the accounting tricks run out and the U.S. risks defaulting on its obligations. Now, assuming interest payments get top priority every family would face cuts. Social Security payments could be delayed, veterans could receive an IOU instead of benefits. Federal employees could be furloughed, and it would be catastrophic for financial markets where the credit worthiness of the United States is the cornerstone of the global financial system. A default on the debt would trigger market crashes that would crush business and consumer confidence that could further shock the financial system and throw the economy into a recession. Treasuries could tank interest rates spike, the dollar sync and global economies reel. That is the reality Congress is sleepwalking toward unless it raises the debt ceiling. Now Congress has raised the limit 78 times since 1960, 49 times under Republican presidents, 29 times under Democrats. But in recent years, it has become a political football in a game where the American people are the losing team. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Raise your hand if you said Japan, no moon landing for them. But a Japanese commercial company attempted a landing this week. Hakuto-R, a lunar lander from Japan would touchdown on the moon this week, at least that was the plan. Ispace, which is a Japanese firm launched it on a SpaceX rocket back in December from Cape Canaveral Florida then entered orbit around the moon taking three months for it to get there. The plan was to land Tuesday afternoon. But flight controllers lost communication with the craft leading officials to assume that it was lost or even crashed. Hakuto-R was supposed to release a data collecting rover even a robot, the size of a tennis ball but before it did, the mission was over. This could have been historic landing this craft upon the moon being the first by a private company perhaps another we`ll try again soon. Next up, a rarely talked about aspect of the Russian invasion on Ukraine. It has taken a huge and sad toll for so many people in the region. But what about the animals that need to be saved as well? Well, if you`re not, there`s actually a pair of veterinarians bunkered underground and aiding all sorts of wildlife from snakes to owls to parrots, guinea pigs, even monkeys. During the rescue efforts, they`ve even had to dodge a few Russian bullets. Just one week after the invasion they cared for about 400 rescued animals in their clinic. Meet Leonid and Valentina Stoyanov, two of our very own CNN Heroes. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
