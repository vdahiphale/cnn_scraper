Overnight, Russia launched what Ukraine described as a massive attack on civilian infrastructure and ports in the southern Odesa region. It's also accusing Russia of trying to create a food crisis with attacks on port infrastructure over the weekend.Today, Ukraine says its forces are making further advances in its counteroffensive and liberating more areas along the southern front line where some of the heaviest fighting is taking place. All of this coming as Ukrainian president, Zelenskyy, shakes up the highest ranks of his military. He's firing his defense minister as the country enters the 19th month of this invasion. CNN's Melissa Bell joins us now live from Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine. So, Melissa, what more do we know about the reasons behind the firing of the defense minister?",

On the contrary, Boris, this is a man who's been widely praised for what he's done over the course of the last 19 months now. It was apparently his request that he move on to other things. But this, of course, allows President Zelenskyy to draw a line on the last - under the last few months.There have been so many allegations, corruption scandals that have dogged the defense ministry here in Ukraine. There have been sackings. There have been resignations. There have been arrests as a result of some of these. And although none of them ever tainted Oleksii Reznikov personally, they have rather marred the whole effort, certainly in the eyes of many allies. So, this allows him really to draw a line, again, at the request of Oleksii Reznikov himself and to bring in a completely new person to man this war effort. And apparently, what we hear is that Rustem Umerov is just the man for the job, a daunting challenge. But this is a man who has a lot of experience. He was a business leader. He's been closely involved with the war effort, having overseen several prisoner exchanges. And, interestingly, he's a Crimean Tatar. He's actually a Muslim and not at all from President Zelenskyy's party. So, it is an interesting choice, but he's considered extremely capable and he's going to have to be - Boris, this is a man who's going to have to keep his Western allies on board for the ever greater needs that he's going to have with regard to weaponry to see this counteroffensive through, even as he shores up Ukraine's own defense capabilities, which is what they have been doing recently, trying to create more and more drones, trying to make more and more long-range artillery so that they can continue successfully, as they've been doing, bringing this war ever closer to Russian soil, Boris.",

Xi, it's not quite clear why he's choosing not to go. Could it be the tensions with India? Does he want to avoid a meeting with President Biden? He also has the opportunity to meet President Biden, of course, at the APEC Summit in San Francisco later on in the year. So the possibility of the pair meeting still remains. But when you look at the fact that just less than a month ago, President Xi went to South Africa for the BRICS summit there, which is a sort of emerging developing nations alternative, if you will, to the G20, a summit where they said they wanted bigger nations like Saudi Arabia and some other powerful nations to join. You can see how the sort of the G7s, the G20s, that sort of old big powers are going to get marginalized by empowering, like President Xi, empowering effectively the BRICS summit. So it diminishes what they can achieve and that unity of voice is what they're speaking about. And, of course, one of the huge items recently was dealing with COVID. But the other one has been climate change, so you don't have these big nations writing the script for the next years coming of climate change, it can be done at the COP summit, yes, but they're the big powerful nations and this will be absent.",

The line is very, very long and they're asking people not to walk, to avoid walking from the city to where I am right now because it could get dangerous. And we are being told that over the last couple of days, there were cars that were stuck for hours, people that tried to get to this area where I'm standing now and had to spend hours either walking through the mud or getting stuck in the mud via car. I spoke to the superintendent of Black Rock City earlier today, and this is how he described the situation inside the camp.

You'll kind of hear in the background occasionally a car will get unstuck and there's a loud scream and cheers or people are saying goodbye. They've formed these really tight bonds with other people.

On January 6th 2021, he thought it was a terrible thing and that Donald Trump had done the wrong thing. Now he's if not in favor of what happened then, excusing Trump and calling it bad judgment rather than criminal activity, which it was and I believe will eventually be shown to be.
