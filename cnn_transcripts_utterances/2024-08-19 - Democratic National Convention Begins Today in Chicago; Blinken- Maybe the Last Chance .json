Max and Christina have the day off.It is Monday today, August 19th, 4 p.m. here in Hong Kong, 3 a.m. in Chicago. That's where the Democratic National Convention is set to kick off in the hours ahead. Delegates from across the country have gathered in the city for the four-day event, as Democrats hope to build on the momentum sparked by Kamala Harris and her dramatic rise to the top of the ticket. The theme of day one, For the People, when Democrats will look to show how they're fighting for everyday Americans while Donald Trump puts himself first. Harris traveled to Chicago Sunday, after spending the day campaigning in the key battleground state of Pennsylvania. During one stop, she appeared to call Trump a coward, without mentioning him by name. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE U.S. (D) AND U.S. PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: This campaign is about a recognition that frankly over the last several years there's been this kind of perversion that has taken place, I think. Which is to suggest, which is to suggest, that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down. When what we know is the real and true measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up.",

Some of the biggest changes, of course, we have seen so far have been to the programming and the speaking lineup. While the biggest names that we would have seen speaking before President Biden dropped out, they are still going to be speaking.Some of the timing of when they're going to actually speak throughout the course of the week have changed, including, of course, President Biden, now speaking on the first night instead of the final night. One other person that is going to be speaking Monday night is Hillary Clinton, who, of course, eight years ago, accepted the party's nomination for the presidency at a convention in Philadelphia. And speaking with somebody who is familiar with her thinking, I am told that in her remarks, she is going to be speaking about the proverbial glass ceiling that she failed to shatter eight years ago and what she believes is possible if and when Kamala Harris breaks that ceiling herself. Now, we are told that Harris and Clinton have actually been in regular touch since President Biden dropped out of the race and that Hillary Clinton was actually one of the first people that the vice president called that Sunday that the president dropped out. That's really interesting. Speaking to some of the convention planners who say, basically, that switch at the top of the ticket from President Biden to the vice president happened just in the nick of time, that a lot of things had been already fully baked in, but those final touches, including even the printing of signs and some of the videos that had to be recorded, that those had not yet been executed. So what we are about to see this week, again, very different from what we would have seen four weeks ago before President Biden dropped out of the race. MJ Lee, CNN in Chicago. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Why are they characterizing that that way? THOMAS GIFT, DIRECTOR CENTRE OF U.S. POLITICS AT UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON: Well, thanks so much for having me, Ivan. It's great to see you again. I think Biden is a lame duck president, pure and simple. He's got three, four, five months where he really has the reins of power, but not much is going to happen during that period. I mean, we have a divided Congress. We've had that for the last several years. At the same time, you know, no policy is really going to get done. This is about passing the torch. It's about a new generation of candidate. And so Harris is going to try to take that opportunity and run with it at the convention.",

She has been VP for the last three and a half years. She also has been the presumptive presidential nominee and now officially the nominee for several weeks now.But polls show that considerable portions of Americans don't have a firm impression of Harris. That's especially true when it comes to policy. She's really been riding this wave of vibes, so to speak, now for several weeks. She hasn't answered any significant questions from reporters. She hasn't done any sit-down interviews. Harris did deliver an economic speech that we talked about where she introduced some new proposals, such as banning price gouging, creating new housing subsidies, expanding child tax credits. But Harris's honeymoon period is going to end. She needs to extend that honeymoon period for as long as possible with the convention and really define herself, as well as with Tim Walz.",

In some issues, she absolutely wants to distance herself, and she's had trouble doing that. It's particularly the case when it comes to inflation and cost of living. She gave in her speech about a few days ago, said, you know, three and a half years ago, prices were much lower. Whenever you went to the grocery store, you could afford the items that you wanted to buy. She seemed to conveniently forget that she's been the vice president. Now, of course, she's not responsible for everything that Biden did, but she has been by his side, and to the extent that some of those policies really did contribute to increases in cost of living, she's going to have a hard time to distance herself from that, but she's going to do her best for sure.",

He met a short time ago with Israeli President Isaac Herzog in Tel Aviv, and Blinken is trying to push for a ceasefire and hostage-release deal. CNN has learned his meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has begun. Blinken's also expected to speak with Defense Minister Yoav Gallant later today.Netanyahu says Israel will not give in to demands to end the war in Gaza as a condition for a deal, and Hamas claims Netanyahu is obstructing a possible agreement. CNN international diplomatic editor Nic Robertson joins us live now from Tel Aviv. Good to see you, Nic. You know, we're hearing accusations now both from Prime Minister Netanyahu and from Hamas, each side accusing each other of trying to -- of creating obstacles for a deal, but we're also hearing from reports that senior members of the Israeli defense establishment are also accusing Netanyahu of throwing up obstacles to a peace deal.

It's not just about securing a deal on Gaza, but it's about making sure that Iran or Hezbollah don't follow through on their statements that they were going to strike back at Israel for the killing of senior Hamas and Hezbollah figures just over a couple of weeks ago. So all of that is at stake.But there are key areas where there's disagreement. Israel wants to be able to filter Palestinians going from the south to the north of Gaza, make sure they don't have weapons. That is a red line, no-no, for Hamas. The control of the Egypt-Gaza border, the so-called Philadelphia Corridor. Israel insists it must have control of that. Otherwise, they say Hamas will continue to operate tunnels and smuggle in weapons into Gaza. Hamas is saying absolutely not. Israel wants to continue to control the Rafah border crossing. That's the main sort of area, place where trucks come and go in and out of Gaza into Egypt. That also is a red line for Hamas. So there are still some very, very contentious issues, and that's before you even get into details about the number of hostages, who's alive still, what their names are, which Palestinian prisoners would be released in exchange, all of that. The bridging proposal is designed to get across. So Secretary Blinken will have a very, very, very tough job here.",

The father survived, but six of his children were killed in an airstrike in central Gaza.The U.N. says that the safe zones in Gaza are now smaller than ever. They're down to 11 percent only of Gaza. 80 percent of the population, they say, has been forced to move. And this is a tragedy that is going on minute by minute by minute in Gaza. Israel says that it is targeting Hamas where it is operating close to civilians, even inside those so-called safe areas, and that it will continue to do so. In fact, it says it stepped up military activity around Khan Younis in the sort of south center of Gaza. So the dynamic is still an utterly deadly dynamic in Gaza. So while the talks are stalling and all that effort is going into moving them forward, people are still dying. The conditions, the living conditions are worsening. The safe places are lessening. You have as well the tensions on the northern border. Hezbollah launched a barrage of missiles and drones into northern Israel this morning. And just last night, there was what we understand to be an explosion on the streets of Tel Aviv here, the first in several decades of this type that intelligence authorities believe was terrorist-related.
