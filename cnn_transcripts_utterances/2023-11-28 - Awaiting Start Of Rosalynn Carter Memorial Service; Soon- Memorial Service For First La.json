      "sentences": "You are looking live at the white pillars of Glenn Memorial Church in sunny brisk Atlanta, Georgia as America prepares to say goodbye to the Steel Magnolia who forever changed -- what it means to be a first lady.You're watching live CNN special coverage of celebration of the remarkable life and times of Rosalynn Carter. I'm Jake Tapper in Washington. Soon the ceremony starts to honor the woman who spent almost eight decades at Jimmy Carter side. The numbers of her life are a testament to a marriage that was good and lasting. Four children, 12 grandchildren, 14 great grandchildren and counting. Born Illinois Rosalynn Smith to an auto mechanic and a dressmaker. She defied early trauma and poverty to walk the halls of power, not just as a bystander, but as a true equal. She was the very model of a modern first lady. Her hand touching every nook of her husband's presidency. She was the protector of her husband's political brand, the first to take an office in the East Wing. She attended cabinet meetings. She was also her husband's standing on the campaign trail in 1980, when the Iran hostage crisis consumed the nation and the world for 444 days. And today, the country gets its first glimpse in quite some time at Jimmy Carter. And he will be at Rosalynn side for the last time. The 39th president, as you may recall, entered hospice care earlier this year in February. The funeral will also bring together a roster of American luminaries who are rarely together. The current president and First Lady Jill and Joe Biden, the current Vice President Kamala Harris and Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, the 42nd President Bill Clinton, and we will also see all the living former first lady's -- former First Lady, Secretary of State and Senator Hillary Clinton, former First Lady Laura Bush, former First Lady Michelle Obama and former First Lady Melania Trump. I want to go straight to Atlanta now at CNN's Eva McKend, who was outside of the Glenn Memorial Church. Eva, what are you learning about today's ceremony as well as how it was planned?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Jake. You know, the most remarkable aspect is that 99-year-old former President Jimmy Carter will be here, though I'm told he is not expected to speak. His grandson Jason telling me that he is physically diminished and he himself is approaching the end of his life, but that powerfully, Jake, he wouldn't have missed this for the world.We also know many of the things that we'll see here today, Garth Brooks performing, Trisha Yearwood, the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra. That all of this was by Rosalynn Carter's design that prior to her passing, she really illustrated what she wanted this surface to look alike. And although there will be many dignitaries here many famous faces, the family tells me that what is most encouraging to them is all of the Georgians that have expressed their support for the family, as the motorcade made that long trip from planes, three hours here to Atlanta, people lined the streets, in support of the Carters and that has really just given them so much strength at this difficult time.

A little girl with blond hair, who went to public school in D.C. that was another break from D.C. tradition. And I don't think anybody went to public school since then presidential offspring. She was allowed to roller skate in the West Wing portico. They were very unconventional of the Carters.",

She was invited to these formal occasions, but she brought a book along with her. I think there was a tree house that was there. But she seemed very much the normal child, which I think reflects so much of the Carters. There she is.One thing that I just want to mention about today, which is, we've spoken so much about how former President Carter has been in hospice care for quite some time now. And I've spoken to close family friends who really underscored that his health is very fragile right now. But they said he was insistent about being here today. It was not sure. Even last night when he said to the family, he wanted to come in -- they weren't sure, but they said through sheer force of his will, which we know a lot about and determination. He insisted on being here together. And just finally, so many of their friends and family have said the following. You know, they talk about a partnership, but they can't imagine one without the other. This really was a team.",

She also participated in the struggle and left their church and plains when their church wouldn't integrate. Mrs. Carter had a tough time in 1980, when the moral majority was supporting president, then candidate Ron Reagan.And some people began to question her faith because of some of the policies that her husband had stood for. And she couldn't understand how people could doubt her piety. This is a woman who read the Bible, certainly when she was young, she read it every day and probably continued to read it most every day. And so, she was someone who was pained by how politics had begun to shape the way in which we thought about piety and religion in our country.",

And I think she would most want to be remembered. And we'd be remiss if we didn't talk about her mental health work. She is the first lady since Eleanor Roosevelt to address Congress to testify on behalf of a Mental Health Act. And she brought these concerns from the people around the country when she was campaigning to her husband. And so, she saw herself as a conduit for her husband. And there's a great story where she was campaigning for him in 1966. And she was 4:30 in the morning that tells you something about her commitment, standing outside of a factory. And she said to this very tired woman coming off her shift. She said, I hope you can go home and rest now. And the woman said, actually my daughter is mentally ill. And she heard this story and that night, Rosalynn Carter stood in line at her husband's rally, and just -- and shook his hand and he was surprised to see her, and he said, I'd like to talk to you about mental health. And you need to take this up as an issue. And so that is what she would most want us to be talking about.",

And in fact, her fight for the ERA was when it failed -- when the ratification failed of those final four states.Ironically, women's groups and feminist groups blamed Jimmy Carter for putting his wife front and center and trying to push for the ERA. So, there was this balance of her using her podium, which she used very effectively as an activist, first lady in the period of time that she served against a backdrop of a country that was reckoning with the role of women because first ladies before her were very active. Lady Bird Johnson was very active. Eleanor Roosevelt was very active. I mean, really set the standard. But the office of the first lady, we absolutely have her to thank for formalizing it, putting a structure around it. I was a direct recipient of that being a chief of staff to a first lady. And really credit Mrs. Carter for fighting for that even while her husband when he ran for president, ran on part of a platform of cutting the White House staff, but she succeeded in banding it.",

And what Rosalynn did was she attested and first saw the humanity in the person. And from that she then sprung to what can we do.So, she volunteered in and out of the hospitals in Georgia and was there on the ground meeting with people and from learning about that and seeing it in her own family, you know, at 12. She lost her father. She'd caregiving to him to leukemia, her mother's grieving, and she cares for her three younger siblings at age 12. And so, she knew that at some point, we all will not only be caregivers, but will become caregivers. She also saw mental health when she was working in this hospital and the profound problems that it created for the person and the family. So, from that, after seeing the humanity, she then said, OK, I'm going to push for a policy change. In1980 a huge governmental policy change that affected mental health and communities and funded it. She then said later, when she was out, President Carter was out of office, she said, OK, through the Rosalynn Carter Institute. I'm going to train journalists and train the American people on how to speak about mental health. She called people out and said we can't talk about these people is inmates. These are people who have mental health challenges. That was groundbreaking. That was, you know, a half a century ago. Her courage was something.",
