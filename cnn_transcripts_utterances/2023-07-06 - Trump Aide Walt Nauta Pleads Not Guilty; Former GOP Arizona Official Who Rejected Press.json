Walt Nauta appeared in a Miami courtroom earlier today after his first appearance had been delayed. Nauta's appearance comes as we learned of a major development in a separate investigation into different alleged criminal behavior by Donald Trump. Former Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers tells CNN that he has met with the FBI about Trump's efforts to overturn the election in his state, Arizona, part of special counsel Jack Smith's January 6th investigation. Bowers, a conservative Republican, resisted pressure from Trump and his allies, after Trump lost Arizona in 2020. CNN's Carlos Suarez starts off our coverage from Miami.

Nauta was finally able to enter a plea in this case after finally scoring a south Florida-based attorney. His arraignment was postponed twice, because he couldn't find a local counsel.Now, attorney Sasha Dadan was in court with Nauta, along with his Washington, D.C.-based attorney. And Dadan is a former public defender with a good amount of experience trying cases in south Florida. She has an office in Fort Pierce, and that's where Nauta and former President Donald Trump's trial will take place. Now, Nauta pleaded not guilty to obstruction charges, and lying to investigators. Prosecutors say that Nauta moved several boxes, dozens of boxes with classified documents from a storage room at Trump's Mar- a-Lago properties, to other parts of that property, and that he lied about the entire thing. All of this, according to prosecutors, was in an effort to try to keep one of Donald Trump's lawyers from finding some of these classified documents that have been subpoenaed by a grand jury. Now, Jake, according to a search warrant affidavit that was released yesterday, prosecutors said that they have surveillance video from Mar-a-Lago showing someone moving several boxes before the FBI searched the property.

Most headlines coming from inside Belarus, where Prigozhin was supposedly supposed to have been in exile. But now, Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko tells CNN that Prigozhin is in fact still in Russia. As Russian state media covers a raid on one of the Wagner chief's homes in St. Petersburg. CNN's Matthew Chance attended Lukashenko's press conference, where Chance's questions for the Belarusian leader made a lot of news. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The rare meeting, with the Belarusian leader, and an extraordinary revelation, of the whereabouts of Wagner, the Russian mercenaries he's meant to be sheltering. Despite earlier statements, neither its fighters, nor its leader he tells me, have taken up his offer of exile. ALEXANDER LUKASHENKO, BELARUSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  As far as I'm informed, as of this morning, the Wagner fighters are now stationed at the regular camps, where they go through rotation to rest and recover from the front lines. In terms of Yevgeny Prigozhin, he is in St. Petersburg, or maybe this morning, he would travel to Moscow or elsewhere. But he is not on the territory of Belarus now.",

The suspect, Taylor Taranto, is a former U.S. Navy service member, who also happens to be a January 6th defendant.How did he find Obama's house? Well, prosecutors are blaming another former president. A Justice Department memo says, quote, former President Donald Trump posted what he claimed was the address of former President Barack Obama in a social media platform Truth Social. Taranto used his own Truth Social count to re-post the address, unquote. The Justice Department here almost makes it sound like Trump blasted out the Google maps location for the sake of creating chaos. Not to excuse it anyway what happened, but the truth is a bit more complicated that. Here's the context of what Trump did. He posted four pages from a 2017 conservative newsletter that praised Trump's first hundred days in office, selectively of course. And in a passage, suggesting that the Obamas were still in D.C. fighting against Trump, the second page of the newsletter included the exact home address of the Obama's new $5 million mansion. Why they did that, I do not know? But prosecutors say Taranto re- posted that page of the newsletter, writing, quote, got them surrounded, unquote. This Truth Social count, by the way, has the same username as Taranto's YouTube page. CNN was unable to confirm the identity. Now, here's what Taranto reportedly brought along with him to the Obamas' neighborhood, the address of which he learned from that Trump posting. Quote, I mean, not quote, but here's what he brought -- hundreds of rounds of ammunition, these two firearms, and a machete. CNN's John Miller joins us now.

PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER:  Jake, President Biden, bringing his Bidenomics sales pitch to South Carolina, a deep red state, but also one that relies on his campaign in 2020. And while he was here, he touted his legislative accomplishments, including, for example, the Inflation Reduction Act, and infrastructure law. And then kick through the winds of the past three years, including 11 billion dollars in manufacturing and green energy in the state. Also touting more manufacturing jobs, and more investments generally into clean energy. And, he also took a political swipe at Republicans in the state, who voted to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act, which the administration says has been paying off. But, of course, Bidenomics, and the crux of it, is on a strong economy. And on that front, the president recognized that it may be a tough sell. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Priscilla Alvarez, thank you so much, with the president in West Columbia, South Carolina.Let's bring in Democratic Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, the national co-chair for President Biden's 2024 reelection campaign. Senator, good to see you. Thanks for joining. So, President Biden says the economy is strong, that his administration is spurring U.S. manufacturing and creating good paying jobs. That's not how the American people see it. In a recent CNN poll, 66 percent of Americans say they disapprove of the president's handling of the economy, 76 percent of Americans say that our current economic conditions are poor. Obviously, some of the factors driving this is the cost of living is up and people might feel that the president is all touch with the American people on the state of the economy. SEN. CHRIS COONS (D-DE):  Well Jake, the reality on the ground is that we are seeing the strongest job growth in decades. We have the lowest unemployment in 50 years. Just this week, the announcement that there were half 1 million new jobs created by the private sector in the month of June. Overall, 13 million jobs created by our private sector in the two and a half years President Biden has been in office. That's the strongest recovery of any advanced economy on earth, from the depths of the pandemic. And so yes, there is a gap between the polling, the perception, and the reality on the ground and in the daily lives of Americans. Look, if I were facing reelection, I would prefer strong, on the ground reality of great jobs and good opportunities, and needing to communicate about it, then the opposite, having a positive perception but very weak numbers on the ground. President Biden is in South Carolina today, because he and his cabinet, and his supporters in Congress are fanning out across the country to engage Americans, and to help inform them about exactly what he has gotten done in the bipartisan infrastructure law, the CHIPS and Science Act, the growth in manufacturing. Jake, the news is really good on the job front.",

That upon returning, for more than 500 days in an Iranian jail, he was greeted with IRS tax penalties.And so, Senator Mike Rounds and I, he's a good friend, a Republican senator, introduced a bipartisan bill.
