Part of an event, commemorating the 70th anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education, the landmark civil rights case that led to school desegregation.And just yesterday, the president met at the White House with the plaintiffs in that case. Now, the president was trying to deliver a message to the black community that he understands the progress that the community has made, and also the work that is left to do. Here's the president, in his own words. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: The black students rely on Pell Grants to go to college. And something I'm really proud of. We're making historic investments in historic black colleges and universities. I'm from Delaware. So, I go along with Delaware state to be the best HBCUs. Kamala keeps saying is Howard. And I'm going now -- I'm going on Sunday to make a speech at that other place -- that man's college, more -- Morehouse. I got more Morehouse men in my administration in Morehouse. The regardless of loyalties, it's clear HBCUs are vital to our nation's progress. I mean it. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But I would say, that's not terribly different from what we've seen in past election cycles that a Democratic presidential candidate may put together.What is different is that Donald Trump -- according to all the public polling out there may be on the precipice of doing better and performing better with more support from African Americans than any Republican in the modern era. That's the different piece of this. So that's why this can't just be for the Biden campaign, nor do -- when you talk to them, I don't think they intended to be. Just a one-week kind of thing and done, maybe the way that the president likes to joke about the former president and infrastructure week. This will not just be a one and done effort. This is going to be a concerted effort. You see it in their field organizing attempts. You'll see it in their paid advertising.

      "sentences": "Yeah. And Zolan, I want you to look at some of what Kayla was just talking about. First, let's just go back to 2020 and the actual vote. Black voters, Biden got one that 75 percent of them. And just look at the subset of 18- to 29-year-old voters, 24 percent. Now this is -- that's an actual vote. Now we're just looking at polls and he is down in the polls to 49 percent.Now we know that, for lots of reasons, polling in the black community, political polling has been fraught. And maybe the sample sizes haven't been big enough to get a true sense. But as we talked about that, I also want to talk about what you have reported. As recently as last week, you and your colleagues have a story, the justice department recommends easing restrictions on marijuana. And part of what you talk about in there is that that was a policy decision intended as an outreach activist to African American voters, but to young voters, in particular. ZOLAN KANNO-YOUNGS, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, THE NEW YORK TIMES &amp; CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Yeah, that's right. That's right. I mean, look, yes, it's early. And we're looking at polling here. But one, I can tell you that these numbers have the attention of some of Mr. Biden's closest political advisors -- some of President Biden's closest political advisors. They are -- they are worried about this frustration that's far because this very much is the base of the party. And in a way sort of scrambling for different policy achievements now that you can show that can energize not just -- not just voters in the black community, which is obviously not a monolith, but specifically young black voters as well. So that falls as the marijuana announcement, definitely is an example of that. Look, that's essentially a proposed rule. It's not going to take effect for a while. It's like a long arduous process. The fact that the president put out a video with it yesterday, a week after the Justice Department sort of recommendation to the White House, even shows just the urgency to really find something to energize these voters.",

But I do want to say to, look when we talk about young black voters, when we talk about voters in the black community, many of the concerns are the same that many American voters, it's the economy, right? It's frustrations around affordability. So, just looking for sort of different announcements, such as like a marijuana announcement, it's not going to suffice. And if this current moment that we're in reminds me of the last time around Biden made a commencement speech at Howard University. I spent the week going and talking to Howard students, as well as their parents to sort of see that generational divide in a way. What you had is parents obviously worried about the state of democracy. But saying, look, if it's a choice between Biden and Trump, I'm going to go with Biden. But those younger voters are saying, we have high expectations here. This person came in, proposing sprawling -- you know, proposals and didn't get -- and didn't, you know, get policy achievements, legislative achievements, but it wasn't everything that they heard, you know, initially. So, whether he can meet those high expectations. That's what we have to watch with these events moving forward.",

Talking about all of his accomplishments, the things that he's delivered in his presidency, diversity and whatnot without going very negative on Trump.Because this is a discussion right now within the Biden sphere of folks who want him to go more on the offensive and remind these young people of what's at stake of what happened during the first Trump presidency with the court, with affirmative action, with Roe v. Wade, and there's others, Dana, who want to go even further. I think the debates are going to be an opportunity for Biden to show his hand on this and whether he's going to go brass knuckles on some of this. And extending to some of the advice for instance, that Reverend Sharpton -- Reverend Sharpton has given, which is look, we should also talk about the way back history of Central Park Five of housing discrimination. He even said, he wanted some of these individuals to come to the debates. So, you have a lot of tension here within the advisory sphere for Biden to get a lot more rough and tumble.",

And I mean, I have talked to people, African American leaders who are concerned about what the reception that the president is going to get this weekend at Morehouse. And it's not so much -- and maybe it's a little bit about did he do what he promised to do on the economy. But it's not unlike to your point, the concern that the Biden administration -- the Biden campaign has when he goes on any college campus.KANNO-YOUNGS: It follows him everywhere he goes now. I mean, my colleague Maya King did a great piece where she basically went and met with black clergy members in Georgia as well and around the country, who did express concern about how Biden's policy towards Israel and Gaza would impact the black vote. We've already seen some protests around Morehouse in the surrounding colleges around there. We know that the faculty is well circulated a petition around the time that this was announced. So, I think it's fair to say that we can expect, you know, some protests. But, you know, to your point, I mean, that's kind of been where everywhere the president goes at this point. So, whether or not it stops at speech. I don't think that that would be the situation, but it will definitely be something to watch there. I'm still looking at the central challenge, I think, but the Biden administration has had -- when it comes to their racial equity agenda, which is, you know, you came in talking about voting rights sprawl and criminal justice reform. The fact that democracy is being threatened and you have had policy accomplishments, but they're not sort -- but how can you sell -- how do you sell enrollment in Obamacare, lower prescription drug pricing, lower unemployment, when many of the students that are in that commencement speech are worried about the state of democracy and the current state of the nation right now.",

And their bodies indeed retrieved from the Gaza Strip by the Israeli military. The IDF spokesman Admiral Daniel Hagari saying in that news conference that you just played a clip of that the three of them were attending the Nova Music Festival on October 7. They actually managed to escape the festival as Hamas militants and terrorists began arriving and shooting of that festival and regime.But then in (inaudible), a town nearby is where the Israeli military says that these three individuals were killed, and their bodies then subsequently taken into the Gaza Strip. We already knew previously, according to the Israeli government that Shani Louk, the 23-year-old tattoo artists from Tel Aviv, who was attending this festival, that she had been killed on October 7, after in late October. Forensic pathologist discovered a fragment of her skull in Israel and concluded that she was dead. But today was the first time that we've actually heard official confirmation that Amit Bouskila, a 28-year-old and Itshak Gelernter who was 58 years old, that they were indeed killed on that grim Saturday. This is of course, as we've been watching reaction pour in from all corners of Israeli society, including the Israeli prime minister who says that his heart breaks for this great loss. It is a powerful reminder of just how connected everyone in Israel feels to the fate of these hostages. And the Nova Music Festival was certainly one of the reasons for that. And that's because this festival pulled together people from all corners of Israeli society, all corners of the country from near the Gaza Strip, but also from Tel Aviv, from Northern Israel, contributing to this sense of connectedness that so many Israelis feel to the plight of these hostages.

Thanks to both of you.Barak, I'm going to start with you. What is your latest reporting, not just on this mission that allowed for the IDF to announce this grim news, but kind of what it means in the bigger picture, and the ultimate goal here, which is to get all the hostages back and to stop the war in Gaza? BARAK RAVID, CNN POLITICAL &amp; GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST: Well, I think that one of the things that are evident from this -- from this retrieval of those bodies is dead. Every day that passes, we find out that more and more of those hostages were either killed on October 7, or while they were in captivity, those specific three were killed on October 7, but the hostage talks are stalled. Just in the last few days, there were several meetings of the Israeli war cabinet with no real progress when it comes to how to re-launch those talks and how to create possibility for a breakthrough. And I think that this isn't -- this might be the tragedy that most of the news that Israelis get over the last few weeks and months about the hostages are mostly about dead bodies that are being brought back from Gaza.",

But this will not end until we get everybody back, including the bodies.The fact that the IDF is risking lives of soldiers to get the bodies out gives us a sentiment of how important this is to the sentiment of Israel public and in the military. Ultimately, though, it is Hamas was refusing to release them. Hamas took them on October 7. Hamas murdered so many of them either on October 7, and afterwards. There were several times deals on the table that Hamas could ever prove. We've seen President Biden and leaders of the world understand and recognize that is Hamas that is not allowing this to happen because they want the war to completely end before even they release all of the bodies of the hostages, the Israeli public. Israel as a country cannot agree to that. We did not look for this war. We did not enter this war. We were very much surprised as everybody knows. We've suffered a total massacre.
