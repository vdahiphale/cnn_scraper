In the coming hours, The E.U. is expected to discuss its response to Tehran's crackdown on demonstrators, including the situation in the Kurdish region of the country. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHURCH (voice over): Human rights groups based in Norway tells CNN that at least 13 people have been killed in Kurdish cities in the past 24 hours. This, as an Internet watchdog says cellular data was down in those areas for hours during the protests. (END VIDEO CLIP) CHURCH (on camera): Well, since the beginning of protests over two months ago over Mahsa Amini's death, Iran's regime has unleashed a campaign of repression. Eyewitnesses tell CNN, sexual violence is being used to suppress, demoralize, and in some cases, blackmail protesters. CNN's Nima Elbagir has this exclusive report. But we want to warn you, it contains details of sexual violence. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIMA ELBAGIR, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Over these mountains is Iran, a regime that has succeeded in cutting many of its people off from the outside world. But disturbing stories detailing the authority's brutal retribution, systematic sexual violence against anti-regime protesters have begun leaking out. We've come here to the Kurdish region of Iraq to try and find out more. This is Hannah (PH), not her real name, a Kurdish Iranian woman recently smuggled out of Iran. She fears for her life. After taking off and burning her headscarf on the streets, she was arrested and detained by Iranian intelligence officers. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): They choose the women who were pretty and suited their appetite. Then, the officer would take one of them from the cell to a smaller private room. They would sexually assault them there.",

Disturbingly, in some cases, the rapes were filmed and used to blackmail protesters into silence. There has been a real escalation where female protesters are, as you can see here, being openly assaulted, often sexually. But the violence against women like the protests are not confined to the Kurdish areas. They are often focused on locations where the protests are most intense, like here in the capital, Tehran. One of these stories is Armita Abassi, a typical 20-year-old on social media, sharing her love of animals -- In social media post appearing under her name, Abassi, like many young women in Iran criticize the regime openly after the protests began. Unlike most, she did it without anonymity. It didn't take long for security forces to find and arrest her. Abassi disappeared. Soon after, whistleblowers began to post on various social media platforms. Medics sharing eyewitness accounts of what had been done to Abassi. \"First of all,\" they say, \"there were a few plain clothes men with her and they did not let her out of their sight. Even during a private medical examination, they were there.\" \"She was my patient. I went to her bedside. They had shaved her hair. She was scared and was trembling.\" \"When she first came in, they said it was rectal bleeding due to repeated rape, the plain clothes men insisted that the doctor write that the rape was from prior to her arrest. And then, after this issue was becoming obvious to all, they change the entire scenario altogether.\" The details of these leaks were confirmed to CNN by an insider at Imam Ali Hospital, where Abassi was brought to be examined. In a statement, the government said, \"Abbasi was treated for digestive problems.\" The medics who treated her said that was not true. The Iranian regime denies the rape, accusing her of leading protests and allegation which could see her face the death penalty. At this usually busy border crossing between Iraq and Iran, it is deceptively quiet. Those who can cross tell us the noose is tightening on protesters. Authorities have for decades used sexual torture against Iranians and it appears once more a familiar pattern. Sexual violence deployed to enforce an assertion of moral guardianship.

Then, Mexico will take on Poland and its prolific scorer Robert Lewandowski. And finally, the defending World Cup champions France will start their title defense against Australia. Monday began with a route as Group B favorites England dominated Iran. It was a 6-2 goal fest with intriguing storylines, both on and off the pitch. Also, in Group B, Wales rallied and scored on a Gareth Bale penalty kick to tie the U.S. late in the match. It ended with a 1-1 draw. And here is a look at the full Monday results. A group -- in Group A, the Netherlands clashed with African champions Senegal, with the Dutch seizing the victory. Final score, 2-0.

Or why the tournament shouldn't have been here. At the same time, I think the local people, the ones I've interacted with here in Qatar have been gracious hosts for what that's worth. But yes, I mean, the rainbow armband, the one love armband issue yesterday was certainly rubbed a lot of people the wrong way, because this is -- this is something that the European teams had told FIFA they plan to do for, you know, a couple of months now. And to get clarification the day before the tournament is about to kick off that they could potentially face yellow card discipline for wearing that armband.

I guess that my question is, you know, there are tens of thousands of frozen embryos, maybe hundreds of thousands of frozen embryos around the country, you can't give birth to all of them. I mean, what is your feeling about that?PHILIP RIDGEWAY, PARENTS OF TWINS FROM EMBRYOS FROZEN 30 YEARS AGO: No, that's a good point. I think there's sort of two problems. One is the upstream problem of there's more and more, you know, embryos created and then, frozen every day. But then, there's the downstream problem of what do you with the embryos that already are frozen? And we can't do anything about the upstream problem but we can do something about the downstream problem. And adopting these two children may have been just a drop in the bucket. But these are two children that are no longer sitting in liquid nitrogen waiting to be adopted. So, whether it was two children or however many, we accomplished what we set out to accomplish, which is to, yes, rescue children.",

I know some people, you know, it definitely is a consideration. But for us and for our family, the idea of, like I said before, giving birth to my adopted child, knowing that there are some, you know, kids still struggle with separation even as infants, since we're able to avoid that trauma for them was very appealing to me and then, really giving these children value. A lot of embryos, a lot of people look at embryos as somehow less than human. And the reality is, is that God created every single embryo, that's it's because of him that they are living, that they are given life and they each have value. They're made in his image. And we really wanted to show how Timothy and Lydia were embryos but they're the same children. They were the same children now as they were then. They were just smaller. And so, we really wanted to give these children, in particular, these embryos are frozen, a voice and show the world that they deserve life and that they should be given that opportunity to have life, you know, one parents and couple at a time.",

The former \"Tonight Show\" host who is an avid collector of cars was injured in a gasoline fire a little more than a week ago, suffering burns to his face, chest and hands.Doctors at the Grossman Burn Center in Los Angeles say they are optimistic that he will make a full recovery. The hospital releasing a photo of Leno with some of the medical staff. We're back now with Mara S. Campo and Frank Luntz are joined by Charlotte Alter, the national correspondent for the \"TIME\" magazine.\" Guys, I'm so happy to hear this because I was on the air last week when we first got word that this had happened and it sounded really bad. It sounded as though he was not going to be out of the hospital in a week. And so, I'm surprised that he's made this kind of recovery. MARA S. CAMPO, JOURNALIST AND \"RUN TELL THIS\" HOST:  It's great to see these photos, to see him recovering and healing. But I also really love that he posted these photos of him as he is in the healing journey. Because we live in the age of transparency, right, everybody shares everything. But it's not necessarily the age of authenticity. People aren't real about what they're going through. So, when someone like Jay Leno post this as he's healing, not after the healing is done, but as he's going through it, I think with other people who are going through it, it really offers a lot of comfort.",
