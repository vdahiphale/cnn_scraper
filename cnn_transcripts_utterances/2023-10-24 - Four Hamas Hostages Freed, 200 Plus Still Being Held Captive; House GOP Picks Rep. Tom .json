      "sentences": "Well, a problem for Tom Emmer on the House floor. He does not have the 217 votes to be elected speaker. There is an ongoing vote at the moment, a roll call vote in which members are saying whether or not they will vote for Tom Emmer, who is the Republican nominee to be speaker.He just won that nomination contest. But now the question is, will they vote for him on the House floor in a straight party line vote. He can only afford to lose four votes, but we are told that he has lost about 10 right now. That is according to Congressman Dan Meuser. He's a Pennsylvania Republican and initially had run for speaker. He dropped out himself. But Meuser just told me and a bunch of reporters just moments ago that about 10 members have said that they will actually vote against Emmer on the floor. He said they're not just the hard-right members, the House Freedom Caucus members, the ones who do ended Kevin McCarthy's speakership. He said there are a whole different range of members, perhaps have a different range of issues. Some of them had told me prior to this that they have concerns about some of his votes on spending, on codifying same sex marriage. We'll see if that's the reason why. But ultimately here, this is the issue for Emmer. He does not have the votes at the moment, which raises questions. Can he get the votes? What assurances can he give the members to get the 217 votes? How long will it take to go to the floor and try to reopen the House? All huge questions as we get into yet another period of uncertainty for the House Republicans. Even though Tom Emmer is close to becoming speaker, simply not there yet given enough opposition in the narrowly divided Republican House, indicating that Emmer is still short around 10 votes or so to becoming speaker of the House. We'll see if he ultimately gets there and how the rest of the day plays out here now, Dana. BASH: And just to underscore what you're saying, when you were on a short while ago, we were talking about whether they would do a secret ballot behind closed doors to see if Congressman Emmer can get that to 17. It turns out that they're doing what's known as a roll call vote. So they're doing kind of what we saw happen in public over and over again, just with Republicans to test in a way that they didn't do before. And he doesn't have it.",

They're making it very publicly behind closed doors so the -- Emmer will know which members he has to go to flip.If he has around 10 or so, that means he has to flip about six to come his directions. But what assurance is going to give them? Will he get there on issues such as demands that some of these members have made on spending issues and the like? That could take some time to play out. And all the while, all those huge, pressing national issues, whether it's aid to Israel, aid to Ukraine, taking steps to avoid a mid- November government shutdown, none of that can get done until the Republicans are able to figure out and -- this leadership crisis that was started at the hands of one of their members. Can they get there? Such a huge question at this moment. Is Tom Emmer still short the 217 votes? We'll see what his next steps are as they still meet and huddle behind closed doors here, Dana.",

Clearly a strategy there, as we've seen in public, Trump's team sort of go after the fact that Cohen is a convicted felon, questioning his credibility as it pertains to this case.But next up, Cohen has been talking about what he did for the Trump Organization, saying of course, as we know, that he was Trump's personal attorney, that he was in the room with him all the time, having discussions, making decisions, resolving any issues that brought Trump ire. And this is what's going to be pivotal to this case for the New York Attorney General's Office because they say he's had many conversations, Cohen, with Trump about his net worth, about of fudging financials for Trump. And so this is what is really at the center of this case, but certainly a dramatic moment as these two men have not been in the same room in five years, Dana. Of course, we've seen them go at each other in public, whether it be social media or in interviews, but certainly, this is the first time they are face to face with Michael Cohen on the stand and turning against his former boss.
