So, you want that shot to take effect and be ready to protect you against the flu.And here is why and I'm sorry to put this in such stark numbers but this is really why you get the shot. The last time we had a real flu season a couple of years ago, flu killed 500 children. I will tell you, I have sat with those children and sat with those families who had children who died, cried with them. It is horrible. You do not want that to happen to your child. And adults, nearly 25,000 died that year. So, let's talk about the power of flu vaccines and what they can do. So, if you look at the 2019-2020 flu season, flu shots prevented 6,300 deaths, more than 100,000 hospitalizations and more than 7.5 million illnesses. So, get your flu shot, flu by boo, this weekend, the perfect time.",

Flu shots are generally sort of in the 40 percent to 60 percent effectiveness rate. I'll be honest, they are not the most effective vaccine out there, but, still, if you could reduce your risk of getting very sick from the flu by like even 50 percent, that is a lot. You could save your own life, you could save your child's life.",

One of them is the fact that Doug Emhoff is the first Jewish person in any of sort of the four roles, president, vice president, first lady or now second gentleman. And they put a mezuzah on the door post of the naval observatory where they live. A mezuzah is something that traditionally Jews put there as a way to commemorate or remember God's commandments. And he said wanted to do that to make a point for a lot of reasons, one of which is that there is a rise in anti-Semitism in America and he wants to use his platform to speak out.He did release a statement most recently about certainly the Kanye West controversy, saying that hate has no -- and anti-Semitism has no place in America. So, that is one of many things, Erica, he and I spoke about as we walked around the naval observatory. One was the fact that he has older kids. And he did something that I actually didn't even know about. He got some tattoos that relate to them. So, watch that part of this discussion. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

We had one night where we got kind of caught behind another party that got a bag stuck and ended having to climb until past 1:00 A.M. And I couldn't believe it. Sam, I expected him to cry a couple of times on this trip because it is hard and emotional but he has been so tough and worked through all of it. And so --yes.
