The Israeli defense forces say that was about 2,500. Nonetheless, thousands of missiles fired in a very short period of time, providing cover for attacks by sea. There was a motorized craft were used by Hamas to infiltrate from the sea.They used paragliders to sail over the Israeli defenses and fences that keep the Gazans in and has been like that now for some decades. And of course, then, they were able to penetrate the fence and actually launch ground attacks. All of this amounting to the biggest intelligence failure of Israel since the surprise attack by massed Arab armies in the Yom Kippur of 1973. But much more importantly, from the Israeli perspective this is striking, this is the Hamas and their militant supporters striking right in the heart of towns like Sderot, which is very close to the Gaza Strip. But there has very high levels of security normally and then somehow they've been able to overcome those, they've been seen fighting on the streets, killing people allegedly at a bus stop. I think the 22-figure of Israeli dead so far is certain to be increasing. And then I think ultimately this is very much part of the plan. It's been a long time in the making. Just under a year ago, I was in Jenin on the north of the West Bank where militants there who had been increasing the violence of their attack had a warning of what might come. This is what they said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The leader of the Hamas military wing in Gaza, Mohammed al-Dir, has called on his supporters and supporters of the Palestinian extremist cause to rise up, not just on the West Bank, but obviously inside the Palestinian population inside Israel where the Knesset says there are some 400,000 weapons believed to be in the hands of what they call Israeli Arabs. And of course, in the background there is that potential threat from Hezbollah. That's in South Lebanon.That's unlikely to be unleashed unless it is clear that the Israelis are fighting on multiple fronts in the occupied territories, Gaza and indeed inside its own territory. So, the next 48 hours are going to be crucial for the Israelis with Benjamin Netanyahu there vowing a very powerful response. He will be under extreme pressure from groups, I think, right across the Israeli political spectrum to try to go into Gaza to break the back of Hamas. But in the past, that has been tried and has failed, often creating a great deal of criticism for Israel in the international community but also bringing Israelis face to face on the ground in terms of infantry and armored attacks inside the Gaza Strip. It's extremely dangerous and fraught with problems particularly if it is true that Hamas has managed already to have captured live hostages and moved them back into Gaza. That is going to complicate any Israeli operations very severely. Victor, Amara.",

Israel has got pretty good intelligence and has seeded the Gaza pretty well with informants so that they would know if a major operation was being launched. And so, in many ways, you know, what it's reminiscent of is the attacks in the Yom Kippur War, which were exactly 50 years ago this week.And in that case, Israel was also taken by surprise. That didn't really seem possible, given the modern amount of intelligence that they have. So, I think that's one element. The second is the complexity of what Hamas has launched here. And they had bulldozers ready to breach the walls. They clearly had their rocket forces ready. It looks like it's been about 2,200 rocket launches ready. And that's why there are such severe Israeli casualties, which we haven't seen before. And I think the complexity here for President Biden is going to be pretty high this weekend. First of all, his relationship with Bibi Netanyahu has been pretty tense. Second, he was hoping to be, President Biden was hoping to be in the final weeks of negotiating what would be a historic Saudi Arabia-Israel move toward normalization that was going to depend on Prime Minister Netanyahu agreeing to Palestinian state, a freeze on settlements.

Hamas never really took responsibility or claimed responsibility for that. Because, at least one of the reasons, the expectations that they were attacking from Lebanon and not Gaza was the guaranteed retaliatory demolition of Gaza after attacking Israel.

And, you know, it's really it's going to be very difficult for the United States and others to really even find the right forces within the Palestinian political structure to go talk to, because they are so fractured at this point, so divided, that it's not clear how you conduct a meaningful negotiation.",

And to also wrap your mind around what the civilians are going through now, people in Israel, especially in southern Israel, they are being told to stay barricaded inside their homes. There are reports that militants are knocking on doors. We know that hostages have been taken, including Israeli soldiers.That is what we're hearing from Hamas. We know out in the streets, according to some videos that we have gotten here at CNN and some videos that are circulating on social media that CNN has able to geolocate. We are seeing videos of civilians being fired upon. We also had video of, I think it was a red SUV that was also being fired upon by Hamas militants. We also have video of a tank that was seized by Hamas militants and them cheering there in the streets.

Of course, when we did, when had enough time to dig back into it, we all discovered things that we should have seen.I'm sure the Israelis will, over time, try to go look for how they missed an operation of this complexity. And you know, that really is the most stunning part of this, because we've not really associated Hamas with the ability in the past to do land, sea, air, you know, coordinated operations.

I do not have information yet about whether those reservists who said they would not serve, whether they have follow through and have not followed the call to serve right now or whether that has affected the Israeli military readiness. We have not heard that from the Israeli military. All we've heard from them saying that they are calling up thousands of reservists. What is clear, though, is that Israel was caught off guard. Israel was surprised, Israel was not expecting this. This is something that Benjamin Netanyahu said himself saying that they were surprised. I mean, if Israel was expecting anything close to this, that festival of nature, that party, that rave in the desert would not have happened because it's so close to the separation fence. In the past, there have been sort of indications. We kind of get an idea of what's been happening. And there have been tensions in Jerusalem. There have been tensions along the separation fence.

This is stunning, obviously very concerning about what happens next. What are you expecting when it comes to Gaza and Israel's response? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes. I think, Amara, what we're going to see is a lot of aerial attacks, like the one that you just showed the video of. That one appeared to be along the Gaza-Israeli border. And we're going to have the Israelis go after the infiltration routes that the Hamas fighters are using right now. So, the Israeli intelligence is working overtime at this particular point in time, Israeli Air Force is sending its jets up in the air to respond in the way that you see. But they're also going to go after the command-and-control targets of Hamas. So, any headquarters type installations, any areas where the leaders of Hamas are concentrated right now, they will -- the Israelis will go after those areas. That's part of the standard Israeli practice. And they will also be using ground forces to probably go into at least parts of Gaza. That's going to be a very difficult operation. Because Gaza is not only a very crowded, it's basically a complete setting for urban warfare. And that is going to make it very difficult for the Israelis to advance in areas like this.

We've seen the reports of -- you mentioned them on air, where you've got people who are in shelters, in their bomb shelters, and the Hamas militants are right at the door of the bomb shelter, trying to force their way in. So, those types of scenarios will result in that limited type of urban warfare.Hamas won't -- probably won't be able to amass the numbers of fighters that they would need to do a full-blown urban warfare-type operation. But limited incursions absolutely are possible, because, frankly, they're going on right now. And there will be continued attacks in places like Ashkelon, as we're seeing right there on the video. And that is going to be a major factor for the Israelis. It's going to be an essence of diversionary attack by the Hamas fighters in order to get into areas where we haven't seen them in many instances before.
