They came out, the company, and they said that they lost $58 million and only had $4 million in revenue in 2023. Those are painful revelations and that immediately crushed the valuation of the stock, costing Trump $1 billion on paper. The loss is in fact so severe that the company's own accountants are sounding the alarm that it could implode, which is why experts think the company's multi- billion dollar valuation defies logic, and I heard that well before I even started listing to be honest. Even with a cash infusion of $300 million after going public, the company is not out of the woods. It is obviously hemorrhaging users as well.Thanks so much for joining us.

He's now extending it to include family members of the judge and the district attorney Alvin Bragg. Alvin Bragg is not covered by the gag order, so Trump can talk about him if he wants.In this order, the judge writes, the court now amends the March 26 order to include the family members of the court and the district attorney of New York County. This decision and order is equally narrowly tailored and in no way prevents defendant to - from responding to alleged political attacks, but does address defendant's recent speech. He also goes on to say that this isn't a case of David and Goliath, and that the roles are no longer in play as demonstrated by the singular power of Trump's words have on countless others. He said that there is - he finds that there is a threat to the integrity of judicial proceedings and says the threat is very real.

So if you get past one, you don't get past another.But those initial moments, once a car rams into that barrier, Anderson, your heart is thumping as you approach that car, right? There's a security booth not far away, and you're wondering, is this an active shooter who's about to pop out with an AR-15? Is it like Cincinnati? Is this whole car, a massive car bomb? What's about to happen? But you have to keep going. And when they pulled this man out of the car, he did not say (inaudible) the gut right now on the part of the people who are looking into it, and my own is, this is probably an individual who's going through a difficult mental episode, probably not trying to attack the FBI, maybe trying to get in to tell them something that so far is only in his mind. But it certainly set off alarm bells, and it certainly reminded 55 other field offices that security is a top priority, especially with talk about weapons (inaudible) the FBI, witch hunts and all the other threats that are increasing to FBI agents, federal prosecutors and judges.",

They're calling this unacceptable. And, of course, as you said, seven, at least, officials from the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps were killed, including two very senior commanders in the IRGC. So Israel - Iran vowing to take revenge here. But Israel, neither confirming nor denying that they were behind this strike, instead telling CNN earlier today, according to a spokesperson, that this consulate was not a consulate at all. And according to their intelligence, they do believe that it was actually being used by the IRGC and was being just portrayed globally as a consulate, when in fact it was being used for military purposes. So we're not getting really any confirmation from the Israelis that this was them. But the Iranians, of course, placing the blame squarely on the Israelis and saying that they are going to take some kind of retaliatory measures, which is, of course, something the U.S. does not want to see. They don't want to see this escalate beyond the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. So they're reaching out to allies and partners in the region now, trying to get a sense of what happened here. But clearly, this does not bode well for the tensions between Israel and Iran, given that if Israel did do this, then that would have been an attack that Iran sees as an attack on its sovereign territory, Anderson.",

You've seen attacks on facilities. This -- there's nothing covert about this. You saw the scope of that destruction. This is where the war turns overt, and that's where countries feel like they have to show they're not going to be embarrassed that they will respond. The third really interesting element of it, I think, though, is that the Iranians have to wonder, how did they know that so many commanders from the Quds force, the elite group of the Iranian military were gathered in one place? There's either a human spy or there was some kind of intercept, but it was remarkable intelligence that they could kill six of these commanders -- seven of these commanders at one shot (ph).",

What more are your sources telling you about the decision that the palace is making right now about his health?FOSTER (on-camera): Well, I think it was a big reassurance exercise for the public, but also for the family. They're ultimately there to support the King. And now that he's going to be able to do a bit more, they're going to take each engagement one by one, depending on the medical advice. Then, if he's able to do more, then less pressure on them. Particularly, the Princess of Wales, who's going through chemo has to consider that, and also it's got the kids off school at the moment. I think the next big challenge probably is Friday, this big Netflix movie. It's, you know, many people will remember the interview. It's going to remind everyone of that. It's going to open up a new audience. And it's not just the associations with Epstein. You're going to see a lot of very realistic behind the scenes footage as well, showing how frankly out of touch Prince Andrew was. I'm empathetic towards Epstein's victims. And these are the sort of values that William and Charles have been trying to move away from. So I think that's going to blow up again. It's going to be a problem. You're probably going to see a lot of it on social media. And we're not going to hear much from this lot about it, I don't think, because he's not a working royal.",
