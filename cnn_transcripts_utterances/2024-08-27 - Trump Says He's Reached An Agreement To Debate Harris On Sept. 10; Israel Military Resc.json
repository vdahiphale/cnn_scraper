      "sentences": "Well, Brianna, what we are told is that this impasse between the Harris and Trump campaign appears to be over. And the big, remember, issue that both sides were having was over whether or not the mics would be muted. In that first debate that Donald Trump did on - with - excuse me, on CNN, they essentially had agreed to muting the mics while the other candidate was talking. And Donald Trump's team thought that that worked out well for him.Well, then we heard from Harris' team saying they didn't actually want those mics muted. So this led to a sort of impasse. They were not happy with it. Donald Trump's team said they wanted the CNN rules. Now they are saying that they have come to an agreement with Kamala Harris and that it's going to be broadcast on ABC rules. As we know, the rules will be the same as the last CNN debate. This is what Donald Trump is saying, which seemed to work out well for everyone except Joe Biden. And then he says, \"The debate will be, quote, 'stand up,'\" meaning they won't be seated. \"The candidates cannot bring notes or 'cheat sheets.'\" We've also been given assurance by ABC that this will be a fair and equitable debate and that neither side will be given the questions in advance. I did call a senior adviser after Donald Trump put this out to make sure about this issue on muting the mics. They said, yes, it does mean that the mics will be muted while the other candidate is speaking. So this would be a win for Donald Trump's team here. We have not gotten comment from the Harris side of things. But I did speak, as I said, to that senior adviser, who seemed very pleased with the fact that this debate was moving forward and with those same rules that we had had during our debate when it was Donald Trump and President Joe Biden earlier this year.",

Bush, Scott Jennings; former Republican congressman, Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania. He's also a senior adviser with Our Republican Legacy. And Jamal Simmons is back with us, the former comms director for Vice President Harris. Scott, to you first, because the campaign for Trump had been clear, they wanted the mics muted, like we saw in the initial debate with Biden. Then you heard Trump on the campaign trail saying it didn't really matter. I guess it did matter. And I wonder what your reaction is to this news, Trump saying that the mics will be muted.",

So he needs this debate. So from a Republican's perspective, it's good that it's happening.The CNN rules worked for him before. It seemed to be fine. And so, I - if this is the agreement and this is how they got it done, then good for Team Trump. I've never been all that interested in the minutia of the rules. I just wanted to make sure they had a debate because I think the American people deserve to see one. And so if we're going to have that on the 10th, that's a good thing.",

But I think Trump actually benefits from having the mics muted, because he's prone to outbursts. And with the mics off, you're less likely to hear them.It's one way to keep him somewhat controlled. So I think that's a victory for Trump that they've muted those mics. Probably better for him. I see why Harris wanted the mics on. She thought she could, you know, she could probably trigger Trump to say something pretty outrageous and pick it up on the mic. So that's a victory for the Trump team.",

It might just be true that the Harris campaign was trolling Trump, you know, looking for a way to get under his skin every day.And it does seem like if you pay attention to some of the social media that's out there, that they are really doing a very good job at just needling him every single day, playing a lot of offense on this campaign. And that's the kind of thing that Democrats want to see. And it's the kind of thing that I think ultimately hurts Trump. Look, Trump right now is zero for one when it comes to debates, right? Like he may think that he won that debate, but it might be that he actually lost the war because of that debate. Because after that debate, Joe Biden left - and Joe Biden left, he ended up with Kamala Harris. So he should be careful.",

Obviously, Jamal is making the argument that he, you know, Trump may have won the battle, but he lost the war.

I mean, it's not like he made a whole lot of great points and he got caught in a lot of lies and false statements. So he didn't do himself any damage. He looked reasonably controlled. But I wouldn't go so far as to say Trump won. I'd say that Biden just lost miserably because he demonstrated to the public that he did not seem to be fit and was incapable of serving another four years fully. I think that was the real issue, so I wouldn't go so far as to say Trump won.",

They do an interview because they want to move forward some part of the campaign agenda, right? They've got something to advance. And so the question is, what voters are they trying to talk to and what outlet are those voters paying attention to.So what you may see is maybe there's a mix, maybe there's local news, maybe there's national news, maybe there's radio and print mixed into this. So we don't exactly know how it is they're going to come up with this because they haven't told us yet. But I got to say, when you're doing this and you're thinking about this, you're not just thinking about doing an interview for interview's sake. You're doing it because you're trying to accomplish a strategic purpose. And the campaign just hasn't had a reason, a purpose to do an interview to this point. I would argue it's time for them to do something, because the American public needs to hear from the candidate on some of these issues. And I think we're going to see that based on what Vice President Harris said, which is that they're going to do something by the end of the month.",

They cannot figure out how to, where to, when to and who to do an interview with. One simple decision. We want to put her in charge of the country and make all kinds of complex decisions, they can't even decide when and how to do an interview. And so that concerns me.If I were counseling them, I would say, pick somebody and go in and be prepared to face the discrepancies in your record. You've got all these anonymous press statements now saying you don't support any of the stuff you used to support. You're going to have to tackle it head on. That's number one. Number two, she's going to have to say Joe Biden made some mistakes. I mean, she can't run on Biden's record. She can't run on his plan. She's going to have to show up and say he did this, this and this. I disagreed, but he's number one. I'm number two. I've learned from the experience. If she's not willing to do that, she's going to wear Biden. It's going to make it hard to win, because if she isn't willing to separate on a specific policy issue or two or a decision, Trump's going to have her for the rest of the fall basically as a continuation of the Biden agenda.

She's certainly a stronger candidate than Joe Biden, but Biden has spent a lot of time in the Commonwealth.Harris right now, I still think is - you know, she's in the game. She can win it. She'll need to run up numbers in the Philadelphia media market, particularly the collar counties of Philadelphia and the suburbs of Harrisburg and Pittsburgh, so she really need to do well in those areas as well. But right now, it's still a game on. I think it's too close to call. But right now, I think Trump maybe has a slight advantage going into this, but she can easily make up ground.

The now-discussed Woodside summit is where the foreign minister first proposed to Jake Sullivan to make a return visit to Beijing, a reciprocal visit, as it's been discussed. The two meet every six months or so to make sure those lines of communication are open and to provide a forum of sorts for the two global superpowers to bring discussions to the table on other thornier issues, too, like economic policy, with new tariffs set to go into place in the coming weeks, as well as rising tensions in the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait. But, Boris, there is also one other looming item on the to-do list, and that is the potential for another bilateral meeting this fall between President Biden and President Xi. There are two multilateral summits happening in South America in November, but a U.S. official tells me that any discussions to have the two leaders meeting again before the end of Biden's term are still in very early stages, with the possibility that one doesn't materialize still very real.
