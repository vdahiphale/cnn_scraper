And Shimon, if you hear any more about new video that they do see, it seems to be kind of coming in by the moment here, with these developments, please keep us updated.Shimon Prokupecz, thank you for that. My other sources on the manhunt tonight are: CNN's Chief Law Enforcement and Intelligence Analyst, John Miller. And also, retired New York City Police Captain, John Monaghan, who is also here. It's great to have you both here, two experts, in this. And John, you've been doing reporting on this. I think the one -- the part that I'm the most struck by is what you reported on the clearest picture yet that we have of this person, where his mask is pulled down, he's smiling in the image. I was kind of wondering when New York -- the New York Police Department released this today, why he was smiling. And you're hearing that it was because he was flirting. How did the police know that? JOHN MILLER, CNN CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp; INTELLIGENCE ANALYST: Well, they went to the hostel, and they went through the dates. When did he check in? When did he check out? When did he check back in and check out again? And they want to interview the people who interacted with him. And a woman who works as a desk clerk there said, Oh, he was checking in, I got the driver's license. There's a question here as whether she looked at the picture on the driver's license, and saw a guy with a hood and a mask and said, Do you really look like this, and lower the mask. But she said, we were flirting back and forth, and I said, Let me see what you look like, lower the mask. And he lowered the mask, and gave this big smile. That moment where he had to weigh, Do I act suspicious enough to leave my hood up indoors and keep the mask on and send alert signals that there's something wrong with me that I won't show my face? Or, did he just engage in that moment? Whatever it was that made him pull the mask down, their flirtatious moment, has resulted in what is the single most important clue so far that could lead to him being identified.",
