Security Council as Israel expands its assault on Hamas.On the ground in Gaza, Israeli military officials say there are now more troops there on the ground than there were just 24 hours ago. The troops pushing deeper into Gaza as they hunt for Hamas and what's believed to be the more than 200 hundred hostages that are in that underground tunnel system complex. And from the sky, a steady drumbeat of new strikes and explosions this morning have been seen and heard. This is amid urgent calls for a pause in the bombings so desperately needed food, water, fuel and medical supplies can get into Gaza. Right now, an Egyptian official says 75 aid trucks are waiting to cross into Gaza from the Rafah border in Egypt. The International Red Cross is now calling the humanitarian crisis in Gaza a catastrophic failing. We begin with the ground incursion and what is happening now where there are some, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry, more than 8,000 people who have been killed in this past three weeks as Israel has declared war on Hamas. CNN's Jeremy Diamond is in Sderot, just about a mile from the Gaza border. You've been there for quite a few hours now. What are you saying at this hour?",

We can hear machine gun fire. We've heard it over the last several hours. And what we've also been able to see, thanks to our photojournalist,Matthias Somm, is images of destruction inside the northeastern most city of Gaza, Beit Hanoun, which is right behind me over my shoulder. And what you can see is the destruction, destroyed buildings. And this is also the area where we've watched tanks go by, and, again, fighting ongoing between Israeli forces and Hamas militants. We've seen plumes of smoke emerge as we hear the outgoing artillery and then hitting inside of Gaza. We have learned today that the Israeli forces have struck over 600 targets in recent days, including underground tunnels and command centers that Hamas maintains below the Gaza Strip. We are also learning more about where these Israeli forces are operating, as you can hear, some more outgoing there just to the side of me now and a plume of smoke actually emerging off-camera here that appears to be perhaps even in Northern Israel, actually. We'll get back to you on that. But what we have seen is Israeli forces operating not only in the northern most part of Gaza, but also further south, near Gaza City, one of the main roads there. We have this video of an Israeli tank appearing to operate on one of these main roads near Gaza City and actually firing on a passenger vehicle. Now, we do not know who was inside that passenger vehicle, but it does tell us that Israeli forces are certainly operating further south than just the northern most part of Gaza where they made their initial approach.

It's not clear to me right now if that is in Northern Israel, just north of the Gaza Strip, or if it is inside of Gaza. But we are seeing -- let me see if our photojournalist, Matthias Somm, can turn the camera towards the smoke that is this way, maybe you can get a sense. But, again, we have been seeing kind of throughout the day, that definitely is outgoing fire, outgoing artillery fire that we are hearing. But -- and, again, these are the sights and sounds of war that have been happening over the last several days and are going to continue to happen. The IDF has made very, very clear that they are going to continue to expand these ground operations and continue to add more troops as they carry out this ground offensive in Gaza.",

You're talking about distances there that are very small. That's just to give you a sense of what Jeremy is literally seeing and hearing right now.Now, when we talk about aid, the White House says that President Biden has pressed the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to immediately scale up the flow of humanitarian aid that's been coming into Gaza down here through the Rafah crossing. He wants that aid in much greater quantities and much more quickly. Priscilla Alvarez at the White House. Priscilla, what has the president specifically been saying to the Israeli prime minister?",

This was the first phone call over the weekend since Israel expanded its ground operation in Gaza, and part of the focus was getting more aid to Gaza. Of course, this comes at a time where a dire humanitarian crisis in the region is growing and as aid agencies say that there is not enough food, water and medicine, all of that in short supply.And so in this call, the president making clear to the prime minister that they need to get that humanitarian aid into Gaza. According to a readout from the White House, it said the following. The president, quote, underscored the need to immediately and significantly increase the flow of humanitarian assistance to meet the needs of civilians in Gaza. Of course, this is an extension of what U .S. officials have been pressing Israel to do. And according to a top Israeli official, there are expected to be as many as 100 trucks that enter Gaza. Now, in addition to this, over the weekend, we learned that connectivity, internet connectivity was restored in Gaza. That was something else that the U.S. was pressing for. So, this remains a priority for this administration. But in addition to that, something that U.S. officials are keenly watching is that this conflict not widen, not spread any further, and especially sending a message of deterrence to Iran. Take a listen to what National Security Council Spokesman John Kirby had to say about that on CNN This Morning. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It's both prepared to fight Israel to the last Palestinian.

What you see now with the U.N., I think, is the continued erosion of Israel's international legitimacy and a major push, I think, to embarrass the United States, which has stood steadfastly by the Israelis. In coming days, though, if the humanitarian issue does not improve and Palestinian civilians continue to die as a consequence of Israel's efforts to strike Hamas positions, I think the U.S.-Israeli relationship, there may be an increasing daylight between the two as the Biden administration seeks to press Israel on both of those issues, even while they provide extraordinary support in Israel's war against Hamas.",

And so these questions of how do you even define what an insurrectionist is, and even if you assume that someone's an insurrectionist, how do you hold that person accountable is simply not in the Constitution.And the only parties -- like everybody might have opinions on this and, frankly, everybody has opinions on Donald Trump, but the only person entity that can really sort this out is are the courts, and most likely, as Marshall had said a moment ago, the Supreme Court.

That would require Congress to pass a law barring someone from running for office. Does it have to happen in every single state? And so, for instance, if Nevada or Ohio or any other state wishes to go through the same calculus, do they have to do it too? And these are all questions that sort of need to be figured out. And also, you know, what does it mean to support insurrectionist? Merely the fact that other folks have done it or have engaged in acts of insurrection, doesn't necessarily tie a candidate for office to that. So, it's very, very hard, John.",
