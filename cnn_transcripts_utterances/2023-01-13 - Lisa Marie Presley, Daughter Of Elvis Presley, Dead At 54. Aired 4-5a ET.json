That has been the warning we've heard from Ukrainian military officials over the last few weeks.

Early Thursday morning, CNN learned that EMTs responded to Lisa Marie's home in Calabasas, California for a possible cardiac arrest. Now this came just two days after Lisa Marie attended the Golden Globes at the Beverly Hilton in Los Angeles alongside her mother Priscilla to support Austin Butler who portrayed her father in Baz Luhrmann film Elvis. He actually won a Golden Globe Award that evening. We saw cameras pan over to Lisa Marie and her mother in the audience. At one point it looked like she was wiping away tears. When Elvis died in August 1977, Lisa Marie was just nine-years-old and she is the only heir to his estate. Lisa Marie went on to have several children, one of which his name was Benjamin, he died by suicide in 2020. And Lisa has been open about the grief that she experienced in the wake of her son's death.
