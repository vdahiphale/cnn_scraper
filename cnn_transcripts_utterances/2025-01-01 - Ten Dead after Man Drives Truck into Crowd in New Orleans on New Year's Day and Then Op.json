In addition to that, I'm asking the public to stay clear of eight blocks around Bourbon Street, stay clear from Bourbon Street, eight blocks around. Very active, and again, a unified command is in place right now. I'm going to ask Chief Kirkpatrick to give you an update. You're then going to hear from our agent in charge relative to the FBI.

That is my ask. Once again, stay away from Bourbon Street, Canal Street all the way to St. Ann until we can figure out what is going on. Our goal is to provide you additional information at the 11:00 a.m. press conference. Thank you so much. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But the improvised explosive devices that they have found, they have found them, but they probably, as we speak, are looking to see if they were viable. But here's the one question that was not answered. What about this perpetrator? Do they have him in custody? Is he deceased? He shot two police officers. They had a right to shoot back. We don't know what happened there. So that is where we're sort of wondering, because they're going to want to question him. They're going to want to see exactly what that mindset was from him, if possible.",

      "sentences": "Sure. Well, I think we also have to put on that list of things that we got from the press conference. A little bit of confusion in messaging from our local officials, which is not -- that that often happens. They are trying to get their hands around this thing as quickly as they can. But the mayor very clearly said at the beginning of the press conference that this had been a terrorist attack. The police chief, although I don't believe she used the word \"terrorist,\" she referred to it repeatedly as an intentional act, that he drove around the barricades. And then, of course, the FBI assistant special agent in charge said, started off her comments by saying this is not a terrorist event. And then she really only referred to the to the IDEs that they were investigating.So a lot going on there. And it's not I think, strange to see that they're not maybe perfectly connected on how they're going to message this and present it to the public at this early hour. Nevertheless, the FBI investigates many things for the purpose of determining whether or not they are terrorist acts. So the fact that the FBI is involved doesn't mean conclusively they've determined, yes, this is terrorism. They could still be in the phase of trying to make that determination for themselves. Terrorist investigation is a national security investigation, and it is done for the purpose of mitigating a potential threat to national security. You don't wait until the terrorism label has been applied before you get out the agents and the resources and the teams to do this work. So I think it's entirely predictable and responsible that the FBI is now at the front of this very large law enforcement team, and that's to make that determination about potential national security threats. They want to know if this was an intentional attack, why did it happen? And most importantly, do they need to be concerned about another one? Are there other people out there who might have helped this attacker, trained this person, supported them with resources or money or instruments that they needed for this attack? And are there potentially other attackers out there they need to be prepared for? So it also brings the entirety of the FBI's intelligence collection apparatus to the table. And that's going to really inform the direction that the investigators go and enables them to bring in, bring other partners to that effort as well.",

      "sentences": "Well, let's take that in a couple layers here. Not only do you have the Sugar Bowl, but you also have the Super Bowl that's coming up in less than a month pretty much that's going to happen in that same city.When you talk about the layers of security, as someone who's covered the Sugar Bowl before, they really do a good job of sort of blocking off Bourbon Street as someone who's been there at midnight. But the idea, and something that Julia brought up there is did they move some barricades beforehand? We saw in New York, we've seen in cities like Atlanta and Chicago, they use the heavy sanitation trash trucks to sort of block off roads. And that's something that we haven't seen in this location. One thing we do know, and one of the reasons why they might be able to talk about that motivation and how that truck was moving through the crowd, is there are a lot of video cameras that are up and down Bourbon Street. So, officers probably had the opportunity to watch back the incident almost in real time to see exactly what happened. And that would lead me to the next question is, do they have a beat on the suspect? Because obviously, if you have a white F-150 that fired shots, the tracking cameras that are in that area should be able to flag that and be able to follow a license plate. So I'm hoping to hear from law enforcement in the near future about how they were able to track that vehicle, whether the suspect is still in it, or did he flee. You would also believe that if two officers were fired on, did they return fire at some point? But when you look at those numbers and you see the fact that they used that clear language that he was trying to intentionally hit people who were in that area, you know, just how dangerous that would be with a truck of that size. But one of the things that stood out to me, is all I saw was those metal barricades in that area. The drawdown aspect of it, we know that usually they surge people in around that midnight area. New Orleans does a really good job of having a mounted patrol as well. So you just have to wonder what was the number of officers that were down there at the time of this at 3:00? And then moving from that point, how many video surveillance cameras are in the area from local hotels, from local businesses? Did anybody who was involved in this who was on the street, also get video that could help investigators? Those are all the big questions. And of course, hopefully we'll get more of that when it comes to around 11:00.",

And then sure enough, as you heard from the law enforcement officials there, there absolutely was as the suspect, according to these officials, shot two police officers. I want to bring into the conversation CNN's Tom Foreman, who, as I understand you have a long history and relationship with New Orleans. And, Tom, can you -- I've been to Bourbon Street. I've been to New Orleans. I imagine a lot of our viewers potentially have. But for those who haven't, you know, we're looking at these images. These are tiny areas here and the thought of a pickup truck plowing through Bourbon Street is pretty terrifying.",
