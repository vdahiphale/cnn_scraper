You know, Evan -- Evan said if he's Grievance Donald Trump, that's problems for the Trump campaign. Saturday night in Philadelphia, he was kind of on message about working for you, fighting for you, right? And Joe Biden has to appear dynamic. He has to appear vigorous. He has to be combative. I think if Joe Biden comes out and is combative, people will think, whoa, who's this guy, right? I mean, that's what the Biden campaign wants to see. The Trump campaign will just see the opposite.

They -- there's a new left-leaning government there in the last couple of years that viewed his case as something that they wanted to champion. You -- you saw, for instance, in October, Anthony Albanese, the prime minister, bring it up personally with -- with President Biden. We're told that -- you know, Kylie Atwood is told that, you know, pretty much over the last couple of years, every time Australian diplomats met with the U.S., they would bring up the case of Julian Assange. And so what we see, like in April, we see that, you know, the Australian officials write to Attorney General Merrick Garland, saying we think that there's a deal possible. They also raised the possibility of a felony plea that would bring this down and resolve this. Now, you know, some of this, I think, for Justice Department officials, they also were losing in court in England, where Assange has been holed up. He's been fighting extradition. And in May, they also lost another effort to try to get him extradited, lengthening this fight. So I think what -- what ended up happening is you saw I think they came to terms with the idea that, you know, he's already served five years, which is probably about the maximum that he would probably have gotten if he had gotten convicted on one of these counts. And they -- I think both sides decided that it was time. In the case of Assange, he was insisting on a misdemeanor.",

Very much the same case. And they decided that there was too much of a risk of the precedent, right? And the issue was, you know, if Wikileaks is -- is cooperating and partnering with U.S. news organizations to publish some of these stolen documents, you know, why are you going after Assange and not after \"The New York Times\" editor, for instance? And so they were uncomfortable with it in their -- everything changed after the hack of the DNC documents. And Hillary Clinton targeted by Russian intelligence and passed to Wikileaks. That began changing the view of what was happening. And in the end, what I think the government believes is that -- is Julian Assange was not a journalist. He was directing and actually encouraging people to steal stuff, which is something that -- a line that we don't cross when we're doing our work. And so they view Julian Assange as in a totally different -- in a totally different way than, I think, certainly Barry Pollack, his lawyer, described him just now. But you -- I mean, you're going to hear from Julian Assange today, and he is going to embrace this idea that I'm a journalist, and I was prosecuted for being a journalist.
