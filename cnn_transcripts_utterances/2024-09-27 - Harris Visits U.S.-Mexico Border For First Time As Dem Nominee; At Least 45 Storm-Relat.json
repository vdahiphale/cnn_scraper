I was attorney general of a border state for two terms.I saw the violence and chaos that transnational criminal organizations cause, and the heartbreak and loss from the spread of their illicit drugs. I walked through tunnels that traffickers used to smuggle contraband into the United States. I've seen tunnels with walls as smooth as the walls of your living room. Complete with lighting and air conditioning, making very clear that it is about an enterprise that is making a whole lot of money in the trafficking of guns, drugs, and human beings. And my knowledge on how they work comes from the fact that I have prosecuted transnational criminal organizations who traffic in guns, drugs, and human beings. My team and I broke up a heroin trafficking ring in the Bay Area with ties to Mexican cartels. We took down a gang working with the Sinaloa cartel to traffic methamphetamine into the United States. We seized millions of dollars worth of cocaine from the Guadalajara cartel, and broke up a drug trafficking operation, including pill mills and so-called recovery centers that were pushing opioids with deadly results. As attorney general of California, it was 10 years ago that I brought a bipartisan group of American attorneys general and led that group to travel to Mexico City, to meet with Mexican attorneys general to address this issue. And in particular, to increase intelligence sharing on gang activity. All of which allowed us to prosecute more human traffickers. And I started as attorney general, the first comprehensive report in the state of California analyzing transnational criminal organizations and the threats they pose to public safety and to the economy. So, stopping transnational criminal organizations and strengthening our border is not new to me, and it is a longstanding priority of mine.

And as far as we know at this point, according to the Ministry of Health, six people killed, 91 injured, but it was six buildings flattened in that strike, and we assume that the death toll will rise as they can recover bodies from underneath. But what we've seen, Anderson, in the last three and a half hours is well over a dozen strikes. What you can see in that other pictures we're putting out from here are some of the fires left from those strikes. Now, what's interesting is that the Arabic spokesman for the Israeli military has been putting out tweets with specific locations, warning people to leave that specific building and get away as much as 500 meters. But we noticed, for instance, one of those warnings came out at the top of this hour, and 12 minutes later, there were airstrikes on an area, Bourj el-Barajneh, which is a Palestinian refugee camp in a wider area, which is one of the most densely populated parts of Beirut, home to Palestinian refugees, Syrian migrant workers, and workers from South Asia and Africa, probably the most deprived people in this country who don't have the means to evacuate even if they wanted to. But what we've seen is that thousands, perhaps tens of thousands of people, have streamed out of the southern suburbs of Beirut, basically camping out on the sidewalks in other parts of town, desperate to get away from this series of Israeli airstrikes that has rocked Beirut for the last three and a half hours.

Effectively, the Israeli government made a decision that they believe it is now necessary to go and strike Hezbollah even harder in order to try and get Hezbollah to stop firing rockets into northern Israel. And tonight certainly marked the most significant escalation that we have seen over the course of the last week and a half.And it appears to have been born out of a target of opportunity. We saw the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, approving that strike while he was in New York attending the United Nations General Assembly. The Israeli military then came out, talked about hitting this central headquarters of Hezbollah underground. I then confirmed with an Israeli source that Hassan Nasrallah was indeed the target. But so far, we don't know that this strategy of de- escalation through escalation, as Israeli officials have called it, is showing any signs of working. So far, Hezbollah has shown that it is also willing to escalate on its side as well, firing deeper into Israel over the course of the last week. Anderson.",

And of course, you know, if you're seeing pictures of Prime Minister Netanyahu approving a strike, what the military would call a time-sensitive targeting, it means that they have very good intelligence on a direct location of where Nasrallah is. Over the last week, after the beeper walkie-talkie chaos that occurred within Hezbollah, I think we've seen a lot of turmoil in that terrorist organization. They've been attempting to find other ways to communicate. And when they do that, they give up positions of some of their key targets. And what we've seen over the last couple of days is multiple leaders of the Hezbollah organizations, from area commanders to missile strike commanders to rocket commanders to the chief of Hezbollah, becoming targets because they are in a bit of turmoil. Communication opens up the targeting and the intelligence collection by the Israeli Defense Forces, and that's what's happening. [21:00:11] I'd add to the point that on October 8th, the day after the October 7th attacks by Hamas, Hezbollah started firing rockets. There had been over 3,000 rockets fired into northern Israel. And I think what Israel has been attempting to do is find intelligence to strike the leaders of Hezbollah during that entire period of time. That's what I would do as a commander, and I think that's what the Israeli Defense Forces is doing as well.",
