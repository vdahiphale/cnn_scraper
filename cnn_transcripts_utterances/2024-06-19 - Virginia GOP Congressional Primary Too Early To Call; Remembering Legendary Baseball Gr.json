He's leader of the House Freedom Caucus, which is one of the hard groups in the House GOP. They have gone after their leadership. In fact, Good was one of eight Republicans to vote to oust Kevin McCarthy and lead to this unprecedented situation that we saw last fall. OK, that was one area which has generated a lot of criticism from his own conference and his own party. But he also endorsed Ron DeSantis in the Republican primary, presidential primary. And then something Donald Trump has not forgotten either. They've -- the fact that he endorsed Ron DeSantis. But you make a good point because there was this is the most its expensive house primary in the country right now and Good, despite Donald Trump saying he stabbed me in the back, he stabbed me in the back, repeatedly going after him, Good is very close. We'll see. If there's a recount, we'll see if something changes. Maybe it won't but it shows you the power of incumbency at the end of the day as well.",

It says that border protection is important, but that the spouses of U.S. citizens and their children that have been here for over ten years also deserve to work. SEN.

So, just incredible some of the scope of this. Fires also raging in parts of California overnight. Those again continuing, watching two, one outside of Los Angeles, and then one in northern California as well. Plus, this heat dome. We've got this area of high pressure that continues to slide east.

And this is including places well into New England like places in Maine. Yesterday, we broke so many records, 95 degrees, that record, daily high temperature in Hartford, Connecticut. A couple of more records fell in parts of a Scranton, Pennsylvania, and Ohio, as well. As we go through the day today, we're going to be watching Caribou closely. They are forecast it 96 degrees, which would be their hottest this temperature ever, period, incredible. We'll have temperatures both on the daytime highs and overnight lows, plenty of records, falling 150 or more in the next couple of days.
