Student protesters smashing windows after storming a historic academic building at Columbia University. They have now barricaded themselves inside Hamilton Hall. On the outside, a human chain. Witnesses say over 200 protestors holding the line, standing guard outside. As this has been unfolding, we also have this live video from the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill. It looks like they're kind of heading out of what was a very active scene. Protesters there clashing with police just moments ago. Several people arrested. Our panel is back. And Elliot Williams also joins us. Let's pick up the conversation that we were having. David Urban, you had been making - you'd been kind of talking about what this means for students, for the country. And I know, Karen, you were about to respond to what he had to say.",

Why is the - you know, what's happening in Gaza? What is the dynamic between the Palestinians and the Israelis? And how do we have, you know, a respectful debate? And, unfortunately - and I'll just say, when - and when I was in high school it was about, you know, apartheid. And on Berkeley campus, on UC Berkeley, it was pretty peaceful. And there was actually sort of an internal policing of, you're getting away from our message about anti-apartheid and a, you know, a feeling of, you know, the violence would take away from that.And I think David made a great point that we may not focus on the little boy who they're trying to talk about here and instead -",

And crimes can be in the form of threats or assaults or anything else.The problem is that, as we were talking about yesterday on the program as well, there's this muddy line between what counts as speech and debate and the marketplace of ideas and what counts as assault and threats.

A lot of the times carelessly. You know, a lot of journalists, a lot of press people, a lot of photographers were awfully close. And I was really afraid that they were going to seriously injure someone with something that heavy.But in terms of Hamilton Hall, this is a very significant piece of infrastructure at Columbia. This is where the famous 1968 student protests over the Vietnam War took place. Then, student protesters took over Hamilton Hall. They occupied it for days on end. They locked the dean in his office. And, actually, this is still where the dean of Columbia college has his office today. So, this is a very significant building. It's also where the center for the core curriculum is. And that's the sort of academic cornerstone of the Columbia college experience. So, there's a reason why they chose this building to do it. And make no mistake, that they are trying to continue the student activism of the 1960s and the 1980s. And they see it as, you know, one in the same.",

Now they're - you know, a lot of students have mixed feelings about this. A lot of people feel that we shouldn't be negotiating with people who violate university rules.But the fact of the matter is, the university did, and then they realized that the demands of these protesters are just completely unreasonable. Their most important demand is divestment completely from Israel, which means, you know, companies like Google, companies like Amazon that do business in Israel, they want all of that divested. And, you know, Columbia can't actually do that because then they would lose all of their contracts and all of their financial aid from the New York state government under - under an executive order. So, you know, we're in this situation where they have impossible demands. The university has realized that. And so they said, OK, we've tried negotiation. That doesn't work.

We are working on trying to get more and some pictures on that for you.But we also want to go to this because at Columbia the university is now facing a lawsuit over how they've handled these pro-Palestinian demonstrations on campus. An anonymous Jewish students filed the suit yesterday alleging that the university is failing to provide a safe learning environment for students. The lawsuit is seeking class action status. And it takes particular issue with the decision by Columbia to go to a hybrid learning model last week amid unrest on campus. The suit states this, quote, \"the segregation of Jewish students is a dangerous development that can quickly escalate into more severe acts of violence and discrimination.\" Columbia declined to comment.
