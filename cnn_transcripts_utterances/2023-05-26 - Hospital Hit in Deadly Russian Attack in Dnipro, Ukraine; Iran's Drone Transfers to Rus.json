Men opening the exit door before the plane landed. We'll have a live report. And also there's a new antibiotics discovered using artificial intelligence. And it may defeat a dangerous super bug. At least two people are dead, another 30 wounded after a Russian attack hit a medical site in the Ukrainian city of Dnipro. A hospital was among the sites damaged. The mayor says it's a miracle that doctors were changing shifts when that attack happened. It means that fewer people were working at the time of the strike. Drone and missile strikes were also reported in the Kyiv and Kharkiv regions overnight. And the Russians are reporting attacks inside Russia's Belgorod region near the Ukrainian-Russian border. Further away an explosion has been reported in the Russian city of Krasnodar. Social media video appears to show a drone flying above the city. Moments later, there is some kind of blast. A short time ago, CNN's Sam Kiley filed this report from Eastern Ukraine on the Dnipro attacks. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): These calm waters are home to a secret Russia doesn't want you to know. Experts say Iran is quietly sending weapons on ships like this one across the Caspian Sea to replenish arms for Moscow's war on Ukraine. Concealing movement at sea is considered nefarious and potentially a violation of international law. But in the Caspian Sea, there is a growing number of gaps in vessels tracking data known as AIS, with a more than 50 percent increase in ships hiding their movement between August and September of 2022, according to maritime trafficking data. Most of the vessels going dark are Iranian or Russian flagged tankers. The timing is suspicious, too. This practice picking up last summer just as White House officials revealed that Russia had purchased hundreds of drones from Iran. So why would these ships want to hide their movements? Maritime security analyst Martin Kelly tells us it is likely because of what these vessels are carrying.",

Well, in Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan is in the fight of his political life as the country's presidential election heads to a runoff for the first time ever. President Erdogan, who has ruled the country for two decades, faces main opposition from candidate Kemal Kilicdaroglu on Sunday. Neither candidate reached the 50 percent threshold needed to win outright in the general election on May 14th, which of course forced this runoff. Sunday's election comes amid a serious economic crisis in Turkey in what analysts say is democratic corrosion on Mr. Erdogan's government. CNN's Nada Bashir is in Istanbul and joins us now live.

And of course if, indeed, we do see a win for President Erdogan, as many people are anticipating given the first round results, there will be some serious questions. He is up against a number of serious challenges. Not least the economy. There has been fierce criticism of his unorthodox monetary policies.

Now you can see from the footage exactly what the response was. People being buffeted by strong gusts of winds. You can see some of the passengers holding on tight to the armrests. It must have been a terrifying experience. Now we did hear from one of the passengers. She had said that it appeared as though the man might have been trying to get off the plane. She said she heard the flight attendant shout help, help, and then about 10 passengers did help and pull him back in. Now as the plane landed, that individual was arrested by police. They have said that he has confessed, that he did open the door but has not given a reason at this point as to why he's done it. In fact, we did hear from one policeman involved in the matter and he said that it was very difficult to talk to him. He was not in a good state mentally. And he was unable to even stay upright.

Police say the alleged gunman is the son of a local government official. He ended up barricading himself in his father's home and was later taken into custody. According to NHK, Japan's public broadcaster, the man was licensed since 2015 to possess four hunting rifles, including shotguns and air guns. The big lingering question that remains is motive, an issue that was addressed by an area police chief.

AI makes that process much faster, so they were able to try like hundreds of millions of different, you know, chemicals to see what would work the best or sort of formulations, I should say, to see what would work the best. And what they did was they put this infection of this bacteria on a mouse's skin. They tried this and it worked. And it didn't hurt the good bacteria. So let's take a look at this bacteria and talk a little bit about what it is and what it does. So it's called Acinetobacter baumannii, and it is bad. It kills, you know, in the United States alone hundreds of people a year. It is antibiotic resistant or some strains of it can become antibiotic resistant. It's causes infections in the blood. It causes infections in urinary track. It causes pneumonia. And it's mostly found in hospitals. So we're talking people who are in the ICU. Other places they are the most vulnerable and they have such a hard time fighting this bacteria. And this is a really terrible part, it clings to surfaces. So it can be really hard to clean.

We don't know that it's going to work well in people. They have to figure that out. That takes years in and of itself.

You need to have 157-mile-per-hour winds to be a category five. So we call this a buzzsaw hurricane or typhoon just because of the nature, the shape, and particularly looking like a buzzsaw. The good news, the silver lining here, it's moved away from Guam. It's got a lot of ocean to traverse. And we do believe that it will continue to weaken as it approaches Southeast Asia. We're talking about the Philippines, there's Taiwan. That's not until middle -- to early to middle parts of next working week. However, this is going to help influence some of the weather patterns across Luzon, for instance, which could be impacted by heavy rainfall. You can see all the ocean water ahead. We do have above average temperatures for the first half of its travels, but then as it reaches the extreme Western Pacific, I think we're going to get into some cooler water. We'll get some shear in the upper levels of the atmosphere, that will help kind of disorganized the storm, and help weaken it, although it will still be a formidable typhoon on its approach. You can see the system as it makes its way towards Luzon and eventually into Taiwan. You can see the timeline at the top portion of the TV monitor here. And look how it influences the monsoon rains across Luzon. This could help impact some localized flooding.

Turkish voters head to the poll Sunday for the country's first-ever presidential runoff election. Neither President Recep Tayyip Erdogan nor his challenger, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, reached the 50 percent threshold needed to win outright in the general election which forced the runoff. Passengers aboard an Asiana flight were in for a scare when their cabin door opened above South Korea sending in gushes of air. Upon landing safely, police say they've arrested a man in his 30s who appeared to have opened the door. About a dozen passengers suffered minor injuries from hyperventilation, at least nine were sent to a hospital. Well, sources say White House officials and Republican negotiators are inching closer to an agreement to raise the debt ceiling. If that doesn't happen come Thursday, the U.S. Treasury secretary said it's highly likely that there won't be enough money to pay all the government bills.

And really these next 24 to 48 hours are a critical time period, especially when you take a look at the legislative calendar and how long it would take to move something through Capitol Hill. Now there have been some signs that these talks have been progressing, and that they are moving closer to an agreement. Sources say that some of the contours that they are discussing is raising the debt ceiling for two years and pairing that with spending caps that would also continue for that same length of time. Now these spending caps would not apply to defense or veterans programs, but sources still caution that there are still work to do in determining what those spending levels will look like. There are also other sticking points. One of the major ones being the work requirements that Republicans want to see for some social safety net programs. So these are all things that negotiators are talking about in these final days of negotiations. Now the president has said that he does thinks that they can get to an agreement, but it really remains unclear when they will be able to do so. Now there have been some Democrats, progressives, who have been pushing the president to use the 14th Amendment to raise the debt ceiling on his own. But the White House and the president have insisted that there are no backup options here. This morning, the deputy Treasury secretary Wally Adeyemo was on CNN, and he said that that 14th Amendment is not an option. So what the White House has been urging is that Congress needs to act in this moment. One of the other issues that they are facing is that they've started to hear a lot of consternation from both Republicans and Democrats who are frustrated with what they are learning about this deal. Each side feeling that their parties have given too much. So that would be a key challenge in trying to ensure that they have enough votes to get this passed up on Capitol Hill.

He's probably exhausted. Hasn't even been to California between New York and Texas. So he's not doing quite well. We'll hear from him about after his first round, about how he's feeling right now, but whether or not he does well this weekend, it really doesn't matter because he captured, you know, the hearts of so many people with what he did last week. And no matter what, they can make a movie about his story and what he's already accomplished.",
