The Storm Prediction Center says April to June is the most active time for tornadoes in the U.S. and May is often the busiest month. In Brazil, more rain is expected today through Sunday. Torrential downpours have already caused catastrophic flooding in the southern part of the country, affecting more than one million people. Tens of thousands of people have been rescued. More than 100 have been killed. McKenna Ewen has more on the difficult times in Brazil. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
