      "sentences": "Well, Wolf, this report contains a lot of harsh criticism for the FBI, especially former FBI leadership that oversaw the Trump-Russia investigation. In the end, John Durham spent four years in this investigation.This is a 300-page report. And he concludes that while the FBI had reason to launch perhaps an assessment or a preliminary investigation, much lower-level investigations, he believes that there was a lot of exculpatory evidence that the FBI was ignoring and that they should not have launched, essentially, a full-blown investigation. I'll read you just a part of what he concludes as part of this report. He says that the FBI discounted or willfully ignored material information that did not support the narrative of a collusive relationship between Trump and Russia. He also says that an objective honest assessment should have caused the FBI to question that not only that a predication for this investigation called for Crossfire Hurricane but also to reflect on whether the FBI was being manipulated for political purposes. The, of course, reference there is the fact that, according to Durham, there was this information that indicated, at least from Russian sources, that perhaps the Clinton campaign was trying to politically tie Trump to Russia, something that he says the FBI didn't really take a hard look at, Wolf.",

That is not the case, Wolf. He did prosecute three people, two of them were acquitted. One of them pleaded. So, that happened sometime ago. As a result of this investigation, though, Durham does not conclude, he says he didn't find anything that amounted to a provable criminal offense.Of course, we know that the former president, Wolf, is still going to be claiming victory here. I'll read you just a part of what he has now posted on his social media platform. He says, wow, after extensive research, Special Counsel John Durham concludes that the FBI never should have launched a Trump-Russia probe. In other words, the American public was scammed. Of course, we're going to hear a lot more of that from the former president. The bottom line, though, Wolf, is that there were a lot of problems here in this investigation. One of the things that John Durham finds, however, is that he doesn't think that the FBI needs to make any new changes. A lot of these changes, he believes, were made already, and he says that it's simply a case of the FBI following the rules that are already in place. Wolf?",

This is a fancy way of saying, listen, there was sufficient reason to actually do an investigation and it was not biased in its inception.Now, this new report is saying hold on a second, there were plenty of cues, red flags out there to say you do not have things corroborated, and perhaps you're engaged in a kind of confirmation bias. You're essentially saying, listen, I want this to be true, therefore, I will pursue with that particular vigor, and I will not treat others in the same way. That's what he's saying in terms of a lapse of judgment, not following the protocol, not following the objective analytics you're supposed to do so. But, again, the idea that they don't actually have any rules to change is perhaps the most intriguing about this. No charges. There were three cases brought, really two ended in acquittal, one a guilty plea. So, the idea of the search for the deep state and the confirmation about that did not pan out. But it does show you that the actual rules that are supposed to be in place ought to be followed. You cannot have people leading an investigation who are simply trying to confirm what they want to be true. The facts have to lead and the evidence must follow. Politics has to be set aside. BLITZER:  Elliot Williams is with us as well. What do you make, Elliot, of Durham's conclusion that there was, in his words, a noticeable departure from how the FBI handled other similar cases?",

It's quite significant any time law enforcement is alleged to have sort of -- sort of taken different standards in how they approached one investigation versus another or pursue their investigations just to confirm biases that individuals might have had and so on.But to pick up the broader point, which underlies all of this, there was not -- Durham did not find sort of the kinds of systemic abuses that many people came into this investigation hoping to find. The former president came out of the gate making an argument that this was going to be the investigation of the century and so on. Just based on, number one, the record of prosecutions they had, and, number two, the findings that there simply are not major changes being made at the FBI seems to sort of undermine the seriousness of some of the takeaway conclusions here. Now, I want to be clear that law enforcement has a very important obligation to ensure that all investigations are treated fairly, treated the same way, that there is not bias, and political bias is not allowed to affect the way investigators pursue their jobs. But the idea that this uncovered a vast deep state conspiracy simply was not the case.",

I'm sorry.He basically, to me, copied and pasted or plagiarized from the OIG report, which also looked very critically at what the FBI did, made suggestions for things that could be improved. And Durham has absolutely done nothing. I mean, I think, in particular, he lacks any kind of legal or moral authority to talk about any kind of confirmation bias or political motivation when his own top aide resigned given just how politically influenced he was by Attorney General Barr, flying around the world dining together.

Granted, as the panelists have said, this doesn't prove that there was a deep state, this doesn't prove that there was a sort of conspiracy theory against Donald Trump, but Donald Trump loves conspiracy theories. He's been able to, obviously, convince many of his followers that there is a deep state and that people are out to get him, that there was a kind of witch hunt.

He was reviewing the conduct for criminal purposes. And so, the recommendations, though, even though they're not there, it's clear that the FBI is in need of oversight, is in need of more accountability and more focus. It's a great institution. I've worked with him as United States attorney, as head of the DEA, always in federal law enforcement. But they have such a broad jurisdiction that it needs to be more narrow. And that's what has to be looked at. And I hope to lay out more specific plans. But three weeks ago, I announced -- when I announced for president, I said we've got to reform the FBI, bring it more accountable, not defund them, but to support them and to make them more responsive to their primary mission, which is counterterrorism. And, so, let's have that kind of reform, but it can be broader to the federal agencies that right now we have so many, and they overlap in jurisdiction, they get in conflict with each other and not as effective.

      "sentences": "Yes. Well, Ukrainian officials are saying that the Russians are going all-in again in the fight for the center of Bakhmut. What the Ukrainians are doing, and where they've had success over the past week or so, was to try to push not inside the city, around the city.Now, they have momentum there. They seem to have sort of lost that momentum at the moment, perhaps waiting to push forward again, perhaps waiting for further supplies and reinforcements before they do that. But it's in the center of Bakhmut where the Russians are really pushing down hard, and some of the gains that the Ukrainians have had in and around the center. They don't seem to be able to hold onto those at the moment, Wolf. So, it's a tough picture in Bakhmut. And when you look further along the eastern front here, it's been active. If you go north of here, the Russians also have a big push on north of here. Ukrainians telling us, they're saying the Russians bring in new fighting vehicles, new supplies so that they see the Russians are putting more into the fight, that they've dug in their defensive. So, when the order comes for this counteroffensive, the Ukrainians know they're in for a very, very tough fight. But they had success just a few days ago, as you said, a Russian SU- 35, a Russian SU-34, both aircraft, fighter aircraft, high-speed aircraft, and two MI-8 helicopters, Russian helicopters, were shot down, Ukrainians say, by their surface-to-air missile system just inside Russia, so outside of Ukraine. And this they're saying it is a big plus for the Ukrainian air defenses. But the reality is everything is all about the counteroffensive. And Ukraine needs all of that equipment and more that it's waiting still on some accounts to get from NATO allies.",

General, thanks so much for joining us. Are the chips falling into place right now for this expected Ukrainian counteroffensive against the Russians? LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  They are, Wolf, most assuredly. What you're talking about, though, when a force goes on the offensive, they have to consolidate their forces that are coming from all different directions throughout Europe from various training centers. It's a requirement to get a set. The Ukrainians are doing that right now. But here's the thing. A Ukrainian commander, General Zaluzhny, has the ability to do two things right now, pick the time and the place of the attack. And once he picks that, he's going to go full force. So, some of these things that we're seeing right now as distractions in and around Bakhmut and north of Bakhmut, some of the other cities, those will all pail in significance once this offensive takes place.",
