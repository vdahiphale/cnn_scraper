      "sentences": "Well, Pamela, this is another reminder that getting inflation back to normal is easier said than done.So today's report focuses on wholesale inflation. These are prices before they come to all of us as consumers. And it showed that producer prices were up by 2.4 percent year over year in October. That is a step in the wrong direction, an acceleration from September. Month over month, prices were up by 0.2 percent. That's not an alarming increase, but it is also an acceleration. Part of this is being driven by the calendar. A year ago, inflation was falling rapidly. That's tough to live up to. When you look at the trend, you can see that inflation is obviously in a much better place than it was two, 2.5 years ago. But when you combine today's report with yesterday's Consumer Price Index, it does suggest that this last mile of getting inflation back to normal is proving to be challenging. Economists that I talked to today, they didn't sound alarmed, though they did sound a bit more concerned. And there is this growing sense that the Fed may have to slow the pace of interest rate cuts next year, which, of course, would be disappointing news for everyone trying to pay off credit cards or trying to get a car loan or a mortgage. Now we know that the Fed and economists, they pay attention to the rate of inflation. But all of our viewers, they care about the level of prices. And there's no doubt that everyone is paying more than they were a few years ago. The typical household every month has to spend about $1,100 more than in January of 2021 for the same goods and services all because prices have gone up. One last point, I talked to Moody's economist Mark Zandi. He told me he's optimistic that the rate of inflation is going to keep going back to normal, though he did warn that could change if higher tariffs and mass deportations are on the way. Andrew Lester, Pamela, we know that higher tariffs and mass deportations are two key campaign promises from the president-elect.",

We have seen these types of racist texts referring to plantations and slaves sent across the country. And so both I think we need to look at the source ultimately of who's pushing out this language, as well as the platforms that are allowing this type of language to spread, often in violation of their own terms of service, the own rules that they set for themselves and make sure that they are following those.

And, largely, we're relying on cell phone video or people using the recording related to the weaponry on various military planes, and that there should be something more advanced than this. Bottom line is, the Pentagon is coming out with a statement later on today, one of their reports, which is embargoed until about an hour from now, something like that. But I would be shocked if it said anything different than what they have said before, which is, look, we're taking this stuff seriously. We're looking at this stuff seriously. There's just no evidence of it being extraterrestrial in any way. Yes, maybe, maybe it's some kind of advanced weapon system or something that we just don't know about in the world.

SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Those voices in her head that had made her crave food -- experts call it food chatter -- they were silenced. And that is part of the magic of these new medications. GLP-1 seems to act in a way that no other known hormone can. Here's how it seems to work. Every time you eat, all sorts of hormones are released, like GLP-1. They are called post-nutrient hormones. They travel here to the hypothalamus in the brain to tell you that you are full or satiated. They also travel over here to the pancreas to kick out more insulin to help absorb the energy you just consumed, and also over here to your gut to slow down the emptying, allowing you to better digest your food. In so many ways, it seems like the perfect hormone to help you stop eating as much. Seemed perfect for Rashida (ph). In that first year, she lost 100 pounds. It changed her life. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

As you just saw there in that clip, the idea that, when you eat, there are these hormones that should go to these areas of your brain that are responsible for the feelings of fullness or satiation, for some people, they just don't seem to have as much of that. So they have that constant food chatter. And, Pamela, it was really interesting spending time with people, people who are eating and already thinking about their next meal, people who became very anxious, worried that they had enough food in their pantry closets, for example. That sort of thermostat, that food chatter for them is really, really loud. And that seems to be what's contributing.
