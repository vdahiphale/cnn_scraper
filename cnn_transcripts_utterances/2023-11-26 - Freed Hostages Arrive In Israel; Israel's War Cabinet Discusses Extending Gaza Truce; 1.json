The White House says President Biden spoke with Abigail's family earlier today. She is the first American released since the four-day truce began between Israel and Hamas. Moments ago, Hamas announced its intention to extend that truce which is set to expire tomorrow is underway.

      "sentences": "Wolf, that's a major development in and of itself. At the very beginning when Israel announced it had approved this truce, it said there will be an extension of a pause in the fighting one day for every 10 Israeli hostages released. But we didn't really hear about it from that point on. We didn't know if it would be extended and certainly there were major questions if the deal itself would hold over the four-day period yesterday when it seemed like it was on incredibly shaky ground, on very thin ice, and might risk falling apart.The country stepped in. The U.S. stepped in. The deal held yesterday and we saw it work much more smoothly today. The U.S. had always viewed the first two days as a testing period. We got through those and now is the opportunity and the time where it's possible to talk about extending this deal. And that's what the War Cabinet is doing according to an Israeli source familiar with the discussions. It's a major step to get to this point. Hamas also indicated they're interested in an extension, but again it remains complicated. It remains first for a pause in the fighting. The humanitarian aid needs to keep going in, the hostages need to keep being released, the Palestinian prisoners need to keep being released. Just because it's worked for three days and will hopefully work for a fourth, that doesn't guarantee it in any way. It will still take an effort to get it over the finish line to extend it a day at a time.",

What we've done is see these two giant military helicopters, one of which is still parked on the helipad behind me, deliver those freed hostages to the Schneider medical facility over the course of the past few minutes.There are nine children who were released in this third group of hostages from Gaza over the course of the days, five adults as well. And we believe, and this is what we've been told by the Hostage Forum, the group set up to help the families, that they've all been brought here, certainly all the children have been brought here. And that includes, of course, 4-year-old U.S. Israeli citizen Abigail Edan. She had her fourth birthed on Friday as a hostage inside the Gaza Strip. She's been met here by her family but it's going to be very difficult because as we've been reporting her family says that she doesn't know. She's not yet aware. Maybe she's not old enough to understand. But she's actually an orphan because both her mother and her father were killed in Kfar Aza, that small Israeli community near Gaza which was attacked along with several others on October the 7th and from where she was ripped away into captivity inside Gaza. You spoke earlier about, you know, what happened to her. She was in her father's arms apparently. He was trying to protect her when he was killed. She then ran to her next-door neighbor's house, the Brodutch family, and tried to take shelter with them. But then they were all abducted together, and now Hagar Brodutch who's the mother of three children aged 10, 8 and 4, they were also released alongside Abigail as well. So her next-door neighbors are also in this chopper as well. They've been released from captivity inside Gaza. So that's I supposed one positive as well. Certainly a positive for the father of that family who I spoke to earlier this evening, and he told me how excited he was going to be to actually meet his family again after more than 50 days. Hopefully that's now happened. Chen Goldstein Almog, she's a mother with three children, she was on this chopper as well. She's been released today. They're also going to be coming into a very changed world because these children's father and one of the sisters was killed in Kfar Aza as well. And so all of these hostages, whether they've lost loved ones or whether those loved ones are still alive and are welcoming them back here, they've still endured an unimaginable amount of trauma, Wolf. And so the process of recovering from that is going to be a very, very long one indeed.",

Less than that.A Thai hostage, the sister of a Thai hostage, one of the foreign nationals who's now been released, has told the media that her brother says he was treated well. He wasn't tortured. He was kept in a house and his food was good. And so slightly kind of contradictory accounts of the different circumstances, obviously different people were kept in. I think that's important. Because of the 240 hostages that Israel believed are being -- were being held before these releases started happening inside Gaza, they're not all in one place. Some are in tunnels, some are kept underground, some are kept in houses, all in very varying degrees of hardship. And so, you know, obviously everybody's experience of this 50 days or so maybe very different -- Wolf.",

And that this was a topic of discussion as well between the president and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as well as the continued release of hostages and surging aid into Gaza.And we're also learning, Wolf, more details about the push from the United States for the release of this 4-year-old. U.S. officials believe that she was held in northern Gaza with her neighbors, and the president pushed in his conversation with leaders over the last several weeks for her release in his negotiations along with the release of two other American women. Now they were not part of the release today. That is still an ongoing effort by the United States and will see if they can secure their release in the hours and days to come. But the U.S. was able to track the movements of Abigail Edan over the course of the day today as she made her way to Israel and the president was in close touch with his senior advisers as that was ongoing and they did not breathe a sigh of relief, Wolf, until she was firmly in Israel. And that is when we heard from the president today in his remarks to reporters where he talked about what Abigail Edan and these other hostages have endured. In her case he said that she has been through, quote, \"terrible trauma\" and that her experience has been, quote, \"unthinkable.\" Both of her parents killed in that October 7th attack. Her siblings are alive. But this has, indeed, been what the president called an unthinkable experience and one that the president and his White House officials have been working closely behind the scenes to try to secure her release along with others. And he expressed optimism today that there could be more releases in the days to come and a potential continued pause in fighting if Hamas were to agree to exchange 10 hostages for each day in -- each day pause in fighting.

That it was clear to the world that the United States saw the attack by Hamas as terrorism, not as legitimate resistance. Behind the scenes, there is no doubt, there's been great reporting, much of it from us, that, behind the scenes, the United States has been trying to persuade Israel to reduce, A, the number of civilian casualties. And, B, to see that only a pause would lead to hostage releases. The challenge now, Wolf is -- first of all, what will Hamas' terms be? There's been some reporting today that Hamas wants more Palestinians to be released per hostage. What will Hamas seek? And, two, how much patience will the current Israeli government have in these pauses? One thing we have noted is that Israel's approach to the crisis, understandably, was to eliminate Hamas as a threat to Israel. But eliminating Hamas as a threat also implies regime change. Israel is in northern Gaza. It's not in southern Gaza. How do you achieve regime change without going into southern Gaza, with all of the humanitarian consequences that will bring. And, at that point, will we start to see, as Israel does this, some daylight, public daylight, between the United States and Israel? So far, we haven't seen that.

Three of them students at various American universities.All of them had been visiting Vermont over the Thanksgiving holiday, when Burlington police say a man, described only as a white man, approached them, and then fired his handgun, injuring all three of them. Again, that is the only suspect information that's been shared by Burlington police, who say they are not quite ready to establish this yet as a hate crime. Though this is certainly something they are taking a very close look at, given that at least two of these young men were wearing those traditional scarves, a symbol of solidarity with Palestinian, at the time of the shooting yesterday. Which just happened to take place close to the University of Vermont. But that's not where these students attended. Let me bring you up to speed on the identifies of three young men. According to what we have heard, from the Institute for Middle Eastern understanding, which is in close contact with the families of Tahseen Ali Ahmed, who is the gentleman that you saw on the left of that photo. Kinnan Abdalhamid who's the young man there at the center, hugging both of his friends. And, on the right, you'll see Hisham Awartani. Now, we understand that AwartanI's mother is still in Ramallah right now, which is where she lives. And she is desperately trying to leave the region to make her way to the United States, so that she can be with her 20-year-old son, who we understand is in stable condition. But we also understand, according to the former Palestinian minister of education, who's also in close contact with the families of these young men, that Awartani has a bullet lodged in his spine. So, it is still unclear whether or not --you know, how he'll be able to recover out of all of this. So, it's certainly a traumatic incident here. The FBI in the region saying that they are aware of this. They are ready to step in and assist, should we get to the point where this investigation leads us to believe that this is, in fact, a hate crime. But, look, we've already heard from various Palestinian and Arab American civil rights groups in the United States, who say it all adds up. That they are confident that that's exactly what this was. In fact, you just had a conversation, Fred, in the last hour, with an attorney representing the families. Who says that this gunman, who's still on the loose, did not exchange any words. Simply walked up to them and opened fire. So, it'll certainly be interesting to follow this investigation. And the Burlington police chief saying, given the geopolitics at play, certainly the conflict that's been happening half a world away, because of that, they're certainly going to take a prior -- this will be a priority to establish whether or not these three young men were specifically targeted because of what they were wearing.

And the government of Israel, of course, would like to see the hostages released. But there is -- more than anything, there is political pressure at home. And the families of the hostages have become a very powerful political force. They organized themselves with a speed that was really astonishing. They became --they became a real political force inside of Israel. And they are really pressuring the government to do whatever it can to negotiate to have these hostages released.

Hamas is an --is really an enemy of peace.
