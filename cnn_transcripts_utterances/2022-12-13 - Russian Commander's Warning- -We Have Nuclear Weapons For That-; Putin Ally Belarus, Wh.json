And new video tonight of the unprecedented number of migrants along the U.S./Mexico border. I'll talk to a reporter who was there and says it's one of the biggest surges she's seen. What's causing it? Let's go OUTFRONT. Good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, we have nukes for that. That is defeating NATO. It is a direct threat from a Russian commander broadcast on Russian state TV. He says Russia cannot win the war he clearly believes it is fighting without nukes. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ALEXANDER KHODAKOVSKY, DONETSK MILITIA COMMANDER (through translator): We realize that our resources, of course, have their limits, and the next spiral of escalation can only be won, nuclear. And we don't have the resources to defeat the NATO bloc with conventional means. But we have nuclear weapons for that. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

CNN is learning the United States is now finalizing plans to send the most sophisticated air defense systems on the planet to Ukraine. We're talking about the U.S. Patriot missiles that Ukraine, frankly, has been pounding the table asking for since the war began. The system can take down tactical ballistic missiles, cruise type missiles, aircraft as well. Now, for Russia, Patriot missiles have been positioned at a red line. The former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has warned NATO against providing with them, saying that if NATO did that, the Western alliance would immediately become a legitimate target of Russian-armed forces. Those are powerful words. And based on Medvedev's words, Putin clearly views this move as an escalation. All of these news coming in as air raid sirens blared across all of Ukraine today. That familiar now haunting sound as Putin ramps up his air assault with crucial help from his close ally Belarus. And tonight there is word of snap Belarusian military drills along the Ukraine border. The country's defense ministry announcing what it's calling a sudden inspection of combat readiness. The military equipment is also on the move in Belarus. And, remember, it is a country where Putin pulls the strings. Just four days ago, here he is appearing alongside Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko. That is at an economic summit. And now, today, the Belarusian military is building two river crossings along the Nemen and Berezina Rivers. A big question is whether this is more saber-rattling or actually something more in light of the escalation. It is unclear at this hour. But what is clear is that Putin's military situation, as it is, is growing evermore tenuous. I wanted to play for you an intercepted call. And this one is between two Russian soldiers somewhere in eastern Russia where temperatures right now are hovering at zero degrees Farenheit. Listen to this. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) RUSSIAN SOLDIER 1:  Hi! How are you? RUSSIAN SOLDIER 2:  Yeah, we're here at the shooting grounds. We're freezing, really. We're training, digging fox holes. (EXPLETIVE DELETED), it's minus 15 degrees Celsius, damn it. About 60 percent of us are (EXPLETIVE DELETED) helpless going around the shooting grounds losing their weapons, helmets, and their ammo cartridges. We all have to take a hazmat suit with us.

Antitank systems, more advance missile defense.We are not afraid of them, says the captain, Dimitri. We don't expect them to come here, but if they do, we'll be ready. These soldiers are constantly rehearsing, ready at a moment's notice. Do you think the Russians are going to try to come again? Let them try, says Igor (ph). Before the war, he repaired sewing machines. Now he drives this. How quickly can you get guys to the trenches if you need to? It'll be very fast, he says. They started building these trenches in early April, reinforcing them ever since, getting ready for the Russians. They overpowered Ukrainian defenses at the start of the war. Six weeks and thousands of deaths nationwide later, soldiers from this battalion helped force them out. Was there ever a point where it was overwhelming where you thought we can't do this, we can't fight them all? I never thought like that, says Serhiy, because I know there's no way back. We have families at home. We have children. He says that 2,500 Russian vehicles actually passed right down this road. Now, we're driving down the same road to a bridge near the border, well within Russian artillery range. When the Russians invaded more than nine months ago, they just drove down this road and right over this bridge. But now the bridge has been rigged with explosives and these swamp lands which are frozen over, are full of mines. When the first convoy of an estimated 30,000 Russians came in February, the Ukrainians were unprepared and outnumbered six to one. Now, like soldiers from a century ago, they hunker down in the trenches waiting for whatever comes down the road. (END VIDEOTAPE) RIPLEY (on camera):  And tonight, Erin, here in Kyiv, they are closely monitoring a flurry of Belarusian military activity just in the last week. Today, the nation announced a new foreign minister, a new air force chief. Last week, it was counterterrorism exercises along with those joint combat drills with the Russians. Not to mention the snap military inspections, all of it raising alarm bells and crucially diverting resources potentially from the east, from the south, to the north. Is this an attempt by Russia to try to distract Ukraine while they focus on other areas? Or could this be yet another danger facing this democracy under siege?",

And they're complaining their husbands are getting really sick from the poor conditions that they are living under, in this case at a Siberian training camp. They are living in tents heated by wood-burning stoves. Temperatures are well below zero, any medicine that they have they brought themselves and that they are not being properly trained. I mean, it goes on and on, right? This is in the \"Baikal Times\". This is in the Russian paper. And then one of the wives says, Douglas, and this is the thing that really stuck out to me, quote, we believe that all this is needed for a just cause. We are proud of the guys, we don't blame the authorities.

It's been consistent with what glimpses we've seen of Russian society, that they'll complain about the mechanics of what's going on in the war, but they seem to buy into Putin's narrative that Ukraine represents a significant threat, an existential threat perhaps, it's Nazified.And you don't really see a lot of popular disenchantment about fighting Ukraine. You see more just complaints about how the Russians are fighting.

He's targeting the Ukrainian people, their infrastructure, their electricity. He is taking the fight to the people.

What are the consequences? If Putin is ill, does it mean he becomes more desperate? Does it mean that we can look forward to a change in regime, and would the change in regime be any better? We're talking about Putin perhaps engaging the Belarusians to attack. Now, here's a country that within two years had protest marches of hundreds of thousands of people. And you'd have to think it'd be a pretty desperate act that could actually reignite the fire in Belarus to set the stage for its opposition largely overseas to stir the emotions of folks in the country including its military.

Evan Perez is OUTFRONT. So, Evan, what more can you tell us about what the DOJ wants from Perry and sort of, you know, how it fits in the puzzle that they appear to be trying to put together? EVAN PEREZ, CNN SENIOR JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT:  Yeah, look, Erin, he is not a well-known name. But he is sort of like the connective tissue for a lot of things that were going on inside the White House and certainly the former president's efforts to try to overturn the election results and to try to remain in power. He was trying to get a lot of these text messages that I think the Justice Department is trying to get its hands on were to Mark Meadows and to other players in this broader effort. He said he was trying to, in text messages that we've seen from the Meadows' side, you see him trying to pass on information that he said he was getting from some cyber forensics team that he says he was in touch with. And not only was he trying to get investigations of these Chinese satellites, like one of these conspiracy theories, he also was key in the effort to replace the then acting attorney general. He wanted to get Jeffrey Clark in that role so that he could try to help the former president claim that there was fraud in the election and to find that way to remain in power. So, Scott Perry is a big player. Justice Department has been trying to get his text messages or get access to his phone to get some of those messages and to get all the data from his phone. We don't know exactly how that is turning out. It's a secret proceeding that's going on behind closed doors.

That's one. And then the second one is he also seems to be directly involved in the entire scheme of false slates of electors. So that's also something that CNN had earlier reported back in April.

And QAnon followers tonight are celebrating a tweet from musk. The tweet says \"follow\" and features a rabbit emoji. When I looked into it, I saw your comments. The white rabbit, of course, has been a signal for QAnon followers. Musk says, oh, no, this tweet is just a reference to a scene in \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail.\" And you just happened to tweet that out at that time. You studied QAnon extensively.

A lot of people have taken it as a reference to \"Alice in Wonderland\", which \"The Matrix\" was referencing. But it's not so much important what he intended it to be. Because wehave no idea what he intended. What is important is how people are interpreting it. And whatever he meant when he sent this, a lot of QAnon believers and a lot of conspiracy believers are taking this as him tipping his hat to QAnon, tipping his hat to their ideas, and signaling in a very quiet way, hey, I'm one of you, you're just like me, we're going to do this together.",

He's implied the company's former head of trust and safety had a permissive view of sexual activity by minors. Now, look, we've seen this by QAnon, mike, in the context of falsely claiming that an elite cabal of Democrats are running child sex abuse networks, right? We saw that -- that ended in violence of course in a pizza shop in Washington, D.C. Do you see a connection between that by QAnon and what we're seeing Musk do now when he talks about child sex abuse and Twitter management?",

What it does do is put a really, really big target on this person's back.We now know that he's had to leave his home. He's getting so many death threats. He's had to go into hiding. So, again, I can't tell you if Musk meant to do that, if he was indifferent to what would happen. But all I can tell you is that this is happening and this is one of the most prominent people in the world who is using his platform to indirectly or directly send death threats to one of his former employees.",

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [19:42:55] BURNETT:  Tonight, a new and massive surge in crossings at the southern border. We've got new video just into OUTFRONT from El Paso photojournalist Corrie Boudreaux who was on the ground in Juarez today showing the long line of migrants waiting to be processed to the U.S. I mean, just look at that. Border Patrol officials say more than 2,400 migrants are crossing into El Paso every day, and the Biden administration is now bracing for the situation to get a lot worse later this month because that's when those Trump-era COVID restrictions are set to finally be lifted. Now, those restrictions were used by border officials -- are you ready for this -- nearly 2.5 million times to expel migrants at the border. So, that's 2.5 million crossings that did not happen because of the restrictions that are going away. So, one El Paso official called this, quote, a true emergency for the community. OUTFRONT now, Corrie Boudreaux, as I mentioned, the photojournalist who just took the video that we were just showing you. And, Corrie, look, I really appreciate your time. You've been there along the border filming what you've been seeing. On Sunday, you captured these incredible images. And today, the crowd of migrants at the border today where you say new fencing has been installed. So, tell me more about some of the crossings that you're seeing.

In other cases, there are, you know, sometimes rumors that get spread around about the border, you know, who is able to be processed and who is able not. So, sometimes that influences people coming.
