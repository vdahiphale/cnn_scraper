It just kind of strikes you right in the heart.Again, you know, here we are at the scene of another mass shooting. This this one, again, at a school. And we know from what we've been told by authorities that it was one the shooter was a current or former student. I haven't heard that that detail clarified yet. So our first responders are doing -- going through this same awful ritual that so many others have gone through. They are responding to a scene of unimaginable carnage. You have multiple people shot, already removed and taken to the hospital. And they are trying to piece together exactly how this happened. Identify the shooter, contact family members, conduct at least health and safety welfare checks at wherever this person's residence is. Because, oftentimes, these shooters strike out against family members before they head to their ultimate destination. And it's just a -- a sad and macabre ritual for so many first responders and families and communities around the country. But we're here -- here we are in Madison, Wisconsin, going through the same thing.",

We actually heard Police Chief Shon Barnes asked by a reporter if there were metal detectors at the school that would have gone off had someone walked in and gone through one with a firearm. Let's listen to the response from Chief Barnes. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "You know, Boris, there's always -- communities have vigorous conversations around adding safety measures to schools. There's really no limit to the number of things you could do. You're limited only by budget and creativity.But increased door locks, greater surveillance, really monitoring the perimeter with -- with human beings, security specialists, be they law enforcement or private contractors, metal detectors, massive fences. These are all things we can do. But I think what the chief is alluding to there is, is that what we want? Do we want our kids to have to go to school in locked-down compounds that look more like jails than they do elementary schools? And so I think, obviously, something that Madison will -- will struggle with for some time going forward, trying to figure out what the appropriate level of security measures are. No security measure is perfect. Sandy Hook Elementary, 12 years and a few days ago today, had just recently imposed new security restrictions on access to the school. All the doors remained locked during the day. There was video surveillance outside the front entrance to the door, and you had to be, like, recognized by video or have I.D. or something like that before they would let you in. Adam Lanza simply took out an A.R.-15 and shot his way through the glass door and entered. So there, you know, I think we need to be realistic about what we can expect from those security measures. But clearly, you know, the profusion of weapons in schools, in places of learning, places that are supposed to be safe spaces, kind of screams out at this point that we need to be doing something differently.",

The shooter found dead as police arrived on the scene. Several people there also transported to the hospital with injuries. Let's get the latest now with CNN's Shimon Prokupecz, who has been following all the developments. And, Shimon, we are set to hear from law enforcement in less than an hour. What do you anticipate they are going to share with the press? SHIMON PROKUPECZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME &amp; JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Well, one of the things I think there's a lot of questions about the victims here. Most importantly, the conditions and also the age range. And there can be anywhere from very small children here, because this is a school that's K through 12. So that's what I think one -- one of the biggest questions. And obviously motive. But they're not going to be able to answer that. Perhaps maybe the type of weapon used here, some of the partners that are working with them, like the ATF and the FBI. And the age of the shooter, if we can learn that. It's really striking to me already that the police were able to say that this is a juvenile that was the shooter. So it's going to raise a lot of questions. And so I'm curious as to the age of -- of the shooter. And then, you know, there's so much work that investigators need to do to try and figure out the motive, to try and piece together how all this unfolded. So well probably get a better timeline from the chief. You know, as you can see already, he's been giving a lot of information. He held a press conference fairly quickly to put out as much as he could put out. And also, most importantly, to let people know that there was no longer any threat. So I think things along those lines, well hear from them. And there will be certainly a lot of questions that reporters will have about the victims, the shooter, and exactly how all this unfolded.",

ROB D'AMICO, RETIRED FBI SUPERVISORY SPECIAL AGENT: Yes. So I think what's really important is, was this a former student, a current student? Was there a connection between where he went to and where he was in the school prior? Like more like targeted or was it just he came in with a grudge? And did they have threats before this? I think that's really important to get out right now. But the rest of the investigation is going to start -- come slowly though.",

Did the parents have the weapons and did not have control?We've seen, in the past, before, where parents were arrested because they didn't have control of their weapons. They didn't have the responsibility to protect the weapon. Did this kid actually take this -- this active shooter, actually take this weapon without the parents' permission? And did he have -- how did he have access to it? I also want to know from the school, did the school have any incidents reported in the past? Oftentimes, schools hesitate to notify the police about incidences. But they should, right? Because maybe if the police responded and investigated something that this active shooter did in the past, it might have deterred him. So I often have -- the school should notify the police. Even-- even students should notify the police if something suspicious happens. If this guy made threats online, social media. So these are all the things that we're looking right now. Comb -- combing through his Facebook, his Instagram, his social media just to see if he's -- why he did this and why he targeted this school.",
