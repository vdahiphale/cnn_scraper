I doubt he will accept that. Second, he has been very consistent in arguing that he will not accept membership of Ukraine in NATO. And third, he even recently said that even if there is a pause in the war, this pause should not be used to arm Ukraine and to make it stronger.

      "sentences": "Inflation like anything else, Fareed, in economics is determined by demand and supply. On the demand side, it's off to the races in the Trump program. They're going to substantially bloat the budget deficit by enacting and continuing all the tax cuts and a lot of new ones, by abandoning the independence of the Fed and pushing it to pursue looser policies, and, of course very importantly, by trashing the dollar and hoping for a lower dollar.All of that is on the demand side. That's probably larger or as large as anything that President Biden did. But what's really different about the Trump program is the supply shock that it administers to the American economy. Across-the-board tariffs and massive tariffs on Chinese goods mean that everything we import, everything that competes with, things that we import, everything that uses an input and imported good is going to be jacked up in prices. And these are tariffs not just going up a bit. These are far larger increases than President Trump imposed in the first term. The other important part of the Trump program is the crackdown and the contemplated deportation of substantial numbers of workers. The reason why inflation settled down to the extent that it has is that we went from a labor shortage economy to a labor balance economy, but if you start deporting millions of workers, which is what the president keeps talking about, that's going to create labor shortages and labor shortages, particularly in industries that are sensitive like agriculture, which determines food prices, like new home construction, which has a lot to do with house prices. So supply side, big upward shock. Demand side, massive stimulus collision. The result is going to be higher prices and an inflation dynamic, and that's going to permeate into the psychology.",
