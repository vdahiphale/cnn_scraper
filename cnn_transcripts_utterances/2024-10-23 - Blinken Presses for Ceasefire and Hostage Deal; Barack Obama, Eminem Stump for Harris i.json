It's destroyed a bunch of its arsenal. It's eliminated its senior leadership, including, most recently, Yahya Sinwar. This has covered the cost, great cost, to Palestinian civilians in Gaza. Now is the time to turn those successes into an enduring strategic success, and there are really two things left to do.

It's a dangerous practice, a last resort of humanitarian assistance, and one that took a tragic turn for one family in central Gaza.

Enough, enough! We don't want beans, we want dignity, we want dignity. Here -- show them their aid. Take you aid, we don't want it! Here, take it, take it. This is what our son died for. Where is our dignity, where is our dignity? Me son is being taken from one corner to another to drop a pack of tea. My dignity for a pack of tea. You didn't drop it to help me live, you killed me. You killed my son, my nephew, Until when? We are dying throughout an entire year. Until when? I don't want aid, my son is gone. He was standing there telling me to look at the parachutes. He ran away when he saw it coming close to him. Put pressure on Israel and enter through the ground border. It's safer for my life. Our live are makeshift, humiliation, death, horror.
