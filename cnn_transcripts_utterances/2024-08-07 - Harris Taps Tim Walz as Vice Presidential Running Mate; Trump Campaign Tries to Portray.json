But I have to say, Max, your trainer collection definitely would fit at the skate park.I don't know what you're wearing today. Absolutely, of course. The performance by Arisa Trew yesterday was spectacular. I have to say, that's a similar word you could use to describe the project that was six years in the making for Gabby Thomas, the 27-year-old from Atlanta who now lives in Austin, saying it is unbelievable, indescribable to claim Olympic gold. She beat St. Lucia's 100 meter champion Julien Alfred in the final of the 200 to claim victory, not only for Team USA, but to become the first, the only Harvard University graduate to win track and field gold at an Olympics. She says it was watching Allyson Felix in London 2012 that inspired her. Felix won seven Olympic golds in her career, so still some way to go for Gabby. But she'll be hoping for more in the 4x100 relay, which is still to come. But if Gabby Thomas went into her final as the favorite, then Cole Hocker's victory in the men's 1500 was an entirely different story. This one had been billed as a race for the ages, the Olympic champion up against the world champion, Jakob Ingebrigtsen, up against Josh Kerr. But 23-year-old Hocker, who finished sixth in Tokyo, had very different ideas. His was an epic run, storming from fifth place to last -- to first, I should say, over the last 300 meters, to set a new Olympic record on the way to taking gold. Ahead of Kerr in silver, with Team USA's Yared Nuguse in bronze, it's the first time in 112 years the two American men have medaled in the middle distance event. Elsewhere, the Emma Hayes era, well and truly in full swing with the U.S. women's national football team. She's only been in charge, you might remember, since the end of May, but has led them to what is set to be an epic Olympic football final against Brazil. They produced a really hard-fought extra-time victory over Germany. It was Sophia Smith's 95th-minute winner that made the difference, to book their place in the gold medal match as they look for their first Olympic title since 2012. But also set to be the legendary Marta's last-ever game for Brazil. This, her sixth Olympic Games, she'll be desperate to lead her country to a first international crown. That final taking place on Saturday. But as you mentioned, loads to look forward to here on Day 12. Another day, a fab day on the agenda. USA's Katie Moon is the defending champion, heading into the women's pole vault. We're expecting a great battle between the USA's Quincy Hall and Team GB's Matthew Hudson-Smith, the former roommate of Noah Lyles. That's the men's 400 meters. And the women's golf fit is underway at Le Golf National. Not a familiar course for many of the women's players, but it's Nelly Korda, who's the defending champion, France's Celine Boutier, carrying the hopes of the host. She's the top-ranked European.",
