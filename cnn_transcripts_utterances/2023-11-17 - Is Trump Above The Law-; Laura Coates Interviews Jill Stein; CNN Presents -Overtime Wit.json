Remember that phrase, no one is above the law? How about this one? How does it go again? Let me get it right. If the president does it, it's not illegal. Starting to come back to you now, isn't it? Well, today, there's a new one for the history books. A Colorado judge finding that Donald Trump incited really an insurrection or intentionally engaged in behavior and -- quote -- \"therefore, engaged in insurrection within the meaning of Section 3 of the 14th Amendment,\" saying he \"acted with specific intent to disrupt the electoral college certification of President Biden's electoral victory through unlawful means, specifically by using unlawful force and violence.\" Something that, well, we were watching the day it happened, January 6th.

But because he was the president, that law does not apply. The judge saying the 14th Amendment's insurrectionist ban does not actually apply to presidents because the oath the president takes is not the same as the oath for officers of the United States.That sounds a lot like someone is above something, doesn't it? Almost exactly like since the president did it, it's not illegal. I mean, talk about whiplash. And if you're confused, you're not the only one around these parts. Up till now, we'd heard primarily, I think, two arguments in this case, not unlike what we heard in places like Michigan and Minnesota, who already decided to keep Trump on the ballot. One of the arguments was that it should be up to the voters, not any court, to tell you who was on the ballot. The other argument, since Trump had never been charged with insurrection and there had been no legal conclusion that he actually engaged in it, there's no reason to take him off the ballot because of, of course, due process and that presumption of innocence that we all hold very dearly. Well, today, it didn't seem to come down to the voter's argument, and the judge did say that he didn't cite something. Instead, it came down to what's called a technicality, if you will. If the founding fathers meant for the president to be removed by this mechanism, then they would have clearly stated that. It's that they mentioned officers of the United States. I want to dig in more here, though, because the Section 3 actually says this: Who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any state legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any state. They didn't say the president. You see that? It's almost as if, and this is something I've heard a lot recently, there's a two-tiered system of justice. I want to get right to Noah Bookbinder. He's executive director for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, the acronym known as CREW. The organization also was involved in this very case in Colorado.

And this kind of antisemitism is becoming all too common, not just on social platforms, but across right-wing media. Here is Oliver Darcy with more.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) OLIVER DARCY, CNN SENIOR MEDIA REPORTER (voice-over):  Antisemitic rhetoric is finding a home in right-wing media. Since the onset of the Israel-Hamas war, a handful of influential talk show hosts has spread antisemitic tropes to their millions of followers. One of the main charges? The disgraceful notion that a spike in antisemitism is merely Jewish people getting a taste of their own medicine after supposedly supporting anti-white sentiment, a reprehensible conspiracy theory that has been denounced by the Anti- Defamation League. UNKNOWN (voice-over):  Any more comments? DARCY (voice-over):  Take Elon Musk, one of the world's richest men who has supported a host of right-wing conspiracy theories. Musk replied to a user online, publicly endorsing that notion, writing this week, you have said the actual truth. It's not just limited to Musk. Right-wing media figures Tucker Carlson, Candace Owens, and Charlie Kirk have also peddled this idea. CHARLIE KIRK, RIGHT-WING COMMENTATOR:  It is true that some of the largest financiers of left-wing anti-white causes have been Jewish Americans. DARCY (voice-over):  Kirk has also floated the conspiracy theory that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu knew about the October 7 terror attack but chose to do nothing.",

Ben Shapiro, co- founder of \"The Daily Wire,\" which employs Candace Owens, ripped her earlier commentary as disgraceful during a recent speech. BEN SHAPIRO, CO-FOUNDER, THE DAILY WIRE:  The question was about Candace Owens. I think her behavior during this has been disgraceful. Without a doubt. She still works for my company. I think that she has been absolutely disgraceful. I think that her faux sophistication on these particular issues has been ridiculous. DARCY (voice-over):  Owens appeared to fire back in a response drenched in antisemitism, suggesting Shapiro had opted for wealth over virtue, quoting a Bible verse saying, you cannot serve both God and money. CNN reached out to \"The Daily Wire\" for comment and has not gotten a reply. The rhetoric comes as antisemitic attacks are surging across the U.S. and around the world. Jonathan Greenblatt, the head of the ADL, spoke out against the commentary coursing through right-wing media. Responding to Musk, Greenblatt said, at a time when antisemitism is exploding in America and surging around the world, it is indisputably dangerous to use one's influence to validate and promote antisemitic theories.
