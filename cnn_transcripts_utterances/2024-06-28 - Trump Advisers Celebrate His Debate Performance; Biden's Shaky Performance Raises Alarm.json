Democrats are panicking after President Biden's softspoken performance that really puts it mildly, according to them, were a number of moments where he mumbled or seemed to freeze. Some Democrats are privately questioning whether he should remain at the top of their ticket. Donald Trump's advisers, meanwhile, are celebrating his performance. CNN reporting that one adviser specifically pointed to this moment where Trump avoided responsibility -- or tried, I should say, to avoid responsibility for the January 6 riot. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  And let me tell you about January 6. On January 6 we had a great border -- nobody coming through -- very few. On January 6 we were energy independent. On January 6 we had the lowest taxes ever. We had the lowest regulations ever. On January 6 we were respected all over the world. All over the world we were respected. And then he comes in and we're now laughed at. We're like a bunch of stupid people. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It's one we've heard asked of Democrats for decades, particularly before Roe fell. They have been able to handle it much more easily in the time since the Dobbs decision.
