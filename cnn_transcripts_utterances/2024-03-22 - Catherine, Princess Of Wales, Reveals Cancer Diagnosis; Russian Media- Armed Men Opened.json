I think it's going to be last minute moments.If it's a family event or there's a service, something that she thinks is important, she may turn up to it. But I think it's going to be a last-minute decision. Her priority is obviously the treatment and the recovery. But now we're into the Easter holidays, it's about creating some regularity for the children. So I don't know if that means they're going away on holiday or that they are just going to stay at home and take daily outings and just work together as a family. William will be carrying on with his public duties. So I think we can read into that that she is stable enough at home for him to carry on with his public duties. I mean, the pressure on the monarchy right now is absolutely immense. The queen has really stepped up in recent times. She went on a visit to Northern Ireland just this week. Major constitutional events. And she was representing the king there. The king, obviously, isn't carrying out public engagements. Kate has been going to be doing it for some time. William is going to do what he can. But the top four royals are pretty much out of action. This is a real amount of pressure on them. So I think you're going to see Edward and Sophie stepping up a lot more. Also, a lot of pressure on Princess Anne right now.",

And obviously, of great interest to people around the world who are concerned about -- about her. Where do you see this going from here? RICHARD QUEST, CNN BUSINESS EDITOR-AT-LARGE: I think there'll be two distinct tracks here, if you will. Within the United Kingdom, I think the -- the sort of the mainstream media, if you will, would all follow the rules. There'll be no going after her. There'll be no sharing pictures. If pictures are taken elsewhere, they won't be shown. Her privacy will be respected. But of course, it is a democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press. And so there will be pictures. In fact, the pictures we've seen of her so far have usually been paparazzi, or even members of the public who published them. And that's going to be the bigger problem, I think. It's when the paparazzi decide to try and with -- with vigorous determination, decide to get pictures of, in any shape, form, and description, and how those are then used, who buys them, who shows them, who gives oxygen, if you will, to these rogue photographs that are taken. And the second thing, of course, from the princess' point of view, as much taken with watch her last line of her statement, Anderson, she said, \"I'm also thinking of all of those whose lives have been affected by cancer. For everyone facing this, do not lose faith or hope.\" So very similar to the king when he gave out his diagnosis. And suddenly, the number of men going for prostate cancer tests went up enormously. So she has got this jewel -- well, the primary responsibility and role, of course, is her family and her health, as she said. But she will be very aware of the need to also, for other people to be seen as, in a sense, as a role model for how one handles such awfulness in such a public arena.",

You've got the very barest of details and they just present just as a bid and you never heard from them again, in a sense.But that doesn't cut it -- cut it today. You have to look at the -- the unspoken social contract, the spoken constitutional contract between monarchy and the people is that they serve the peoples' pleasure in a sense. And therefore, there are duties and responsibilities, and which come into conflict when something extremely personal like this takes place. And it's that balancing act, Anderson, that is going to define how this moves forward in a public sense. Obviously, the medical sense and her family is the priority in that way. I was -- one thing I was very interested in. You were talking to Dr. Jonathan Reiner about the way this had moved forward. Now, when she initially went in for surgery, as the good doctor said, they had a pretty good idea that something was amiss. And if you think about the number of weeks that we have been kept at arms-length in a sense, from that sort of information. And it's arguable we'd have never have found out anymore if it hadn't been cancerous. And the public, what right does the public have to know in what circumstances about her condition, her treatment. The truth is very little until it affects our own sort of way of life and our own constitution. At the moment, that's not in question.",

If you're just joining us, we learned at the top of this hour, around 02She had gone in, as you know, in January for major -- what she called me sure abdominal surgery. She said then that they did not believe it was cancerous prior to the surgery. Then they found that cancer had been present. She said, in February, she began -- late February we believe, she began chemotherapy. The -- Kate Middleton, the princess of Wales, nor anyone at the palace have not -- they have not said exactly what kind of cancer this is, nor will they be saying that, according to our Max Foster. They do not plan to be giving any more details. And they asked for privacy as she undergoes -- continues to undergo this chemotherapy. I want to check in with our Max Foster. Max, I know you've been sort of monitoring not only any information coming out from the palace, from the royal family, but also just reaction in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. What are you hearing?",

      "sentences": "And, Max, also, I mean, unsettling for -- for Catherine and also obviously the royal family, the privacy breach, the attempted -- according to authorities, there was an attempt to find out medical records among hospital staff.What is the status of that? And did that -- I mean, are you hearing anything about whether that sort of played a role in the timing of this announcement? FOSTER: It didn't play any role in the timing. They stuck to their plan. I mean, if you look at what they've done, they've stuck to their plan throughout this. They've only done what they said they were going to do in terms of media coverage and statements and all of a social media post that they've been putting out there. So the current status of the hospital is that, according to our affiliate sources, ITV, three members of staff tried to get into her digital records at the hospital, tried to see her medical records. And there's an investigation in the hospital. And the data commissioner is also looking at that. The police aren't yet involved. But that does suggest that that information wasn't ultimately leaked, but they did try to access it. It does speak to all of the conspiracy and all the coverage here, because why would people be trying to get hold of that information? I think the general consensus is that it would have been leaked to the media and they would have tried to sell that story. It would have been worth a huge amount of money. So it all speaks to the same thing. The fact that so many, I don't know what to call them, the people out there who are promoting these conspiracy theories, trying to get information, trying to make money, frankly, from clicks and views on social media. This is the pressure that they are now facing. And I can't think of another story where the speculation is bloated so much. And of course, there has been criticism of the palace for not giving enough information and allowing those conspiracy theories to bubble up. But they've now explained why that was. And it was simply to try to get their heads around it and to protect the kids.",

It's a huge shock for Britain, across the world.Kate Middleton has been the princess of Wales, has been on the front page of so many newspapers, all these social media trending, just as Max was talking about. And Kate has come out and given this really intimate, really beautiful video in the gardens of Windsor Castle, those daffodils behind her, and really being so unaccustomedly open, as you say. She was talking about cancer. She said exactly when the cancer was discovered -- was discovered, and she talked about starting chemotherapy. So she's really had this openness, what we haven't seen from the royal family before. The queen's father, George VI, we knew nothing. Even the queen herself, as princess, didn't know he was ill, so she went off to Kenya. We simply aren't told this. And I think we are moving into a new royal world. It's totally unprecedented. The king was open. Kate was open. And I think it really makes us think about the royal family. We can't always imagine they're super humans going on forever, never even getting a cold or even a major illness like this. They are human, too. And this is all bought at home to us, I think.",

Dr. Brawley, you've, I assume, heard what Catherine has said. I'm wondering what stands out to you from a medical standpoint. She said she had this major abdominal surgery in January. It was in late February, started chemotherapy, that the cancer -- that initially when she wanted for the surgery, they did not believe that there was cancer. She says she found out later that there was. DR. OTIS BRAWLEY, PROFESSOR OF ONCOLOGY AND EPIDEMIOLOGY, JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY: Yes. This is -- we, of course, all hope the best for this poor woman who has to go through this in a very public way. This does happen. You can have, for example, an ovarian cyst or a problem with the ovary that leads to abdominal surgery. And then the pathologist a day or two or three after the surgery, while examining the specimen, finds out that there actually was a cancer there. That happens. We also sometimes see it with colon cancer. We then very frequently will give people what we call adjuvant chemotherapy. That's a person where there's no evidence that they have disease left in their body, but there's still the possibility, we give them adjuvant chemotherapy to try to clean up what might be there that's so small we can't see it. And the prognosis can still be very good. I think that's something all of us have to keep in mind and have to hope. We have people who have colon cancer or ovarian cancer, other cancers who -- who do very well.",
