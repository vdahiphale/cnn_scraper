I'm going to just show it to you here. Again, this is ABC had gotten this picture of it. We are told that that backpack was found in Central Park in New York City. Now, you know that for days now, authorities have been scouring that park. They've been looking for the backpack and it appears that they may now have it. That's crucial, of course. But what they do not have is the CEO assassin, and top New York police department officials tell CNN exclusively right now that they have reason to believe that the suspect left on a bus on Wednesday, hours after the killing.

There's other ways in which we just don't -- we can get at least a match, maybe there's an opportunity.We may not get a hit which is a hit. Meaning you have an identified individual in this, but it's in the database we have well have something and you can compare it to other DNA -- DNA evidence or DNA analysis for possible family members that may have been perpetrators in crimes. So there is opportunity there. Nothing, as far as evidence, is concerned, should ever be taken away or removed. It is always probative until its deemed not. BURNETT: So, so, Kate, let me ask you about then identifying who he is because, you know, when you potential family members things like that. So the clear picture of the suspect's face and we just heard the commissioner of New York police, you heard her describe that as sort of the one money shot that they have. That's it, when he was flirting with the woman checking him in at the hospital. So that's when that that smiling picture was taken.
