And of course, then the army overthrew that. And so basically, you've got a mess with not very clear lines of who has the influence over which side to try to get them to step back from the fighting.

And U.S. officials have said that Russia and China both take advantage of these situations. And when the U.S. tries to step in or the European Union and say, we'll negotiate peace, but you've got to honor human rights, you've got to cleave to certain norms of behavior.

Current estimates put the deadline for when the Treasury Department will exhaust the extraordinary measures it uses to pay the government's bills at some point early this summer.President Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy have yet to hold substantial negotiations on this, something that has become a key point of anxiety for many members on Capitol Hill. House Republican leaders, I'm told, have begun informally putting together a debt limit package that they intend to socialize with their rank and file members next week McCarthy is also slated to deliver a speech on this at the New York Stock Exchange on Monday. Another key priority on the Hill will be around receiving classified briefings. The Pentagon is scheduled to give an all senators briefing on Wednesday as they continue to investigate the massive leak of classified defense documents. The Gang of Eight, which includes the top four congressional leaders, as well as the chairman and ranking members of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, started receiving some of the classified documents found at the homes and offices of former President Donald Trump, President Biden and former Vice President Mike Pence in recent weeks. They're eager to review these documents more closely in a classified setting on the Hill. Another key focus for Congress is on the recent abortion ruling in Texas. There's little that Congress can do following the court's decision to suspend the use of medication, abortion drugs, but Democrats in particular are eager to weigh in on this in person and see what legislation, including messaging bills. They can put forward to force Republicans on the record. And lastly, House investigations are continuing to heat up. We're seeing more Republican chairmen begin to issue subpoenas as they enter into the fourth month of being in the majority. On Monday, the House Judiciary Committee will hold a field hearing in New York City as they continue to escalate their investigation into Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg.",

These concerns are raising questions over in Indiana, in Richmond, Indiana, where they've had a similar situation, a plastic recycling plant that caught fire there. Still hundreds of people there are waiting to hear back whether if they can return home. Frankly, we do know that they're doing air and water quality tests to shape those evacuation orders before they lift those evacuation orders. Here, in this case, massive plumes of smoke. We've seen pictures of that in Brunswick, Georgia. That is in the southeast coast. This is a city of about 15,000 people. This is the Pinova plant, which delivers raw materials used in other industries, specifically specialty rosin and polyterpene resins. These are derived from pine and other natural resources. We are told by the Glenn County Board of Commissioners that the fire originally broke out Saturday morning and then they contained that fire. But about three hours later, that fire reignited. We are told by the Glenn County Board of Commissioners that they've received help from across state lines, the Jacksonville Fire Department, all sorts of agencies doing airdrops, doing foam operations, and that origin of the fire is still unknown.

Of course, they are not considered collaborators. They need to get to a third country and address a local Ukrainian consulate. It will issue them Ukrainian documents to return to Ukraine.\" But for those who remain in Russia long term, the future is less clear. By Ukrainian law, people who publicly deny occupation or who call for support for Russian actions are considered collaborators. International law prohibits forcible transfers of people.

And I'm also sympathetic to the view that Fox perhaps deliberately spread information that they had reason to know was not true.But a ruling against Fox is not just going to be a ruling against Fox. I've seen a lot of news organizations and journalists saying, well, we would never do that. And perhaps they wouldn't do that exactly. But I think once you get in the business of plumbing the depths of the news gathering and reporting process, probably no news organization can emerge unscathed. We don't have the kinds of canons of ethics that lawyers and doctors do. Reasonable people can differ about what good reporting is and what good judgment is. I am very reluctant to have court step in and basically become a tribunal on journalism, and that's the risk of an adverse ruling in a case like this.",
