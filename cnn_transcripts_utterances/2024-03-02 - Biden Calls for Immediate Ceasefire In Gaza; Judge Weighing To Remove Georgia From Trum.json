We have heard that the child malnutrition in Gaza is the worst in the world at this point, a U.N. agency saying that they believe that one in six of every child under the age of two is severely malnourished. And what we're now seeing as well from other countries is that they are pushing more for these airdrops. There is a realization that with the collapsing infrastructure and distribution within Gaza. And also, we've heard from U.N. groups and NGOs Israeli troops in some occasions firing upon aid groups and not allowing aid through to where it's desperately needed. We are seeing this reliance more on drops from the air.

He wants to delay, delay, delay as much as possible, leading into this 2024 election, which is really interesting, because at the same time, he has really made his campaign his presidential campaign and his legal argument, one in the same. He does not have to be in person at all of these trial dates, but he has been to as many as possible because his campaign side has seen that it benefits them. It benefits them for Republicans to see him sitting in court. And so, that has become an argument that has effectively merged. And so, it's really interesting to sort of see those kinds of difference in opinions of: a. we are going to use these legal issues to our benefit politically, but at the same time, we're trying to delay because at the end of the day, legal problems are not a plus.",

And the timing is also interesting. It comes after she has lost her home state of South Carolina, Iowa, and New Hampshire. And the big question everyone has is what happens with Nikki Haley after Super Tuesday. And I was sitting with her in a small roundtable yesterday morning here in D.C., with reporters. And that was one of the key questions that we asked is, what are your plans post-Super Tuesday? And she said she is not looking that far ahead, which I think is notable. And so, the big question for me is, are these endorsements in vain? Or do we see Nikki Haley continue on even past Super Tuesday?",

I can't do what I want to do as president with a Democrat vice president.\" No Labels has certainly said that they have some interest in her. They have said they've also looked at independents.

She uses her money very wisely. And so, again, who knows she could -- $12 million could bring you past Super Tuesday, which is in just a few days. Does she stay in past Super Tuesday? We don't know. What does she do afterwards? She seems it she has not signaled any, any clear indication on what she would do afterwards.

But we just have to get through the short term here, and you can take a look at this map showing all of the winter storm impacts. Notice how wide this swath of purple is right here. That's extreme. That's the highest category possible that you can get on these impacts. We're talking near impossible travel we already know several roads that are shut down due to bad conditions? More are likely to continue today and tomorrow. Whiteout conditions, the damaging winds, we already know of about 50,000 people without power so far, that number is likely to tick up as we go through the next 24 to 48 hours. Here you can see all of these winter storm alerts including several Blizzard warnings, not just for California but also portions of Nevada as well. As we zoom in a little bit closer, you can see, we still have some rain and around San Francisco up around Sacramento and all of this heavy snow, pretty much up and down the Sierras and even spreading into Reno. Remember, Reno is not that high in elevation, folks. They are going to end up getting some significant snow out of this as well. Here you can see the wider shot, so a lot of that moisture is starting to spread eastward too that will end up producing rain and snow for some other states too as we push through the rest of the weekend. Here is a look. Again, you can see, it's going to come in waves. So, for a lot of these areas it may take up, then, it may slow back down you're going to be looking at some of the snowfall rates of, in sometimes, two to four inches an hour for multiple hours then it may go back down to maybe only one inch an hour, and continue on off and on throughout much of the weekend. Overall, yes, we are talking about measuring this snow in feet, widespread. You're looking at four to eight feet of snow. But some of these areas could pick up as much as 12 feet total before it's all said and done. Look at these wind gusts that have already come in numerous ones well over 100 miles per hour. And that is the concern why we expect those power outage numbers to tick back up.",
