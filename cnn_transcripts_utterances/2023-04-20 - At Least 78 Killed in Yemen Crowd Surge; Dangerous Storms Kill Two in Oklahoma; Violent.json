What you're looking at is a crowd, is basically pile of humans trapped, entangled together in the heart of that crowd. You could hear on that video that again I'm not playing. People screaming, begging for help. Arms outstretched. There were some people on the edge of that crowd trying to pull those arms, pull those people out of, again, just that crush of humanity to no avail. What you're looking at is a crowd that was just outside of a school where aid was being distributed, Rosemary, by two merchants. This is Ramadan. It's normal for aid to be handed out at sunset when fast is over. We're in the final days of Ramadan. Eid is just coming up and these dozens of people were gathered in hopes of getting just about $10 -- Rosemary. Just about $10 is why some of those people lost their lives, a total of 78 people killed. According to Houthi officials who blame those two merchants for not coordinating with the local authorities, saying that caused this crush, that caused this stampede and surge that led to that loss of life. Dozens more were injured. Houthi officials saying that they're going to provide some $4,000 to each of those families, each of the victims or each of the families of those victims killed. They're also going to be covering hospital stays, in-hospital treatment for those who are injured. But again, it is just tragedy on tragedy in a place that the U.N. says is home to one of the world's worst humanitarian crises at a very poignant time, just before Eid al Fitr -- Rosemary.",
