The monarch then will formally become the royal leader of the U.K. His wife, Camilla, will also officially be crowned Queen.You're looking at a live picture of the -- yes, there it is -- Buckingham Palace right now and the parade route as well. And thousands will soon descend upon the mall outside of Buckingham Palace. We initially, I am told in my ear from our executive producer Chris, that we had the King, but he is a little busy now, so -- oh, there he is, there he is. There he is. He is talking to folks, shaking hands and just enjoying himself. Max Foster there right now, joining us. Final preparations obviously being made. The King is out and about. Tell us what we should expect. MAX FOSTER, CNN ANCHOR &amp; ROYAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, he's meeting a governors general and commonwealth representatives really just down at Marlborough House. He just left here at Buckingham Palace where he had lunch. He'll be back here at Buckingham Palace a bit later on where there'll be a gathering of heads of state who've all come in for the coronation. And I think, Sara, it could possibly be the biggest gathering of heads of state ever because the only comparable event that we can think of is the funeral last year. And that was obviously at short notice and it was also during the United Nations General Assembly. So we think this is a bigger gathering of heads of state. But we're not being given a specific list by the palace. We're just going to have to wait to see who actually turns up at the coronation tomorrow. Lots of preparations. They've been preparing for months for this. There have been military preparations at two airfields which are all about getting ready for that massive coronation procession which will leave the Abbey and come back to Buckingham Palace after the coronation. 4,000 members of the military. We haven't seen anything like that since the last coronation. Arguably, one of the biggest events that we've seen in this country since then. It will be a lot of theater, but at the very heart of it will be effectively a divine moment where he's anointed by holy oil and is effectively made the God's representative on earth. There's nothing less than that. That's how they actually view this occasion. And that particular moment, in the middle of the service, we won't actually see it's going to be hidden because it's this very divine moment, but that's at the core of it. And around that, Sara, a huge amount of pomp and pageantry, processions, music, a lot of military and also some family dynamics as well. They're trying to modernize it as much as they can, considering this is a ceremony going back 1,000 years. They're trying to have a lot of inclusivity. So there'll be a more diverse congregation there, there'll be other religions involved in the service. So, a lot of history trying to make it current. We'll see afterwards whether they achieve that. But there's a lot of excitement really about the pomp and pageantry, which we do do pretty well if it goes to plan.",

But they don't have much reporting about who this is and what they've shared beyond a single photo of a storage room.Now, that storage room is significant because classified documents were contained in some boxes that moved in and out of storage. But right now, what we're really looking at is who this person could potentially be. But we know from our reporting that pretty much everyone who's worked at Mar-a-Lago, from the gardeners, the waiters, all the way to operations, and even the head of security, they've all been subpoenaed. Investigators have been talking to all of them. So it's not clear when they say cooperation, if they mean someone who has provided potentially significant evidence in this case, or if there's someone who has just complied with them and given them photos or other knowledge that they should have as part of their job at the property. But right now, again, we broke the story that investigators are really curious about whether they have all the surveillance footage from Mar- a-Lago. They need that to understand what happened to those classified documents once they went down to Florida and they did a new round of subpoenas. Just yesterday, Matthew Calamari Sr., and his son, Matthew Calamari Jr. went before the grand jury to talk about what exactly happened to that security footage after they received a subpoena. So at this point, a lot of significant developments. But what all of this tells us, John, is that this investigation is far from over.

One, is that on the security footage they did receive, investigators saw Walt and at least one other employee moving boxes from a storage facility.Now, we've learned those boxes contain some classified materials. Now, we know investigators have spoken with Walt several times, but he does not appear to have been completely cooperative. There are also concerns that he may have given inconsistent statements. Now, I'm getting a rap cue, but I want to include this also really important piece of our reporting. We know that investigators called in Trump's chief operating officer and executive vice president of the Trump Organization Matthew Calamari Jr., because he received a text message from who? From Walt Nauta, asking him to talk. And they want to know what they talked about and if they discussed anything related to that security footage. BERMAN: Paula Reid, you are our key cooperator.

      "sentences": "Good morning, Kate. Yes, this is all part of what we're learning of -- what we've known has been a very secretive world of money and influence around the Supreme Court and why so many people are pushing the justices to adopt a formal code of ethics.But I want to say that all these instances that have come out recently in news reports are not all the same and not of the same weight. But let's start by saying what Leonard Leo told The Washington Post in response to that report. \"The work Ginni did here did not involve anything connected with either the court's business or other legal issues. Knowing how disrespectful, malicious and gossipy people can be, I have always tried to protect the privacy of Justice Thomas and Ginni.\" So let me get to this, Kate, about what's the same here and why these kinds of reports keep raising concerns and what's different. We saw just recently reports from ProPublica about Republican billionaire Harlan Crow giving all sorts of gifts to Clarence Thomas, gifts of travel and lodging, most recently, a gift that involved the -- a grandnephew that Clarence Thomas and his wife were raising, money that would allow that child to go to a private boarding school. Now, those instances were supposed to be reported as money that came to Clarence Thomas. This instance arguably did not have to be reported in any way because right now, the spouses don't have to detail their income on these forms. But that aside, let me just say that, once again, it's another issue that points up how much we don't know about wealthy interests trying to influence justices, or maybe not even trying to influence justices, but raising that kind of specter. And that's why there's so much pressure for the justices to adopt some sort of formal code of ethics rather than, as the justices hope, this all fades away. I don't think this time, Kate, this is going to fade away.",
