An emergency crew work to rescue people trapped in their homes is also happening.CNN's Miguel Marquez is in Montpelier, Vermont.

The sun is out first time in a long time we've seen that, and the water is finally starting to recede on the Winooski River here in the -- in the downtown area.This is right at the confluence of the North Branch of the river. And this end is a -- is a big reservoir just north of where we are that they were concerned that was going to overtop. There's been a couple of reservoirs in the state that have already overtop. The top of them and pouring more water in two systems like this. But right now, the water here is starting to recede. The water was hitting the top of the bridge earlier and there was tons of debris that was starting to gather on the top of the bridge. That now seems to have stopped. And the bridge south of us -- or west of us. This is a walking bridge. It was hitting that bridge a short time ago and it is now below that. All that said, there are still concerns about how much water is being poured in the system. The problem for Vermont is that they've had -- they've had rainfall for weeks now and the sponge is just full. There's nowhere for the water to go except over the surface. And that's what you're seeing now. Over a hundred water rescues across the states. They are still very concerned about many roadways because they're either washed out, water on them, or debris on them still. And it is going to take a long time for the many people across this -- you know a lot of very rural parts of this state that have just been devastated. Sara.",

It will now be held next Tuesday. A brief delay if you will.And it is just one step in the broader fight really being waged by Donald Trump's legal team to get the trial date -- the start of the trial pushed back -- pushed back to not even begin until after the 2024 election. Joining us right now for more on this is CNN's Senior Legal Analyst, former federal prosecutor Elie Honig. So, Elie, let's talk about these requests for delay, not just this delay that from the first hearing but the broader argument that Donald Trump's legal team is making for -- it's that they should have this start of the trial not begin until after the 2024 election. What do you think of what they're asking?",

It'll be too politically charged to have a jury trial, a criminal trial of one person who's running for office done by the Justice Department of the other person. They argue, why would we take that risk? Why wouldn't we just do it after the election?To me, the more compelling argument though, is the practical argument. They say DOJ took a year, and change to investigate this. Now, you want us to go to trial in five months, we have to go through 400,000 documents. We've been given 120,000 e-mails, nine months of surveillance video, and we don't even have it all yet. Trump's team is saying. And I think compellingly, they cite two other recent classified documents, one of them took a year and a half to go to trial. The other took three years to go to trial. So, they're just making a straight-up logistical argument, we can't realistically be ready that quick.",
