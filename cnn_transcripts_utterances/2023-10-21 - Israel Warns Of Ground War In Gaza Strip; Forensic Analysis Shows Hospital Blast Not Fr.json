      "sentences": "And welcome to our continuing coverage of \"Israel at War.\" I'm Erin Burnett in Israel alongside my friend John Berman in New York.The head of the Israeli Defense Forces told his commanders tonight that, quote, \"We'll enter the Gaza Strip.\" Not a question. A definitive statement. A spokesperson for the IDF tonight saying they are increasing airstrikes to Gaza to minimize risk to troops for the, quote, \"next stage of the war.\" Increasing, I should say they've been running at some days as more than 200 strikes and they're going to increase off that number. CNN's team on the ground here saw dozens of tanks, armored personnel carriers, as well as bulldozers massed at the border. And we have seen those bulldozers, massive military ones, designed for an urban incursion they will be facing. This video represents just one of several groupings that our team witnessed. Altogether, CNN saw hundreds of tanks and armored vehicles. This comes as the World Health Organization warns that the limited amount of supplies allowed to cross into Gaza from Egypt today is not enough. It was about 20 trucks. They say they need 100 every day. The director general also saying that the hospitals inside Gaza are already at their, quote, \"breaking point.\" Twenty trucks, as I said, entered Gaza earlier today. Food, water, medical supplies were in them. No fuel, as that is deemed too controversial as to whether Hamas will siphon that off and take that for military purposes. Of course, that fuel is desperately needed to run those hospitals. Generators which are hours away, a day away from possibly running out. Nic Robertson joins me now Sderot, Israel where he has been since this all began. And of course, Nic, it's just to take a pause here, it was two weeks ago today that these horrific attacks happened. What is the very latest where you are tonight?",

      "sentences": "Yes, for the very latest there's fighter jets in the sky. We've been hearing explosions coming from the northern end of Gaza. We've been seeing flashes in the past hour or so. And through the past 24 hours, a noticeable uptick in the amount of strikes, Israeli strikes going into Gaza, compared to I would say the 24, 48 hours prior to that.That period, a couple of days prior to the hostage release early yesterday, was relatively quiet. Noticeably it has picked up today. We've been driving along the border trying to sort of compare and contrast what we're seeing now today compared to what we were seeing a week ago. That frenzied activity of the very fast and quick military build-up, that's not there. There you heard another heavy detonation coming from Gaza. That frenzied activity for a fast build-up isn't there. It's more settled. I think more roads are controlled. The security is tighter the closer you get to Gaza. A grouping of tanks that we've seen that were getting ready to, it appeared, to move forward five or six days ago. They're gone. But it's hard to know if they're moving forward further and closer to Gaza, or have they been pulled back on a pause. I found what was interesting today. The areas where we have seen a massive back from the frontline, a few areas where we've seen massive rows of tanks and heavy armored fighting vehicles. All parked up in fields without troops by them. They're still there. They're still in those locations. That potentially means that the IDF has a lot more reserves that it can call upon in terms of armored vehicles when it needs them. But it also signals that perhaps it hasn't got -- it hasn't moved all of its force yet towards Gaza. More heavy detonations there. It's just hard to say from the limits of what we can see about what's going to happen. But obviously everyone is aware that the humanitarian aid, the hostages, they play on Israel's calculation of when it can do what the IDF says it seems to be getting ready to do.",

And look, we've heard from politicians, whose government ministers saying the green light has been given to the military. But the politicians still have a hand in this because we know again in the past few hours or so Hamas's military wing have said, look, we've got another couple of hostages. And we've heard from the prime minister's office and the IDF both saying that this is just propaganda coming from Hamas.We know that a couple of hostages were released yesterday. We know that it took a couple of days to sort of formulate the plans and make that actually happen and work. So there's a lot of pressure. How many different nationals are being held by Hamas? I think the number is over 30 now. 210 hostages held by them. Hamas has got a huge amount of leverage. And it's trying to leverage the humanitarian aid situation as well over the Israeli governments. It's a different calculation that the Israeli government has had to make than it's ever made before. But it seems to me the intent is absolutely there to go in. It's merely the precise timing of when.",

Well, there's a new CNN forensic analysis tonight, and it's very important because this is about that hospital bombing that everyone watching knows about and has seen so much coverage of. There has been such intense emotional reaction to around the world, particularly here in the Middle East. Well, this forensic report that we have shows that Gaza, that the bombing in the hospital in Gaza was not from an Israeli strike. So it's not the U.S. intelligence saying it. It's not the IDF saying it. This is CNN's forensic analysis.

There is a lot of artillery at work. And significant to make the point that it also would not be that.John Berman, back to you in New York. JOHN BERMAN, CNN HOST: Thank you so much, Erin.

That's really the huge problem for Jews all over the world, for Israel, that no matter how righteous what Israel is attempting to do in the face of these horrific barbaric attacks, the tide in the Arab Street, the tide among too many people in Europe elsewhere, in terms of how they view Israel today is not working to the Israelis advantage, even after this horrific attack.",

They were at the festival. They had been on vacation actually with their mother for three weeks in Mexico. They came back the night before because they were so excited to go to the festival.So they literally landed here in Tel Aviv at 11:00 PM. They got to use one of the family cars and they drove down together straight to go to the festival, the brother and sister. And during this conversation, Ilan, their father played for me and this is the first time he had played this call since he received it, he had not listened to it even though his phone recorded it, but he wanted everyone watching to hear it. He wanted them to hear the heartbreaking call from his daughter, from Maya as she and Itay were being kidnapped here is that moment.

They are not ruling anything out during the early portion of this investigation. In fact, the police chief just recently is saying, pleading for patience saying that this understandably raises some important questions, and he wants to give his investigators some time to examine every single aspect of it. Here is what we know at this point. Samantha Woll, according to the Isaac Agree Downtown Synagogue of Detroit found dead outside of her apartment this morning, not far from downtown Detroit. What homicide investigators have said so far, said she was stabbed multiple times. She was found unresponsive outside of her apartment. The blood trail that was located at the scene suggests that she was potentially attacked inside of her home. Meanwhile, there is a wealth of tributes right now there are pouring in regarding Samantha including from Michigan's own attorney general, Dana Nessel, writing on social media that \"Woll would often use her faith and also her activism to improve her community.\" And then there's also MoReno Taylor. I want you guys to hear a portion of our interview with him earlier today. He actually worked alongside Woll in the Nessel campaign. He fought back tears, as he told us a little bit about a friend that he called Sam. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So he is leaving open the possibility that we all would think right now, which is the sort of lone wolf or targeted attack against someone who's a leader in the Jewish community.We know last week, DHS and FBI said beware of the lone wolf phenomenon -- what we call the lone wolf phenomenon. There is no concern or sort of like a Hamas type of attack, it would be a targeted attack against an individual. We know the rise of anti-Semitism over the course of the last two weeks and then something as important why patience is being asked.
