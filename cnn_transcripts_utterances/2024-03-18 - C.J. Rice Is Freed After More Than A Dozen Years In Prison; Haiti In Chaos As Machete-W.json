I'm in Philly because there are major developments here and a legal case that we've been following for years here on THE LEAD involving C.J. Rice who is now a free man. As of this morning, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania officially considers C.J. Rice to be legally innocent of the crimes he was convicted of in 2013. District Attorney Larry Krasner dropped all charges and exonerated him today. Now, you might remember me talking about this case on CNN and in an \"Atlantic Magazine\" cover story in October 2022, C.J. Rice was sentenced to 30 to 60 years in prison, 30 to 60 years for 2011 shooting in which no one was seriously injured. I know about the case because my dad, Dr. Theodore Tapper, was C.J. Rice's pediatrician at the time and testified at court that it was medically impossible for C.J. Rice to have carried out this crime, shooting the victims and running away because C.J. Rice at that time was recovering from surgery since he had been shot three weeks before. And his pelvis had been shattered. He could barely walk at the time, much less run. Now it became clear from investigating this case for \"The Atlantic\" and CNN that C.J. Rice had an incompetent defense attorney. That court appointed counsel, Sandjai Weaver, who failed to bring up his medical records or pull his cell phone data that would have confirmed his alibi, who didn't challenge the complete concoction of conjecture that was the supposed motive for the shooting and on and on and on, bad decision after bad decision. Now after following C.J. Rice's case and fighting for C.J. Rice's conviction to be overturned for years with my father leading the way and an incredible legal team challenging the conviction, I am happy to report that cha was finally released from prison in December.

The D.A.'s office in deciding not to retry this case, did a very thorough reinvestigation, perhaps the investigation that should have been done from the beginning of this case. And it's important to note that it turned up no inculpatory evidence against C.J. And in fact, only lead to more exculpatory evidence. So, I think an important point to make here is that this isn't a case where we have a DNA profile proving scientifically that someone else committed this crime.

The prosecution has a responsibility and in many jurisdictions, they don't take it very seriously.And often evidence of innocence, exculpatory evidence is not uncovered until well after the trial, and that's just the fact of life and it's not the defendants full in many cases, there was some such evidence in this case as well. And the more you limit the ability to develop that evidence after the fact, the more innocent people spend their lives in jail or even worse and that's been the trend lately in our jurisprudence and it's -- it's very regrettable at a great cost I think.",

Putin said prisoner exchange negotiations that could have freed Navalny were underway before the opposition leader's death in an Arctic prison last month, one of several Putin opponents who just ended up dead. Meanwhile and unsurprisingly, Putin secured another six-year term, an election that the United States and European Union say was neither free nor fair.CNN's Matthew Chance reports now from Moscow as some brave Russians attempt to honor Navalny's last political wish, with courageous acts of protest. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN CHIEF GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Another flash of defiance in Russia's presidential vote. The opposition called this midday against Putin. Supporters gathering at polling stations across the country in a show of solidarity. It's what Alexei Navalny, Russia's late opposition leader, had urged before he suddenly died. Well, the Russian authorities say that anyone who attends an unauthorized protests will be dealt with severely, but you can see its just after 12:00 here in Moscow and a lot of people have turned out at this one polling station to cast their ballots. It's not a protest, but it is an indication of just how many people here are heeding Alexei Navalny's call. Why become now to cast your vote?",

In several polling stations, dye was poured into ballot boxes to ruin paper votes already cast. Across Russia, the number of voting centers were hit with arson attacks. But officials insist these deeply flawed presidential elections in which the opposition wasn't even allowed to stand were free and fair. Compared to the last presidential vote in 2018, we received one half as many complaints, Russia's chief human rights commissioner tells state television. I don't remember such active, deeply monitored elections here, she adds. But the defiance of some Russians it has also been exceptional, simmering discontent in the Kremlin's tightly controlled Russia briefly boiling up to the surface. (END VIDEOTAPE) CHANCE (on camera): Well, Jake, tonight, the newly re-elected Russian president has been attending an extravagant concert in Red Square in Moscow to mark a decade since Crimea was annexed from Ukraine. He took to the stage to a rapturous reception from a specially selected crowd. But independent election monitors here say the landslide election victory is just one failed to convey the real mood of Russians and to allow them to decide on Russia's future independently and freely.

This year's recipients are actress, director and advocate Eva Longoria, and retired Admiral Will McRaven.The award is given to people who make significant contributions to society and do so with decency. As head of Special Ops, you might know McRaven as having directed the 2011 raid by Navy SEALs that killed Osama bin Laden. He's also the former chancellor of the University of Texas. The award is generally -- the general is generally known, I'm sorry, the admiral is generally known for his work with veterans and families of service members since he left UT. He and Eva Longoria are each going to receive $50 million to give to the charities of their choice. Previous recipients include CNN's Van Jones and chef Jose Andres. They were the inaugural recipients of the prize in 2021, as well as singer and philanthropist Dolly Parton in 2022. Bezos and Sanchez did not give out the award last year. And joining us now is one of this year's recipients, retired Navy Admiral William McRaven. Admiral, Congratulations on the award. It's good to have you on. You said that you want to use the gift to focus on educating the children of veterans who were KIA, mental health for veterans, as well as other helping to develop future military leaders through education. Obviously, we frequently cover the military and veterans on THE LEAD. How will this award help those who serve? ADM. WILLIAM MCRAVEN (RET.), RECIPIENT OF 2024 BEZOS COURAGE AND CIVILITY AWARD: Yeah. Well, first, thanks for having me on Jake. I appreciate it. And this incredible gift from Lauren Sanchez and Jeff Bezos is going to go a long way towards helping veterans and their families. And as you point out, that while this is the early days of this award, I've just received last week, so were taking a hard look at what our options are going to be. But the two main areas we hope to focus on are in fact, the Gold Star children and educating Gold Star children, in particular. As you know, I've been working with the Special Operations Warrior Foundation for many years. My wife, Georgeann is on the board. And so I know the statistics when it comes to the nature of the fallen and the children and Special Operations community. Since 1980, we've lost over 1,300 killed in action or in training, and they've left behind around 1,700 children. And the Special Operations Warrior Foundation has already educated well over 500, but that that means we've got 1,100 still in the pipeline. So a portion of this money will certainly go towards helping with those children. And then well see how we can broaden that out to help the other Gold Star children as well. And then on the mental health issues. Now, frankly, the Veterans Administration, the military health care system and does a really good job of helping the active duty members and some of the retirees on mental health. But where there might be a gap, this is where I really want to focus some of these resources from this remarkable gift. TAPPER: Where might there be a gap?",

So you're probably aware, you know, as we -- as we look at the population of those that are in the case of the Special Operations community, breaches that are exposed to these blasts that we get from crank enough demolition artillery men, those that are exposed to these kind of micro concussions that happened as a matter of routine. I still don't think we quite understand completely the science behind that and the impact its having on some of our veterans.But we know of course that the veteran suicide rate is higher than the general population. And there's a lot of things that go into that. But I am concerned that some of these micro concussions and some of the blast victims from these kind of repeated blast, there might be an area there where we can focus some of that money as well as just brain performance. How do we help the veterans be smarter longer? We also work with the brain health project out of the University of Texas at Dallas and we want to put some of the money towards their efforts as well.",
