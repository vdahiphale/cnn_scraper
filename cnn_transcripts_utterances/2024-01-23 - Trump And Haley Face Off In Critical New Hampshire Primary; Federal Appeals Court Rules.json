We are live from London. It is Tuesday, January 23rd. I'm Richard Quest. In London, as elsewhere, I mean, business. Good evening. Right now in New Hampshire, votes are being cast in a crucial Republican primary contest. There are only two contenders remaining for the Republican side, Donald Trump and the former South Carolina governor, Nikki Haley, and she is looking to seize momentum ahead of next month. Meanwhile, the former president is trying to score a second blowout victory. Both candidates have spoken over the last few hours.

And that's what they see in him. They want him to be the person who effectively blows up our Washington political institutions. That's number one. Number two, immigration, still the biggest motivator for Republican voters, they see him as the strongest on immigration. So just sort of being that change agent or chaos agent, whatever you want to say it, plus his stance on immigration, that's got all of these Republicans coming to him. John is right, she needs undeclared voters to show up. I would just say ultimately, the Republican nomination will be decided by Republican voters in total and he is crushing among Republican voters.

So I think that it is important for more than one percent of the American people to have a chance to vote for president before we decide on a rematch of 2020. That doesn't seem very popular. I also say on the immigration front, Joe Biden and Democrats and Republicans in the Senate are working on a border security bill, which Donald Trump wants to scuttle because he really doesn't want to have the problem solved, he wants to demagogue it back to the presidency, so those sort of facts matter.

No one is denying, Richard, that a flood of weapons sometimes bought legally on the US side of the border, then find themselves brought illegally into Mexico. The question is how to stop that flood where it has become a very lucrative business of arming these cartels. You know, the majority of the weapons of the Mexican government says it finds in drug-related crime come from the US and more troubling in the last several days, they've said that they found US military grade weapons, weapons that are meant for the US military in the hands of cartels and how those weapons have ended up in Mexico is something of a mystery, whether they've come from third countries or there is some sort of black marketing ring going on here. But Mexico has called on the US to investigate this immediately, because often, this means that the cartels are simply better armed than the Mexican government, that the Mexican government, when it tries to bring the cartels to heal simply does not have the gun power to do so. And until they can bring this flood of weapons to a halt, then they can stem that flood of weapons, they simply don't have the hope of stopping either the drugs that flow north, or the massive amount of weapons that come back south into the hands of those cartels.",

Sky team, of course is one of the largest and it's getting even bigger this year. SAS, Scandinavian is moving over from Star Alliance as Air France KLM takes a hefty stake in the Scandinavian carrier. And then the reverse, the Italian Airline, ITA, is likely to make the opposite move, it's going to join Star once it's been acquired de facto by Lufthansa. In recent years, it's joint ventures that have grown more popular, the JVs, and arguably the global alliances have lost some of their shine. It leaves the aviation world just questioning what role they serve. Now, I realized that Patrick Roux, the CEO of SkyTeam, I've just suggested that the world is flat by asking what role does the alliances serve, but Patrick, what role do you serve now?",

We are in the process of extending that to digital tools, so that a customer, a Delta customer, that is traveling on Korean Air, for instance, can use his Delta app to check in, to track their bag, to select their seats to check the flight information on the Delta app.",

Something that is that is -- go againstyour plans, and here, the plans is really to go towards sustainability efforts that our members are really pursuing actively. And yes, that's an example where it will slow down this effort. So it's also the beauty of being part of a family because on sustainability, we are very active and we are building, we are launching exchanges of best practices among our members. We are running a friendly competition called the Sustainable Flight Challenge. That is really a way to test new ideas, to exchange those ideas, and to adopt those ideas and to accelerate the transition. It was 72 flights here, and a lot -- thousands of ideas were exchanged.",
