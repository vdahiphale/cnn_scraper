The report says Israel's actions have intentionally led to the forced mass displacement of Palestinians, which it describes as a widespread and systematic campaign that amounts to a war crime, crime against humanity and ethnic cleansing.As of last month, the U.N. estimates more than 90 percent of Gaza's Palestinian population have been displaced. According to the report, the majority of civilian infrastructure has been destroyed, leaving much of Gaza uninhabitable. Human Rights Watch says Israel's evacuation system has not just failed to keep Palestinians in Gaza safe, but instead put them in harm's way. The Israeli military is denying accusations in the report. Lebanese state media reports a third straight day of Israeli airstrikes in Beirut's southern suburbs. This comes one day after Israel's newly appointed defense minister says the country has expanded its military ground operation in southern Lebanon. Meantime, a new report from the International Organization for Migration finds that nearly 900,000 people have been displaced from their homes in Lebanon since last October when tensions first flared between Israel and Hezbollah. The wave of displacement has surged since late September. CNN's Nada Bashir joins us now live from London. Good morning to you Nada.

Of course, we've already seen hundreds of thousands of civilians displaced across Lebanon, particularly in the southern area. We have seen the destruction of civilian areas, residential areas in the south of historical areas across the country. So this is deeply troubling to hear that we are seeing an expansion despite efforts by members of the international community to push for a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon. And of course, all this comes as we continue to see air strikes targeting parts of the country's capital, Beirut, focused on those southern suburbs. For the third day in a row now, we have seen yet more Israeli air strikes targeting the southern suburbs, particularly the district of Burj al-Biraj, near the airport in Beirut. And as you mentioned, again, a huge displacement crisis not only in the south but across the country including in the capital where many have already fled their homes for their own protection. The Israeli military did say that it issued an evacuation order ahead of what it described imminent strikes in the southern suburbs. It is an area that is known to be a Hezbollah stronghold. The Israeli military maintains it is targeting Hezbollah infrastructure but important to underscore this is also a residential area crammed with residential buildings and high rise apartment blocks, so very troubling for the civilian population.",

(VIDEO PLAYING) The Dutch police arrested a number of pro-Palestinian protesters who defied a ban on holding rallies in Amsterdam on Wednesday. Their rally was peaceful but it followed several nights of clashes which came after attacks on Israeli soccer fans in the city last week. Tensions are also high in Paris where protesters rallied against a gala organized by a far-right Israeli group on Wednesday. Security is extremely tight around the national stadium there as France and Israel's soccer teams prepare to take on each other today. Well in the coming hours, thousands of officers will be deployed to ensure security in the city. CNN's Melissa Bell has the details from Paris. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MELISSA BELL, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: A huge police presence will be around the Stade de France here in Paris on Thursday to ensure that the planned match between Israel and France goes ahead as peacefully as possible. It had already been described as an event that was likely to attract tension, but the events of last week in Amsterdam, which saw more than 70 people arrested after a night of violence against Israeli fans in the Dutch capital, has led to renewed fears that these kind of sporting fixtures can become lightning rods for pro-Palestinian support, and possibly, as we saw in Amsterdam last week, tension and violence. That's why French authorities are taking no chances. 4,000 policemen and women but also more than a thousand stewards in the Stade de France. 20,000 tickets have been sold rather than the 80,000 that can normally be taken inside at that stadium and any pro-Palestine signs have been banned. The only signs will be allowed are either Israeli or France flags. The French authorities say that will be closely monitored. We saw earlier this week a basketball match in Greece attended by a Tel Aviv side where the fans had displayed large Free Palestine signs. That is the kind of expression of support that the French are keen to avoid this time. At the match also on Thursday will not only be the French president but two former presidents, Nicolas Sarkozy and Francois Hollande.

Want to check today's top stories for you?A new report by Human Rights Watch says Israel's actions in Gaza have intentionally led to the forced mass displacement of the majority of civilians in the enclave. It describes it as a widespread and systematic campaign that amounts to a war crime, crime against humanity and ethnic cleansing. The Israeli military is denying accusations in the report. Republicans have finally won enough seats to gain control of the U.S. House of Representatives. They captured the 218 seats needed to cross that threshold on Wednesday, even though a handful of races are still undecided. Democrats have won 208 seats, so the Republicans' majority remains razor thin. Both parties are expressing surprise at Donald Trump's pick of Matt Gaetz to be attorney general. The Florida Republican has now resigned his seat in Congress, effectively ending a House ethics committee investigation into alleged sexual misconduct. Gaetz denies any wrongdoing. CNN spoke earlier with former Trump White House attorney Ty Cobb about Matt Gaetz. Here's what he had to say about Trump's pick for attorney general. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But Matt Gaetz is just simply unqualified both academically, professionally, ethically, morally and experiential. He has no business being in this conversation he doesn't have any you know leadership is quite contrary I mean the one thing he did his famous for you got eight votes for -- out of his own party which was deposing Kevin McCarthy.You know when he walked into the White House when I was in the White House, you know, serious staffers you know throw red flags they look the other way and hope he wasn't there to visit him -- visit them. So this is not it this is just not a serious choice this is a choice that is contemptuous I think anybody who served in the Justice Department historically and most of the people that are there today, you know, are deeply saddened by this and that diminishes the pride that with which they associate themselves with the Department of Justice. Hopefully this will be a chapter that passes quickly. Hopefully it won't even get to a hearing. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Ukraine says air defenses intercepted two cruise missiles and two ballistic missiles, along with dozens of attack drones.And one man in the Kyiv region was wounded by falling debris. The city has endured nightly drone assaults for weeks. Residents fear a major attack could be expected, cripple Ukraine's damaged energy infrastructure even further ahead of winter. Well meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is reassuring allies that the Biden administration is doing all it can to support Ukraine before Donald Trump enters the White House. Blinken met with NATO's Secretary General in Brussels. He says the outgoing U.S. administration is working to ensure Ukraine gets the aid it's been promised so it can come to the negotiating table with Russia from a position of strength. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: We've obligated just recently and pushed out the door. Another $8 billion in security assistance for Ukraine, that was in September. Another almost half a billion dollars just a few weeks ago. And President Biden is committed to making sure that every dollar we have at our disposal will be pushed out the door between now and January 20th. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The experts who wrote it say global emissions from coal, oil and gas are all projected to increase. It comes as many expect 2024 to be the hottest year on record and experts say the trends show no sign of stopping. Meantime, Argentina is pulling itself out of the COP29 climate conference, where delegates are supposed to be working on those issues. President Javier Melei has recalled the country's delegates from the conference. That's according to a government source. It comes as he prepares to meet with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump later this week. World leaders are gathering in Peru where the annual APEC summit is getting underway, but diplomats say much of the focus will be on one person who's not even there, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who pledged to slap tariffs on both friends and foes. Experts say Beijing smells opportunity in Trump's election victory, and it will try to divide the U.S. and its allies while presenting itself as a more stable alternative to Washington. And for more, Marc Stewart joins us now live from Beijing. Good to see you again, Marc. So what is expected out of this APEC summit with China's growing influence in Latin America?",

Expect China to try to portray the message that it is very much open to discussion, diplomacy, and communication as well as stability.Because I think it is safe to say that Beijing is definitely having flashbacks to the first Trump administration when many diplomats here wonder what was coming next. You know despite some frosty moments between the United States, including the Biden administration, it's at a point now where there are regular diplomatic talks. We've seen Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen come to Beijing, as well as National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, and that there is room for common ground on issues such as control of fentanyl and climate change. It's a message that Beijing will certainly try to project this weekend, hoping that this incoming administration, which may likely be filled with China critics, to let them know that is an approach they certainly would like to see continue.
