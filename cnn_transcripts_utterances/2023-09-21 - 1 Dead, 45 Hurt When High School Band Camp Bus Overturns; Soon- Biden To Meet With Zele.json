And we now know, according to officials, that this bus was actually transporting a large group of students from Long Island, specifically coming from Farmingdale High School.According to that school district, it tells CNN that those students were on their way to band camp in Pennsylvania when just after 1 o'clock in the afternoon, their bus crashed. And these aerial pictures give you a dramatic look at the - what eventually took place there. You see that bus on its side in a wooded area just off of Interstate 84, I believe. Here's what we understand right now. Not only that those students were coming from Farmingdale High School, but they were heading to Greeley, Pennsylvania, which is typically about a 140-mile drive, when at one point that bus crashed, again, killing one person and injuring at least 45, according to local fire officials. The school district releasing a statement saying, \"That they were informed that there had been an accident with bus one en route to Greeley, Pennsylvania for band camp.\" Police and emergency responders on the scene, as well as district administration, the school district saying that they will be providing additional information as it becomes available. Obviously, there's still many questions here, including, of course, the cause of this accident, but also the severity of those individuals that were injured when this bus ended on its side there just off of the interstate. The result certainly is a massive scene that is still very active right now. In fact, a portion of Interstate 84, according to authorities, remains closed as authorities continue to work that scene, guys.",

You mentioned there were 45 people hurt, at least one dead. Do we have any other information from officials about who else might have been on board?

There's also some pretty large bushes.And when you're talking about a crash of this magnitude and we're talking about a bus where obviously you would expect that people may not be wearing seatbelts, there's going to be concern that some people and certainly some things will be ejected from the bus.

We - it certainly would not be surprising if we get to that point as the parents of these children, again, 45 people who were injured aboard that bus that was carrying students. As you can imagine, these parents will be desperate for answers and desperate to be reunited with their children. But again, as of this point, looking through some of our editorial, we do not know exactly where that is happening right now. The authorities are certainly, specifically the school district, is taking those steps to make sure that parents are informed and they can be - see their children again.",

And when you look at the geography there, it is certainly not as populated as perhaps you would find in New York City. So perhaps that may have led to a challenge there for authorities. But no, it is certainly a heavily wooded area there that authorities have to comb right now as they try to get to the bottom of what actually led to this crash. Boris? Brianna?",

Let's start with CNN's Kayla Tausche at the White House. Kayla, these two leaders have met several times by now. They are largely on the same page when it comes to countering Russia.

So far, it is not clear that Zelenskyy changed any minds in his meetings, especially when it comes to House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. He has been circumspect about putting more Ukraine funding on the floor of the House of Representatives.And after his meeting with Zelenskyy, I pressed him repeatedly on whether or not he would commit to putting $24 billion in a supplemental request from the White House on the floor of the House before the end of the year. And repeatedly, McCarthy dodged the question, saying that there were issues and priorities when it came to the U.S.'s spending that needed to be dealt with first. So a huge question right now of whether or not McCarthy will put that money on the floor of the House. And this is coming as McCarthy is trying to find a way forward with his Republican conference to avert a government shutdown. It also comes as House Republicans are expected to leave for the weekend, even though they were saying that they were going to work through the weekend. So, so far, no indication that any minds, or at least the minds that matter, were changed in that room. Boris?",

It's a very, very different reception that he received in the House today. And House Speaker Kevin McCarthy is being careful because those on his right flank have openly mocked the support for Ukraine. You had Matt Gaetz earlier this week tweeting a picture of McCarthy standing with his pin with the Ukraine flag and yellow and blue pocket square. And Matt Gaetz tweeted, how does this make you feel, basically arguing that this is probably going to enrage some on the far right.So that is why House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has been so careful, Brianna.",

In fact, they want to take Crimea back and long range weapons are critical for that. But at this point so far, the U.S. is not delivering on that. Can you explain to us why that is?

But what I've learned through my reporting is that the U.S. military has briefed the White House that what Ukraine needs most right now to be successful in the counteroffensive are vehicles, are mine clearing equipment, are the types of aid that will help them breach Russian defenses on the ground, and that they want to essentially prioritize that type of weaponry instead of, or perhaps in addition to in the future, sending those ATACMS.John Kirby, the spokesman for the NSC, has said that the review by government agencies on whether to send those deep strike missiles is still underway, that no decision has been made, but that it remains on the table. But for now, there is a belief within the administration, based on briefings from the U.S. military, that that is not what is most pressing at this exact moment in time.",

He's talked about this perception that's plaguing the Ukrainian leadership regarding corruption. And recently, Volodymyr Zelenskyy fired many of his deputy defense ministers.

They have to deal with these things to move forward with that. The Ukrainian people, 77 percent of them hold Zelenskyy responsible for ongoing corruption in Ukraine. They want change. Zelenskyy wants change. There will be change, but not always at the pace that I think all of us want, because it's like trying to fix the airplane while it's in flight.

Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser to that end, told reporters today that the $24 billion request that the White House has made essentially would sustain the war from the end of September, the end of the government's fiscal year, through the end of the calendar year, but that the administration has already begun conversations with Congress to talk about what would be needed after that and what the U.S. government's assessment is about how much aid Ukraine could need to sustain the war beyond the end of this year.And so some of those conversations are already happening, but there's also an acknowledgement that war is unpredictable, and they don't know exactly what the state of play on the ground will be at that time and what Ukraine's needs will be, and that that conversation will have to evolve, even as it's one that they're trying to anticipate right now.",
