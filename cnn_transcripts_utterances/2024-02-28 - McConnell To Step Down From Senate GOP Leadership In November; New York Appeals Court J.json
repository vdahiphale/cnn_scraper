But what the judge said is that Trump will have to come up with this money. He has about until essentially the end of March to do this. And -- but what the judge also said is that Trump is this one of the bans that was Trump is facing was that he couldn't take out any loans from any New York financial institution or any financial institution that was overseen by New York regulators, which is essentially a large swath of the global banking system. So the judge here saying that Trump can apply for loans because that was one of the arguments Trumps team has made. They said that to satisfy this judgment, to come up with that much money in cash, they might need to get alone or to sell property, but they said they were prohibited under this judge's order from accessing the banking system, from going and say taking out a loan against Mar-a-Lago or one of the golf properties. So the appeals court judge is now saying they can go ahead and access the capital markets. They can try to get loans in order to satisfy the judgment because what one of the arguments Trump team's made also is that even get a bond of this amount of money, the people that underwrite these bonds want cash. And that is why they need access to markets. So Trump is going to have to come up with this money, but now, he's able -- he's given more ways to try to do that short of selling as property. Of course, big question is, will he be able to get someone to underwrite this bond? Will he be able to get access to the markets? Will someone read them alone? That all remains to be seen, but the clock here is ticking briefs in this case when they will take this to the full appeals court panel are due by the end of the month and that is also around the same time that this judgment is due, which is also right when Trump is going to be sitting for jury selection in the criminal hush money case on March 25th, Jake.",

Now percentage-wise, that's not extraordinary event in Michigan. In 2012, 11 percent of Michigan Democrats voted uncommitted when President Obama was on the ticket, but viewed as a total number. This is a cause for alarm, generally, 20,000 Democrats can be relied upon to vote uncommitted, every Michigan presidential primary. This was five times that, more than 100,000 Democrats. And that's enough to swing that battleground state. Additionally, most voters in the predominantly Arab American Michigan city of Dearborn voted uncommitted.

But these text messages are in stark contrast to the tone in his testimony. It revealed months of communication.We reviewed all 413 messages between Bradley and Ashleigh Merchant. Not only does it show that they've been communicating or that they work for months, but it also shows that Bradley is appearing to assist Merchant as she was scrambling to find evidence for her bombshell allegation in her effort to disqualify Fani Willis. Bradley was supposed to be the star witness for defense attorneys, but he was really not so easy to get information out of. But during these text messages, he was very chatty with Ashleigh Merchant. And in one of these text messages, Merchant says, do you think -- talking about the relationship -- do you think it started before she hired him? He responds absolutely. Now, we should say that Bradley, during his testimony said that he was only speculating what he responded absolutely. Other text messages, though reveal a very cordial relationship between Merchant and Bradley. In fact, he refers to Ashleigh Merchant at one point as a friend. I'll read part of that text message here now, saying: It is my hope that they do the right thing before then. You are my friend, Bradley says, and I trust you, they will not. They're arrogant as F. She thinks she won the other day when she didn't have to be deposed. So these text messages just really reveal a much different picture, a much different tone from what we saw from Bradley during his testimony. And as we understand it, Jake, there are currently being reviewed by Judge Scott McAfee as whether he's going to introduce this into evidence. Tuesday's hearing didn't end with a damaging testimony the defense attorneys thought they would get, but now, these text messages are being considered as evidenced in the case -- Jake.",

Now, these texts as Nic just laid out, they're recent. They're from January. They're from last month and in the texts, Mr. Bradley is telling the lawyers for the defendant, the people who are challenging the D.A. absolutely this relationship started before Mr. Wade was hired and he's giving them specific details. Here's when it started. Here's this specific legal conference where they met, where they started, and then yesterday, Mr. Bradley gets on the stand and all we hear is I don't recall. Not at all plausible when he's giving them details a month ago and that's speculation. I'm sorry. It's not speculation when you're giving specific details.

On the one hand, I could see the judge saying, I find the D.A.'s story that this relationship only started after Mr. Wade was hired to be non- believable, non-credible. The text messages certainly undermine that. There have been cell phone records that undermine that, or I can see the judge saying, look, there's a lot of question about this.
