Show of hands? Anyone? Yeah, I did not think so. But tonight, sources tell CNN that the now former Speaker McCarthy was behind the interim Speaker Patrick McHenry's move to kick former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi out of her office space. It's things like this that drive voters crazy. You're telling me that within hours of throwing out a speaker, with no clear succession plan, 44 days away from yet another manufactured government shutdown with concerns over the economy looming, the border, national security, funding for Ukraine, with all of that, that was the priority. See, this is what we call the disconnect. Shouldn't the first priority be, well, to function? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN.

That is -- I remember when John Boehner had run into these problems in 2011, 2012, 2013. He and I would speak about the problem that he faced, which was that he had a group of people in his caucus who were making it virtually impossible to govern. When he left in 2015, a lot of people asked me, well, that's going to change, right, with Ryan? It doesn't change. There's an endemic problem. And I think whether it's Mr. Scalise or whether it's Mr. Jordan or someone else, they're still going to have to face a continuing resolution. In the middle of November, they're still going to have to pass appropriation bills. And because it's divided government, they're going to have to deal with Democrats.

This has made inestimably more difficult than Mr. Boehner had or Miss Pelosi had in her first term because they only have a five-seat margin. And so, taking vengeance on these eight people is operationally going to make life very, very difficult. I realized the anger. You know, one of the things that you say in Capitol Hill is everybody wants leadership but nobody wants to be led. And I think that's one of the problems that the Republican majority is going to face. They somehow are going to have to select a leader who can come back and get 218 votes, maybe get some Democrats to participate in supporting legislation. But they're not going do that if they are constantly being held at the mercy of people who are demanding 15, 20% cuts below what they already agreed to.

It's coming down in many respects to not just the policy considerations, but it sounded like they didn't trust McCarthy, Democrats or Republicans.In fact, let me just -- some of the complaints about McCarthy from Democrats include that he accused Democrats of wanting the shutdown after they voted to avoid the shutdown, that he gave Democrats 30 minutes to review short-term spending bills. They reversed the decision about holding a vote for an impeachment inquiry or as he called it, an inquiry. He made a deal with Biden on debt limit that he backed out. He helped craft the microchip bill, then whipped his party to vote against it. He delivered votes for COVID relief, then he criticized it and worked against the creation of January 6th Committee. So, you've got what those eight Republicans are talking about. He's accusing Democrats of being problematic in all this and not supporting him. Maybe that's why he's going after Pelosi in the office.

When the Democrats won control in 2006, she offered the outgoing speaker, Mr. Hastert, a room in the Capitol, a very nice room, I might add, to use as his office until he decided that he was going to leave. That's usually not a problem because most speakers leave after they've left their term as speaker.And so, Mrs. Pelosi was given that same courtesy by Speaker McCarthy when she left the speakership in 2021 and 2023, and she has been occupying that office. I think that the -- and by the way, they not only threw out Mrs. Pelosi but threw out Steny Hoyer, the majority leader as well, who is known as a very collaborative person who worked very closely with Republican leaders both in the majority and in the minority. My feeling about this is, you know, Nancy Pelosi, her reaction to losing her office, I'm sure, is going to be what she used to when people would ask her, how do you feel about this situation? It's not a big deal for her, I'm sure. What it is, is an enormous missed opportunity. Here you had a new person come in. The dust has somewhat settled from yesterday. McHenry is not going to be the speaker long term and all like that. He could have come in with no risk to himself and said, why don't we start off just as a reset? Why don't we try to start talking to each other and find some symbolic way of getting people into the room and figuring out something that will restore people's confidence in the system and restore people's confidence in the Congress? And instead, you take what I would feel is just sort of the cheap shot to go after Mrs. Pelosi -- as you say, she wasn't even there, she was in Senator Feinstein's funeral -- and start off with an adversarial act that I think is naturally going to only inflame passions.

And it encourages you to take risks if you believe that the math can justify the risk. I won't get too nerdy here, Laura, but in the philosophical community that Sam has kind of aligned with himself with, which is called effective altruism, there is this belief in what's called expected value.

And the question was, will we keep flipping the coin? And the answer is Sam said, according to the math, he'll keep flipping that coin for forever.This case is essentially a coin flip. Sam, it's not a coin flip oddswise. It's not like Sam is going to, you know, has a 50% chance of winning this case. But Sam is essentially betting that if he flips the coin 12 times, there are 12 jurors in this case, can he get one heads or one tails? Can he only convince one juror that he is innocent? And if you think about it that way, it's like, oh, yeah, sure, why not go to trial? Obviously, the preponderance of evidence against him is astounding. You know, hearing prosecutors outline their case today. It was overwhelming.
