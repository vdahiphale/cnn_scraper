And then finally, why give this permission with apparent restrictions that the Ukrainians are apparently only allowed to fire within the Kursk region where it just reported that those 10,000 Russian troops are and 1,000 or so North Korean troops.

I mean, this began with a wave of arrests in January of 2021 targeting the participants in what was an unofficial PR that was held the previous year, 2020, in anticipation of what were supposed to be elections for the city's legislature, which were then postponed.So the participants in this and the organizers were all swept up in police raids in January of 2021. And the prosecutors successfully succeeded in getting convictions on almost all of the so called Hong Kong 47, saying that this primary election amounted to a plot to paralyze the government and undermine state power, that it was a quote, conspiracy to commit subversion. And so what we've seen is that most of these defendants who have been behind bars awaiting trial and awaiting now sentencing for close to four years, they then received sentences from a panel of three judges appointed by the Hong Kong government, no jury in this case. They received sentences ranging from more than four years and up to 10 years. And that longer sentence was given to Benny Tai, a legal scholar, former professor at Hong Kong University and opposition leader who was described as a mastermind of this alleged plot. As you mentioned, Joshua Wong, who was a young student protester involved in many sit ins, a real thorn in the side of the Hong Kong authorities and of the national government in Beijing. He received a sentence of more than four years. And as he left the courtroom when the session was adjourned, he was heard yelling, I love Hong Kong. Excuse me. The arrest of these individuals basically was a real turning point. It came after a controversial national security law was imposed on this former British colony and it all but crushed a vibrant kind of political culture of different views that had been tolerated and in fact endorsed by this city's mini constitution.

That's as the State Department says. It's heard back now from both Israel and Lebanese officials about their efforts to broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. What we're hearing from Israeli officials is that things are moving in a positive direction. But they say that they need to take direct action, have a full operational freedom is how they describe it. And that appears to imply that they need the ability and want the ability in the terms of what they will agree to. And it's important to them. They say that they have the right to fire back if the terms of the ceasefire are violated. Now, Hezbollah has made their response through Lebanese officials, but both the Lebanese prime minister and the speaker of the Lebanese parliament both had a degree of oversight of the U.S. proposal that's been passed onwards to Hezbollah. They say they're not aware of this sort of language, precise language, indicating that Israel would have the right to strike back if the cease fire terms were violated. So that appears to be a gap between the two sides. But this is something that State Department officials say that they are working towards resolving, trying to find a way, and they're putting a lot of energy into it to bring about that cease fire.

And of course, the smoke from those nearby farm fires.But how does the level of toxic smog right now compare to what you've seen in recent years? DR.

KUMAR: so one of the first things I believe needs to be done is to raise the awareness amongst the masses that number one, although the levels go much higher the optical quality of air goes really bad during the October, November, December months. But pollution is a round-the-year problem and it's not just an environment or a chemical issue. It's a major health issue with serious health effects on everyone who breathes but pregnant women, children, elderly and those with co-existing diseases being the worst affected. So the Doctors for Clean Air is a countrywide group of doctors who are using their power as powerful messengers to convey to the masses that air pollution is a health issue and we all need to collectively tackle it on a war footing.",

KUMAR: so one of the first things we are requesting people is to not move out of their houses, number one. Not to do any outdoor exercises. You know, it's a very common thing for people to go to parks in the morning, run, jog and do all kinds of exercises. So we are asking people not to do that. Those who are already on medications may need increase in dosages. We are advising them to connect with doctors and then increase accordingly. Those who are developing fresh symptoms we are requesting them not to do self-medication, but to connect with doctors. Those who have bad diseases. We are now making efforts to have them in the hospital and adequately treated. These are all responses to the disease burden, which is coming. More importantly, we are advising people to wear N95 masks should they really need to go out of the house, because that is the only thing which provides effective pollution -- protection against the particulate matter.",

But that didn't stop burglars from breaking into Windsor Castle grounds.Police say thieves entered a farm building on the Crown Estate land late on Sunday, October the 13th, stealing a pickup truck and a quad bike before making their escape. The farm just minutes away from Windsor Castle and from Adelaide Cottage, where the Prince and Princess of Wales have a family home, and they were likely there that night. There's no indication that the royal family was targeted or ever in any danger, but the incident does show another security breach surrounding the royals. Kate and William live on the estate in a cottage during school term time with their children. And they don't live with any staff. So it does raise questions. And for their part, Kensington and Buckingham Palace both say they don't comment on security matters. The break-in just days before King Charles and Queen Camilla's long flight to visit Australia and Samoa. The couple weren't at Windsor when the break-in took place. Incidents like this aren't new, and this one certainly not the most serious. In 2021, a man broke into Windsor Castle itself wearing a mask and armed with this weapon, a crossbow. The 19-year-old was hoping to kill Queen Elizabeth II, but he was stopped before he could harm her. Still, the incident raising serious concerns about security around the royal family.

Well, Friday's bout between Jake Paul and Mike Tyson was by no means boxing's greatest match, but Netflix says it was a record-breaking night for the company.

This was a really significant moment that people gathered to watch.And that's the kind of thing that Netflix is really trying to get people to do here as it looks to be a replacement for cable television. I do think for Netflix, the big question is, can it continue to host these live events without some of the kinds of glitches that we saw during this fight on Friday? You know I myself had to reload Netflix a couple of times to get these buffering issues to end. Lots of people reported the stream was paused. And you can imagine some unhappy customers if people paid for Netflix specifically to be able to watch this fight and then couldn't watch the whole thing because of these technical issues. I think that is what Netflix is going to have to get under control here as it continues to invest in live events. I mean, looking forward for the company. Its planning to host two Christmas day NFL events live. One of them, Beyonce, will be performing the halftime show. The company doesn't want to have upset customers who weren't able to watch Beyonce because of technical issues. And Netflix did acknowledge this about Friday's fight. It said that this was a mega event and that it's buffering systems were on the ropes essentially, it sounds like it didn't have the computing power and it didn't correctly anticipate the number of people that would be would be watching. And so I think as Netflix looks forward to this being a monetization opportunity, first, it has to get these technical issues under control. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
