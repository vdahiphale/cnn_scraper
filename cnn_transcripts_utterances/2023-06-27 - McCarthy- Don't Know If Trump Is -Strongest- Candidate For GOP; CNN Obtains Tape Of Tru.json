Are you surprised to hear the Speaker raise any doubts about the former president and his ability to be the president again if he's the nominee? REP. TIM BURCHETT (R-TN), FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE: No, I've been in those situations. You're thinking about something else and you're asked a totally different question. And so, I still think Kevin McCarthy is firmly in the Trump camp and he knows that President Trump helped him get where he is. And I suspect -- and one thing you can say about Kevin McCarthy is he's loyal to a fault. And these advisers, they're always just trying to stir something up anyway, so they can justify their humongous paychecks, which most of them are overpaid. And so, you know, I've been seen that many times, so I just don't put a whole lot of faith in that.
