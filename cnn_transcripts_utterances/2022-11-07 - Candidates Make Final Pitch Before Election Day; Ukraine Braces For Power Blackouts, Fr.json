The candidates are now making their final pitch ahead of Election Day up for grabs, all 435 House seats and 35 of the 100 Senate seats. The outcome of this election will determine who controls Congress. And while Democrats currently hold a slim majority, it remains unclear if they'll be able to hang on to power especially in the House. That's where race ratings by inside elections shows Republicans appear to have the advantage heading into Tuesday.Well, the party needs 218 seats to control the chamber. And with 20 seats rated as a toss up. Republicans would only need to win a few of those to take back control but in the Senate control still appears up for grabs of the 35 seats on the ballot only three are considered a toss up and those key races in Nevada, Georgia and Pennsylvania may end up determining which party will lead the Senate. Well for voters the key issue remains the state of the U.S. economy. According to a recent CNN survey, 51 percent of likely voters said that was their top priority far greater than any other issue. But those numbers are divided along party lines. According to the polls, 71 percent of Republicans called the economy their top concern, while 53 percent of independence and 27 percent of Democrats set the same while the polls also show partisan divisions on other issues, including abortion, which resonates strongly with Democrats and immigration, which Republicans consider a more pressing matter which. So much at stake, Americans have been rushing to the polls and force for early voting. So far, more than 40 million people have already voted across 47 states. Georgia alone recorded about two and a half million pre-election ballots. That's a midterm record and far higher than the numbers from 2018. Traditionally more Democrats vote early. But a former Atlanta mayor says the turnout is no guarantee of a Democrat win. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

What is most top of mind, obviously, is inflation, gas prices, the economic uncertainty, fears that the nation has headed toward a recession.And so that has just been the absolute dominant issue, which is not what we thought earlier this summer when it seemed as though, you know, abortion was going to play a much larger role in this election. But it's all those economic issues, that frustration with Washington, the feeling that no one is doing anything to help them.

And when I was out there talking to people about those initiatives, that just what -- they just felt that that had not helped them, and their families enough going into this year, and so a lot of them are just looking for change. Even the mention of the Inflation Reduction Act, the Democrats passed this year, would sometimes draw like laughter from voters that I talked to saying like what's been reduced, I'm still paying $5 a gallon for gas and I'm having to cut all of these things from my life.

And they're such an important swing vote in states like Arizona, Pennsylvania, Nevada.But a lot of the women that I've talked to feel conflicted. They don't like the direction that the Republican Party has taken on abortion. They see the laws that have been passed in a lot of red states as being much too restrictive. And at the same time, you know, they want change and think that Republicans potentially would do a better job on some of these economic issues.

I'm Laila Harrak and you're watching CNN NEWSROOM.The midterm elections are looming large in the U.S. with just one day to go until voters across the country cast their ballots. The vote will determine who will control Congress and who will lead more than two dozen states. All 435 House seats and 35 of the 100 senate seats are up for grabs. While Democrats currently hold a slim majority it remains unclear if they'll be able to hang on to power. And addition, 36 states will be electing governors. Candidates in crucial contests have ramped up their campaigning in the lead up to Tuesday's election, in an effort to sway undecided voters and get their base to the polls. And they've been getting some help. As president Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump both hit the campaign trail in a final push ahead of the critical vote. Already, some states have seen a huge turnout in early voting. According to data from election officials, more than 40 million preelection ballots have been cast in 47 states. Meantime, former President Donald Trump and state governor Ron DeSantis hold competing rallies in Florida. Mr. Trump, who's campaigning for state Senator Marco Rubio, once again pushed his false election claims. CNN's Kristen Holmes has the latest from Miami. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: In the final days before the midterms, former President Donald Trump delivered a dark message during a rally with Senator Marco Rubio in Miami. The president focused on crime, particularly crime committed by illegal immigrants, drug dealers, murder, death. But all of that dark messaging similar to what we saw when he ran for president in 2016, resonated with his supporters. Supporters stood cheering for him, even as a torrential downpour started outside of the rally. Perhaps the most surprising remarks that came from former President Trump were those in support of Senator Marco Rubio. He praised the senator. Usually during these rallies, he focuses much more on himself and his political future. However, he heaped praise on Rubio there. Now one person who is noticeably missing among top elite Florida Republicans was Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. He was not invited by former President Donald Trump to this rally. DeSantis is largely considered Trump's most formidable opponent in 2024, should both of them run for president. As we reported last week, former President Trump is likely to announce in the two weeks between the midterm elections and Thanksgiving. That's when he's eyeing announcing a third presidential run.
