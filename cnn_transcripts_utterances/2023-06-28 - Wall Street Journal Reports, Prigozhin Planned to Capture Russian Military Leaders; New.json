Possible, you might think, but it does not really tally with the fact that we saw Surovikin on television quite quickly telling everyone to go home, telling Wagner not to get involved in this. That's odd. Now, some suggest in The New York Times that his body language may have suggested he wasn't particularly comfortable. Frankly, I can't imagine anyone being comfortable in that particular time. Also, too, Surovikin head to the Air Force, which did a lot of the bid to resist Wagner's advance. This is also clearly, true or not, aimed at trying to get Russian generals to turn on each other and to make the job of Ukraine's forces easier by sowing further disarray in Russia's already catastrophically managed invasion here.

He can be prosecuted for tax evasion, which, as Henry Kissinger once said, has the added benefit of actually being the truth. It doesn't even need to be made up.

We had a lot of papers, a lot of paper stacked up. In fact, you could hear the rustle of the paper. And nobody said I did anything wrong other than the fake news, which, of course, is Fox, too.

Because the notable thing about that is that we know that prosecutors asked not only for the original documents that may have been in Donald Trump's possession but also copies of those documents. And the Trump campaign told us that they believed they were political plans.But then later, when Donald Trump was on his plane traveling from New Hampshire, leaving his campaign stop, he told reporters that he was referring to building plans and plans for a golf course. And then he added that there was no document. And so it's just very interesting to point out, because as we've been covering this for weeks now, and after the news of the indictment, he's had different responses to what exactly had happened. I remember when I was covering him following his arraignment in Florida, when he went back to his Bedminster Golf Club in New Jersey, he said that, essentially, he was entitled to taking documents with him. He later told Fox News and then reporters yesterday that he didn't have any documents at all. And so I think this is something that prosecutors are tracking very closely and seeing how he's responding to this and also using it to determine the intent that may have been there if he had these classified documents, John.",

This is part of the special counsel's investigation into Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election.And also on that front, the special counsel, Jack Smith, is set to interview today Georgia's Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. Here with me now for more on quite a bit of this, Nick Akerman. He's a former assistant U.S. attorney of the Southern District of New York and former assistant special Watergate prosecutor. So, Nick, let's start on this exclusive reporting that Rudy Giuliani has spoken to investigators in the elections probe, if I want to shorthand it that way. Our CNN's reporting, as my colleagues say, that some sources say that some of the grand jury questioning in that investigation has centered on the actions of people around Donald Trump, not just Donald Trump, and that includes Rudy Giuliani. So, him going into to speak to investigators now says what to you? NICK AKERMAN, FORMER ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK:  Well, it says to me that he is certainly a subject of the investigation, if not a target at this point. I mean, he was there with Donald Trump on January 6th at The Ellipse. He was dealing with people in the war room that Steve Bannon was in charge of at the Willard Hotel, where Roger Stone appeared, where General Flynn appeared. Basically, all of the people that were there were either people that Donald Trump had given pardons to or people who had asked for pardons. So, these were people, also like Stone and Flynn, who were dealing with the Oath Keepers, the Proud Boys. So, of course, the Justice Department is going to be interested in getting to the bottom of what Giuliani's role was in this. Certainly, he was also out there with the fake electors. He was dealing with Georgia legislators, other legislators, trying to get state legislatures in the battleground states to essentially change the vote for Donald Trump from Joe Biden. So, I don't think he could have talked too much. I mean, I think whatever he said would be used against him. He went in with a lawyer. And my sense is that he was very careful about what he said. And I would bet anything that most of the talking was done by his lawyer. On the classified documents case, the reaction from Donald Trump now, as John Berman was just discussing, is that he maintains now that he's done nothing wrong, even after this audio recording has now come out. This kind of gets to -- my question is kind of on the narrative front. We know prosecutors look at every -- we are going to look at everything and every statement that's made it publicly and privately they have access to. But what is the narrative that you see now that Donald Trump and his legal team may be trying to paint around all of this?",

The New York Times has some more reporting about that property, and it's that investigators, they considered looking -- seeking a search warrant for it. And here's part of their reporting. In it, it says, investigators were concerned that more documents were stashed at the club, and the only way to account for them was to search the property.But one of the people said that the Justice Department lacked probable cause to obtain a warrant from a judge.

I've done 40, 50 search warrants as a prosecutor. The big hurdle always is having current information that the evidence of the crime exists on the property.And here, it was like a year before the search at Mar-a-Lago that they knew that he had this document relating to Iran, that he had a map that he showed to people, but there was no current information that it existed at that time when they did the search warrant at Mar-a-Lago. So, I would bet dollars to donuts that there are lots of classified documents still at Bedminster. The problem is that there is no probable cause that the government can come up with. There's no insider like there was at Mar-a-Lago, who basically laid out for them exactly what happened with the documents.",
