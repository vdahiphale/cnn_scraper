      "sentences": "Hello and welcome to CNN \"Newsroom\", I'm Max Foster in London. Just ahead Turkey's Presidential election appears heading for a runoff first. Longtime President Recep Tayyip Erdogan looks unlikely to secure an outright majority of the vote. We'll have a live report from Istanbul. Ukraine's President makes a surprise stop in the U.K. after a series of visits with other European allies.A look at what he is discussing with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. And one of the strongest cyclone to ever hit Myanmar cuts communications in coastal areas. It leaves millions leaving out. The ballots are still being counted but Turkey's most consequential Presidential election in decades appears to be heading for a runoff. Preliminary results show Recep Tayyip Erdogan the increasingly authoritarian leader who's ruled his country for 20 years is leaving, but he's just below the 50 percent threshold needed to secure now, an outright victory. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh joins me now live in Istanbul. So this is probably going to run off. Where does that leave the two contenders here?",

      "sentences": "Well, you know, that's what it looks like at this point, Max, the electoral board saying that they've counted more than 99 percent of the ballots that were cast. And so far, they have President Erdogan of 49.40 percent, followed by Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the opposition's candidate of 44.96 percent.So the most likely scenario here with neither of them, especially if you look at President Erdogan's number, not achieving that 50 + 1 that was required to win the Presidency. It is most likely headed to a runoff in about two weeks' time on May the 28th. And we've heard from both sides saying that they are ready for this. The opposition just a short time ago, the main opposition party, the CHP coming out and saying that they are ready for this runoff, as we heard from their leader yesterday as well. But if this is the will of the Turkish people, they are ready for this, but they're also trying to continue to sound hopeful and optimistic. But this no doubt, Max, has been a big blow for an opposition that for the first time came together under this unified banner of a coalition of the people that they were presenting one candidate to try and unseat President Erdogan. And there was really this feeling that they might have that chance of doing so. And they were promising people change, they were promising to take this country back to being a real democracy, trying to reverse years of President or the wands rule. And you had a lot of people who were really optimistic about this coalition seeing they unified, seeing them more galvanized than ever. And right now, a lot of people are disappointed. And on the other side, you've got President Erdogan, who is not used to losing 20 plus years of being at the top. And you know, while he hasn't secured that 50 percent, while this is a likely scenario where it is heading towards a runoff, but again, they're still counting the rest of the ballots. This for President Erdogan as well is when, Max, because if you look at the situation in this country, you look at how unhappy many Turks have been with his leadership. There was a lot of speculation that this might be it, this might be Erdogan's last stand, as many heads described it, but he has managed to emerge from this. At this point pretty much unscathed, despite the state of the economy that is blamed on his policies, despite the criticism that he and his government got following that devastating earthquake with the disastrous initial rescue response to that and the lack of preparedness. You still look at these numbers, and he still has the support of about 50 percent of the country and what these results do tell us, Max, is what we've always known that this is a really divided country, and it's really a reflection of the polarization in Turkey.",

But you'll remember when he came back in February, he made this elaborate pitch, he presented a helmet of Ukrainian fighter pilot to the Speaker of the House of Commons calling for wings.He said, for freedom. He wants these fighter jets. He still doesn't have them. But he was asked about this today. And he said that he expects some very important decisions in the closest time. We know that Ukraine had originally been offered Typhoon training by the U.K. They have apparently backed away from that request and enough focusing on F-16s, which of course the U.K. does not have but the U.K. has pledged to help push for that to work with international partners and allies so that Ukraine can eventually get these NATO standard American built jets. So that was one thing, I think you can see how urgent this is. Now, obviously, you hear him there. It seems like the counter offensive is imminent. This was 2.5, 4 countries in 2.5 days, much less pomp and circumstance and ceremony than we've seen on previous tours. He really needs these weapons. He made that very clear. And this was also I think Max, about guarding against war fatigue, both inside Ukraine, and among the Allies, where we are seeing that creeping into political discussions. You saw him really it was a public thank you to the people of the U.K. whose tax dollars are paying for these weapons.",

Other countries, it's not just F-16s, but that is what they're focusing on mainly. And I think this is where we see the same kind of decision making the same kind of calculations that come in to all these new weapons platforms that Ukraine get.It's not necessarily so much about antagonizing Moscow nowadays, it's about the logistics. This is like the NATO Secretary General said a war of logistics. You can't just throw a new capability onto the battlefield and expect them to be able to manage it. This is why we're seeing training. This is another thing that we learned today the U.K. is going to start training Ukrainian fighter pilots this summer. So pretty soon, we're seeing some training going on and other countries as well. They have to do that first. And I think you know, at some point the Jets will follow.",

There was a now function of a technical malfunction of a missile that was fired in the direction of Israel.The Israelis fired back at some positions, apparently one affiliated with Hamas. But by and large, as you can see, behind me, life is back to normal. You saw the schools are back in session. They were off the entire time during the five day round of violence. Now, we've been driving around the Gaza Strip today, what we saw is that people are in those areas where there were airstrikes. They basically are trying to put their lives back together. And what's interesting is that we went to several locations where there were direct hits on homes, the assumption is somehow affiliated with Islamic Jihad. But the result was that in all the houses around those buildings, there was a lot of damage being done. And there's a lot of anger among people who really are just caught in the middle in this conflict. We spoke to one man who showed us all the damage that was done to his house. And he said the only thing he had received was a bag of rice and sugar, and other foodstuffs and he threw it on the ground. And he said how I am going to rebuild my house with 30 shekels or about $8 worth of groceries. So there's a lot of anger and resentment about the level of destruction that's been done here. And the fact that by and large, people are getting small handouts of aid, but in terms of rebuilding their damaged or destroyed homes, that help is not coming, Max.",

Turkey saw inflation hit 85 percent in October, and the devastating earthquake that hit the south of the country in February cause billions of dollars in damage of course.
