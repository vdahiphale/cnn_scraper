And a new CNN investigation shows how Russia keeps a constant supply of deadly drones. Plus, South Korea has impeached its acting president less than two weeks into his job. Following new details then into the investigation of a deadly Christmas Day plane crash in Kazakhstan, a U.S. official tells CNN that early indications suggest a Russian anti-aircraft system may have downed the Azerbaijani passenger jet, killing at least 38 people. The source says it may have been a case of mistaken identity in which poorly trained Russian units fired negligently against what they thought were Ukrainian drones. The airline carrier isn`t being as direct in its assessment. It says preliminary investigations have found the disaster occurred, quote, \"as a result of physical and technical external interference.\" That`s according to Azerbaijan state media. CNN`s Brianna Golodryga has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BIANNA GOLODRYGA, CNN SENIOR GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST (voice-over): As investigators race to determine the cause of the deadly Azerbaijan Airlines plane crash, early indications suggest that a Russian anti-aircraft system may be responsible, a U.S. official told CNN. The aircraft was traveling from the Azerbaijani capital of Baku to the Russian Republic of Chechnya when it attempted an emergency landing in Kazakhstan. The crash occurred shortly after Ukraine fired drones nearby at southern Russia, possibly leading Russia`s defense systems to inadvertently strike the aircraft, the official said. Video from on board the flight shows panicked passengers praying and holes visible in the body of the aircraft. The source of the apparent damage has not been confirmed. The airline and Russia`s Federal Air Transport Agency initially told local media the aircraft crashed after it collided with a flock of birds, an account disputed by Ukrainian counter-disinformation official Andriy Kovalenko. Russian state media also reported that the plane had been rerouted due to heavy fog around Chechnya`s capital. Several investigations have been opened, including one by a joint commission involving representatives from Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Russia. ILHAM ALIYEV, AZERBAIJAN PRESIDENT (through translator): The commission`s task is to fully investigate the matter, the causes and all the details of the accident and to inform both me and the people of Azerbaijan.",

But in order for the formal impeachment process to actually end, a constitutional court ruling upholding this decision is required. But critically, and this is the problem facing South Korea right now, they don`t have enough judges within the constitutional court to issue such a ruling. And actually it`s the job of the acting president Han to fill those vacant spots. But he`s refused to do so, which has led to this political deadlock we`re currently seeing in the country.

      "sentences": "Well, Donald Trump`s fixation this week over wanting to take control over the Panama Canal as well as the revivalof his desire to purchase Greenland, a Danish territory, is really part of a larger negotiating tactic, I`m told. One Trump adviser told me his interpretation of what Donald Trump has been saying this week is really that he wants to force foreign leaders to the negotiating table to bolster United States trade, but also to try and curb both Russia and China`s larger influence over the global region. Now, as it relates to Panama specifically, Donald Trump believes that Panama and as it relates to the Panama Canal specifically, is taking advantage of the United States and its companies. He really is pushing for a new agreement that would lower the price that different American vessels pay for passage throughout the Panama Canal. He also believes that many Chinese companies are controlling the ports around the Panama Canal, essentially giving them more control over which ships can pass through and again, what the prices are for other countries. Now, as it relates to Greenland, I`m told that Donald Trump`s kind of fixation on that has been about trying to curb Russia`s influence in the Arctic region, and that`s part of why he`s continued to say that he wants to buy Greenland, even though we know that its prime minister who controls the Danish territory has said that Greenland is not for sale, just like it wasn`t for sale back in 2019 when he first floated this idea of trying to purchase the country. Now all to say, this is what one of the Trump advisers told me. They said, quote, \"Everything has to be looked at in terms of curbing Russia and China influence, while also protecting the economy.\" Now, to be clear as well, to go back to the Panama Canal here and what Donald Trump has been saying, Donald Trump has actually been fixated on this for several months now, I`m told. And I would actually point to an August interview he did with Tucker Carlson on X, where he brought this up. He said that he believed that the former president, Jimmy Carter, who negotiated this treaty to give Panama control over the canal despite it being U.S. made, was a stupid idea. He believes that Panama is taking advantage of the United States, and that he would potentially want to negotiate some sort of different deal with Panama if he were to be elected president.

The temperatures have been between the 70s and 80s since our team arrived. Now this time last year his trip was quite different. He was preparing for the election and seeking another four years in the White House. Obviously a lot has happened since then. There were questions about his ability to serve another term. He stepped out of the race, endorsed his vice president Kamala Harris who then lost the election to now president-elect Donald Trump. Trump is now the one preparing to serve another four years in office while Biden is focusing on preserving his legacy. Over the next few weeks we do expect Biden to give several speeches about causes and specific policies that he considers some of his best accomplishments. Talking about issues like climate, the economy, and foreign policy. After he leaves St. Croix he will spend New Year`s Eve in Delaware and then in early January, in the early part of the new year, he will have a foreign trip to Rome and the Vatican where he`ll speak with Pope Francis about global peace efforts. And we don`t expect a lot of policy advancement in these next few weeks. White House officials believe that most of what they would get done in this final sprint toward January 20th could be overturned by the incoming administration. So again the focus on protecting his key accomplishments and preserving his legacy over these next 27 days. Traveling with the president in St. Croix, Julia Benbrook, CNN. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And I`m sure a lot of the viewers know that Chechnya in the past, a place where there was a lot of terrorism. Right now, it is an area that has been under attack by the Ukrainians with drones. And so it`s entirely possible that knowing that and knowing the air defenses that the Russians have for Grozny and the region that they might have, you know, thought that this was incoming Ukrainian and they decided to shoot it down. It`s unclear at this point, but I think significant, Max, is the lack of comment by Russia at this point. You know, they have essentially said we just have to wait until we have more facts.
