We're going to begin with the word that shook the U.S. political and legal world and reverberated around the globe on Thursday. Guilty, guilty, guilty, that word spoken 34 times as the jury in Donald Trump's hush money trial turned the ex- President into a current felon. Now, despite weeks of often damning evidence in the trial, the verdict came as a shock to many, if not everyone, though, not some on his actual legal team. It is the first time, though, in history that a former President has been convicted of a crime. Now, Trump remained defiant and unbowed as he left the courthouse, vowing to appeal, and saying this fight isn't over. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This was a rigged disgraceful trial, but the real verdict is going to be November 5 by the people, and they know what happened here, and everybody knows what happened here. You have a Soros-backed DA and the whole thing, we didn't do a thing wrong. I'm a very innocent man. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I think the most surprising thing to me is that we are on the street in New York in front of Trump Tower and New Yorkers are just living their day-to-day lives. But, I can tell you, inside of Trump Tower right now, those advisors, Donald Trump himself, they are all strategizing about how to make this work in their favor, if they can, ahead of November. That is where the concentration is.I know you mentioned the sentencing date. That is actually very critical. July 11 is just days before Donald Trump is set to go to the Republican convention. That is also when he is set to be the official Republican nominee. You talk a lot about how historical this was because of the fact that he is the first former President to be convicted. It is also historic because he is the first current presidential nominee of a party to be convicted. So, how again this plays out in November, that's the big question. That's what you're going to see both him and his team really focusing on in the next coming weeks.",

I see really just two issues. One is actually the aggravator, the felony that was created because there had to be another crime that this was in furtherance of, not that it was completed, but the attempt. And they had an option of three different crimes, and the jury could pick any one of the three, and they didn't even have to agree unanimously on which one was the predicate crime. So, I do think that that might be there, some case law that is on both sides of that issue. That's probably their strongest issue.The other thing is that their expert was essentially not allowed to testify. The defense had somebody who is going to talk about elections, and whether this actually was in furtherance of trying to influence an election, and that person was limited in what they could say. And then, ultimately, the defense said, we're not going to call them. I don't know if the defense proffered that testimony. If they didn't, then they've waived that. But, if they did, that may be another issue. But, Judge Merchan has a lot of latitude in what he allows in and out, and it really has to be an outrageous mistake to be overturned.

Now, does that actually make a difference in how one, I guess, sentencing is considered, but also, how did that maybe in some ways change how this case needed to be a tried, adjudicated?

How is his behavior been an aggravator or a mitigator? Remember, he had 10 contempt charges upheld against him. He did not behave like a model defendant, and he is still continuing to behave sort of in an outrageous way if he was compared to any other defendant.So, I actually think, in the courtroom, the politics, the idea that he is a former President, that he is a candidate for President, that is actually not played into it. And I suspect if they talk to the jurors, they will say that they listened to the instructions that the judge gave them and they put that aside. Any prejudice, any bias, any sympathy, that was not part of their verdict. That is part of their oath. And I think these jurors followed to the tee every instruction that they were given. The fact that he is Donald Trump, he was just a defendant in that courtroom, and he will be that at sentencing.",

That has been, of course, a central theme of the Biden campaign. And all of this was reflected in a statement by the Biden campaign that came out shortly after the verdict was reached, where they said, quote, \"A convicted felon or not, Trump will be the Republican nominee for President.\"Now, they also used the opportunity to fundraise, essentially telling their supporters that this Trump conviction could fire up his supporters and his fundraising. So, texts went out to folks with -- from the President saying, \"You know I hate to ask, but there couldn't be a more important time for you to make your first donation to keep this guy out of the White House once and for all.\" So, as you can see, they're trying to use this to fire up their own supporters in their own base. But, they're being very careful about how they seize on it, because they do think that the issues of this election will ultimately be more prominent. Now, of course, the White House has been generally reluctant to weigh in over the course of the trial. And we did get a statement from the White House Council spokesperson last night who said, quote, \"We respect the rule of law, and have no additional comment.\" So, we're not anticipating hearing much more from the White House. And as you mentioned there earlier, the President was really out of the public eye yesterday, commemorating the ninth anniversary of the death of his son Beau. He will be returning to the White House this morning, where he does have a few events, including celebrating the Kansas City Chiefs. That is usually a lighthearted event, but you can imagine that he will be asked about this by reporters, and we'll see whether or not he decides to weigh in. Of course, this is something that the White House had been considering whether or not he would give remarks. The logistics, of course, a little bit complicated and uncertain.

I'm not going to rule that out. We just don't know. Let's go one by one, though.The case in Florida, the classified documents case, that's the federal charges against Donald Trump for mishandling national security information, obstructing justice, that case, it's bogged down right now. There is a lot of work that the judge has to do. She is hearing many, many different legal arguments that Donald Trump's team has put before her. She has hearings scheduled until the end of July. No trial date. But, the big thing that she is going to have to tackle in that case going forward is how classified documents could be used at trial. That's going to take a lot of time and attention in a secret room where the judge goes document by document with the defense and prosecutors on what can they show the jury. So, that's where that stands. The two January 6 cases against Donald Trump, the state case in Georgia and then the federal case in Washington, D.C., are a big question mark. The case in Georgia, a state case, that's moving very slowly because there are some big legal issues on appeal, such as whether Fani Willis, the district attorney, can remain on that case. Let's take a moment. I'll come back to that in a second. The big question, though, hanging over that and the federal case in Washington, D.C., that is related to presidential immunity. We're waiting for a Supreme Court decision, very likely by the end of this month. Depending on what the Supreme Court does here, there is a path for that to potentially go to trial unless they give Trump so much protection because of him serving the presidency at the end of 2020, in the beginning of 2021. If they give him so much protection, he can't go to trial. That's also a possibility. Once that is all sorted out, then things may be able to pick up again in the Georgia case as well. Immunity questions, federal questions, constitutional questions, classified documents questions, a lot to go for the courts to work out before we see even trials again on the schedule. Omar.",

He was impeached twice during and after his time in office. And in both of those occasions, Republicans in the Senate decided not to convict him, which meant he could run again for President, among many other things. But, Trump's power in the grassroots of the Republican Party is so great that if any Republican wants a future in politics, they have a choice. They can either support Trump, or they can speak out against him and probably lose their career. We've seen that many times. For example, former representative Liz Cheney, who was a rising star in Republican politics, was pretty much driven out of the party because she stood up to Trump after January 6, 2021.So, that is the reality of politics in the Republican era. In any other era of modern American politics, the idea that somebody could be convicted of a crime and still continue running for President will be fanciful. But, it speaks to Trump's talent for really changing the political environment and transforming his party and his own image, that he is just as viable a political figure, at least with Republican voters today as he was yesterday.",

These polls were taken before he has been found guilty on 34 counts. I mean, it's really shocking to hear this being read out. Is this going to change the mind of voters who are undecided? They're going to have to ask themselves a question. Would you vote for someone for the most important elected position in the entire country who couldn't even get a job at a local mall?

And I've covered politics a good bit here in the U.S. Many voters really don't pay attention until the last minute, and here you have a trial that was very intricate, and its details of white collar crime. Even within that, the charges, I think, for the average American weren't exactly clear that you could explain in five seconds or less. So, I wonder, do you think the conviction, while unprecedented and while important to cover, do you think the conviction here in this case will reverberate as much as if this conviction was coming in the January 6 election subversion case, for example, the federal case out of D.C.? Do you see this as not quite having as big of an impact on the American population? LINDSTAEDTSo, he had basically cheated the American voting public, and this really goes at the heart of American elections, a critical institution in any kind of democracy that someone defrauded American voter and that may be enough to sway some people who feel like this isn't -- enough is enough. But, I think there is other liabilities as well. It's going to be really interesting to see what happens at the Republican Convention, which is held, of course, a few days after Trump is going to be sentenced. There could be louder voices in the Republican Party. I mean, thus far, he has had an authoritarian hold over it, but this is just too much of a liability, and there might be a little bit of chaos at the convention come July.",

I mean, I think yesterday and the swift response that you heard from Republicans on Capitol Hill just underscores what a close hold that Donald Trump not only has on elected officials, but really on the base of the party. The reason that elected officials feel like they need to run to his side isn't just because they like Donald Trump. It's because they know that not standing with Donald Trump could have an impact on their own electoral future because voters are standing with Donald Trump.So, you heard yesterday from a slew of leaders in the Republican House leadership. They were very swift. I mean, within minutes of the verdict being read yesterday, we had statements from Mike Johnson, Steve Scalise, Tom Emmer, Elise Stefanik. That is the whole of the Republican leadership team in the House. Meanwhile, on the Senate side, you also had swift statements from John Cornyn, who, like you said, is running to be the next Republican leader, and John Thune, someone who else -- who also is running to be the next Republican leader. We also heard yesterday from Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. He rarely speaks out in defense of Donald Trump. He rarely talks about Donald Trump, either on policy or on his legal battles. But, he did tweet this yesterday, quote, \"These charges never should have been brought in the first place. I expect the conviction to be overturned on appeal.\" Now, you note there, there is no mention of Donald Trump, but he clearly felt like he needed to say something, given the fact that the whole of the Republican Party was swiftly moving to support the former President.

As you can see, that is where U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is holding a news conference at the NATO foreign ministers meeting. Now, Secretary Blinken has been meeting with his NATO counterparts as the Biden administration made a major policy shift on Ukraine. He is speaking right now. So, we'll go through some of those comments and try to bring you some of them later on.But, the U.S. is now allowing Kyiv to use American munitions to strike targets inside Russia, but only those close to Kharkiv. Now, Russia has made significant advances around Ukraine's second largest city, although NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has downplayed the threat of an escalation. A Kremlin spokesperson said he doesn't know anything about this decision, but added that there have already been attempts to strike inside Russian territory with American-made weapons. I want to bring in CNN Senior International Correspondent Fred Pleitgen. So, obviously, as we continue to monitor what the Secretary of State is talking about right now, President Biden, for him, this is really a big shift from before where there are still restrictions in place now, but obviously, walking a tightrope here of a further escalation. Tell us what this means.",

      "sentences": "Well, first of all, I think you're absolutely right. I think that he is, in a certain extent, walking a tightrope. At the same time, this is a pretty significant shift for the Biden administration, Omar. Beforehand, of course, the Biden administration had said that U.S. weapons were not to be used by the Ukrainians to strike Russian territory or to hit Russian territory. But, it seems as though really the escalation on the part of Moscow has really forced President Biden's hand to now allow the Ukrainians to do just that. But, there are still those restrictions that are in place, meaning that the Ukrainians can use, for instance, artillery to hit frontline Russian troops that might be gathering on Russian territory to attack Ukrainian territory.The main thing around that frontline that you were just talking about in the Kharkiv area is that the Russians are really attacking from Russian soil over there, and not from occupied Ukrainian territory. Obviously, those restrictions put in place by the Biden administration making it very difficult for the Ukrainians to react. The other thing that's happening in that area as well is that the Russians have, to a great extent, been using their air force to hit the Ukrainians with some really powerful bombs. And now, the Ukrainians much more than before are able to fight back. They can, for instance, use American air defense systems to shoot down Russian planes. They can try to hit those frontline Russian troops. But, there are those -- still those restrictions on what they can't do, and those are pretty significant, because for instance, they can't use longer range U.S. missiles, like for instance, the ATACMS missiles, that can go about 150 miles to hit the Russian air bases from which they launched those planes that hit the Ukrainians. So, certainly, the Ukrainians still not able to use those U.S. weapons to the full extent, but definitely a lot more than before. And we have already heard from the Ukrainian President, from Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He said that he had heard about this decision from the Biden administration earlier this morning. He doesn't know everything about it yet. But, he did say that it was a very important first step for the Ukrainians, not just because their troops are getting hit pretty hard by the Russians on the frontlines there in the Kharkiv area, but of course civilians are also being hit as well in those villages. So, definitely a significant step for the Ukrainians. And one last thing, Omar, and I think this is one of the things that really speaks to American leadership in all of this as well, is that other countries, NATO members, especially European NATO members, have now also followed suit. We've just heard from the Germans, that's of course where I am right now, that they're also going to allow the Ukrainians to use German weapons to hit Russian frontline troops in that area. So, definitely, the U.S. really moving forward. The French had already as well. So, from the Ukrainians, this is definitely going to help them. But again, as you've noted, those restrictions to a certain extent still in place, Omar.",
