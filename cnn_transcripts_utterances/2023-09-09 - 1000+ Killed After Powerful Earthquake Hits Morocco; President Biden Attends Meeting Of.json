And we begin this hour with breaking news out of Morocco where a powerful 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck late Friday killing more than 1000 people. It was the strongest to hit the area in over a century. The epicenter in the High Atlas Mountains near Marrakesh is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.Rescuers are now struggling to access the hardest hit areas after roads were damaged. Equipment and manpower are limited -- is very much limited in this region. Patients are waiting outside hospitals and residents are sleeping on the streets fearing that intense aftershocks may hit. More than 700 people are in critical condition. And officials believe the death toll will steadily wise. I want to bring in now CNN Senior International Correspondent Ben Wedeman for more on all this. Ben, you've been to the area before. Set the scene for our viewers what the topography is like, who lives there, why it's also a tourist attraction. And now how an earthquake of this magnitude can cause so much damage.",

      "sentences": "Yes. This earthquake happened just a few minutes after 11Essentially thousands -- tens of thousands of people slept outside if they could sleep at all last night. Now the death toll, the last we heard which was a couple of hours ago from Moroccan state television was that 1037 people had been killed so far. More than 1200 wounded, 721 according to state television in critical condition. The hospitals clearly overwhelmed people waiting outside to be seen by doctors other areas, basically beds -- hospital beds been put in the street because there's no room outside. Now people have been lining up in Marrakesh, the main town in that area that has been hit a lining up to donate blood. But there have been aftershocks. More than a dozen in the hour since that earthquake struck. Now, it's important to keep in mind that the epicenter was about 45 miles southwest of Marrakesh in the High Atlas Mountains. And I've been there, I've camped in that area, hiked in that area. It's some very deep ravines roads that easily blocked by falling boulders. And that seems to be had been what happened. We've seen nighttime video of roads blocked in that area. There are lots of small towns and villages in the High Atlas Mountains. Some of them severely affected by the earthquake. We've seen the accounts from people in that area. One woman Fatima told CNN. I barely got the chance to grab the children and run out before I saw my house collapsing in front of my eyes. The neighbor's house has also collapsed and there are two dead people under the rubble. Now she told CNN that rescue teams had not reached their town hours after the earthquake struck. So, this is really one of the problems in this area is that in addition to the fact that it's remote, the Moroccans don't have enough manpower and equipment to reach all of these areas in addition to the city of Marrakesh. So, it's a problem and they desperately need help from abroad. That help is coming but it couldn't come soon enough. Fredricka?",

When people saw the true extent of the damage, but also of the horrific injuries. I saw many people carried out of buildings and stretches. One person wrapped in a carpet being brought into the streets. And some of them what appeared to be very bad head injuries, a lot of blood. And I even saw one instance in which woman had to be turned away by an ambulance crew because ambulance was full of injured people and they simply said they couldn't take her -- take her in the ambulance.

Right now, President Biden is in India where the G20 Summit is underway. Today, world leaders agreed on a joint statement laying out their shared views on a range of issues including climate change and economic development. But the declaration stopped short of explicitly condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Earlier the President met one on one with Indian Prime Minister Modi but noticeably absent from the summit are Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping. President Biden was asked Xi's absence might affect the summit. And here's what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Yes. Really, the main surprise today was that joint declaration that Prime Minister Modi announced midday leading up to today. Diplomats had really been working furiously behind the scenes to try and develop some consensus language when it came to the conflict in Ukraine. And remember, this is a bloc that includes Russia as a member.So, gaining any kind of agreement on that front was always going to be difficult. Now what did emerge fell short of an explicit condemnation of the conflict in Ukraine of Russia's invasion. It would talked in more broad terms about the importance of protecting sovereignty, territorial integrity, about the importance of not using nuclear weapons. And to some observers, it did seem like a watered-down version of what the G20 came up with last year. When you talk to White House officials, they do say that this is a consequential declaration. That was the word that the National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan used earlier today. And they do make the point that President Biden and other leaders were able to get consensus from countries that haven't necessarily been as forceful in the condemnation of Russia countries like India, where we are but also South Africa and Brazil. And so, certainly, this statement, still reflecting some deep divisions among this grouping. And this is a fractured moment for the G20. Perhaps most explicitly seen in the absence of President Xi and President Putin from the summit. You heard President Biden say today that it's not necessarily affecting a progress on the ground here. And he has been able to use those leaders absences as an opening somewhat to make the case for United States is put sustained of role in the world. And President Biden did come armed with several proposals, several ideas that would help bolster the United States' role in the developing world in particular, including reforming the World Bank, unlocking what the White House said, could be hundreds of billions of dollars in new loans and investments. Making it a more attractive lender to those countries than China. And of course, the other major announcement that President Biden made today was this new transit corridor that would extend from Asia through the Middle East and eventually on to Europe. This would really provide a major competition to China as it seeks to bolster its global trade routes. And so, President Biden certainly looking to use his presence here to make the case for sustained American commitment abroad as he concludes this G20 Summit here in India, Fredricka.",

The most recent being two confirmed sightings just yesterday afternoon inside of that search perimeter, Fred. That is critical here because it tells investigators that it's safe to assume that this 34-year-old escaped convict is still in that area that continues to be searched by air and by land.As of the latest update this morning, that search perimeter, a majority of it includes Longwood Gardens. For those viewers that aren't familiar with this, this is a botanical garden. It's about 1000 acres roughly, of meadows, gardens, of course, and woodlands as well. And that's what really concerns authorities here over and over again. I actually step out because this is interesting. You actually see a USPS vehicle approaching one of the roadblocks. The driver of that has to step out and open up the back of his vehicle so that the state patrolman can actually take a look. This is what's happening time and time again, as authorities really try to keep close to this perimeter, only allowing a select few individuals to make their way inside. I should mention, Longwood Gardens. That has been closed due to public safety that they said in a statement that their safety of the staff and also of their guests is priority. So as a result -- as a result, because of this escape, they've closed down, but really on any other late summer weekend that would be packed with families enjoying festivities. But the reality for the residents in this particular part of Southeast Pennsylvania, that man is still on the loose and because of that, there certainly still sort of a sense of fear among some. But also, for the most part, we have seen people go about their day to day lives except for the occasional interruption just like what you saw here, Fred, as Cavalcante continues to be on the loose.

Now Meadows lawyers had hoped that they could remove his case to federal court and then tried to get it dismissed using laws that extend some immunity to federal officials. But according this ruling, that is not going to happen for Meadows unless he somehow successfully appeals this.The judge found that everything that Meadows did in his role as Chief of Staff in this alleged conspiracy, they were political activities. Even though Meadows' attorney insists that the things that he did and the allegations in this indictment were all related to his official duty to his federal job. But interestingly, the judge even uses Meadows' own words against him, cites his own testimony or Meadows was asked to define the limits of his authority. Couldn't do that. And also, notes how Meadows acknowledged that the lawyer is on that infamous call with the Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, those were not government lawyers. Those were campaign lawyers. So, the judge firmly finding that all of these were political activities, not part of his official duties. So, Meadows will not be successful in removing this to federal court. Now Meadows is the first of five defendants trying to move their cases to federal court and spoken with sources in this case. And everyone was watching Meadows' case because they believe that Meadows had the strongest possibility, the strongest likelihood of succeeding. And the fact that he has not been successful at getting his case moved to federal court. Not a great sign for anyone else who wants to try to do this. Former President Trump is a slightly different case but also not a good sign for him either. Though, the judge officially says that his ruling has no impact on anyone else's case, and each will be decided individually. Paula Reid, CNN, Washington.",

And tennis, the U.S. Open, 50 years ago, it paid women the same as men. So there has been a history of inclusion and diversity and openness in tennis that has not existed in really any other big sports that American women play. We're seeing the fruits of that now. So when you've got Althea Gibson, a wonderful athlete, a black woman who won grand slam tournaments in the late 1950s. Think about that sentence. That happened in the late 1950s.

We've got sustained winds of 115 miles per hour but gusting up to 140.That forward movement still to the west-northwest at about 12 miles per hour. It's going to continue on that trajectory, at least for the next 24-48 hours. You'll notice here, we do anticipate it is going to restrengthen, likely in the next 24-48 hours. It's going to hit a much more favorable environment with less sheer that's going to allow it to strengthen, likely back up to at least a category 4 as we get into Monday and Tuesday. But then things start to change. We start to see that track begin to shift. Now here's the thing. Not all the models agree on exactly where this storm is expected to go in the next few days. You can see most of them fall within this box, but some push a little bit closer to the U.S., others a little bit closer to Bermuda. The reason for the discrepancy is a lot of factors are going to come into play the next few days. Right now, Lee is being driven by this, what's called the Bermuda High, this high-pressure system that's basically steering it to the west. But once we get into Monday and Tuesday of the upcoming week, we have a secondary high-pressure system as well as this trough that are going to come into play. Those are really going to be the focus of where Lee goes once it starts to edge a little bit closer to the U.S. Now, what that means is it could end upcoming much, much closer and skirting right there along the eastern seaboard as it slides north. Or it could go a little bit farther to east, hugging closer towards Bermuda. Regardless, both Bermuda and the east coast of the U.S. likely to experience some high surf and maybe even some significant rip currents over the next several days. So it's definitely something to keep an eye on as we start off the next couple of weeks to know which path this storm is likely to take. Now another thing to keep in mind, in terms of strength, right now, it's in about the warmest water it's going to be in.

So immigrant workers who have gone from storm to storm in the last decade sometimes worked five, six, seven hurricanes each year, are saying they won't go. Now, there are a small number of workers who remained in Florida after Hurricane Ian. They're still there. They're more afraid than ever even as they do the repair work, because they worry that if they face labor exploitation, if they don't get paid, if they face unsafe conditions, even coming forward and blowing the whistle, they would be risking being deported. So they're -- you know, they're in fear at work. Meanwhile, thousands of other workers I'm talking to are afraid to drive there to work.",
