(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RANDI KAYE, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): 1:59 AM Sunday morning, Ryan Wesley Routh may have already been lying in wait for Donald Trump. Court documents unsealed today included an FBI affidavit indicating Routh's cell phone may have been in the vicinity of the bushes for up to 12 hours before he was ultimately spotted by Secret Service. Secret Service caught a glimpse of the barrel of the suspects gun and opened fire. In terms of him being in the vicinity, based on his phone records, is there any evidence to show that Routh was in this, in the vicinity, in the area, before Sunday, and when we say in the vicinity, does that mean right there at that spot in the bushes or it could have been down the street at a restaurant? JEFFREY B. VELTRI, FBI SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE OF MIAMI FIELD OFFICE: He was in very close proximity to where he was spotted by the Secret Service. In terms of your first question, whether he was there earlier, our investigation is still working to determine that. KAYE (voice over): At 1:30 PM, Secret Service agents calling shots fired to West Palm Beach Police who immediately seal off the area. Trump International Golf Club is now on lockdown.",

In court, Routh told the judge he had zero funds and was making $3,000.00 before his arrest. He said he had no assets beyond his two trucks in Hawaii. The judge appointed a public defender. Since the alleged attempt on Trump's life, a complicated picture has emerged of Ryan Routh, a 58 year-old small business owner from Hawaii. CNN has learned that Routh supported Trump in 2016, but later dismissed him as a buffoon and a fool. Routh also mentioned Trump in his self-published book titled \"Ukraine's Unwinnable War\". Routh traveled to Ukraine in 2022 and encouraged others, including Afghan fighters, to sign up to fight. He did an interview with AFP News Agency from Kyiv in April that year.",

It suggests two different things. First thing is, he used the cover of darkness the night before to get through the bushes to the fence line, do his reconnaissance as to what's the best place to set up and then he lay in wait there. The other alternative is that he set up his GoPro there, set it to a streaming setting and then went back across the street where there's many commercial places in parking lots and just settled into what --",

So, within that block on Summit Boulevard there, there's everything. The question is, the special agent in charge Veltri, said his phone was detected very close to that tree line where he fired from, but when you're doing tower triangulations for a signal, there's a difference that can vary from a couple of hundred feet to place it, it could have been across the street.

It's a known vulnerability. They knew that.I think the Secret Service -- the acting director, said it perfectly that they are in a reactive mode. I think the Secret Service really needs to reassess their -- how they operate and be more of a proactive and thinking outside the box because clearly something in Butler -- mistakes were made, and mistakes were made here. The Secret Service agent acted appropriately, taking out the threat. But he got into position, and was there for 12 hours. I think those individuals and that situation needs to be addressed.

So we can't argue about policy when the other side doesn't have any policies and he's totally gutted out the Republican Party. I'm not sure what they stand for any longer.
