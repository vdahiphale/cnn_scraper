When she was born, my parents were told that Angel would never be able to walk or talk or clothe herself or feed herself because she had Down syndrome. We were forever just connected at the hip. She was my forever playmate. I just knew Angel is living the good life like me and we were just kind of parallel living lives and the first summer I came home from college, she was sitting around at home and she wasn`t working. You could do this. Could I do this one? Knowing how drastically her options changed once she was mandated out of the school system at age 22. It was painful. I felt a lot of guilt because truthfully I truly believe in my heart of hearts that she is so much more intelligent than I am in most ways that matter. My sister`s story is very much the norm. College of Adaptive Arts is a lifelong, equitable collegiate experience for adults with special needs of all differing abilities who historically haven`t had access to college education.",

We are now on the campus of West Valley College. They get to go and hang out with student union or get some coffee or walk around campus. It feels like inclusion at its finest. Our college accepts adults at age 18. And our oldest adult now is 73. There is no age out limit and that was very intentional because I would see my sister as an adult. See these finite programs, and when they`re done, I`ve seen firsthand how they revert back to the loneliness and the isolation. I am so humbled each and every day by their depth and ideas and ways to make the world a better place. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Thesefurry four-legged firefighters munch on dry brush, low-hanging branches and weeds, helping to clean out and landscape fire prone areas. It`s a sustainable and natural way to prevent fires if you will without using pesticides and energy consuming machines. Whatever floats your goat. CNN weather anchor Derek Van Dam has more. (BEGIN VIDSEOTAPE) DEREK VAN DAM, CNN WEATHER ANCHOR (voice-over):  As a mega drought rages on across the western U.S. with seemingly no end in sight. The owners of these homes are in a desperate situation. They`re trying to prevent wildfires from burning down their house, and they`ve turned to goats for the solution. That`s right, goats. This is a trip of goats. Quite literally, this herd is here to feast on all of this dry brush. Weeds and low hanging branches like this can act as lighter fluid for a fire moving up a steep hillside. The goats eat it up, creating a line of defense for local firefighters.",

This was an expensive shirt. As you can tell by now, goats love to eat. But they really love to munch on invasive weeds. Targeting this type of non-native vegetation can help eradicate it from an area so that the right plants can grow.
