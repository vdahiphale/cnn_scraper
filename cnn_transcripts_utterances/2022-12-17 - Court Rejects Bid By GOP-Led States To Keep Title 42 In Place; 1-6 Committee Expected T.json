Border towns are seeing a surge of migrants streaming in from Mexico, and those numbers could swell even more. A Federal Appeals Court has rejected a bid by several Republican-led States to continue Title 42, which is due to expire in just four days. That Trump-era policy allowed authorities to immediately expel migrants for health reasons because of the pandemic.

They have permission and papers to be able to travel elsewhere into the United States, but that is the backlog here.They cannot -- sometimes they cannot move them out fast enough, and that is what city officials here are the most concerned about because as we've seen this surge here in El Paso over the last week, which has very little to do with anything, with the lifting of Title 42, they know what is coming or what they projected to be coming here in the weeks ahead, and that is why the focus right now is trying to move people out of border communities to their final destinations as quickly as possible. And here, people are preparing for yet another night on the streets, and what we have seen outside these bus stations where people have been camped out is kind of the generosity of locals here who will bring goods and essentially leave them here for people to pick up. And really people are most concerned about getting blankets and shoes at this point. This is one woman who had just arrived here a little while ago, she's giving away blankets, and you can see people here who have been lining up to try to get whatever it is that they can. People here are essentially bracing for what could very well be another long night. And just so that people have a real clear understanding, even though a lot of these -- all of these people crossed in from Mexico. many nationalities here. There are people from Cuba, Venezuela, Nicaragua, Honduras, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, as well. So these are all people coming from many different areas in Central and South America as well.

DOJ already has wide-ranging criminal probes into January 6, but if all members of the January 6 Committee get up there on Monday, and they say, based on all of the evidence that they have uncovered, based on 17 months of their investigation, more than a thousand interviews, putting together an integral timeline of what happened in the lead up to and on the day of January 6th, if they say all of that has led to evidence of the former President committing a crime, Pamela, that's a strong final statement from the January 6 Committee.",

Well, there is news tonight in Georgia in another investigation of former President Trump. Sources tell CNN the special grand jury there investigating Trump and his allies efforts to overturn the 2020 election is winding down its work which means it could be making recommendations soon to the Fulton County District Attorney. The grand jury has been looking at what Trump described as a \"perfect phone call\" -- remember that -- with Georgia Secretary of State when Trump asked him to find the votes. Well, the special grand jury can't hand up indictments. If recommendations are made, the DA will then have to go to a regular grand jury to ask for indictments. Well, hundreds of tourists in Peru tonight, they are stranded, unsure of how they're going to leave the country.

So many of us have been waiting to gather with families and friends. So many of our gatherings had to be downsized or maybe even skipped entirely in the past two years. But now here we are, once again and we are now dealing with high rates of the flu, RSV, and COVID. And the flu numbers are particularly important and concerning.We have seen some improvement in the data over the last week or so. What we're still seeing that people are not getting vaccinated. In fact, the Health Department puts out a target every year, that's about 70 percent of the population should be vaccinated. But so far, only 40 percent of adults and 46 percent of children have gotten the flu vaccine and that is leading to some concern because those flu numbers are continuing to increase, and we're not through the season just yet. I want to just put the numbers in some context, what we are seeing so far, more than 150,000 hospitalizations, 15 million people have become ill as a result of the flu, and 9,300 people have died. And as I said, those numbers have not been this high in at least a decade and we're not over. We're not done with the high season yet. So what to do, as we all head, as I said into the Holiday season? Public officials are recommending that you mask up indoors, that you test and that you make sure that you are getting those vaccines, especially those COVID vaccines and a booster in addition to your flu shot. There is a lot of concern, but health officials are highlighting the fact that we now do have several tools in the toolbox in order to be able to gather safely and prevent others from getting sick if we are sick ourselves. So it can be done. The Federal government is responding they have once again, opened up requests so that you can put in your information, your address, and you can get those COVID-19 tests delivered right to your door, so another option for people to do -- Pam.",

Doctor, the Department of Health and Human Services says 80 percent -- 80 percent of US hospital beds are occupied right now. But COVID-19 only accounts for six percent of that. So, what does that tell you? DR. LEANA WEN, CNN MEDICAL ANALYST: Well, it tells us that COVID has to be put into the context of all other illnesses at this point. Prior to COVID, even during the flu season, during the winter, hospitals became pretty full also, and that's because we have the flu, we have RSV, we have many other respiratory viruses, and we also have other reasons that people need to be hospitalized. They may have appendicitis or gallbladder infections, or heart attacks, or strokes or be in car accidents. So, the concern now is whenever hospitals become so crowded, care for everyone ends up suffering. Maybe you would have waited an hour to be seen in the ER, now you're waiting six hours. And so, the concern is on a population level, and there is also a concern on the individual level that when there are high levels of viruses circulating, then people who are very vulnerable to severe illness, they are more likely to get ill and become severely ill. And so I definitely agree with the correspondent, Gloria, just said, if you have not yet already gotten the flu vaccine, please get it. If you are somebody very vulnerable to severe illness from COVID, make sure that you get that updated by bivalent booster for COVID as well.",

More than 10 percent of deaths in the US last week were due to the flu, COVID-19, or pneumonia, we should note both bacterial and viral. That's well above expected levels for this time of year.

I think that's probably what's happening. This is the reason why we're seeing an earlier than usual influenza season, but I see it among my own patients that there is so much fatigue around vaccines and precautions, and people are just not getting the influenza vaccine. That really is highly protective, it reduces your chance of getting hospitalized, reduces your chance of getting ill. And so it's not a perfect vaccine, but it does reduce your likelihood of severe illness. So get the influenza vaccine also.",

WEN: Yes, I mean, this is a time where kids are spreading a lot of different viruses, a lot of different bacterial infections to one another as well. I know that my kids also just since they started back in school this year, they've had four or five rounds now of various infections, and those infections could include RSV that we're hearing a lot about, it could include flu or COVID. But we're also seeing that there are other diseases that have long been here, including strep infections that are here as well. So, it's really important to get diagnosed if your child is having high fevers, difficulty swallowing, if they are having -- complaining of a sore throat or just not seeing like themselves. That's another reason that you should seek medical care. Antibiotics, there are plenty of antibiotics that work very well against strep, and so make sure that you get that diagnosed, and just in general, be on the lookout for what's not normal.

He was going deeper into urban areas. He was getting closer to people, attacking dogs. Dogs that were on a leash. And so experts thought maybe he was in distress and that it was best to capture him. That's what they did on Monday and then he went to get a medical evaluation. This medical evaluation revealed a number of things. They already believed that he had been hit by a car. But they discovered trauma to his eye, to his head, to some of his internal organs and they also found preexisting illnesses. There was kidney disease. There was some infections in his skin, there was arthritis, just a bunch of different things that they took into consideration and then decided that it was best to put him down. Some of the experts that have been tracking him for years. They spoke out this week and said that his data will live on, here's one of those experts. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SETH RILEY, CHIEF WILDLIFE ECOLOGIST, SANTA MONICA MOUNTAIN NATIONAL REC. AREA: He's been an incredibly interesting animal. It's - we've really gotten a lot of really great information from him. He's persisted in the smallest home range that has ever been recorded for an adult male mountain lion.
