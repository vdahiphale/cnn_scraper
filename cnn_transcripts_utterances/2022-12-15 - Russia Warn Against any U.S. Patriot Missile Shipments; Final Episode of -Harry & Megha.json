Now both sides in Russia's war on Ukraine are dismissing any chance to have a Christmas ceasefire as they each report new attacks. The Russian backed Mayor of Donetsk says Ukraine launched its largest strike on the city in eight years and he claims Ukrainian forces fired 40 rockets at civilian targets. A Regional Governor in Russia says Ukrainian missiles triggered air defense systems in Klintsy, about 50 kilometers from the border for a second day now. And you saw the orange flash there, CNN cannot confirm if that was from an attack. Now in Ukraine a Kherson official report shelling is ongoing after 86 separate strikes over the past day, including this one on a government building Wednesday. And he says the city is now completely disconnected from the power grid. Two more deaths are reported today after three on Wednesday. We've got Will Ripley, back with us this hour from Kyiv. Will, I want to get into the blackouts that we've been seeing in Kherson, the targeting, specifically in Donetsk as well and where we're standing right now on the frontlines and the aggression that seems to be boiling to new levels, levels that we haven't seen since the start of this war.",

      "sentences": "Yes, you know, the United States had said it was last week or the week before Eleni how theyexpected the fighting to kind of slow down during the winter months. And yet we've seen real escalations on the frontlines to the south and in the east. You talked about Kherson, which has been under nearly constant Russian bombardment since they pulled out of that city and the Ukrainians retook it. And so you now have the population there, not only coming under relentless attack and we have the video from that administrative building that took a direct hit, huge portions of it totally destroyed. And yet you also have, you know, civilians and an entire city essentially cut off in terms of electricity. And so the conditions that people have to live in there, and in many spots along the front lines, they're just unspeakably horrific, especially for any of the children who might remain, who can't go to school who have to live under the constant fear of air raid sirens and rockets raining down. That's why UNICEF is saying that these Russian airstrikes on Ukraine's critical infrastructure, which means not just the immediate frontlines, but striking the power grid and plunging huge swaths of this country into the dark and cold, are not only hurting the physical and mental health of almost every child, but putting them in a desperate risk. Every single child across Ukraine, according to UNICEF, their physical and mental health is at desperate risk. In Donetsk you have the Russian backed authorities claiming that Ukraine is doing the same thing to those who live meaning civilians living under Russian occupation. And they point to rocket attacks. They say that the Ukrainians fire 40 rockets at civilian targets in Russian occupied Donetsk, which broke away from Ukraine at the beginning of all of this going back; you know, eight, almost nine years back to 2014. You have video that has emerged of a major intersection in Russian health Donetsk on fire; you have a cathedral that was hit along with commercial and residential buildings. CNN can't independently verify these claims. You also have, you know, yet another report of a of a potential shelling attack even inside Russia, of course, the most brazen attack allegedly involving Ukrainian drones striking a strategic airfield just 500 miles from Moscow. So all of this, you know, just kind of also shines a spotlight on this conversation about bringing Patriot missile defense systems into Ukraine something that the President of this country Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been asking for not just for months, but for years. But as Nick Paton Walsh pointing out last hour, it's incredibly complex. And there's a lot of moving parts but the Ukrainians say they badly need every tool every weapon that they can get to fend off this Russian assault.",

I think we might be lookingat this week for clarification from the U.S. Defense Department that such a scheme or mechanism may be underway; possibly they could say it's already on Route. We don't know a lot of the detail as to how this will happen. That's important because the timeframe is very important for Ukrainians suffering on a daily basis from these relentless Russian missiles. And it seems Russian fired Iranian drone attacks as well, the Patriot system, some analysts hold out as kind of the gold standard. And frankly, U.S. allies around the world have often asked for patriots to defend their skies. And these often involve deploying U.S. troops to assist with the servicing and maintenance the operation of these complex but highly effective systems. That's not really an option when it comes to the Ukrainian battlefield. Because obviously that would involve putting U.S. personnel on the frontlines, potentially targets and potentially to complicating Washington's desire to not be competent in this war. They're very happy to supply Ukraine with pretty good weapons to defend themselves against Russia, but they don't want NATO or U.S. personnel actually on the battlefield. So in order to fill this clear messaging that we're hearing from the U.S., they want to give patriots to Ukraine. There's a complex tasks now of training that may begin according to our colleagues in Washington in Germany at a U.S. base there pretty soon of Ukrainian personnel to operate these systems, maintaining them possibly in Ukraine, you have to train Ukrainians do that as well, or bring damage patriots out of Ukraine to do that servicing on the U.S. auspices. And then, of course, the complexities the technology around this as well, while a truck that fires some of these Patriot anti-aircraft or anti- missiles can take as few as three people to actually operate. A patriot battalion can have just shy of about 100 people in it multiple devices within that to make these proper systems function to the effectiveness they can. So that's a huge ask, frankly, to get that many Ukrainians ready fast enough for this to be implemented during winter. So clearly, the Pentagon hearing messaging from the White House this is probably underway soon having to deal with the intense logistical challenge ahead of them. But also conscious too of the signal this is sending that the U.S. is not shying away from sending its best weaponry to help Ukraine defend itself. And that's a key message to give Moscow ahead of a potential winter counter offensive or stalemate depending on what happens in the cold months ahead Eleni.",

Now, we've heard that before, it's important to hear it again. But it wasn't necessarily a new revelation. These last three episodes have been very much about how the royal household has dealt without racism. And it's not a pretty picture that Harry and Meghan paint at all. It's one in which, as Max was saying, in his package there, there were leaks. And there were also stories being briefed against Harry and Meghan, how he says very clearly that the other Royals were jealous of Meghan. They were upset by the fact that she was such a loyal Rockstar. And as a consequence, there were actual stories briefed against her and the attacks began, they failed to protect her. And this I think is very damaging. Also, the image that it gives of the future king, King Charles has a very early reign; he can't ever measure up to his mother's popularity. And this, I think is damaging, because I think people are watching this and saying, but Charles is Harry's Father, why couldn't he do something to protect them? Why couldn't he intervene? And I think people are saying, what kind of institution is this, in which a woman of color marries into the institution, the first ever woman of color to marry into the war family and the consequences, she suffers so much that her mental and physical health is very much damaged.",

      "sentences": "Yes, because obviously nurses are a very essential component of any public health system. But broadly speaking inthis country, the law says that nurses are free to walk out provided that no patients' lives are put in danger, the precise definition of what that means is a bit of a gray area, but the government and the union actually negotiate that and work that out in advance. And so if you show up to an emergency room with a broken leg or something worse than you'll be seen. But if you show up with something more minor, or you show up, or you have an elective surgery that may be in danger. But keep in mind that not all of the nursing unions are actually going on strike or not all of our hospital regions are going on strike and not all nurses are part of the Union. So the union that is striking the Royal College of nurses, what are they looking for? Well, they're looking for a raise that is 19 percent seems like a lot except when you consider inflation right now is 10.7 percent. The government is offering them a raise of 4.3 percent. And they say that they are willing to talk to the Union about anything, except for pay because of the financial pressures that the government is under right now. I should also mention that the Bank of England is trying to keep inflation to around 2 percent. It opted to raise its key interest rate by half a percentage point today. And while it didn't specifically in its statement mentioned strikes, it did mention that there are wage pressures domestically right now. And so perhaps the government is also thinking that if you give a whole bunch of public sector workers a raise that may not help the situation when it comes to inflation. But the nurses also say that look, the system more broadly needs to be overhauled because if you look at the number of people showing up to the emergency room, broadly speaking, the numbers have not changed over the last four years. What has changed, though, is the number of people who are waiting 12 plus hours to actually be seen by a doctor. And you mentioned it earlier Eleni it is not just nurses that are upset with their working conditions at the moment. This is the number of days, working days that have been lost per month due to labor shortages. This are labor strikes, excuse me, this was the pandemic so they didn't keep track. But right now, they have peaked at 417,000. And just to end, the nurses are going on strike today, they're going on strike Tuesday, but it's not just them. You also then have the paramedics that are going on strike Friday and Wednesday, and then you have the Royal Mail and the bus drivers that are going off the 16th and the 17th. I could go on and on. But look, the bottom line is there are a heck of a lot of public sector workers in this country that are not exactly satisfied with conditions and it's only going to get worse from here Eleni.",

The hearing started over two hours ago in Lima Peru's capital and we have an update for you Eleni. Just a few moments ago, the hearing was adjourned until 5 pm local time, which is also 5 pm eastern. A judge must decide whether Casio remains in prison for the next 18 months as the nation's Attorney General has requested. As you may remember, Casio was impeached and arrested on December 7 after he announced plans to dissolve congress and install an emergency government. He was apparently trying to get ahead of a congressional vote on his impeachment. Castillo is accused of conspiracy and rebellion. He denies those allegations, but it was still a country in turmoil today. More than a week after Castillo's impeachment, the government declared Wednesday a state of emergency that will be in effect for 30 days. Defense Minister Alberto Otarola said the National Police and armed forces are responding to what he called, \"Acts of vandalism, violence and seizure of roads\". Peru's National Police has said earlier that highways in at least four regions across the country have been blocked by protesters demanding the immediate return to power of former President Castillo. As you know Eleni, Peru is a country that receives many international tourists every year who are attracted to wonders like the Machu Picchu Inca Citadel train service between Machu Picchu and Cusco was disrupted due to the deadly protests leaving dozens of tourists stranded there. A political crisis has gripped the country for years, - who you mentioned before and who took over after the ousting of Pedro Castillo spruce six precedents in less than five years, Eleni back to you.",

And this comes as a Trump eraborder policy known as Title 42 is set to expire next week. It allows officials to turn away migrants at the southern border under a public health authority. Now, a big concern is that hundreds of migrants who've been staying across the border and Ciudad Juarez, Mexico would try to enter the U.S. next week. CNN's Ed Lavandera has more. ED LAVANDERA, CNN SENIOR U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: We are on the edge of the Rio Grande. And this is the spot in Juarez, Mexico, where thousands of migrants have been crossing into the U.S. for the better part of a week; we've been seeing numbers of on average, about 2500 a day. And this morning, once again, it's a very orderly process as you might be kind of hard to imagine here. But there's a literally a long line of people that go several 100 yards back, there are hundreds of people essentially making a line waiting to be allowed into the U.S. to get processed. All of these people you see on the other side of the river are essentially waiting to turn themselves in to Border Patrol agents. And as I mentioned, it is a very orderly process. They stand here in this line. And then you can see the embankment there where the border wall ends and the barbed wire there ends and there's a little chain link fence. And at that point, there are Border Patrol agents there who are calling the people up and they call them up one small group at a time. And then they get processed or taken into a border patrol facility processed and then determine whether they will be deported, or they will be allowed to go through the immigration process. So that is what we're seeing here. These numbers are really intense and the number of people that we're seeing here, but essentially, this is coming days before the possibility of the end of Title 42. And as we have been reporting, the concern is that the number of people that we're seeing here at this point could just be a fraction of what is coming. The Biden Administration says it is projecting and preparing for the possibility of anywhere between nine and 14,000 migrants a day crossing all along the U.S. southern border, that would be twice the number of people we're seeing right now. But all of these people you've seen behind me here they have been waiting overnight in the frigid temperatures down into the 30s waiting they're all covered in blankets. They have been making fires to stay warm. And this is just part of the process and part of the scene that we're seeing unfolding here along the Rio Grande between Juarez and El Paso. We just spoke with one family who said they had been spending two and a half months traveling from Venezuela, the mother and father had tears in their eyes as just a few moments ago. You can see it just a little rocky path that the migrants have built up there to make the crossing of the river a little bit easier. They had tears in their eyes as they got to that point crossing over into the U.S. and stepping over there to a great deal of uncertainty. They know full well that after everything that they've been through, the chances of staying in the United States isn't guaranteed, so all of this process playing out and unfolding here. This is the scene on the banks of the Rio Grande between Juarez and El Paso.",

The social media company has suspended in anaccount that track the live location of the billionaire's private jet. The @elonjet profile was run by 20 year old Jack Sweeney, whose personal account now also seems to be suspended. This is despite the fact that last month Musk tweeted my commitment to free speech extends even to not banning the account following my plane even though that is a direct personal safety risk. It is unclear why these bans have been put into place. And it has set off a new round of complaints about what critics call an inconsistent and opaque policy. Recently, journalists have released internal Twitter files that sheds some light on decision making within the company. But they are also raising even more questions. CNN's Donie O'Sullivan has more.

GABRIEL NICHOLAS, RESEARCH FELLOW, CENTER FOR DEMOCRACY &amp; TECHNOLOGY: Musk has talked a lot about informing people of removal and reduction. And that is a good thing. But it's not clear how he's actually going to have the engineering and the resources to do it. O'SULLIVAN (voice over): Well, Gabriel Nicholas was study de-amplification says transparency is a good thing. There are some cases where it is better to not inform a user their account is being limited, such as the case of serial harassers. DR. JOAN DONOVAN, HARVARD KENNEDY SCHOOL: And we look at the kinds of accounts that Twitter has de-amplified or banned over the last two or three years. It tends to be accounts that will post things that are both novel and outrageous and detrimental in some way to society, whether it's through hate harassment or incitement. O'SULLIVAN (on camera): So what is de-amplification? Well, sometimes when you open your Twitter feed, you're not just seeing the latest tweets. What you're seeing is the algorithm recommending to accounts and tweets it thinks you might be interested in. Now, let's imagine Twitter is Time Square. People here can say whatever they want to whoever they want. But sometimes the algorithm might pick up the more interesting comments and tweets and highlight them on some of the billboards. But if you're blacklisted, you're never going to get your comments or tweets up on these billboards. And that is what some people understand to be shadow banning.",

I know you've had a discussion with him. O'SULLIVAN: Yes, so Jack Sweeney is a 20 year old who lives in Florida? He's a coder. He's actually an Elon Musk fan. And he built an app. A Twitter account that tracks where Elon Musk's private jet is. Yesterday, Musk Twitter closed down that account and we spoke to Jack, have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JACK SWEENEY, CREATOR OF @ELONJET: If he keeps it up, it just shows that he can continue to do what the last people did at Twitter and they can bend the rules in however which way they want for whoever they want. They could ban someone for one thing and not ban someone else for the same thing because they just liked the person.

But he is using public information there.

The share price of the electric car manufacturer is down nearly 60 percent so far in 2022. And that's part of a wider shock to tech stocks caused mainly by rising interest rates and inflation. And since Musk bought Twitter on October 27, the share price has fallen even more than 30 percent where shareholders worried his attention has been diverted from Tesla. But also a concern is just how much equity Musk has dumped since announcing plans to buy Twitter in April, a total of $22.9 billion worth of Tesla stock.
