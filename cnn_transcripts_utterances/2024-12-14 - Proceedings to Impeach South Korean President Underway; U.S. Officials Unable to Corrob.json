And for Secretary Mayorkas to diminish that and call it duplicates is just irresponsible on his part. My residents are really fed up. They are tired of the inaction by the federal government.

And right now, seeing that in action, you can't help -- you can't blame them for their concern, their serious concern at the fact that these drones continue to fly over their homes and our critical infrastructure. It would be nice if the federal government and the White House would come here to New Jersey, come to the ground. The president has raised money here in Middletown several times. But maybe he should step aside from the campaigning part of things and come to the governmental part of his job and perhaps put some of those resources that the federal government has on the ground here, because right now it's our county sheriffs, it's our local police departments, it's our state police that are at the front lines.

What happened, just 1.5 weeks ago, President Yoon shocked his country and I think much of the world when he announced that he was imposing emergency martial law on the country.And he deployed soldiers in helicopters to the national assembly as well as police to try to stop lawmakers from gathering there. They ultimately voted to overturn martial law and he had to backtrack just six hours after he declared it in the first place, widely seen as an unconstitutional power grab. Now, in the last hour or so, he has put out a statement in response to this historic impeachment, saying, quote, \"I'll stop temporarily for now but the journey to the future that I've walked with the people for the past two years should not stop. I will not give up.\" And he talked about his commitment to South Korea. But his polls are just at a real low. There were surveys that showed the vast majority of Koreans supported impeachment. As for next steps, Ben, well, we could be months away from actually seeing President Yoon stripped from office. He's been suspended from the powers of the presidency. Those now go to his prime minister, who becomes acting president, though he, too, could face problems and could be implicated in this half-baked martial law effort, which has already snagged a number of other top officials from President Yoon's government. So beyond that, a constitutional court would have 180 days to rule on whether or not to approve this impeachment. The last time South Korea impeached a president, it was just eight years ago. It took that same court 90 days to get around to that moment. That president ended up behind bars for crimes of corruption that she was convicted upon. So President Yoon could face a trial down the road if the court does approve this impeachment and completely remove him from office. Again, as you pointed out, history was made in Korea today.",

So he claimed that they were paralyzing the government, paralyzing government affairs. And he also said that he needs to root out anti- state forces, which implies them, the opposition.

Again, if the country goes through another presidential impeachment process, because it could take weeks and even months to find out what happens and how the constitutional court rules. And so that was their, I've been told, the ruling party's main reason for being against impeachment. To think about the people and the country, even though they do not condone what he did in terms of declaring martial law, but again, in today's second impeachment vote, we saw that the national assembly passed it. He is impeached now. It's now turned over to the constitutional court. President Yoon, his presidential powers are now suspended. The prime minister will be acting president and the constitutional court has maximum 180 days to make a ruling  to what -- to decide whether to oust him or not. They have to make a unanimous ruling.

And even the military was quite -- they were relatively passive when dealing with Korean citizens and others surrounding the national assembly in protest. So fortunately there was no -- it did not lead to injuries, fortunately did not lead to any bloodbath. And so -- but at the same time, clearly, for a president who came into office championing democratic values and rule of law, this certainly puts a major stain, to say the least, on South Korea's reputation overseas as well. And so this is where, right now, with this impeachment vote passing in the national assembly, it puts another stain on South Korea's image. It's the third presidential impeachment of its kind. And so, of course, overseas, I would not be surprised if South Korea's foreign partners pause and they will be questioning, there is a power vacuum. Who do we deal with? Who is our counterpart?
