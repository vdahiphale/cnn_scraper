Sidney Powell has joined Kenneth Chesebro in requesting quick trials. A judge has already scheduled an October trial for our Chesbro and in response to the request, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis wants to trial for all 19 defendants at the end of October. But the defense team for former President Trump is trying to delay the start. Trump and his 18 co-defendants are facing a variety of charges including racketeering and conspiracy.

So, he's the only one of these 19 defendants that is still in jail. And something that probably also didn't help him much is that he's got no representation. We saw that yesterday when he went in front of a judge. He said to that judge, Emily Richardson that he could not afford a private attorney. And the judge replied to him that he does not meet the eligibility requirements for a public defender. So let me bring you back to who Harrison Floyd is. This is the former leader of Black Voices for Trump. Prosecutors are alleging here that he is involved in an alleged plot to intimidate an Atlanta election worker Ruby Freeman in to falsely admitting to massive fraud against former President Donald Trump in the 2020 election.Now, he went before this judge, Emily Richardson yesterday and he found out that he would remain in jail, that Judge telling him it's actually the chart -- the judge that was assigned to this case, Judge Scott McAfee, who will ultimately decide his bond.

And certainly, you can't figure out whether the guy's guilty or innocent before the trial happens.So, it ends up being a very expansive standard.

I mean, if you look at what happened here, back in 1963, 60 years ago, on these various steps of the Lincoln Memorial, there was talk about voting rights. And we heard much of that being expressed here today as well. You remember historically that African-Americans risk their lives, gave their lives for the right to vote.And the feeling here today among civil rights leaders is that voter suppression is still alive and well. To drive that point home, a while ago, just a short while ago, we heard from Andrew Young. Former mayor of Atlanta noted civil rights activist. He is 91 years old, Fredricka. He made his way to the stage. He was here 60 years ago, worked alongside Martin Luther King, Jr. And he shared his thoughts about the state of the country today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

First of all, a series of daring raids on the Crimean Peninsula, one which involved physically landing on the territory. I think that is important not just symbolically but as a reminder about what the ultimate aim of this counteroffensive is. Which is bringing Ukrainian forces to the Sea of Azov and breaking the land bridge between Crimea and the rest of the Russian-held territories here in Ukraine. But also the substantial gain that has been made around and towards a village in Zaporizhzhia region. It is still the scene of intense fighting between Russian forces and Ukrainian soldiers. A great deal of intense fighting to its south and its east. But yet it still represents the first time Ukrainian forces have been able to breach that first line of Russian defenses. With everything that's going to mean for the Russians need to bring in more men to try and defend their positions from other points along the front lines. So from the point of view of the Ukrainian forces, what has been achieved this week does bode well as at least, Fredricka, the beginning of a glimmer of hope after many long weeks of a fairly fruitless counteroffensive.",

But also seeing more creep into the southwest. That's where we're going to start to see temperatures going up in the coming days. Take Palm Springs, for example, topping out at 114 tomorrow, up to 117 on Monday. Phoenix, 113 on Sunday, back up to 116 by the time we get to Tuesday. You're talking 10 degrees above average for a lot of these places. Even Sacramento well above where they should be this time of year. Across the southeastern portion of the U.S., one to two days left of that extreme heat and then we'll finally start to see the numbers come back down. For Houston, 107 Sunday, back down under triple digits by the start of the week. New Orleans looking at 102 on Sunday, down into the upper 80s by chance on Tuesday. So, again, seeing that trend come down. Even Atlanta going from 96 on Sunday, dare I say 10 degrees below average on Wednesday. But there's a reason for that. Because we're going to be adding in rain chances possibly from this potential system here in the gulf coast of Mexico. Right now, about a 90 percent chance of developing into a tropical system in the next 24 to 36 hours. It's expected to slide into the Gulf of Mexico. Further development, it's going to move into a much more favorable environment, so we do anticipate it becomes a tropical storm in about the next 24 to 36 hours, even though right now it's still looking a little disorganized. Most of the models have it coming into a Gulf of Mexico and sliding toward Florida Tuesday or Wednesday of the upcoming week. Certainly something to keep a close eye on. Also keeping an eye on Hurricane Franklin. Winds of 75 miles per hour. This particular system is expected to become a major hurricane, likely by Monday or Tuesday of this upcoming week, before sliding between Bermuda and the United States. But Fred, definitely something we'll still keep a close eye on because it is going to come awfully close. It may still have impacts to the U.S. in the form of some rip currents.",
