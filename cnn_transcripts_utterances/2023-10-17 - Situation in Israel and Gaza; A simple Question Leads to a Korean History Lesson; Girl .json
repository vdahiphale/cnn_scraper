      "sentences": "During the Korean War, it was from 1950 to 1953, the communists were abducting young boys into thecommunist army. My father remembers the conversation that his mother had with his brothers, and she told them to go escape into the local mountains and to hide there until the war was over. No one knew if they were going to see their loved ones again. There was so much more to learn about his history. We all want to know where we come from, right? Technically, I can say I`m North Korean. I grew up in Southern California and I really knew nothing about my roots. My childhood, I guess, was pretty normal. For an immigrant family, my father owned a gardening business. He moved to America in 1974 and he never had a chance to ever go on vacation. I said, hey, what`s your bucket list vacation? And he is like, well, I`ve been on YouTube a lot. And I`ve been looking a lot at Alaska. Oh, then let`s do it. We were on this beautiful train ride through Denali National Forest. It was a glass car. This is a horrible photo. But this was inside the train. And I just randomly asked, hey dad. So tell me about the war. He kind of was taken aback. I obviously don`t think he was expecting that question from me. He just started telling me, he was eight or nine years old. It was pure chaos. He said, Amara, I was running for my safety, for my life in the middle of this war while bombs were flying and I was barefooted. Didn`t even have shoes. My dad escaped down towards Seoul. That`s a long journey from what is now North Korea. His most vivid memory was being hungry as a child at night. Like the noise, his tummy would make. I don`t think I had ever seen my father cry until that moment. You know, he was probably holding in all that pain, that he never talked about with anyone else until Alaska. That was really a pivotal moment in my life. I understand my father so much more now. You know, we -- I used to always be like, dad, you don`t ever talk you`re -- you always look so stern. You`re always working, working, working. You always have a goal. And now I know why. He was able to leave, come to America and build a life for himself and set up his children to succeed. He`s a survivor. I will tell my children when they`re of age, their roots. So if you want to learn more about yourself, ask questions. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Although the rules had been created much earlier in 1903 by a woman named Elizabeth Magie. That`s a story that had been lost for decades until recently. Now, ever since games and puzzles have been big business. And for one lucky player, the game UNO has also meant a big paycheck for her. She`s earning thousands of dollars each month to play the game she loves. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
