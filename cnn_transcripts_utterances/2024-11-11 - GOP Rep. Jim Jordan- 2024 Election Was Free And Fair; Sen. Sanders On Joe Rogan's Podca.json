Yes, you know, I mean, the, the, maybe the only good news of this election for Democrats is that it was such a thorough ass kicking that it's really, you know, there's no sort of, there shouldn't be a debate over was it this or was it that? It was everything. And again, I'd say that just from experience you spend enough time in the desert, you're going to find water with the Democrats are now in the desert and they're going to have to figure out how to find water again. And Bill Clinton did it after the Reagan years with the new Democrats. George W. Bush did it with compassionate conservatism. Donald Trump did it with Make America Great Again. But the clear message for Democrats is you got to rethink everything, especially when Donald Trump has stolen the very coalition that was the backbone of the Democratic Party, the working class of America. And when you look at the demographics of the new coalition, what Trump built of black voters, Hispanic voters, young voters. Man, this is, you know, this is, again, not one thing or the other, it's everything. Democrats have to start from scratch, and they got a lot of work to do.",

      "sentences": "Yes. Mark, Maureen Dowd put it this way in the New York Times over the weekend. She said, the headline is Democrats in the case of mistaken identity politics. Quote, some Democrats are finally waking up and realizing that woke is broke. The party embraced a worldview of hyper political correctness, condescension, and cancellation. This alienated half the country or more and the chaos and anti-Semitism at many college campuses certainly didn't help.And I was reading over the weekend also one voter was speaking to a reporter, had to pick one word for each. They picked the word crazy. It was a woman. She picked the word crazy for Donald Trump. She picked the word preachy for Kamala Harris and then was asked, OK, who'd you vote for? She says, I voted for Donald Trump because crazy doesn't look down on me. What do you make of that? M. MCKINNON: That's -- that's really great. I mean, there's no question that most Americans thought the Democratic Party had just become condescending. That it had become a party of sort of the faculty lounge that thought that they were better than everybody else. Your discussion on the Rogan podcast is a good one because I think that that's going to America where they are. And Rogan is a guy whether you agree with him or not is really, you know, like you said, he was Bernie before he was Trump. He's -- he's -- he's kind of, you know, at least seems to be open minded. And the notion that you would only communicate with audiences that are sympathetic to you. Rogan will listen. And the interesting thing about Rogan's audience is you think about the new sort of media ecosystem. Rogan has more -- more, has a greater audience, 11 million people than NBC, ABC, CBS, CNN, and MSNBC combined, which is about 10 million on a good night. So, you can hit Rogan, go where the voters are, fish where the fish are, that's what Democrats have to do.",
