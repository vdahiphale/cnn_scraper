      "sentences": "Hello and welcome. I'm Bianca Nobilo in London in Max Foster today. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is in the UK right now on a surprise visit where he's set to address address Parliament at any moment. He arrived several hours ago and was greeted by the British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.You can see a photo here posted to Rishi Sunak's Twitter of them embracing on the tarmac. Both leaders later held talks at Downing Street. It's Mr. Zelenskyy's second trip outside Ukraine since Russia's invasion nearly one year ago now. And it comes as Kyiv is urging the West to send more weapons ahead of an expected renewed Russian offensive. CNN's Nic Robertson joins me now live from outside parliament. Actually, Nic, we're just going to return to you because I believe now we have a shot of President Zelenskyy walking into Westminster Hall. There he is. Westminster Hall being the oldest part of the Houses of Parliament, 900 years old, where many of the world's great historical figures and dignitaries have addressed parliament, such as Queen Elizabeth II, Nelson Mandela, Barack Obama, and now President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. And you can see President Zelenskyy receiving rapturous applause from members of parliament and being flanked by the Speaker of the House of Commons.",
