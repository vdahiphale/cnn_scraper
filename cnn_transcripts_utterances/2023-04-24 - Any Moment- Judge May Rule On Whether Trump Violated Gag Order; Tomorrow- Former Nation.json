Moments ago, House Speaker Mike Johnson was at Columbia University calling on that school's president to resign amid demonstrations there.Plus, a powerful CNN exclusive, never publicly before seen video captured by a U.S. Marines GoPro camera, one that contradicts the Pentagon's official report about the Afghanistan withdrawal. See the footage that undermines what's been said about that horrific airport attack that killed 13 U.S. service members and dozens of Afghans. And leading this hour, Donald Trump once again blasting the gag order against him, attacking jurors and witnesses and family and staff of the judge and prosecutors in the New York hush money cover up case. Today, Mr. Trump posting on Truth, Social, quote, \"The gag order imposed on me, a political candidate running for the highest office in the land, is totally unconstitutional,\" all caps. \"Nothing like this has ever happened before,\" unquote. Well, I mean, kind of. Those words, just as Judge Juan Merchan is considering whether or not Mr. Trump has violated the gag order and what the punishment should be. The judge's decision could come any day really, honestly, any minute now. CNN Senior Legal Analyst Elie Honig is here. So, Elie, thanks so much for being here. We're still waiting on Judge Merchan to issue his ruling on whether or not Trump violated the gag order. How long could this be left unresolved?",

And what special counsel Jack Smith argues is that throughout history, there has been a general understanding that presidents could not be completely shielded in criminal cases, which are more serious in nature.And he points to, for example, a modern precedent of the Watergate, that former President Gerald Ford pardoned Richard Nixon after he was forced out office because of Watergate.

This is a court dominated by conservatives, three of the justices put on by Donald Trump.And several of these justices have wanted to strengthen presidential authority over the years.

He's not arguing I'm automatically immune for everything from noon on January 28, 2017, when I took the oath, until four years later. He was arguing that earlier, but he has, I think, wisely dropped that. Now he's arguing the more limited claim that I'm immune for official acts. And that raises the question that the Supreme Court's going to have to grapple with. Well, were these official acts? Now, I think the factual answer is, hell no, but it may take time to get there.And what I think is a nightmare scenario for Jack Smith is if the Supreme Court says you can be covered for official acts, like in the civil context, in the Nixon case you talked about, but it's got to go back down to Judge Chutkan, you have to hold fact finding on that.",
