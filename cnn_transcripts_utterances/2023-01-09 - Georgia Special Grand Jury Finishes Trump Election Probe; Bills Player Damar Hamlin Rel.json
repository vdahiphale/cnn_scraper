And that process still needs to play out. We don't know what she'll do. That timeline is not certain yet. But what we do know is that even though this special purpose grand jury did not have the power to indict, they did have the power to subpoena and they did just that and that resulted in a number of high profile individuals in Trump's orbit coming here to Fulton County to testify in front of the jurors, which included the former attorney for the former president, Rudy Giuliani, South Carolina senator, Lindsey Graham, the governor here in Georgia, Brian Kemp just to name a few.And what started as an investigation into that phone call that you just played, the now infamous phone call shortly after the 2020 election between the former president and secretary of state Brad Raffensperger, which Trump pressured Raffensperger to find votes. The investigation started on that but it really broadened out over time to include a fake electoral scheme in which Trump allies tried to subvert the Electoral College and certify him as the rightful winner of the state of Georgia. They were also interested in Rudy Giuliani's false statements and conspiracy spreading during his conversations with Georgia lawmakers. In fact, Rudy Giuliani was named a target of this criminal investigation by Fani Willis.

TIMOTHY PRITTS, PROFESSOR, DEPARTMENT OF SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI COLLEGE OF MEDICINE: Certainly. A great question and neither are we to be candid. We continue to be ecstatic about his recovery. And as Bill mentioned, when we started all this, what we told his parents is the only thing that mattered was the patient in the bed to get them back to him and his family and to his community.

But it is something that is rather exceptional and I think there are at least three factors that were working for him.One is that he got exceptional medical care. Two is that he was previously an extremely healthy individual and third, and I think we cannot discount this, is that he had rapid resuscitation. Within seconds, he had an entire medical team come to his rescue. He had a cardiac arrest. We know that he had a - his heart stopped and he basically died on the field. But he was able to be brought back to life because he had a defibrillator that was used right there, because CPR was started immediately and that allowed blood to keep on going to his vital organs. That's really the main reason why he has been able to make this kind of rapid recovery. And I think the takeaway here needs to be that we all need that kind of quick resuscitation. The NFL for their games have more than two dozen medical staff on hand, including several attending physicians. That's not the case for most sports games are most places around us. And so I hope this is a call for all of us to get trained on using CPR, and to also have defibrillators readily available because we need everyone to be able to have this kind of remarkable outcome.",

Look, this was a sensitive situation. I was told yesterday that there was a chance that he would be back in Buffalo and in the facilities today. But as doctor just mentioned, this was such a sensitive situation that his health could have taken a turn for the worse at any moment, based on what he was - has gone through. But it is such encouraging news to hear now that he is back in Buffalo. And I want to give some further context on just how far he has come. It was seven days ago that as doc mentioned he died on the field, essentially cardiac arrest, heart stopped and the medical workers and the training staff who jumped into action so quickly giving that life saving CPR, the assistant trainer, giving life saving CPR while an assistant equipment manager so deftly and quickly and with poise and precision unscrewing his facemask and removing it so they could give him oxygen without moving his head by the way, because they didn't know if it was a spinal cord injury at the time. And then also another trainer, and excuse me for giving perhaps too many details, I warn you it could be disturbing, there was blood in his mouth and another trainer was having to scoop blood out of his mouth so that he can have clear airways and he wouldn't become asphyxiated. It gives further context of the scenes we saw with the players, with the tears coming down their eyes as their teammate was getting CPR, hands over their faces and they couldn't believe what they were seeing. They were haunting scenes. And to now know that he is back in Buffalo, Buffalo strong - what a story this is turning out to be. Yes, it's just one of those stories that makes you really grateful for the moments we're given as Dion Dawkins told me on that field last night after the game, it wants - makes him want to be a better father, a better teammate, a better friend, a better human and we should all go home tonight and hug those we love a little extra tight.",

That's the ratio of nurses to patients. We've heard from some folks here that the ratio is up to 20 patients per one nurse when it should be closer to one to four. And that makes it really hard to attract new nurses to the job, creating labor shortages. It's a vicious cycle. I want to bring in Matt Allen right now.

The same deal that was offered to other hospitals that was accepted. Contingency plans are underway here.
