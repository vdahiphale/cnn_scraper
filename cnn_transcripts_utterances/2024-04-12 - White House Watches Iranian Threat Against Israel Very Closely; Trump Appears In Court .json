      "sentences": "All right, a very warm welcome to the show, I'm Zain Asher in for my colleague Isa Soares. Tonight, the WhiteHouse warns of a real and credible threat of Iranian retaliatory strikes against Israel, we'll have much more on those simmering tensions in the Middle East. Then, a key hearing is taking place in the classified documents case against former President Donald Trump. That as we head towards the beginning of his hush money criminal trial on Monday. Plus, a former U.S. ambassador appearing in court, accused of acting as a secret foreign agent of Cuba. We'll have more on that high level spike case. The White House calls it a real and viable threat, and has all of Israel on edge right now. We begin with Israeli preparations underway this hour for a possible attack by Iran. Israel is on high alert fearing retaliation for this deadly strike on Iran's consulate in Damascus last week. A top U.S. commander is in Israel today to discuss the threat, and Prime Minister Netanyahu has convened his war cabinet. The U.S. warns Iran or its proxies could carry out an imminent attack on Israeli or U.S. assets in the region, even as it prepares for a possible new front. Israel is carrying out deadly new strikes in Gaza as the humanitarian crisis there deepens. The top U.S. humanitarian official now says it's credible to assess that famine is already happening in some areas in Gaza. Also this hour, we're just hearing from the IDF that Israel has intercepted rockets fired from Lebanon. I want to get straight to our correspondents in the region. You've got Jeremy Diamond life for us in Jerusalem and Oren Liebermann is at the Pentagon for us. Jeremy, let me start with you, of course, the world right now is on high alert for a possible attack from Iran. Just now, moments ago, about half an hour or so ago, we got rather the IDF had intercepted rockets fired from Lebanon, obviously, we know that Hezbollah has a strong presence in southern Lebanon. Hezbollah also an Iranian ally. How much should we be reading into that? Because Israel and Hezbollah have been trading attacks continuously, pretty much since the war started. Walk us through it.",

      "sentences": "Yes, that's right, Zain. There have been near daily barrages of rockets being fired from Hezbollahas well as Israeli strikes directed at Hezbollah positions in Lebanon over the course of the last several months. This was quite a significant barrage of rockets, about 40 rockets fired by Hezbollah, all of which were either intercepted or fell into open areas according to the Israeli military, there were also several explosive drones that were also intercepted by Israeli air defense assets. This was a significant barrage of rockets, but it is not. We should be clear, the expected Iranian response -- in response for that Israeli strike in -- on a consular building in Damascus just a week-and-a- half ago that killed a senior Iranian commander. We are still waiting to see when or if that response will come. We're in what form it will come. But I can tell you that Israeli officials are certainly on high alert preparing for a potential Iranian attack on Israeli soil. That is, of course, still an open question whether or not it will actually come on Israeli soil, and whether it will come directly from Iranian forces or perhaps from their proxies. That will, of course, determine the shape of an Israeli response to such an attack. And if indeed Iranian forces attack Israel on its soil, Israeli officials have already made very clear, including Israel's Defense Minister, that Israel will respond in kind. Today, the Israeli Defense Minister as well as the Chief of Staff of the Israeli military meeting with General Kurilla, the head of U.S. Central Command, trying to project unity between the U.S. and Israel in the face of a potential Iranian attack. Both of -- both Kurilla and Gallant are talking about the fact that Israel is preparing for a potential Iranian response here. And obviously, Israel conducting a situational assessment, the Chief of Staff saying that all Israeli forces are prepared for a potential Iranian attack.",

      "sentences": "Well, at this point, the U.S. has surged some additional assets to the region, we have seen them bolsterair defenses, especially ever since the attack on a facility in Jordan killed three U.S. service members. So, that is a continuing effort to make sure that U.S. forces in Iraq, Syria and elsewhere are prepared for any sort of attack that might come either at the hands of Iran or at the hands of Iranian proxies. And that's sort of a spectrum, and Jeremy laid this out that the U.S. is looking at, whether it's Iran or its proxies, whether it's somebody acting alone or in unison, how coordinated this is, and what the target is. Sources familiar with the thinking here believed that it will likely be a coordinated attack between Iranian proxies, likely directly against Israel. But that could come in, in various formats and in different locations. Still, they're looking at all of these different possibilities, you can see the level of coordination as Jeremy pointed out, General Erik Kurilla; the commander of U.S. Central Command has been there at least since yesterday. His trip was moved up specifically because of the expectation of retaliation to the Israeli strike last week on that Iranian consular building in Damascus. So, there is very much cooperation here and coordination in preparation for  an Iranian response of some sort that might come from Iranian proxies as well in terms of what that could look like, rockets, perhaps missiles, drones, all of those are being considered as the U.S. and Israel ready themselves for how this plays out. One of the key questions, of course, is when there has been an expectation that this could have already happened, but given Iran's promises, frankly, given Iran's threats, there is the expectation that it is coming. The question again, when and exactly how U.S. officials believe Iran is not looking for all-out conflict here, so, it will be calibrated at least to some extent, not to spark a regional war which neither the U.S. nor Iran want. But of course, any of these situations, Zain, come with the risk of miscalculation, and that's something, U.S.-Iran watching very closely as well.",

UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  This will be gone in ten days. He says his frustration unmistakable. I don't know how it's going to be enough for seven people. I've been suffering here, being stuck for the last six to seven months, and the U.N. hasn't brought me anything to at least satiate my hunger. Six months into the war, famine is creeping into parts of Gaza. Humanitarian aid agencies have been sounding the alarm for months, but now amid ramped up U.S. pressure, Israel is suddenly taking major steps to increase humanitarian aid. \"We plan to flood Gaza with aid\", Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said this week, describing a new phase of humanitarian assistance that will see more aid flow into Israel's port of Ashdod and into Gaza via a   new northern crossing point. Overnight, the first trucks of food aid crossing into northern Gaza via that new crossing point.

All right, with his job hanging precariously in a balance, U.S. HouseSpeaker Mike Johnson is meeting today with former U.S. President Donald  Trump. The visit at Trump's Florida estate will center on pushing the false narrative that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. And the two are expected to call for a bill that would ban non-citizens from voting. But just to be clear though, that law is actually already on the books, non-citizens cannot vote at all in the U.S. at all in federal elections. The meeting comes amid calls from some House Republicans to remove Johnson from the speakership. CNN's Melanie Zanona joins us live now from Capitol Hill.

Now, this is really important moment for Speaker Johnson today as he travels down to Florida with his speakership on the line. On its surface, this press conference is about election, something Donald Trump obviously cares deeply about, but Johnson is going down there with a much bigger mission in mind, and that is to secure a stamp of approval from former President Donald Trump, whether that's explicit or more implicit, just by nature of appearing onstage with him. And interestingly, I think it's really telling here, that sources tell me that this press conference was Johnson's idea. Now, we're also told that people close to Trump say he is not interested in seeing another speakership fight. There is some concern that, that could really undermine Republicans heading into the election this November. And allies that are close to both Johnson and to former President Donald Trump have told Trump that he should either put out a statement supportive of Johnson or at least stay on the sidelines of the fight. But at the same time, the person who is agitating as Johnson is Marjorie Taylor Greene, who is one of Donald Trump's biggest cheerleaders and supporters on Capitol Hill. So, we'll have to see how this all plays out. And meanwhile, hanging over everything right now is the topic of Ukraine funding. That is something Marjorie Taylor Greene has warned Johnson against doing. Johnson has at this point said he is still committed to trying to address it in some way. And I'm told that some allies have encouraged Johnson to really keep Trump in the loop and try to get his buy-in for whatever they plan to do here on Capitol Hill as it pertains to Ukraine aid. So, just a clear recognition that Trump has the power not only to break or make that legislation on Ukraine, but also make Johnson's speakership, Zain.",

In this case, they're not going to be asked questions about whether they voted for Trump in the past or might vote for him in the future. And they're not going to be asked about their party registration or political contributions as well, but they are going to be asked about activism if they adhere or follow any groups in the United States who are extremists, either on the left or the right, and how much they are feeling about Donald Trump in the criminal justice system. Do they feel he has been treated fairly here? If anyone says that they cannot set aside their personal feelings about Donald Trump to weigh the facts here impartially, those people are going to be asked to leave immediately. No further questions.

A former U.S. ambassador accused of spying for Cuba is expected to soon plead guilty in a Miami, Florida federal court. Victor Manuel Rocha is charged with acting as an illegal agent of a foreign government. The case has been described as one of the highest reaching and longest lasting breaches of U.S. government by a foreign agent. I want to bring in CNN's Patrick Oppmann, joining us live now from Havana. This is interesting because what he's accused of is that he spent more than apparently 40 years, four decades, Patrick, as a spy. Just explain to us how that was even possible. Why did it take so long? Potentially, obviously, he's just been charged at this point. But why did it take so long for him to get caught?",

And he's not the first U.S. government employee that hasworked for Cuba, not for money but apparently out of ideological reasons. And as you said, Zain, four decades before he was a State Department employee, before he was even a U.S. citizen, Victor Manuel Rocha is accused of essentially offering his services to the Cuban government. He was regarded very well by some of his State Department colleagues who I've spoken with. They felt that he was a conservative Republican who served his country well for decades, rose the rank of ambassador, served at various posts in the U.S. government, including at the National Security Council, posts that would have given him access to well-guarded secrets, particularly when it comes to Latin America or when it comes to Cuba. He served here in Havana at the U.S. Embassy at a crucial point when two Cuban exile planes were shot down by the Cuban government, so he would have been on the ground when that took place, certainly in a position to give years, if not decades, of secrets over to the Cuban government. That is what he is accused of doing. And the most interesting here, Zain, apparently it wasn't until after he had retired, essentially stopped being a spy because he was no longer in government, that the U.S. government found out, the FBI found out somehow, that he had worked for the Cuban government for all these years, and they sent in someone posing as a Cuban spy handler to reestablish contact with him. They were able to convince Victor Manuel Rocha that they were legitimate, and that's when he spilled, according to court documents, all these details about how he had essentially been a double agent over the years that is why he's faced allegations, charges of being an unregistered foreign agent, not really espionage because they don't have direct evidence linking him to that. But now that he apparently has agreed to plead guilty, part of this process will be he will have to sit down with the FBI spy catchers and walk through the years, the decades of how this all worked out, how he contacted, allegedly, his handlers in the Cuban government over the years, what secrets he shared with them, and it's going to take a very long time and will absolutely be devastating for the U.S. government, for the State Department, to find out what he gave the Cuban government over the years because he had access to so much.",
