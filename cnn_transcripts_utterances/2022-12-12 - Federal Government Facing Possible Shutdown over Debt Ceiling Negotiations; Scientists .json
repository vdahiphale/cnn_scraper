Democrats are looking to seal the deal on a full-year spending plan, but some Republicans may be trying to buy time until January.CNN's M.J. Lee is live at the White House this morning. M.J., what is the White House's sense of where these talks stand and if any progress is being made? M.J. LEE, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Kaitlan, we know that everyone involved in the negotiations had a very busy weekend. One official I was talking to yesterday who has been involved in these talks said this time of year is the time of year when there is no weekend for people who work on these appropriations matters. The two sides are basically slogging through it right now. At this stage I am told the two sides are presenting to each other their various bottom lines. But by the end of the weekend they were still billions of dollars apart. And even though we sense that there was some progress made over the weekend, we know that there are serious disagreements, particularly on spending on some of these priority domestic items. Republicans have basically been saying to Democrats you guys have spent so much money already this year on things like COVID, climate change and health care, so you shouldn't get as much next year. And Democrats have responded in kind. This was money that was absolutely crucial and necessary, and that shouldn't affect how much we get to spend next year.",

KYRSTEN SINEMA (I-AZ):  So what does that mean? Well, in the Senate, we no longer have 60 votes, some would argue that we never had 60, because one of those was Joseph Lieberman. But, whatever. Yes, and Nelson, too, but really, Lieberman. So now, there's -- I think, as the President so eloquently said on Wednesday, there's none of this pressure, this false pressure to get to 60. So, what that means is that the Democrats can stop kowtowing to Joe Lieberman, and had said, seek other avenues to move forward with health reform. And so it's likely that the Senate will move forward with a process called reconciliation, which takes only 51 votes. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
