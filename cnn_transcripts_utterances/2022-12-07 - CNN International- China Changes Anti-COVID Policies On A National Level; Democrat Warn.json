      "sentences": "Is this the end of the road for Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo as he watches the action from the sidelines? We'll explore what's next for the football superstar.Three years into the pandemic, China is making sweeping changes to its strict coronavirus rules, largely backing away from its zero-COVID policies. Beijing says it's simply keeping pace with the times. Amongst the changes infected people with mild or no symptoms will now be allowed to quarantine at home. And people traveling from one region to another within the country won't need to be tested. Several cities had already begun to relax COVID rules. All of these following one of the biggest displays of public dissent since President Xi Jinping came to power in 2012. Ivan Watson tracking the changes from Hong Kong. Can we say now that zero-COVID is over, Ivan?",

They certainly -- they're not talking about zero-COVID right now, but they are talking about substantive changes and reducing the immense pressure that they have been putting on the Chinese people for months now.You went through a list of some of these changes, for example, allowing asymptomatic COVID patients and patients with mild symptoms to quarantine at home instead of being locked up in these vast quarantine camps where there have been reports of terrible conditions, terrible sanitary conditions as well. Take a listen to what more a senior official -- health official had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MI FENG, SPOKESPERSON, CHINA'S NATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION (through translation): Outside nursing homes, welfare homes, medical institutions, childcare institutions, primary and secondary schools and other special places, proof of negative nucleic acid results, health codes and travel codes will no longer be required. There will also be no more checks on people who move across regions. People will no longer be required to carry out COVID testing upon arrival at another city. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That has been very difficult, just travel around the country for months now.So it gives you a sense of some of the burdens that people have been living under. Some of the reactions have been, well, there's some euphoria that you're seeing online. There is also some apprehension because the Chinese state media has been warning of the dangers of COVID-19 for months now saying it's this terrible, terrible thing. So there is some anxiety from some people in China that, oh, now we could get it and this could be really dangerous. There's a run on over-the-counter medicines, for example, at some pharmacies right now. One of the rules that was presented was that pharmacies have to be able to sell things like cold and fever medicine, anti inflammatories, those were restricted under the previous harsh COVID rules. Now they should be sold easily. As much as there is excitement, I think for some people and hopes that this could start to lift a moribund economy where you have high unemployment among the youth in China, there are also some realities coming. And that is that the Chinese population experts say, has very low immunity to COVID. And Omicron is spreading right now. And one of the biggest concerns is that China has high vaccination rates, but very low vaccination rates among the elderly. For instance, only about 23 percent of Chinese citizens over the age of 80 are fully vaccinated. That's roughly 8.4 million very vulnerable, unvaccinated people. And when you're talking about a country of 1.4 billion people, if there is a big wave of COVID cases, you could potentially see some epidemiologists are warning, some high numbers of deaths and real pressure on the health care systems. That is the other side potentially, of this coin as China starts to at last loosen up. Max?",

      "sentences": "That's right, Max. This is hugely consequential most notably, for Democrats on Capitol Hill. They are waking up this morning with essentially a little more breathing room. This is going to make a very real difference for them on Capitol Hill.In the Senate, we saw their numbers go from a majority at 50-50, tie there with Vice President Kamala Harris been able to break the votes. So essentially 51 to 50. Now they're gaining up of seat, they're picking a seat, and that's just so much more valuable to them. Now, they have 51-49 majority. And that essentially gives them what many Democrats here are referring to as a cushion. They have a lot more leverage, a lot more breathing room going into this upcoming congressional session. Now, how does that play out on the Hill in practical speaking? It plays out by them being able to fast track legislation by Democrats being able to get through the President's nominees and judges much quicker and it essentially takes away the power for one lone person, one lone senator to stand in the way of blocking legislation, and that essentially will make for Democrats it much easier. And this also gives potentially Vice President Kamala Harris a little more time in her hands. She, over the last few years, has been coming up to Capitol Hill to cast those type breaking notes that Democrats needed for a lot of votes. So she likely will be freed up of that job. Although, we expect to see her occasionally up on Capitol Hill and put simply one Democrat close to the White House. Wrapping up last night's election victory said it means a lot, it certainly means a lot for Democrats ability to get their legislation through. So the White House certainly celebrating, Biden calling Warnock last night to congratulate him and we will hear in just a matter of a few hours on Capitol Hill. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer speaking out about the election results, Max, of course, with his cushion of a victory and newfound majority in the Senate.",

Republican won, but -- excuse me, but that was not something that they were able to lock up in the Senate seat with Herschel Walker.And that was, of course, a person who had a very close relationship with former President Donald Trump. That was his candidate that he put forward, much to the chagrin of many Republicans in the national party. And so I think they're going to be looking at it and say, we have to find quality candidates and again, it's one more candidate that Trump backed in midterms that lost. Max?",

Mr. Trump and his family weren't charged in the case but the Trump organization could face a maximum fine of around $1.6 million. Trump organization attorneys say they will appeal. Ukraine says Russia is resorting to cheap methods by using Iranian native drones. It comes as a Ukrainian military says it shut down 14 of those attack drones overnight. Meanwhile, there are reports the southern and eastern areas of the country including Russian-occupied Donetsk are under heavy shelling. The regional military official in Kherson says two civilians were killed. And a local official says the Zaporizhzhia region was hit with drones and missiles, injuring three people including a 15-year-old girl.

Police stage raids across the country Wednesday in what German media described as one of the country's largest actions against extremists. Prosecutors say members of the group called Reich Citizens movement, followed conspiracy myths, and QAnon ideology. Let's bring in CNN's Nic Robertson for more on this developing story.

The Interior Minister today said that more than 3,000 police were involved in what he called a dangerous operation, a dangerous mission across 11 different states within the country.So the way that it's understood at the leadership level in Germany, this is a violent group ready for violent action. And if you look at the way even some of the forensic investigators in some of the video we have where arrest took place in Berlin, they're wearing flak jackets over their forensic suits. And I think that certainly gives you the impression there that this could have been a violent takedown of the 25 that they've taken into custody already, 22 of them, I believe, to be members of this group. Three of them, I believe to be supporters of this group. The Interior Minister described the group as having violent fantasies, and, you know, conspiracy ideologies. The way that it's been framed is very much like QAnon but in essence, this group Reichsburger is the German word for it, if you will, believe that the German state is illegitimate, and it appears as if they had an intent to overthrow it. Now the investigations will reveal how close they were to trying to perpetrate any potential acts towards a violent coup. But at the moment, as you say, Max, this is being seen as the largest in recent history, scale operation of this type. 27 though, still members or associates of those groups that apparently on the run as best we know.",

His team beat Switzerland in an astonishing 6-1 victory at the Qatar World Cup on Tuesday, but that wasn't down to the football superstar. He was dropped from the starting lineup, and in his place, a new Portuguese star was born. Let's take a closer look.First of all, normally the attention ahead of the match is on the pitch. Here it is. All the cameras around Cristiani Ronaldo on the bench there singing the national anthem from the sidelines. Now, after that, there was a hattrick, an incredible hattrick from the guy that replaced him. He is Goncalo Ramos and he became an absolute superstar as a result. As you can see from the newspapers, he is the big figure there. You have to try and find Cristiano Ronaldo mentioned from there, mentioned in a small image of him over there. It's completely unheard of in Portuguese football coverage and indeed World Football coverage. Let's bring in World Sport's Alex Thomas for more on all of these, because it was an incredibly bold move by the manager to replace Ronaldo, but it paid off.",

You've a second spell at United that went horribly wrong.We've seen the full circle of Ronaldo's career now being dropped from an international game for the first time since 2004, Max. And the revelation was not only Goncalo Ramos, the youngster who came on and scored the first hattrick in the knockout stage of a World Cup since 1990. And the first time Portugal had scored more than two goals in any knockout match since 1966. But it was also what it told us about Ronaldo's career, that extraordinary still image you showed us a few moments ago. Of all the photographers gathered around him as he wore the yellow babe of those substitutes on the bench waiting to come on. He didn't get on the pitch later, but didn't have much impact. The match already won. And in such incredible style 6-1, not just a thumping of Switzerland when in recent gains between the two countries that had been quite close, but also suddenly completely reinventing how we view Portugal's chances of actually winning the World Cup. Here we are two and a half weeks in, Max. And after 32 teams started the events, we're down to just eight. The quarterfinals set to get underway this weekend.",
