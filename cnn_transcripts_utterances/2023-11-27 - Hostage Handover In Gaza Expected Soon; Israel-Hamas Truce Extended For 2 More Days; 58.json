      "sentences": "I'm Brianna Keilar in Washington, and we are following breaking news. A diplomatic source now tells CNN that the handover for the fourth group of hostages in Gaza should be complete within the hour. Earlier, there were significant delays over today's list of hostages. This news coming, as we learn, from Qatar, who has been obviously instrumental in the investigation, these talks, that the temporary truce between Israel and Hamas is now extending for another 2 days.So far, 58 hostages have been set free over the last three days, 58 hostages from Gaza, that number including 40 Israelis, most of these women and children. And in keeping with the current agreement, Israel has released 117 Palestinians from prison, women and people 18 and under in those releases. Hamas says it now has the list of prisoners to be released later today, while Israel has notified the families of the hostages who are expected to be freed today. We do have a team of correspondents tracking all of the latest developments. Let's start now with CNN's Jeremy Diamond. He is at the Karem Shalom border crossing in Israel. That is near Gaza and Egypt. Jeremy, have there been any updates on this latest group of hostages that are set to be released? JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT Well, Brianna, our understanding is that the process is indeed underway and that there is a major way for these hostages to be released and to then be able to cross into Israel. We know that there were a number of ongoing issues earlier in the day that appear to have delayed the release of these hostages. We know that this morning, the list that the Israeli government received with the hostages was deemed, according to a source that I spoke to, as unacceptable. Part of that appears to have to do with an issue that has arisen before, which is the issue of children being released without their mothers. There were a number of ongoing conversations earlier in the day between Israel and Hamas mediated by the Qatari government with the assistance of the United States also being heavily involved in those discussions today. And I'm told that following those discussions, additional mothers were indeed added to that list of 11 hostages who we expect to be released from Hamas custody tonight. Now, in addition to that, we also understand that this truce has now been extended for an additional 2 days by Israel and Hamas, both parties agreeing to extend the truce. And what that will mean, Brianna, is additional hostages being released, 10 hostages per day, as well as 30 Palestinian prisoners released per day from Israeli prisons, and of course hundreds of additional trucks of aid entering Gaza, along with a continuation of the pause in hostilities. All of this coming, as we have watched over the last several days, Brianna, as we have seen some days where this has proceeded very, very smoothly, other days where there have been issues, as there have been today and as there were on Saturday. And on Saturday as well, Brianna, there was that issue of mothers and children not being released together in at least 1 case. That was the issue of the case of Hila Rotem, who was taken hostage by Hamas on October 7th alongside her mother, Raya, but she was released without her mother. Ultimately, it appears that Israeli officials decided it was better to get her out rather than to not have her, rather than to not have her, rather than to not have Hila be released. And so that release ended up proceeding as it was. But we are standing by here at the Karem Shalom, where we know that for several days, those hostages have crossed into the Rafah crossing and then come to the Karim Shalom crossing and made their first steps onto Israeli soil here.",

So, from an Israeli perspective, we're going to wait until we see those hostages, Israeli hostages, on Israeli soil before we comment. You know sadly, we know exactly who we're up against. We're up against Hamas, a brutal terror organization that on October 7th came over our borders and killed children in front of their parents, parents in front of their children, beheaded babies, burnt whole families alive. So, we know exactly who we're dealing with. And we're going to wait until we have our people on Israeli ground before we comment further on that.",

It has been from the beginning of this agreement, which wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for President Biden and we really appreciate that support and the support of the American people. But we know that if Hamas wants to continue, then we'll get those hostages back tonight. And then every day going forward, if they provide 10 hostages, they get an extra day.And we know what's got us here. We've got to the point where we're at because Hamas is feeling the pain because we put up the pressure on Hamas, both militarily and diplomatically. They needed a break. They were begging for a break. And we desperately want our hostages back. And so, we continue -- we will do this humanitarian pause and then continue forward with our twofold mission, which is still to destroy Hamas and to bring home all 240 hostages from Gaza.",

It's happening on a fourth day of a pause in the fighting. The truce, the temporary truce, has brought great relief to Gazans who have withstood 7 weeks of unrelenting bombardment. But it also has allowed them to come out to the streets to truly see all that's been lost. Seeing as Ben Wedeman is joining us from Jerusalem right now. Ben, Gaza before October 7th. Compared to Gaza of today. Give us a sense, and you've been there many times. How are people there reacting?",

And that's what many people who are emerging from their shelters are coming out to find. That the city that they thought they knew, the areas, the towns they thought they knew are unrecognizable. Many of the people, of course, have fled to the south. There are about a million people staying in UN schools, taking shelter there in the southern part.And in those areas, what people are doing are scrambling to get supplies. They're going to UN centers where they're handing out bags of flour. They're going to other areas where there is cooking gas available. Others are just going out and buying whatever they can. Because the anticipation is that, yes, the truce has been extended for another 2 days. But all the messages coming from the Israeli government, all the statements from senior officials are that this truce is not open-ended. That there will be more to come. Now, as far as the exchange this evening, we understand from Hamas that they have received a list of 33 Palestinian prisoners and detainees who will be released this evening. This includes 3 women and 30 teenage boys. Now, it will take time for them to cross over. But we are expecting, yet again, raucous celebrations by many people happy to see their relatives out of prison. At the same time, it's worth noting that, according to the Palestinian Prisoners Society, which is an NGO that looks after the affairs of prisoners, since the truce went into effect on Friday, 260 other Palestinians have been detained by the Israelis.

So, they are very scared, but hoping that our support, that the support of the international community and that this humanitarian pause will hold for just a little bit longer so they can heal their immediate wounds, which are sometimes life-threatening and they're not getting the right health care that they need. But it's full of fear, uncertainty again, and just that desire for alittle bit more normalcy in their lives again because they are not able to go to school again. They're not able to be with their families and friends and their house has been destroyed. And all they see is rubble and dust and violence. So we can't say they are recovering yet, but we can say that as a child normally does, there's a lot of hope, but also a lot of fear.",
