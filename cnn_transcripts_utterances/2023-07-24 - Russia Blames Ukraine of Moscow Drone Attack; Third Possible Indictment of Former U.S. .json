Just ahead on \"CNN Newsroom\", drone strikes hit two buildings in the center of Russia's capital. Moscow is blaming Ukraine for the attack. We're live in London with details.As a third potential indictment blooms, some of Donald Trump's GOP rivals try to downplay his role in the January 6th insurrection. We will look at what they are saying and where it all goes from here. Plus, no relief from the heat in the U.S. southwest, the forecast plus what other parts of the country can expect. Good to have you with us. Well, we begin this hour in Moscow where Russia is claiming to have thwarted a Ukrainian drone attack in the early hours of Monday. This video, geolocated by CNN, appears to show one of those drones flying above the city. The Defense Ministry says it intercepted two of them and that they subsequently crashed in the capital. Moscow's mayor says two non-residential buildings were hit but there were no reports of serious damage or casualties. The alleged attack happened a day after Russia carried out a fifth wave of strikes in the Ukrainian port city of Odessa. At least one person was killed and several cultural landmarks were damaged. And just moments ago, another Russian attack was reported on Ukrainian ports, this time along the Danube River. And CNN's Clare Sebastian is following all the latest developments for us. She joins us now live from London. Good morning to you Clare. So, what more you learning about these drone strikes on Moscow?",

Just like we saw at the beginning of July, the Ministry of Defense saying that they were able to thwart these attacks using what they call electronic warfare, essentially jamming. But they are overtly blaming Ukraine, the Ministry of Defense saying this was an attempt by what they call the Kyiv regime to launch a terrorist attack.And as you said, we're talking two locations. One in the center of Moscow where state media reported debris was found. We could see a road closure on a local traffic map earlier this morning, which seemed to be an area, you know, really quite central area, close to the Ministry of Defense building. That road closure appears to have been lifted now. And separately in the south -- southern part of the city, a building looks like it's been damaged, a non-residential building, according to the mayor of the city. Residents coming out, having a look, seems to have been fairly loud in some areas. Take a listen to what this one resident had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) POLINA, MOSCOW RESIDENT (through translation):  I was asleep and was woken up by an explosion. Everything started to shake. It felt like the whole building had come down. I looked out of the window. I live in the neighboring building on the side where there's less damage and it felt strange. The damage was so minor. Well, okay, not minor. Any explosion is scary. But it sounded worse than it looked, as it seemed like the whole mall had exploded. After that, I looked online and saw the amount of damage from this side and we came and had a look from here.

Even Trump himself believes the indictment is coming. The question is when.A third indictment could also be a game changer in the battle for the Republican presidential nomination. But some of Trump's Republican challengers are shrugging off his role in the January 6th insurrection. Among those questioning the case against him, his former vice president, Mike Pence.

But I think what he is looking at is the calendar. And if you listen to what his team is saying inside the courtroom, particularly in Florida, largely what they're fighting about is timing. And they know that the longer they can delay, the better it is for them. The Department of Justice knows this is the most highly publicized case that they will ever bring when it comes to the Mar-a-Lago case. And if they do in fact bring one related to the 2020 election, then that also will of course be very highly publicized and they are, I think, in the process of dotting their i's and crossing their t's.",

It's hard for the everybody else to try and make the case that they're better when Trump is still in the running.

So, we've woken up to the news that a fire that started in Corfu yesterday is also underway.We understand this is also a large fire and it's prompting some evacuations on that island as well. So, what we have at the moment is two of Greece's most popular tourist islands in the mid of peak season, basically carrying on evacuations. On the island of Rhodes, we've had about 19,000 people evacuated so far, about 16,000 by road, 3,000 by sea, and thousands of people are now leaving the island, some moving to other tourist resorts around the country. We have spoken to the fire service this morning. Unfortunately, the weather news is not good. It's not promising at all. Where I am there's already strong winds in the area and the situation are going to deteriorate further during the day. You have to understand that Greece has been looking at incredible temperature scorching heat of over 40 degrees Celsius for days now, 104 Fahrenheit, and this is a situation that's going to continue. All we're hearing is new fires here, new fires there, some bigger than others, but certainly the one in Rhodes, the one in Corfu and a couple of other fires in greater Athens and the island of Evia, an area that burned down very strongly a couple of years ago, are the worst ones to look at now. Authorities are telling us that they are taking care. So far, we've had -- luckily there have been no victims and we have not heard of any severe injuries, just some people taken to hospitals and of course tourists trying to make their way back home, Rosemary.

That's what these political parties were vying for in this election. But as you say, none of them, not one party, got the 176-seat majority. Now, there is a coalition government already in place for the last four years under the socialist leader Pedro Sanchez, the current prime minister. So, Spain is not completely new to coalitions.And this election was framed around would there be a coalition of the right with the center-right main conservative party and possibly the far-right Vox Party as one option or a repeat of the prime minister with a variety of other leftist parties, smaller leftist parties beside the socialists? Because of this mixed result where the conservatives can claim they won but not getting close enough to do a deal. If you look at the faces on the people last night outside the two- party headquarters, which I did, and you look at the faces of the leaders, here's what happened. The Spanish left was really trying to keep the far-right Vox Party out of Spanish government. It would have been the first time since the death of Francisco Franco nearly 50 years ago that far-right was in the government. That hasn't happened so far. And the conservatives were trying to get in. The conservative leader said he wanted to get in and govern alone. He didn't get anywhere close to having enough seats. The socialists are now saying they will talk to all these other smaller parties. The arithmetic and the size of the parties is more complicated than four years ago. So, we can expect some tough negotiations going on right here in the heart of the summer tourist season. So, there may be a little bit of a break. The horse trading will begin. And in about a month's time in August the parliament convenes again, comes off a vacation, and tries to get an investor -- an investor to vote, the king of Spain, King Felipe VI, the head of state, has to see each party. and try to propose a candidate who might possibly be able to get through with investiture.

Is that a sign that there's now more parity in a game that has been rapidly expanding across the globe, or perhaps nerves have been playing a factor in the early action?On Sunday in Wellington, South Africa were going for their first ever World Cup result and they came pretty close against Sweden who are the world's third ranked team. Hilda Magaia opened the scoring for South Africa early in the second half. But Sweden responded by pouring more players into their attack and they were awarded when Frido Rolfo's effort was deflected in for an own goal. South Africa had lost all three of their previous World Cup matches. They would have settled for a point here, but it wasn't to be as Amanda Ilestedt scored a last-minute winner. The Swedes just edged it, going top in group G. In Group B, the 2017 European champions in the Netherlands shaded the World Cup debutantes, Portugal by a goal to nil. Stefanie van der Gragt's first half header turned out to be the winner. Portugal only had one shot on goal throughout the entire match. The Dutch will play the USA, the defending champions next. That is a repeat of the 2019 final. Also on Sunday, a massive result for the reggae girls of Jamaica who went toe to toe with one of the best teams in the world. The fifth ranked France. Jamaica's players really struggled to get into this tournament. They had to start a GoFundMe page in order to make all the ends meet and make the trip to Australia and New Zealand and they repaid everyone who believed in them with their first ever World Cup point. The French team have made it to the quarterfinals in each of the last three World Cups, but they are expected to go deeper this time. But this really was a frustrating experience for them. Kadidatou Diani peppered the goal with a couple of headers, and she also had the frame of the goal laid on but they couldn't break down the Jamaica team who celebrated wildly at the final whistle celebrating a monumental performance and a massive result. Their manager put into perspective just how significant an achievement this was. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
