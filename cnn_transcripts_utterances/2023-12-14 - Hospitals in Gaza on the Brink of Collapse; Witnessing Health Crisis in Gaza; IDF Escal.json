Please head to the website to find out more of their reporting. Despite the catastrophic toll of the war, Israel's military is pressing on with its offensive against Hamas. The IDF says its forces are backing Hamas fighters in close quarters across Gaza. And Israeli officials are telling civilians in Khan Yunis, yet again, to move away from certain parts of the city for their safety. This, as a U.S. intelligence assessment says nearly half of the Israeli munitions dropped on Gaza so far have been unguided, so-called dumb bombs. We're covering the story from all angles for you. We've got Alex Marquardt in Tel Aviv as well as Natasha Bertrand joining us from the Pentagon in the U.S. as well. Alex, great to see you. Natasha, good to have you with us. Alex, I'd like to start with you. Jake Sullivan is currently meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu as well as other government officials. This is important. This is in the greater context of what we've heard from President Joe Biden earlier this week, talking about indiscriminate bombing, saying that the Israelis need to be more careful with what they do in Gaza.

That undercuts significantly the argument that Israel has been making, that it's doing everything it can to protect civilians on the ground. Just to take a step back here, according to this intelligence assessment, the Israelis have dropped 29,000 air to ground munitions on Gaza over the last two months, just a really staggering figure in and of itself. But of those 29,000, nearly half have been these imprecise and guided dumb bombs that the U.S. has criticized. Other countries were using in war zones, including Russia's use of these dumb bombs in Ukraine. However, it remains unclear why the Israelis are using these dumb bombs in Israel. They have been given by the United States bomb kits that can transform many of their bombs into smart bombs. That could make their targeting a little more precise. To be clear, precision munitions are not a be all, end all of precise targeting. They can still miss their targets. But it's such a densely populated area, as Gaza, literally a few feet can determine whether or not someone lives or dies. Using the most precise munitions that you have in your arsenal is extremely important. So when Jake Sullivan is there today, you know, he's going to be urging the Israelis to be more precise and targeted in their operations. The reality is that the U.S. understands, according to this intelligence assessment, they have been using these dumb bombs for months. And the White House has continued to say that they believe Israel is trying to protect civilians.",

There is disagreement right now over a 50 billion euro package to Ukraine to help sustain this economy and further discussions about lethal aid. This is essential if Ukraine has hope over the next year of being able to stabilize and fight off the Russian invasion. Even more so than that, symbolically, the question of whether or not the E.U. will greenlight Ukraine beginning its accession discussions into the European Union, starting officially the path to it becoming a member. This has always been a goal of Zelenskyy's. Right now they see it as a very important symbolic achievement that would raise morale if this were to be started. But the critics, particularly chief among them, Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orban, say that Ukraine is fast-tracked unfairly. Orban is a close ally of Putin's in Europe.

White House officials have been saying for weeks that there have been tough conversations happening behind the scenes.

That is where the president and the prime minister appear to diverge. In addition to the president continuing to press for a two-state solution.

She had her own conversations, where she too pressed for the reconstruction of Gaza and for a postconflict plan for Gaza, including, again, the two state solution.
