While the U.S., NATO and EU all agree, no matter what, Ukraine is not at fault. They placed the blame purely on Russia for waging an illegal war in Ukraine. And that war, well, is still waging. On Thursday, Russian forces fired dozens of airstrikes, well, struck targets in Dnipro, Odessa, as well as Kharkiv. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says Moscow is hell bent on destroying Ukraine's energy infrastructure just to make civilians suffer. Our Nic Robertson joins us tonight from Kyiv this hour.

It's not clear how long this will take to sort through the debris and make the determinations of what, exactly what is discovered. But it certainly is a case now of Zelenskyy, Ukraine being aligned with the same positions as NATO and its allies, and partners and very much of that same opinion. That Russia should be held to account. Part of the investigation will likely look at the flight path of the Russian missile, with a view to try and take an assessment.

A Dutch court has just convicted two Russians and a  Ukrainian of mass murder, for carrying out the missile attack eight years ago that downed Malaysian Airlines flight 17. Two hundred and ninety eight passengers and crew members were aboard when the plane was hit over Donetsk by what investigators say was a Russian-made missile. The court sentenced the two former Russian operatives and Ukrainian separatist to life in prison and awarded the victims' families more than $16 million. CNN's Nada Bashir has more for you from London. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER (on camera):  Well, more than eight years since the tragic downing of flight MH 17 over eastern Ukraine. A Dutch court has now found three men guilty of the murder of 298 people on board the Malaysia Airlines flight including two former Russian Intelligence officers and a Ukrainian separatist leader. The judge stating that the consequences of their actions was so severe and attitudes so detestable that a mere time-prescribed sentence would not suffice. The fourth suspect was also acquitted. Now, international investigation found that MH 17 had been shot down by a Russian surface-to- air Buk missile fired from a village in eastern Ukraine, then held by pro Russian rebels. Prosecutors say the launch belonged to Russia's anti aircraft missile Brigade, and was returned to Russian territory the day after the strike. And Moscow has repeatedly denied any responsibility for the incident. Speaking on Thursday, Russia's Foreign Ministry's spokesperson said Moscow will examine the Dutch court's position. The trial marks the first time that an independent judgment has been made on the 2014 incident that the men were tried in absentia and are unlikely to serve time. But for the loved ones and relatives of those who were killed on board flight MH 17, this remains an important milestone in an eight-year battle for justice. Nada Bashir, CNN, London.

He is a current member of the leadership team.

There's a lot of concern, Isa, that this is just the beginning, that we might be seeing more of these death sentences in the coming days. More than 14,000 people have been arrested, more than 1,000 of them in Tehran alone and in Tehran province have been indicted. And several people, according to Amnesty International, are also facing these charges that carry the death penalty in Iran. So lot of concern when you're talking about a country where rights groups say, there's no such thing as fair trials, where authorities are accused of using torture to extract confessions and where defendants, in many cases, don't get access to lawyers. But Isa, these death sentences, the arrests, the rising death toll, more than 340 people, according to the latest figures coming from human rights organizations, none of this seems to be stopping the protests. We have entered the third month of this national uprising and we are seeing more protests across the country, some of the most widespread protests that we've seen today and some of the most intense demonstrations we have seen so far. And it seems that the government's brutal crackdown is not working. What it seems to be doing is making people angrier and more determined to continue protesting and to call for regime change, Isa.",
