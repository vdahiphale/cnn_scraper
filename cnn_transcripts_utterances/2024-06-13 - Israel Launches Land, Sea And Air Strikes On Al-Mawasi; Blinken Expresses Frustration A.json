Israel disputes that number, claiming it's less than 100. And many were militants.Last week, at least 40 dead and Israeli airstrike on a U.N. school again, that's from Gaza officials, a strike which Israel says was precise and targeted and killed at least nine Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants. At the end of last month, at least 45 people killed in a camp for displaced Palestinians in Rafah, again, that's according to Palestinian officials in Gaza. Israel says it was another precise and targeted airstrike. You know, the accuracy of the numbers can be debated. And you and I have discussed that in the past and the credibility of the source question. But you know, the strikes are happening and people are dying over and over again. And there's a common theme here. These are often civilians in areas that are meant to be safe a U.N. school, or just camp for just, you know, for displaced Palestinians the safe zone. Are the Hamas leaders which have been killed, are they worth the price being paid not just in the dead and the injured Palestinians. But in the growing international isolation which Israel is now facing? KATZ: Look Israel's facing and you said it right, John, Israel is facing a wall of condemnations and growing diplomatic isolation. But I think that Israel also has to do what's right for its own security. And after the October 7 massacre, it has to be able to prevent Hamas from ever being able to do this again. The one thing I would say and again, we never really know the phone numbers, because they come up from Gaza, they come from Hamas. But what we do know is yes, there is a tragedy that is unfolding in Gaza. And it's unfolding on the Palestinian civilians who are not involved in these terrorist activities. But the blood of the civilians is on Hamas' hands. And we saw that John over the weekend, or just a couple of days ago, sorry, with the Wall Street Journal report, where they had and received the writings of Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas, who basically saying, Tthis is what we want, we want the civilians to be killed because we want Israel to be isolated. We want Israel to come under diplomatic isolation. So this is part of Hamas' strategy. And the one thing I'll push back on is just that when the world sees that Israel goes in and rescues for its hostages were being held in apartment buildings by civilians or so called civilians. But if they're holding hostages, they're not exactly civilians. Israel goes in there and does what any country in the world would do the United States, the U.K., France, Germany, you name it to get that gets people comes under ferocious fire. Do we think that this is something that takes place in a sterile environment, it's like a laboratory, you knock on the door? And you say, give us back our people? And they just hand them over? Of course not. So Israel has to fight to get back its people. But that's sadly the way it is. And that is Hamas' responsibility for allowing this situation to be like this.",

And Israel does need to work very closely with its allies, because we're a country that is also highly dependent on the international relationships that we have, especially with the United States, which is our greatest ally in the world provides us with a lot of not only diplomatic support around the U.N. Security Council table, we rely on that diplomatic cover, and in general, helping us broker some of these deals that we need to see an end to the war and to get back the Israelis who have been taken hostage, but also for the supply of weaponry, for the supply of aircraft to be able to even prosecute this war to be able to defend ourselves.So definitely these relationships are super important. And that is this balance that the government needs to somehow manage. It's not simple. You mentioned those foreign arrayed elements in the coalition who are pushing for even more fighting and more of an Israeli presence in Gaza. This is not an easy task for Prime Minister Netanyahu to keep up with the war to be able to defend Israel to end it in a way that will bring back our people, but also to retain that important critical security and diplomatic alliance with the United States.",

The Chinese commerce ministry saying these new tariffs are what hurt bilateral trade and cooperation, they would hurt European consumers and industries. They make a mockery of the EU's pledge for green economic transformation, and then again vowing to take all necessary measures to protect Chinese interests and industries.Now, unlike the U.S. tariffs just announced by President Biden last month 100 percent on Chinese EVs, this is going to have a bigger impact because the Chinese EVs have almost no presence in the U.S. market but they have a 20 percent market share in the E.U. including both Chinese brands, but also European brands but also Tesla making cars here then exporting them back to the E.U. market. Now a lot of European economies and their carmakers also are much more entwined with the Chinese EV industry compared to their U.S. counterparts. Sweden's Volvo owned by a Chinese company, Germany, their biggest auto companies, Volkswagen, BMW and also their auto suppliers have a huge presence in China not only selling cars here, but also making EVs here cheaply and efficiently before exporting them back to their home markets. So that's why the Europeans are lot more concerned about potential retaliations from Beijing. That's why we have heard German Chancellor Scholz and a big names like Volkswagen already coming out publicly to oppose these new tariffs. That obviously plays very well into the Chinese playbook of divide and conquer in dealing with EU. But perhaps the biggest question is how effective these new tariffs would be given the amazingly low cost space of these Chinese EV makers. BYD the biggest name, for example, facing a new tariff of 17 percent. But a lot of experts say that's not going to affect their ability to make a comfortable profit margin in the EU, it has to be something like 50 percent to make a difference. So it's going to be very interesting to see what Beijing does next to given their months of threats and condemnations to have to do something, but they may want to exercise some restraints, given that very complex and nuanced picture in the EU.

SAIC which is state backed in China got the highest tariff that 38 percent.So it values and fluctuates based on one what the company is doing and to how they cooperate or did not cooperate with the Commission. The U.S. system is much different. It's a flat tariff 100 percent. Very straightforward. Now, of course, think about the difference between US and European imports of Chinese EVs, the U.S. imports total of their EV imports, about 1 percent come from China. In Europe, it's about 20 percent, it was almost zero before COVID. So think of that scale up just over the past four or five years.
