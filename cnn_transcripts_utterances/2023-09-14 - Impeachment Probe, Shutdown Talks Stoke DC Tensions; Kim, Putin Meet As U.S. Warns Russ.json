Mostly that is his impending legal issues that he has, but it is something that he's watching carefully and he's watching to see who has his back when it comes to this impeachment. The other part of this is that even if he's not obsessed with it, it is very clear that he is going to be somewhat at the center of this because he is at the center of the Republican Party. And when I talked to one member, they told me the other day, two days ago, that it doesn't really matter whether or not Trump is pushing and encouraging and twisting someone's arm, what matters is that if Trump says he wants something done, they know what he wants done and they're going to do it.

That is coming straight from Donald Trump's camp and Republican camp, saying that this is because Hunter Biden is not getting the same treatment, the Bidens are not getting the same treatment that Donald Trump himself is getting.That is a narrative that is breaking through to voters and Republican voters.
