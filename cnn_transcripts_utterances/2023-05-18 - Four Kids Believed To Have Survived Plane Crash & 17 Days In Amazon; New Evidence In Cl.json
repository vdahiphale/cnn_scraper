The young survivors had apparently built themselves a shelter of sticks and leaves.The Colombian forces found three adult bodies, reportedly including the children's mother, in the wreckage of their small Cessna plane. Joining us now to discuss and get some insight is survival expert and author, Dave Canterbury. Dave, thank you so much for sharing part of your afternoon with us. First, I just want to put the challenge that the kids are facing into context. You're talking about some of the densest rain forest on earth. What are they facing? DAVE CANTERBURY, SURVIVAL EXPERT &amp; AUTHOR: Well, the one thing I think you have to put into contact is these are indigenous people. They're tribal people, children of tribal people. So they probably have some knowledge of the local flora, fauna, things like that, and what they can use off the landscape. However, surviving a plane crash alone, that's phenomenal itself. And then the fact that they have the 4-year-old and an 11-month-old child becomes your anomaly because that child probably needs much more care than the older children do. The older children are probably leading this expedition out. Would they be better off staying in place to be found? I would say, yes, they probably would. However, they're probably thinking that if they keep moving toward water, water becomes the highway in the jungle. The closer they can get to water, the closer they are to being found.",

Maybe for survivalists it's an anomaly, but the whole situation seems like something out of fiction, right?And apparently, the weather isn't helping, either. There's a lot of rain falling in that area. How does that complicate the process?",

      "sentences": "Once the rivers start to swell, things like that, you have areas that are rapids. It makes it more difficult to navigate. Obviously, rivers are kind of the highways, so they'll be using those waterways to get to and from places, obviously to extract the survivors out, things of that nature.It's more different during torrential rains when those rivers are swollen.",

      "sentences": "Being a child, it's hard to say their thought process would be. From a survival standpoint, obviously, to understand what injuries they may have from the plane crash and attend to those injuries first.Once that is taken care of, it becomes a simple system of sheltering ourselves from any exterior elements, making sure we have water, and the torrential rains are going to add plenty of water, and then sustainable food, especially for the younger ones who require food more often. And then, are they going to navigate toward a waterway, like I said, or try to stay put. I tend to believe, because these tribal children were probably from a river-oriented tribe to begin with, they probably understand moving toward water is their best bet for rescue. Going from one body of water to a largest body of water -- to a larger body of water to hit the largest river they can find, to find something in the form of civilization or someone traveling to and from.",

Not to mention just the constant pestering of insects in general.And then the constant rain, which would be a large morale factor for someone like us, but for someone who lives in that day in and day out, probably not as much of a downfall in morale as it would be for someone like us. But I think that the fact these children are as young as they are, realizing a 13-year-old child growing up in that familiar will probably be similar to someone growing up around the eastern woodlands around the United States. They're going to know what to stay away from, what they can eat, what they can't eat, things like that. However, alone, without anyone around, definitely going to be a challenge.",

He talked about declassifying them, but he didn't need to.

They have also previously said that he had a standing order that everything would be declassified. The former officials have no knowledge of that.

The photo agency says that it is investigating but points out that accounts from photographers paint a slightly different picture.

And in one video, it is shown being pulled over by the police.\" Not surprising, of course, there are differing accounts here. We're hearing from a taxi driver who picked up the couple. He said that Harry and Meghan were nervous and scared in his car.

Meantime, convicted biotech fraudster, Elizabeth Holmes, has been ordered to report to prison by May 30th. Yesterday, the Theranos founder requested a pause on her 11-year sentence while appealing her conviction. The judge denied her request. The suspect gave authorities the slip for nearly 20 years, but now a man has finally been indicted for stealing a pair of the original ruby slippers that Judy Garland wore in the \"Wizard of Oz.\" Authorities claim he broke into the Judy Garland Museum in Minnesota in 2005, smashed a glass case and stole the iconic footwear. Jim? SCIUTTO: After multiple delays, the man charged in stabbing death of Cash App founder, Bob Lee, was arraigned today in a San Francisco court and will remain behind bars. Nima Momeni pled not guilty to plunging a kitchen knife into Lee's hip and chest in the early morning hours of April 4th. Surveillance video from that night captured Lee's final moments when he limped down the street, wounded, begging for help. But the back story in this case is starting to read something out of a dramatic crime novel. Police say Momeni and Lee actually knew each other, that they were in a car together just moments before the alleged attack. Lee was also friends with Momeni's sister. And at the time of Lee's death, a toxicology report showed drugs in his system. Additionally, Momeni has previously been accused of assault. CNN national correspondent, Natasha Chen, joins us with more. Natasha, prosecutors now believe the killing may have been premedicated. But they had known each other and had multiple contacts.
