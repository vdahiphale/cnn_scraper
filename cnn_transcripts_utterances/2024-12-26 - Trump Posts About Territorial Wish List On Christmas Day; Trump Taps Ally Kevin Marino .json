And I think what these patterns show us is that it's not really isolationism. In fact, if taken to their full fruition, this would really be expansionist, almost even imperialist in terms of their posture. But it would, set U.S. foreign policy goals on a different footing. It would be less about what NATO wants or what is good for that allied country and more about what's in the U.S. economic interests or sort of geostrategic interest.Having said that, no, I don't think that Trump can take back the Panama Canal. It is fully turned over to Panama and has been for, like, 30 years. Greenland is not for sale. It's not even clear whether Denmark could sell or give Greenland to the U.S., but Denmark has no intention of doing it. Greenland is not selling itself. Obviously, Justin Trudeau is not going to make Canada the 51st state. So none of those things is happening. So what is the purpose of it? It certainly seems like this is a few weeks, you know, before, the president-elect takes office, and it seems that he is trying to start both start up sort of negotiations for more favorable trade and tariffs and shipping kind of arrangements and perhaps some partnerships that would block or push China and Russia out in the Arctic Circle. But I don't know. Who knows? It could also be stoking the base, messaging, having fun, all of those things.",

One of his Christmas messages saying, \"Merry Christmas to all, including to the wonderful soldiers of China who are lovingly but illegally operating the Panama Canal.Also, to Governor Justin Trudeau of Canada, whose citizens' taxes are far too high. But if Canada was to become our 51st state, their taxes would be cut by more than 60 percent. Likewise, to the people of Greenland, which is needed by the United States for national security purposes and who want the U.S. to be there.\" There are no Chinese troops in the Panama Canal that you heard Alayna. I'm just talking about the, President of Panama talking about that. There is a Hong Kong subsidiary that operates 2 ports there. But China's influence, to your point, geopolitically is always a concern there. Justin Trudeau is dealing with his own set of domestic issues right now. I think Trump is strolling a little bit on that. And then Greenland, Akayla, on some of it, like, he's announcing -- he announces the ambassador to Denmark, he announces the ambassador to Panama. And in the announcement, he's like, oh, by the way, here's a hand grenade. Enjoy your assignment.",

But he's strategically thinking about when he's walking into those conversations.He knows that all of these countries want to maintain a relationship with the United States. And although he might not acquire Greenland or he might not take control of the Panama Canal, he might be able to negotiate lower tariffs, say, in Panama Canal. He might be able to have more investment in terms of those strategic minerals that are in Greenland. So these are the conversations that he could really use, and of course, he still has that tariff threat over Canada. But I think some of that is also just taking advantage of the political challenges that Justin Trudeau is having and sort of trying to drive the news cycle even Canada there.",

Over the course of the past 24 hours, it was the U.S. more in an information gathering mode and waiting to see what investigators from Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Russia had to say.But now a U.S. official familiar with the matter says the early indications are that it was a Russian anti-aircraft system that may well have downed this Azerbaijan Airlines flight. The flight was on its way from Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, to Grozny in Russia when something forced it down and it crashed in Kazakhstan about 3 kilometers or so from the city of Aktau. At least 38 of the 67 people on board, died in that crash according to Kazakh authorities. And, of course, the investigation underway to figure out exactly what happened. There is video from the aircraft itself that shows holes, what appear to be shrapnel or debris that punctured the side of the aircraft, but until now, it was pure speculation. Now the U.S. stepping in here, that official saying the early indications are that it was some sort of of Russian anti-aircraft system that may have struck and downed this aircraft. Again, the investigation here, the U.S.  looking at this as well, so there could be an update and a further assessment here. There's also no indication as to what type of system it may have been, whether it was a long range ant antiaircraft missile, something like an S-300 or an S-400 that we've seen used in Ukraine, or much more localized, something that is a shorter range anti-aircraft system that may have downed this aircraft. [12:20:00] Phil, it's worth noting, not the first time we have seen this. It was about a decade ago that a Russian backed separatist in Eastern Ukraine fired a missile that downed Malaysian Airlines Flight 17. So we have seen Russian missiles take down commercial aircraft in the past.",

Joining me now is Max Boot, Senior Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and the author of the very good book \"ReaganMax, one of the things, you know, Oren just said something that immediately comes to mind, I think, probably for everybody, which is the MH-17 shoot down back in 2014, which caused international outrage and then a sanctions regime. There were sanctions left out by the EU and the U.S. and, less than 10 years later, Russia invaded Ukraine. It didn't seem to do anything deterrence wise, it didn't seem to do anything to change behavior. What is the international community, if this ends up being the case, what Oren was just reporting, supposed to do here?",

And it certainly does seem to fit a pattern with the Russians, if this is in fact a Russian anti-aircraft battery that shot down this airplane from Azerbaijan. The Russians kind of shooting first and asking questions later and then lying about it.Because remember, a decade ago after the Malaysian airliner, the Russians claimed it was all a CIA plot. And now, of course, they're saying it was the plane just ran into a bunch of birds, which is doesn't sound very credible. But you're right to raise the question, what is the international community going to do about it. I think clearly what we need to do is to double down on supporting the Ukrainians and making the Russians pay a cost for their unprovoked aggression, whether it's against Ukraine or with shooting down evidently these civilian airliners. Are we going to do that? I don't know. We may go in the other direction once, President Trump takes office.",

Vance, the Vice President, who has said he doesn't care about what happens to Ukraine.Clearly, Trump is not going to negotiate it into the war before he takes office in less than a month. The question is, will he have any success once he takes office? And I think that remains very much an open question because, you know, it's easy for the United States to coerce President Zelenskyy and Ukraine because we are their main suppliers of weapons. But how is Trump going to coerce Putin and convince Putin whose forces are actually advancing right now in Ukraine to adopt a cease fire? And it's -- it has not been encouraging to see that Trump is very critical of president Biden's decision to allow the Ukrainians to use US made weapon systems, the ATACMS, ins inside Russia, because that is exactly the kind of leverage that we need against the Russians to convince them to stop advancing. And yet Trump, basically is willing to sacrifice that leverage before he even becomes president.
