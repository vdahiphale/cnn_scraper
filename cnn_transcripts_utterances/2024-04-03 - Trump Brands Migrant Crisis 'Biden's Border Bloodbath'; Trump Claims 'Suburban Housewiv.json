Matt Gorman, let me start with you because look, this is a thing that Donald Trump does regularly; tries to basically take some criticism of him, flip it around on its head, use it to his own advantage. He's also trying to do that. He's doing that in both places, right? Both a bloodbath language and trying to say Joe Biden is a threat to democracy. We've got two kind of things going on. One, an issue, immigration, where Republicans do have strength. But two, them trying to, you know, flip this messaging about democracy on its head. Like, swing voters do not buy that, we see in the polling. What do you make of how he was campaigning yesterday and whether he is in the space that he needs to be if they -- the space his campaign advisers want him to be. Let me put it that way.",

They want to rally up their base by, for lack of a better word, scaring them. You hear President Biden talk about how democracy is on the ballot. If Trump wins, democracy could potentially go by the wayside. You hear Trump using similar language while also calling for a bloodbath if he doesn't win the election.

And every year, the Biden administration has done something to commemorate that, last year, hosting 350 people for a celebratory reception.Obviously, this year, there is this feeling that they couldn't have that kind of a celebration. They needed to scale it back. And they ended up having plans for an iftar dinner to break the fast with a small group of Muslim community leaders. And it became clear to the White House in the course of my reporting with my colleague, Alex Marquardt and Kahlil Abdallah, that there just wasn't an appetite to have a dinner, to break bread at the White House when so many people in Gaza are on the brink of starvation. And so the White House canceled that plan to have the iftar dinner and scaled it back instead to have this much smaller listening session with the president, the vice president, the national security advisor, and other top officials. And it just -- it didn't go as planned. As you mentioned, I spoke with Dr. Thaer Ahmad. He is a Palestinian-American doctor from Chicago. He has spent time in Gaza, one of the hospitals that's been the target of Israel's. And he really described in great detail that devastation that he has witnessed: the patients he has taken care of who are dying, who are injured, and also who are displaced. And he made clear at the end of that that he felt, out of respect for his Palestinian-American community -- He was the only Palestinian- American invited -- that he needed to leave and walk out of the meeting. And President Biden told him he understood. I understand why you're doing this. And before he left, he handed him a letter from an 8-year- old orphaned girl in Rafah, really encouraging him to help Israel -- encourage Israel to stop its planned invasion of that area. And I think the moment just underscores -- we've seen that there is this political pressure on the president, but also there is now -- it's a real raw and emotional moment of tension between these communities.",

It's a multi hazard storm. This severe Threat continues today. damaging winds, large hail, isolated tornadoes possible from D.C. down to Tampa. You could see as the storm system continues to swirl, it will pack some winds that could really gust in the Upper Peninsula there of the Great Lakes.
