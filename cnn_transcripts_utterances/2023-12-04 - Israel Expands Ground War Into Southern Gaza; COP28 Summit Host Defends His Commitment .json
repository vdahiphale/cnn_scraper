Tonight, Israel is expandingits ground operations into southern Gaza as the humanitarian situation there grows worse by the day. We'll have the very latest on the conflict. Then, COP28 leader feeling the heat as he defends comments that alarmed scientists and sent shockwaves through the climate summit. We'll explain. Plus, Russian media reports police raiding gay venues across Moscow over the weekend after the country's top court ruled to ban the international LGBTQ-plus movement. That story ahead. Well, Israel is intensifying its war on Hamas, sending tanks rolling into southern Gaza as it expands ground operations to every corner of the tiny Strip. It's also escalating airstrikes in the south. Densely-populated areas like the city of Khan Yunis are under heavy bombardment, so is Rafah near the Egyptian border where people have been urged to flee. Many civilians are crowding into U.N.-run schools that have been turned into shelters. But the U.N. spokesman tells CNN nowhere is safe. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

A Hamas-run Health Ministry says nearly 16,000 people have been killed, mostly women and children. Well, let's get more now from CNN's Jeremy Diamond who joins us now live from Tel Aviv. Good to see you, Jeremy. So, there are still hostages in Gaza, and despite that, we are hearing heavy bombardment, even a school bombed. What is the U.S. doing to urge Israel to take a more restrained approach to its campaign in the south?",

The Secretary of State Tony Blinken speaking with Qatar's prime minister, to talk about the status of thosenegotiations, which really have stalled in recent days. There have effectively been no more negotiations since Friday, when both the United States and Israel as well as the Qataris were seeking to try and revive those talks after that temporary pause in fighting ended on Friday morning. But it appears that they are stalled over the same impasse that ended those negotiations on Friday, which is the saddest of the remaining women in custody who were held hostage in Gaza by Hamas and other militant groups. It appears that Hamas is unwilling to release those young women who they argue, are reservists because they are of that age when they could be called up by the Israeli military. The United States and Israel find that unacceptable, deeming them to be civilians. And Israel at this part -- point is unwilling to move forward in the negotiations to begin talking about that next category, which would be the men being held hostage in Gaza until Hamas releases all of the women that it still holds in its custody. And so, for now, it appears very unlikely that we will see another pause in fighting, and instead, Israel and Hamas are both turning to their military operations against one another. We have watched as Hamas has really ramped up its rocket barrages directed at Israeli cities over the last couple of days, and the Israeli military, of course, who we were just discussing has ramped up not only its bombardment, but also its ground operations in southern Gaza.",

And he said, \"the resumption of the military operations and its expansion in southern Gaza is repeating the horrors of the past weeks.\" In that statement, he said that news that the Israelis are now going to be focusing in on the south has spread panic, fear and anxiety among the hundreds of thousands of people who are already sheltering in the U.N. schools, in areas where they now think -- believe they have to leave. And what we're seeing is that it's not just the southern part of Gaza that's really been suffering, even in the north, over the weekend, there were some intense airstrikes, basically obliterating entire blocks. And of course, even though many people have fled to the south, there are still many people in the north, and they are suffering too. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WEDEMAN (voice-over): Look around, this is Gaza city's Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital where the wounded are treated in the open on wooden pallets. The emergency ward is already jammed. The courtyard is full of body bags, dozens were killed in a series of Israeli strikes Saturday, many more still under the rubble.

But at the same time, we have got this increasing risk of preventable deaths due to the spread of infectious diseases, and due to the failure to treat other common chronic diseases such as high blood pressure and diabetes and kidney failure and so on. The health system has been massively degraded across Gaza. From 36 functioning hospitals, we're down to 18. Most of them are just partially functioning right now.

We need to bring in appropriate levels of clean water in an emergency, the absolute minimum you would expect would be 7.5 liters of water per person per day. There are clear standards around humanitarian action. Toilets, just bringing in toilets and hand-washing stations. But we would need at least, at the most, 20 people sharing a toilet. Right now, as I said, in most -- in many of these settings, it's 200 toilets per -- sorry, 200 people are using one  toilet. So, we know what -- we know the standards, but we need the security.

So, that still well short over that one week period. We were still 2,000 trucks short of what was required. But of course, with the renewal of the offensive, no trucks went in for a couple of days, we've had more trucks going over the last 24 to 48 hours, but it's falling well short. The Rafah Crossing is insufficient to meet the needs. We need at least one other crossing, and the humanitarian action itself cannot meet the massive needs of the population. We need the commercial sector again revitalized.

It's still -- it is also something by the way that a lot of folks that we've been speaking to out of that community really saw coming. They believe that something like that was going to happen. Now, it was on the night from Friday into Saturday that a lot of these raids took place. Three raids specifically in the town of Moscow, and that's a little less than 48 hours after that verdict came down from the country's Supreme Court where several venues were raided. Now, it's not clear whether these were actually gay bars or clubs, but it certainly seems as though they were gay entertainment venues, as was said. We're seeing some of the video there on our screen right now, of past parades that took place, that were also then broken up by the police. But now, of course, that crackdown has very much intensified -- and you're absolutely right to point out that the authorities say that these were regular drug raids as they put it, now, they just checked the identities of these people. And certainly, from what we're hearing on the ground, nobody was indeed detained, but not only were identities checked and people frisked and searched, but also their documents were photographed as well. And that certainly is something that has a lot of folks from the gay and lesbian community very much concerned in Russia, as they believe there could be repercussions in the future. And of course, it is also part of a crackdown that really has been going on for several years, but has certainly once again intensified and gained in steam really, since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In fact, about a year ago, almost to the day the Russians put in place what they call the gay and lesbian propaganda law, essentially making it illegal to display any sorts of signs of being gay in public. So certainly, now declaring the LGBT movement to be extremist, declaring those who are part as they put it, of that movement, extremist as well, is definitely something that certainly intensifies that once again.
