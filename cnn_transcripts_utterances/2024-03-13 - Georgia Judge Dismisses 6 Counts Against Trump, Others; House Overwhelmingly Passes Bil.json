A Georgia judge just dropped three counts against him in the sprawling racketeering and conspiracy case in Fulton County. The DA there has accused Trump and more than a dozen others of trying to overturn his loss in Georgia's 2020 Election. Three more counts were dropped against a handful of his co-defendants, including Trump's former chief of staff Mark Meadows, who now has a single racketeering charge against him.The former president's attorney praised today's ruling, calling it \"correct.\" Trump, who racked up enough delegates yesterday to become his party's presumptive nominee, still faces 88 criminal charges in four separate cases at the state and federal level. Let's get the latest now with CNN Correspondent Nick Valencia, who has been following every step of this Georgia case. So Nick, walk us through this decision by Judge Scott McAfee.",

You get sweeping bipartisan unity on the Hill. Apparently, all this time that was all it took. This morning, the House overwhelmingly passing a bill that could ban TikTok in the U.S.It would require TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to split from the social media platform within about six months. Failing that, app stores would legally have to delist TikTok in America or face exorbitant fines. The bill heads to the Senate next. So let's bring in CNN Business Writer, Clare Duffy, to talk about this. Clare, leaders in Washington say American TikTok users are vulnerable to snooping and misinformation at the hands of China. What are China and TikTok saying?",

Now, TikTok itself is saying that it plans to basically continue trying to fight this bill and it's now pinning its hopes on the Senate. The company put out a statement earlier today following this House vote saying that this process was secret and the bill was jammed through for one reason: It's a ban. We are hopeful that the Senate will consider the facts, listen to their constituents and realize the impact on the economy, 7 million small businesses, and the 170 million Americans who use our service. So interesting, TikTok there seems to be signaling that if this bill is signed into law, it may challenge it in court, which could continue to drag out the process of actually implementing this legislation, Brianna.",

And if it doesn't, it will be banned from U.S. app stores, and those app store operators like Apple and Google could face major fines if they don't comply.Now, it's not clear whether ByteDance would actually agree to divest TikTok, this hugely popular app. And even if it was willing, it's unclear who - which American company would buy it. Many of the American major U.S. tech companies are already facing significant regulatory pressure over their size and market power. That could make it harder for them to make such a major acquisition. But I think the bottom line for U.S. TikTok users today is that the app won't be disappearing from their phone anytime soon. There's still a long road ahead for this bill to be passed, to be turned into law, and then actually to be implemented.",

Congressman, thank you so much for taking time out to talk with us about this. You are someone who has long had concerns, like so many lawmakers, about TikTok being owned by a Chinese company, also about its influence on children. I know that's something that you've mentioned in the past. Last year, you had said that you were not big on a TikTok ban. You did vote yes today. What changed your mind? REP. RICH MCCORMICK (R-GA): Well, first of all, it's not a TikTok ban, as was previously mentioned. It merely denies access for new users. It's a way to - and one of the things that changed my mind, of course, was actually yesterday when I had a bunch of 12- and 13-year-olds calling my office because TikTok directed in that way, and they were irate. Some were suicidal, someone were threatening. This is a huge lever to affect elections, to carry out a communist government's nefarious plans to basically change our youth in the way they think. This is manipulative. It's controlled by somebody who's not concerned at all in our First Amendment, somebody who can basically galvanize and motivate anywhere from 130- to 170 million people. We recently passed legislation that didn't allow them to own land in certain areas of the United States. Why wouldn't we protect our citizens as well from somebody who has nefarious plans to affect our children and even adults going forward?",

You talked about a ban on purchasing of land. TikTok is an app. Yes, but it's also, of course, a place where people express themselves, they're exercising their First Amendment rights.Do you worry about concerns that that raises? Obviously, there was that Montana ban that was blocked by the courts, for instance, in part because of First Amendment concerns. MCCORMICK: Yes. That's why some people object to it. I think you had 50 Democrats and 15 Republicans vote against this, most of it on the First Amendment rights issue. But quite frankly, there is nobody who's more against the First Amendment than the Chinese government and they do control things. If you wanted something that it was going to be against the Chinese, I'm sure the TikTok would not support that. If you wanted something that was going to be - maybe affecting our elections, they could use that to influence Americans. It's not First Amendment when somebody controls it overseas that has their best interest over our best interest. When you talk about First Amendment, you do want the First Amendment, but I don't think that's what they're interested in at all.",

But do you want to go into a nefarious actor?More important than that, because I know we get information from all sorts of applications, probably over 20 applications on your phone, my phone, they gather data on us all the time. But it's influence specifically directed by a communist party platform on elections, on our children, the fact that they could literally use it - and this is what convinced me and this would put me over the board, is yesterday when they literally used it, you had to put in the zip code, then put in a congressman's office to dial, which they did in order to get access to this application, and then they scream at me about how horrible this bill is. That's an influence. And if they do that with our elections, if they do with the way our children think, knowing that it's addictive knowing they can use it in nefarious ways, why wouldn't we want to put it in the hands of somebody who actually has intent to benefit our children rather than somebody who actually has no interest other than profit and propaganda.",

Look at this, 67 percent when two-thirds of the electorate believes you are very weak on a very important issue, that is not good news for you for either one of these candidates, and that might be part of the reason why this race could change so much. But let's just look historically, right? How far off of the polls at this point from the eventual margin since 1972? On average, they're off about seven points. That's it, much wider than the spread between Biden and Trump at this point. And the biggest difference ever was in 1980 when it was 28 points.
