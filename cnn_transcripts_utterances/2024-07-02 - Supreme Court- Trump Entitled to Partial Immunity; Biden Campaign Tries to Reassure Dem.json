And going back to Bush versus Gore, I mean, there's been significant cases throughout American history. But going back to Bush versus Gore, the two most, I guess, profound political cases were -- in American history have been decided on pretty strict partisan breakdowns, right? Whether that's good or bad, I'm not weighing in on it. That's just where the Supreme Court is. And it ought not be a surprise to anybody that this institution's public standing is failing. And this is why people tend to not have a tremendous amount of faith in institutions in America. But the Supreme Court in particular. [06:05:12] And it's a perfectly plausible reading of this decision that the Supreme Court put its thumb on the scale for a candidate. Now, they can argue, as the chief justice has throughout his career, that, well, we were staying out of the political process. We were making -- taking pains to protect the presidency and not -- you know, not weigh in on one side or another, but just look at the outcome. This was a stunning win for Donald Trump. Yes.",

And Justice Roberts wrote, essentially, that the -- that \"the exclusive authority over the investigative prosecutorial functions of the Justice Department and its officials, that the president has that exclusive authority, and that he may discuss potential investigations and prosecutions with his attorney general and other Justice Department officials.\" What has Donald Trump told us over and over again? Retribution. That he is going to seek to use the Department of Justice to exact retribution. So just right in this portion of the decision, Chief Justice Roberts is essentially saying Donald Trump has the power to go ahead and exact that retribution using the Justice Department.",

And it's -- we've cut off the bottom of that tweet, cut off the bottom of the graphic. It says \"Retruth if you want televised military tribunals.\"And what we just showed there was Liz Cheney's response. She says, \"Donald, this is the type of thing that demonstrates yet again that you are not a stable adult and are not fit for office.\" Doug Heye, as the Republican at this table, is this, do you think, a serious threat? Because there are some who are -- you know, will dismiss this kind of thing as like, well, we shouldn't take this so seriously. I'm curious what you think. And to Elliot's broader point, also, on the Supreme Court.

This is what we saw on January 6, obviously, and this is what we've seen happen in our political lives, even before Donald Trump. Obviously, Steve Scalise dealt with that personally. Gabby Giffords. So the level of danger that our political figures fear and feel is significant. And by the way, that's poll workers now. You know, that's not just secretaries of state, but board of elections, local county, board of elections official. Everybody now, is that at -- at a higher risk. And that comes from a lot of the rhetoric that we see from Donald Trump. And -- but we move to the political on this. And I understand the whistles and bells and the warnings that Democrats are making on this. But if this is the week that has won Donald Trump the presidency, then Democrats, what are you going to do about it? We have a candidate who still, most Americans feel, is an incumbent president who's not going to be vertical in four years, to be really blunt about it. And we saw that last Thursday. Not because Joe Biden had a bad night. When you're 81-years-old, you have bad nights. We know that. The problem is this confirmed what so many Americans were looking for, and that's not going away.",
