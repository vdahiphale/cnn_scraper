We have not seen Prigozhin at all since he sent his militia troops toward Moscow several weeks ago. The video appears to show Prigozhin greeting fighters in Belarus.The video was posted in a pro Wagner telegram channel, that's the militia group that Prigozhin led. It was then shared by Prigozhin's account again whether he's the one who sent it from the account is unknown and it's unclear if the exact date of the video has been verified. It comes as Britain's intelligence chief told CNN that he believes Prigozhin is now likely \"Floating about alive and at Liberty\" and that Russian President Vladimir Putin had to cut \"A humiliating deal with Prigozhin to save his skin, Putin skin\". CNN's Nick Paton Walsh joins us with the very latest. Nick, let's start again with that video, which if real would be the first time we've seen Prigozhin in some time.",

      "sentences": "Yes, it would be and I should stress you know, we haven't been able to assess whether or not that genuinely is Prigozhin recently, and whether he is indeed in Belarus. But that's where the case would be sticking with the terms belatedly fair to say, of the deal that President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko brokered to get his column of tanks to turn round on their way to Moscow back on the weekend of that failed arms rebellion.But interestingly, the emergence of this video indeed the first time we've seen some more palpable sighting of Prigozhin, since that failed. Rebellion emerged as a matter of hours after here in Prague; we heard the first comments really from Western intelligence on the record about that failed rebellion. The Head of MI6 Richard Moore, saying as you said that he believed Prigozhin was still \"Floating about\". And also is referring to how Vladimir Putin that weekend who had had to cut a deal to save his own skin. And during this rare speech, we heard here a sense I think, too, that even the sort of loftier parts of Western intelligence with the information at their disposal. They were still baffled bemused by the flip flopping of loyalties and public displays we saw in the Kremlin and those around it during that weekend. Here's one of the more interesting quotes we heard today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The assessments by British intelligence, and I'm sure that's something that shared with their American counterparts is that what we saw in public was likely what was happening behind closed doors as well.And that remarkable weekend was a staggering sign of Putin's weakness. And it's one that Richard Moore here used in Prague to say to disaffected Russians, if you want to help end this war in Ukraine come and spy for the United Kingdom. And we'll try and do that together. So remarkable insight we heard today, John.",

All right, the Pentagon is working to secure the return of U.S. Army Private Travis came after U.S. Defense Secretary said that the U.S. soldier willfully crossed into North Korea during a private tour of the DMZ on Tuesday.This morning, we're learning more about assault charges that the private faced in South Korea. According to court documents, U.S. Army Private King assaulted someone at a club in Seoul in October. U.S. officials say he spent about 60 days in a South Korean detention facility and was sentenced to pay a fine. At some point after his release, private King was sent to be flown back to the United States and separated from the army. He went to the airport but he never got on the flight and went on that tour instead. His reason for crossing at this hour is unknown. But a U.S. official says there's no indication he was trying to defect. We're joined now by former U.S. Ambassador to the UN and Former New Mexico Governor, Bill Richardson. Thank you so much for being here. You Bill, have consistently negotiated the release of international hostages, including negotiations with North Korea, where you successfully brought an American out. Can you give us some sense of how this actually works? How these negotiations happened?",

      "sentences": "Well, what's happening now makes good sense. I think U.S. policy is correct. Try to fix this problem military to military in the demilitarized zone, get the UN members involved, try to find a way to bring Travis back. Yes, he's -- yes, he must take disciplinary action. But he's an American, he's a serviceman.The good news so far, in my contacts with the North Korea's in the past, is the North Koreans have said nothing publicly yet. That's good. Because it means they're probably interrogating, they're probably deciding what kind of response it's going to be, hopefully they will see that he's a troubled young man that ran across the border, and they can deport them and send them back. That would be the best response. Now other good news is in the last six years, the North Koreans have not detained any Americans, they did with Otto Warmbier, who I was involved in my team, Mickey Bergman and bringing him back, unfortunately perished. So you got to deal with the North Koreans very carefully, no bombast. And so far we've done that. Military to military right now is the best contact; get the facts get the North Koreans not provoked. There's enormous tension in the peninsula right now. So hopefully, the fact that they haven't said anything publicly charged them with anything is good news.",

This is someone who the Pentagon itself is saying, did this on purpose. This was no accident. And he has this history also in South Korea, of criminal activity alleged in court documents.So let me ask you, how much more difficult is it going to be for someone who the U.S. is saying did this on purpose?",

In this case, in an unauthorized way, Travis Kim went into North Korea. So he's the one that made the mistake, not the North Koreans.So the positive side is with the North Koreans unlike the Russians, the Russians, most all the time want a prisoner exchange. OK, we'll give you your person, Brittney Griner for somebody that we want, like Viktor Bout. In this case, there is no potential trade like that, because we have a travel ban in the United States President Trump put a travel ban of humanitarian aid and American citizens traveling to North Korea. So it's different in that sense. What worries me though, is there's enormous tension in the peninsula with South Korea and Japan. And, you know, we have our military doing joint exercises. The North Koreans have been their rhetoric has been pretty strong against us against the whole region. So hopefully this is treated as a humanitarian issue and not a geopolitical issue.",

You saw over the weekend, the leader of the progressive group in the house Pramila Jayapal who said that Israel was a racist state. She then walked those comments back. But there was a vote last night on the House floor, Republicans trying to reveal those tensions between democrats by pushing forward with a resolution vote, just restating the support of Israel. Now, we should note that Jayapal voted for that resolution and all but nine Democrats voted for it. So their efforts to try to divide the Democratic Party on the issue didn't really work.
