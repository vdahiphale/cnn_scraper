      "sentences": "Well, we know, Brianna, that she's going to be inheriting a company in absolute turmoil. Since Elon Musk purchased Twitter and since he named himself the head of Twitter, the company has really been in imperiled. You know, you'll remember in the early days of Elon Musk's reign at Twitter, he laid off most of the staff. Other staffers quit in protest. He dissolved the Board of Directors. He's assailed news organizations, banned journalists, which resulted in at least so far, NPR for instance stopping their use of Twitter.He's alienated advertisers. He's basically destroyed the verification system on Twitter. And he's launched a struggling subscription business. And so, she's going to come in and she's going to have to really grapple with all of these problems. Now, she is a seasoned advertising executive. She has a lot of those key relationships. So, I am sure that Elon Musk is hoping that she's going to be able to restore Twitter's relationships with those advertisers. But the key is, how much is Musk going to still loom over Twitter? He is not stepping down altogether. He's going to be the chief technology officer. And he's basically saying she's going to handle, you know, the business operations while he handles everything else. He plays an outsized role at the company -- given his tweets. And those are the things that often alienate advertisers -- his antics. You know, remember when he spread that deranged to Paul Pelosi conspiracy theory. Those are the types of things that really repel advertisers from Twitter. And so, I think she's got her work cut out for her as she takes the reins over at this company.",

He is now facing a second-degree manslaughter charge after this. This was him on a New York subway earlier this month. This is him walking out of the police station. Earlier this month on a New York subway, he used a chokehold on a homeless man to subdue him and that led to his death. The man who died his name is Jordan Neely. Witnesses say Neely got on the subway and was shouting, though had not physically attacked anyone. Neely's family says he had been suffering from mental illness as well.CNN's Kara Scannell, she's outside the courtroom where Penny had been released on $100,000 bond. And Kara, tell us how the Manhattan DA's office approach this? What evidence, what argument did they present to justify this charge?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Jim. So, we learned a little information about how the DA got to this second-degree manslaughter charge today at Penny's arraignment. And so, what one of the prosecutors, Joshua Steinglass said, he said that since that May 1st chokehold that led to Neely's death, he said that they -- the DAs office and NYPD had interviewed a number of eyewitnesses. They reviewed video footage. There reviewed 911 calls. And they also interviewed the responding officers to the scene.He also told us a little bit more information along the timeline of events. And so, what they said is that Jordan Neely had entered the subway at this one-stop in lower Manhattan. And then he said that witnesses observed Mr. Neely making threats and scaring passengers. It was then that Penny had come up from behind, put Neely in a chokehold and held him in that chokehold. Now they said that the train went to the next station. And at that station, Penny still held Neely in a chokehold, and what he said, for several minutes. Two other men, the prosecutor said, more than helping to restrain Neely. And then what Steinglass, the prosecutor said, at some point Mr. Neely stopped moving. The defendant continue to hold Mr. Neely for a period and release him. He said it was then that paramedics who were on the scene, they tried to resuscitate Neely. But he was pronounced dead at the hospital. So, prosecutors' kind of explaining how they got to this charging decision today. And as you said, Penny was released on $100,000 bond. He had to surrender his passport. Now his attorneys are saying that Penny has been cooperating since he -- since he was on scene. He stayed. He answered questions. He met -- he went back to the precinct and answered the officers' questions. But he said he's continuing to cooperate. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Komorowski is accused of killing 34-year-old Samantha Hutchinson and injuring her husband Eric and two other people when she allegedly drove her vehicle into the golf cart that the couple was riding on just moments after they were married on Folly Beach in late April. And we have a medical update on movie star Jamie Foxx. Foxx's daughter announcing in a social media post today that her father has been, quote, out of the hospital for weeks recuperating. Foxx was first hospitalized in Atlanta on April 11th, after he experienced a medical complication -- according to his daughter. No word yet on what that medical complication was. And finally, an utterly bizarre story to bring you. Crime-fighting cows. Police in Boone, North Carolina are crediting a herd of cows with helping catch a suspect who led them on a high-speed chase and then ran from his car. Police say the cows literally led them to find the suspect hiding in their pasture. Officers even gave them a shout out in their statement. Writing quote: obviously, we want to express our gratitude to the cows. Boris, yesterday it was goats that sounded like humans. Today it is cows fighting crime.",

But do the actual rates of crime, does the data backup the reputation?SIDNER (on camera): In an answer, no, not compared to other cities of the same size. If you're talking specifically about violent crime and even more specifically about homicides, when it comes to violent crime, when it comes to homicides in particular, in the city of San Francisco. If you look at the numbers, the numbers tell you a different story. In 2021 and 2022 there were 56 homicides in San Francisco. A city of similar size, Indianapolis, they saw about four times as many homicides with 271 homicides and 226 homicides respectively in 2021 in 2022. In Jacksonville, Florida, saw almost 3 times the number of homicides. So, when it comes to something like data, I think you see these high- profile cases and you think, oh my gosh, that's happening all over the city. But kudos to Mayor Breed. She was very candid in answering all of my questions. The issue is that everyday things like car break-ins, like theft, that is what people are running into. They are also seeing open air drug use. And the city's only seven by seven square feet. It is hard to ignore and people feel really unsafe there.",
