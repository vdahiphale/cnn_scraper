He doesn't have to explain Access Hollywood and the imperative to save the campaign. And what can we do from the free for all, right? We have to get this under control, Stormy Daniels, get that story, take care of it now, so many details.We know that he's in the Oval Office, not from him, but from him as well, because we've heard information with respect to him being there when Trump became president. We know about the numerous phone calls that were made between parties, whether it be Hope Hicks, right, the press secretary to the campaign, and then later the White House. We know about the issues involving conversations with Pecker, with Howard. Why? Not because of him. We have phone records that establish these things. So, what am I saying? I'm saying that the prosecution has spent an inordinate amount of time in the lead up to his testimony, getting as much corroboration as possible so the jury has to believe very little from him. Last point, and that is that we are in these trials able to make reasonable inferences and draw them from the evidence. What do you think the closing argument will be? The prosecution's closing argument will be not only did Michael Cohen tell you, and if you pause as to believing him, every reasonable inference from the facts would suggest that Donald Trump knew exactly what was going on, orchestrated it, and at the end of the day, it's a conspiracy, it's a cover up, guilty.

He takes out a home equity line of credit.And then it's time to pay Michael Cohen back. And Michael Cohen gets his bonus slashed into a third of what it was supposed to have been.

You guys could bring on a legion of contractors and interior designers and you pick the trade and they'll all look at you the same way and say, yeah, no, we didn't get paid or we got paid a portion.Or if his lawyers were going to talk to you that have already jettisoned themselves from practicing for Donald Trump, a lot of them didn't get paid. And so, you know, that's what he does. That's his M.O. He thinks that that's smart. I know you guys think this is nuts, but when he hears testimony like that, he thinks it's smart. You remember what he said in that first debate in 2016, that I don't pay taxes, that makes me smart? Well, I don't pay my bills. In his mind, he thinks it makes him smart.
