But the White House -- or I should say the Pentagon still has not revealed just why the White House was not made aware of Secretary Austin's prostate cancer diagnosis until today.

And after listening to the entire argument today, it's hard for me to envision any universe where two of those three judges come back in favor of Donald Trump. And here's why. Because Donald Trump's lawyers today locked themselves into a really unusual, and I think ultimately untenable legal position. Their position is a president or former president can only be criminally prosecuted if he has first been impeached by the House and then convicted by the Senate.On one hand, there's just no legal support for that. It's creative, it's inventive, but I don't see anything that they base that on legally. And moreover, it leads to preposterous results like we see with that SEAL Team 6 example. If you're arguing that a president could potentially ordered the assassination, but he can't be prosecuted unless he's been impeached and convicted, that's just a ridiculous result, and judges take that into account. So I'd be very, very surprised if this comes out in Trump's favor. I think the judges are going to reject this immunity claim.",

So, I do think that that's what they are going to find how quickly they do it and then how quickly this gets to the Supreme Court is a whole other story, because obviously, getting this case to trial is really what the special counsel's trying to do.

And part of that reason is because this case, he cares deeply about the arguments that his lawyers made in the courtroom today.He really genuinely believes that he is immune from these charges, because he was president at the time. But the other part of it is the political strategy. And Donald Trump wanted to control the media narrative around this. And that's why you saw his team scrambled to set up this media availability with him and have him speak to the press directly.

But he's still beating her by two to one among self- identified Republicans.And to win a party's nomination, ultimately, you have to win the partisans of that party, which suggests to me that if she in fact is running to beat Trump, and there are main questions about whether she is fully committed to doing all that it takes to beat him, she is still going to have to give Republican voters a sharper argument about why they should move away from the former president.",

I think the test for her will actually be if she can do well in New Hampshire because when we talk about, you know, staying in it the long haul, that takes money.So I think the question for her becomes, can she make an argument to donors to help her stay in the race for the long haul? We know that Trump's goal is to try to shore up the nomination by Super Tuesday. So can she stay in beyond that, to really try to challenge him?

And they think that they have more money in their pocket at the end of the week, under Trump than they do under Biden. Biden has some tailwinds that are going to help them over the next year in all likelihood. Wages are rising faster than prices now.The Fed is indicating that it's going to cut rates. But it is likely that even if you get to, by the time we get to Election Day, I believe it is still likely that more people will trust Trump than Biden, on the economy. Trump's vulnerability I think is really what we saw today. I think he is going to rue today. I mean, literally four or five days after Joe Biden gave a speech saying he is a threat to democracy. He was in court with his lawyers making the case that he can assassinate his political rivals, and face no criminal consequences unless he is impeached in the house and convicted in the Senate. And that is something that has never happened in U.S. history. The Senate has never voted to convict a president. I mean, he really just wrote 1,000 Democratic campaign ads today. And it is striking to me and maybe indicative of the half-hearted nature of this Republican primary race, that we haven't heard a peep out of Nikki Haley or Ron DeSantis, as far as I know, about this idea that a president could kill his rivals without consequence unless he's impeached and convicted.",
