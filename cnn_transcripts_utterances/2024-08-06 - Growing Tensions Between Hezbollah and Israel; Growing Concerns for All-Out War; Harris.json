Their whole, their first joint rally in just a few hours from now, and of course, we'll bring that to you. And wasting no time, the Trump campaign goes straight into attack mode following most dangerously liberal and the West Coast want to be. And the Mid-East is on edge for possible Iranian retaliation against Israel, we're live at the Pentagon with what U.S. officials say they are seeing. We begin, though, this hour with a new chapter and what's being one of the most turbulent presidential races in U.S. history. Vice President Kamala Harris has chosen Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running-mate. The decision of course, coming just 16 days after President Joe Biden ended his re-election campaign. Walz is a former U.S. congressman, high school teacher, a member of the National Guard. He skyrocketed up of the list of contenders to join the Democratic ticket after going on the offensive against Donald Trump and J.D. Vance, describing them as weird. In just a few hours, Walz will appear alongside Harris at a rally in Philadelphia, public unveiling of the new Democratic ticket. To Washington now, and our senior White House reporter Kevin Liptak with the very latest there. I think Kevin, look, I think it's fair to say that Governor Tim Walz started out as the darkest of dark horses here now, here we are. What was it about him that ultimately led to Kamala Harris choosing him?",

Let's get more now on how Harris' pick is playing amongst Democrats. Meghan Hays is a DNC Convention consultant and a former special assistant to President Joe Biden. Mark Longabaugh is a Democratic strategist and was a senior strategist on Bernie Sanders 2016 presidential campaign. Great to have you both here as we've seen Walz Tim, Walz just arriving in the last few minutes in Philadelphia. Meghan, let me get to start with you first.

I want to play what Democratic senator from Minnesota, Amy Klobuchar had to say about him, and we can talk after that. Listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN):  What Kamala Harris has done in bringing in Tim Walz, a guy who grew up in rural America in a small town, joined the service of the National Guard when he's 17, and then ends up as a high school teacher, completely humble beginnings. Has no money in his family and ends up in Congress and as a governor, that is going to be -- she is picking someone that actually is adding something. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Andthat's in part because they don't know if Iran even knows at this point what they're going to do. But they are more concerned now, we're told, about what Hezbollah is going to do about than what Iran is planning. We're told that in recent days, the fears have escalated about the idea that Hezbollah could actually act alone and not be coordinated with Tehran in its response. And of course, Hezbollah is just right there on Israel's northern border. And so, this could be something very significant that we see from Hezbollah, or you know, it could result -- all the diplomacy that we're seeing in the background could result in all sides kind of de- escalating tensions. So, does not seem necessarily like that is what is going to happen at this point. U.S. officials are bracing for some kind of retaliatory action, but they're trying to essentially temper it and try to make sure that any kind of action will not result, of course, in a large number of civilian casualties that it will be more largely symbolic and allow either Tehran or Hezbollah or both to kind of save face, you know, in light of these Israeli strikes in both Beirut and Tehran. And so, we know from U.S. officials that both Iran and Hezbollah have been making some kind of preparations for some kind of attack on Israel. But again, you know, U.S. officials have declined to say what exactly that looks like. I will note, however, that before the attack, the Iranian attack against Israel in April, U.S. officials saw very clear signs and very large   movements by Iran, including the movement of, for example, major missile launchers and things like that into position to prepare for a major attack. They're not necessarily seeing those kinds of huge signs at this point, forecasting something potentially as significant as a massive missile barrage, like we saw a few months ago. But of course, they're basically preparing for the worst here and engaging in this very frenetic diplomacy behind the scenes to try to ease tensions even further.

Just in breaking news that we've had in the last few minutes, I'm not sure if you caught it.

What do you make of this announcement? COLIN CLARKE, DIRECTOR OF POLICY &amp; RESEARCH, SOUFAN GROUP:  Thanks for having me. I think the announcement could be quite significant, and it's really interesting because you now see Hamas potentially attempting to bring closer the political bureau and the military wing, by having a military leader like Sinwar, kind of dual-had-it, functioning in both roles. It certainly points to a victory for the hard-liners within Hamas, some of the other names that have been mentioned, Khaled Mashal has some issues and his relationship with some of the -- you know, kind of Hamas adjacent countries in the region, including the Syrians, the Iranians, and so, this was likely a move to empower the more hard-line militants in the group.

Yahya Sinwar was viewed as very much the bridge between those two wings. And in addition to that, he's also viewed as responsible for the October 7th massacre. The -- in the same way that Mohammed Deif was the leader of the military wing, there's a belief, a strong belief that Yahya Sinwar would have been intimately involved, if not in the planning, then certainly, in the decision-making about choosing to carry out such an attack. And what this also does is, it makes very clear that Yahya Sinwar, despite more than ten months of war, is clearly alive, clearly still very influential within Hamas, to the point that he is able to actually seize power here in the wake of Ismail Haniyeh's assassination. And what that will do beyond what I've already mentioned is also, clearly, show that the hard-liners within Hamas are clearly being empowered. Ismail Haniyeh was viewed in many ways as a more pragmatic voice within Hamas, as a voice who is pushing for a ceasefire, who is willing to make certain concessions at the negotiating table. And Yahya Sinwar, who has been consulted at every step in those ceasefire negotiations, was very much viewed as carrying the more hard-line of position. And so, that obviously, I think is pretty clear what that means for the future of ceasefire negotiations, for how much more difficult it may be to actually achieve a ceasefire, and obviously, this will have tremendous implications in Gaza itself, where we know that the lack of a ceasefire is impacting Gazan civilians more than anyone else perhaps.",

But now, he is empowered even further because we're not just talking about a veto, we're talking about actual decision-making power and authority. And one other thing that we should note is that Sinwar, as he has been consulted at every critical juncture, that sometimes led to delays in those negotiations, because of the fact that Sinwar is believed to be hiding in tunnels under Gaza, most likely under Khan Younis. It was taking -- it could take as little as hours sometimes, but often times, it would take days for the messages to go from Doha or Cairo, from the mediating -- from the negotiating table into Gaza to actually reach Sinwar in a covert manner without the Israelis discovering where he was hiding. And then for those messages to reach back to the negotiating table thereafter. And so, that is going to be clearly another factor in the potential future of those talks. But we should note that for now, these negotiations are effectively dead for the time-being, at least in the short-term following the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, there has been no progress towards another ceasefire deal.

Maybe not on the scale of what we saw in April, but something thatshows that they're not going to sit back and let the Israelis operate with impunity on Iranian soil. And, you know, this is a tough place for the Iranians. They need to thread the needle between responding and not seeming weak. But also, not escalating the conflict further and potentially dragging in the United States, which has increased its military muscle in the region. It's brought in some F-22 fighter squadrons. It's changed out carrier strike groups. So, the U.S. is there. We're seeing a lot of the similar moves that we saw in April. But I think the Iranian response might be a little bit more muted, and again, involving some of the Axis forces here.",

They arelabelling Walz as someone who's more liberal than Harris and President Biden, telling CNN that Walz's record as governor of Minnesota is the proof. One Trump adviser said Harris, quote, found a 60-year-old white guy who has the same crazy ideas she does. CNN's Alayna Treene joins me now live from Washington. It's true, they have wasted no time going after a Minnesota governor. Just talk us through what they're saying, what the strategy is here.",

      "sentences": "Well, I think for the strategy part, look, Donald Trump's team has really struggled over the last several weeks on howto define Vice President Kamala Harris. They have been trying to workshop different lines of attacks to see what would stick against her. But now, I'm told in my conversations with them that they do see an opportunity here with the announcement of Minnesota Governor Walz as her VP. They have plans to try to paint him as more radically liberal than Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. They plan to really focus on his record specifically as governor over the last four years, I'm told. Remember, he was also a Democratic congressman of Minnesota for 12 years, but they really try to home in on what he's done as governor. I do think, though, Isa, it's going to be difficult for them to paint him as a liberal as they are trying to make it out today, because if you do actually look at his record, especially from before his time as governor, he was considered a more moderate leaning Democrat while he served in Congress, he, you know, was pretty moderate on gun safety rights. He voted to impeach Eric Holder after some of the things that he had done. So, there's some things that I think Democrats who are pushing for him to try to paint Walz as someone who is not super progressive, things that they can point to. But this will be the campaign strategy, that he's a liberal, that he stands for everything that the Biden administration has laid out, specifically the policies that they believe Republicans pull better on things like the economy, immigration, crime, and tried to paint him as someone who would be dangerous for the country, just like what they're trying to do with Harris. I want you to take a listen, because we did hear from Trump's running mate, Ohio Senator J. D. Vance today addressing this. Listen to what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. JD VANCE (R-OH), U.S. VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Tim Walz's record is a joke. He's been one of the most far-left radicals in the entire United States government at any level. But I think that what Tim Walz's selection says is that Kamala Harris has bent the knee to the far-left of her party, which is what she always does. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We know and we've been reporting for several days now that Shapiro was also a top contender that Harris was focusing on. However, she, of course, ultimately went with Walz. The argument that the Trump campaign is trying to make is that the more left-wing members of the Democratic Party have been arguing that maybe Shapiro, who is a Jewish governor, was someone who wasn't selected because of his criticism when it comes to the handling of the war between Israel and Hamas. It's something we've seen a lot of the Trump campaign surrogates try to push on social media today. But I'll note that privately, Trump's team is actually very happy she didn't select Shapiro because they are very worried about Pennsylvania. We know Pennsylvania is a crucial battleground state, and they actually were very concerned that Shapiro could help her win that ultimately. And of course, she did not select him. Isa.",

The other thing I think that might have been of concern is Shapiro staunch support of Israel at a time when many key demographics in the party are looking at what's happening in Israel and saying we need a ceasefire. We need to consider what's happening on the humanitarian side and the dissonance between those two points of views, I think, might have been a problem going forward.",

I can give you a look at some of the key ones. I mean, we see this from his background. He's a union man. He's a former teacher. The unions there certainly have backed him. Typical policies, support for Amazon workers, as an example, gig economy workers. I'm talking Uber and Lyft drivers. Then you look at some of the policies for working families, child tax credits, free meals for school children, as another example, paid sick and medical leave funded by employers. So, this is the guy that you get on the campaign trail, one, to say, look, you may not believe and think that the administration's policies have worked for you, but here's -- let me show you, as a governor from Minnesota, how they have worked. He's also, I think the guy to say, look, I understand the concerns for working families. He plays to that working class white vote across the vast belt, certainly, and he's been proven that. And we know Biden has struggled with that. The challenge for me with some of these policies, Isa, is how do they fly with small and medium sized businesses across the country? Because, of course, that's the backbone of the environment. And we spoke to the chamber of commerce in Minnesota and here's a quick quote, many progressive policies signed by the government have limited the private sector from reaching its economic potential. There is much more to be done here to improve our business climate. They're 37th across the nation in terms of job growth and overall growth slightly below that. Isa, it's a balance of practicality and policies that you would like to enact and what Congress will allow you to do.",
