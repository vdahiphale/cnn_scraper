Right now, more than 20 million people are facing a new storm threat in the Midwest and South. The Storm Prediction Center upgrading the risk expecting more tornadoes in Mississippi and Alabama and that includes areas like Rolling Fork, Mississippi, already reeling after being obliterated by an EF 4 tornado overnight on Friday. The death toll from this weekend's storms rising to 26. President Biden approving Mississippi's disaster declaration, freeing up federal resources. And today, the heads of FEMA and the Department of Homeland Security toured the damage alongside Mississippi's governor, saying just this a short time ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But we have a new portion that's developing across eastern Texas. And that's going to be the more concerning one going forward.We have a brand new tornado watch that was just issued. This is going to be valid until 7:00 p.m. Central Time tonight for areas of Eastern Texas as well as portions of Louisiana because as these thunderstorms begin to develop and fire up, they are expected to intensify very quickly and could turn into again some very severe thunderstorms. Already so far today we've had numerous reports of tornadoes, wind damage as well as some very large hail, and that's expected to continue through the day today. Again, overall the threat will extend from eastern Texas all the way over through North Carolina. We do expect a couple of tornadoes, large to very large hail. We're talking the size of tennis balls or even larger. And then some damaging winds. Again, this particular area here where you see an orange and red, that's going to be the biggest area of concern, especially for tornadoes. Here's a look at the timing. Again, those storms are going to develop in eastern Texas pushing into Louisiana, but eventually they are going to spread over into Mississippi, Alabama, and eventually into Georgia as we make our way through the rest of the day. And unfortunately, yes that does include the areas that were just hit on Friday night. One of the other concerns is also going to be rain because Fred, it's multiple waves here and multiple days so that ground is already saturated, and now we're going to be adding an additional 2 to 5 inches of rain on top of it.",

But I got to tell you, Fred, just walking the grounds here it is just heart-wrenching to see so many people with only the clothes on their backs really, looking at piles of debris of what used to be their homes. They've got nothing, including one resident I spoke with who managed to only pull out a piece of luggage with a pair of tennis shoes, a couple of articles of clothing. He doesn't know when -- where he's going to sleep tonight. So a lot of people are relying on leadership that we're seeing on the ground here to figure out what's next? How do they rebuild? Where do they get food, water, what temporary housing can they get. Even before the press conference started, the leadership here they took 20 minutes to walk around and kind of absorb for themselves the aftermath of this tornado. We saw at times emotional moments of them hugging with people, crying with people, hearing their stories of survival, including one person who survived in a freezer as the restaurant his -- and his place of work was crashing around him from this tornado. I want you to now listen to Governor Tate Reeves of what he spoke about the resiliency of the people of Mississippi. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOVERNOR TATE REEVES (R-MS): What we've seen over the last 36 hours in Mississippi, on the one hand has been heartbreaking to see the loss and devastation of these communities, but on the other hand has been inspiring and gives me great reason for optimism and quite frankly, makes me damn proud to be a Mississippian because Mississippians have done what Mississippians do in times of tragedy, in times of crisis they stand up and they show up. (END VIDEO CLIP) ROSALES: And Secretary Mayorkas said quote \"We are here for the long haul,\" saying that there is no substitution as a cabinet member of the highest ranking person up at that podium to seeing this damage in person.

Look at the damage. This is what it looks like in the city of LaGrange, about 70 miles southwest of Atlanta, and you can see the storm snapped power line, toppled trees, did a lot of home damage, building damage. And all that debris well, now it's creating a real mess on the roads as well and forcing officials to temporarily close Interstate 85 through the area while they tried to clear the highway. Georgia's governor has issued a state of emergency in the wake of the severe storms, and so far there have been no reports of any fatalities thankfully. Well, joining me right now is Daniel Evans. He is the president and publisher of \"LaGrange Daily News\" in Georgia. Daniel so good to see you. So tell us about what the city looks like beyond and we saw some of the images. I mean, it's a real mess, but give me an idea how people are combing through the debris navigating through the debris. DANIEL EVANS, PUBLISHER, \"LAGRANGE DAILY NEWS\": Yes this is -- this is something that people in LaGrange and Troup County are tired of dealing with, frankly. At this point, we have had four tornadoes since January 12th this year that have impacted Troup County. So unfortunately, this is something that we're getting used to. But you know, we've had trees down on roadways, on houses, five injuries in Troup County. No fatalities at this time.

But the potential is there.But it's very complicated, not least because in the U.S. there's a tradition, freedom of information and so on. So how you regulate it is a very tough challenge. Complicated indeed. Hey, let's talk about what is also very complicated. The journey of a journalist, you know, covering China. I mean, you write about, you know the golden age and how the golden age of covering China really is over in early 2020. You know you -- you write that nearly 20 journalists from the \"New York Times\" to the \"Washington Post\", \"Wall Street Journal\" were expelled, kicked out of the country. So even before that western journalists have been known to be followed, even harassed. Are you saying, you know that something is different now in the leadership of Xi Jinping? CHINOY: Well, my book \"Assignment: China\" is based on over 100 interviews I did with journalists who covered China from the late 1940s, when the communists seized power, to the present day, and the idea is basically the way in which most Americans get their information about China is from the media and most media. And most consumers of media have no idea how the reporters on the ground actually did their jobs. And so to get the people who told the China story, to tell the behind the scenes story of how they did that -- I think it's both interesting and valuable. The challenge has been up and down, depending on the state of U.S.- China relations and domestic Chinese politics. There were 30 years or so when Americans weren't allowed, journalists weren't allowed into China at all. As China embarked on its program of economic reform in the late 70s, and then on into the 80s and beyond, conditions for journalists got better, more journalists were allowed in. I opened the CNN Beijing bureau, for example, in 1987. And that sort of peaked in the early 2000s around the time when China got the 2008 Olympics. But under Xi Jinping, who has imposed much tighter controls internally in China, reimposed much tougher ideological education, been much more hostile to foreign influence. The Chinese Communist Party wants to control the narrative not only inside China but around the world. So that's meant in recent years much more pressure on American journalists. There are a lot fewer reporters for American media there now, the conditions they face are much tougher. And so people are having to cover China from outside the country, which is what it was like decades ago. It's almost come full circle on that journey that -- people who cover (INAUDIBLE) recount in my book \"Assignment: China\".",

It's fun to look back, you know, and see your own coverage there -- and there we are right there.So you know, getting to the truth, you know, you have learned it is hard in China, you know, from the opulent, shiny construction of cities, the country is proud to show off, even if there are no people living or working there. You know, to the food that you wrote about that was brought in to impress foreigners. So if it was that way for you, you know, when you were the bureau chief in the late 80s and the 90s and early 2000s how do you describe information dissemination today?",

I think Xi Jinping's goal is to make the world safe for the Chinese communist party and that involves tighter control at home, and it involves flexing China's considerable economic and diplomatic and sometimes military muscle to get its way internationally, and to put pressure on those acting or saying things that Beijing doesn't like.So China has always been able to control the narrative internally because there's no free press, but increasingly now, there has been pressure around the world, get to go after voices that are critical of China. And so I think you see this in Australia -- you see it in lots of different places where pressure has been brought to bear to shape the discussion in ways favorable to China. And that's another real challenge for journalists whether they're in China or outside trying to get at the truth because access is limited.

So I think that's the see -- the thing that makes it so exciting, the thing that draws people in. It gives every team and all their fan base and the players on the team, it gives everyone the chance, the belief, that, hey, if we played great for one game, we can move on in the tournament.",
