We'll zoom past me to the entrance of Walmart right there where law enforcement personnel have been coming in and out of that entrance all morning. This attack unfolded a little less than nine hours ago, the first calls came in to police just after 10What we're told by a law enforcement source who spoke to CNN was that an employee or a former employee walked into a break room where people were gathered and opened fire. At some point, that employee or former employee turned the gun on himself. As you reported, as we've been confirming for the last couple of hours, the city of Chesapeake confirming six people were killed, six victims dead, the gunman is also dead. And we're told that at least five people are treated for injuries at a local hospital. But an update on their conditions was not immediately available. But, again, here, they were coming through this for hours. It took them hours to process and go through the store, make sure there were no additional victims, that there was no one hiding. So, this crime scene has taken several hours for police to go through and they have just rendered it safe but, again, they are still combing through just for evidence, Don.",

It's bringing back many memories of the Second Intifida, when suicide bombings and bombs on busses, bombs at bus stations became a regular occurrence, but a bomb like this has not happened in some time. Now, while this has been a record deadly year for both Israelis and Palestinians, this attack this morning, this shows a level of sophistication and of organization that Israeli authorities says they have not seen. Now, no group has claimed responsibility, no militant group, although the Hamas militant group has praised the operation.

The Biden administration has once again extended its freeze on student loan repayments for millions of Americans, but this is in the middle of the president's loan forgiveness program being tied up in all these legal challenges. The forgiveness plan is worth up to $20,000 in debt relief per borrower under a certain income threshold, and the payment pause was going to expire at the end of the year. Now, they've extended it into 2023 with the promise of federal relief still unresolved.Listen to what the president posted in this video on Twitter. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  We're not going to back down though on our fight to give families breathing room. That's why the Department of Justice is asking the Supreme Court of the United States to rule on the case. But it isn't fair to ask tens of millions of borrowers eligible for relief to resume their student payments while the courts consider the lawsuit. For that reason, the secretary of education is extending the pause on student loan payments while we seek relief from the courts but no later than June 30, 2023. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Biden did say yesterday, he said he was, quote, completely confident that his plan is legal. But this is going to be one of the -- it's one of the most controversial issues that the Biden administration has faced on this.The other thing is now because they are extending the freeze on repaying your student loans for those even that weren't covered by what he was going to forgive, they said it wouldn't be inflationary when added to inflation, because the payments were going to restart in January. Well, now, they may not start until next fall because it takes six months after the court has resolved the issue before you can actually start -- they can illegally have you start repaying. So, if they don't get it resolved by Jun, it could be not until next September that people are paying this back. It's very complicated but this affects so many people.",
