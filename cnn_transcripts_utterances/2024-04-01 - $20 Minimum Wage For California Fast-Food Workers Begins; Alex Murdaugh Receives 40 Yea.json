As of today, the minimum wage for fast-food workers is $20 an hour, which is about a 25 percent raise for a lot of folks who work at the big national chains.CNN's Natasha Chen is live from Los Angeles. That's quite an increase. I think anyone would love to see that, Natasha. What are you hearing from workers? NATASHA CHEN, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Brianna, this applies to fast-food locations where there are more than 60 nationwide stores. So it's the larger fast-food chains that you're familiar with. The workers we've talked to over the last several years -- I've been covering the since 2022 -- this is a long, hard-fought win for them. They have been working toward this for a long time. And at least one worker who's going to speak with me right after this live shot said that she's been living with her two parents, one who also works at a McDonald's with her and the other who's a construction worker, they've been living in the same space together in the same unit since the '90s. And she's hoping that this may be the first step in affording a slightly more comfortable place, sometimes buying a cup of coffee and having a little bit of an easier time paying the bills. But to be clear, this law also creates a first of its kind, fast council to help address some of the safety issues, wage theft, and other complaints that fast-food workers have, hoping that this council, with representation from both the restaurant side and the worker side, can help address some of that.",

So obviously, the people coming together to have a seat at this council table, they all feel like this is a good step in everyone coming together to solve some problems.The wages are a huge point of debate, right? We have a $20 minimum wage now set for just this industry. And that wage can go up based on inflation for the rest of this decade if the council so chooses to do so. There are franchise owners who own maybe just a few locations, some of them owning just one location, who are now having to deal with a major increase in costs. And so some are cutting back worker hours. Some are implementing new technology like self-serve kiosks and experimenting with AI and drive-thrus to absorb some of that cost. Another franchise owner tells me he is really going to try to preserve the people, the jobs, the hours, and instead cut back elsewhere. Here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SCOTT RODRICK, OWNS 18 MCDONALD'S LOCATIONS: People are my most important asset. So the very last thing that I want to impact are the hours of my employees and the positions of my employees. And so I'm trying to do everything that I can through price through more thoughtful capex decisions to not have to impact folks' jobs because human beings run my restaurants. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Nobody's going to pay $20 for a Happy Meal. And the Al-Balah (ph) local owner says that she's already seen lower transactions since those prices went up. So it has to come out somewhere and we're going to see how this goes in the coming months -- Brianna?",
