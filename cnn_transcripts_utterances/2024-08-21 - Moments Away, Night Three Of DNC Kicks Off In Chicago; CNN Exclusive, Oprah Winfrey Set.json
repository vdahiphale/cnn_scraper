An aide says that he wants his speech to match. They're using the word joy that we've heard so much from Democrats, that they want to be sort of a three letter code name for their Harris-Walz ticket.

This is an acceptance speech that Governor Walz has been working on since he got named running mate to Vice President Kamala Harris. He has been writing some sections on his own, certainly getting input from advisers and others. And, really, in the final stages, I am told that the process has been about putting his own spin on the language. I'm told by one senior adviser that it has been very important to the governor that the speech feel true to him, so that he feels like he is authentically telling the story that he wants to tell. The stakes, of course, are incredibly high in large part because most Americans don't know very much about Tim Walz. And tonight is likely going to be one of the best opportunities for him to speak to a big audience and really tell that story about himself to Americans as they are really trying to define this ticket. And as we know, and as we have been talking about, he is going to be leaning heavily on his biography. And I should note, just for color, we know that the governor has been learning to use the teleprompter, which is something that he hasn't been using as governor. I am told that that remains a work in progress. They have been recently trying to fine tune and play around with finding the exact, right font size for the teleprompter for the governor, Wolf.",

And, you know, I think that one of the things that Walz can do and one of the reasons I think that Harris chose him and from talking to Democrats about how she went through that is that he does have an authentic way of speaking to some of the voters that, quite frankly, Democrats have lost in recent elections, rural voters, white working class voters. He has authentic experiences on, you know, working on the farm, as being part of the National Guard, as a public school teacher.And that is something -- it's a profile that kind of expands beyond where Democrats have seen the most growth among their voter shares. Suburban -- if they'd gone with Josh Shapiro, for example, he cuts a much more suburban, well-educated profile. So, I'm interested to see how he leans into that. I thought the joke that President Obama seemed to make at his expense last night, where he said, ah, those flannel shirts he has, they've seen some stuff. That clearly is part of this as well. And you started to see those hats appear, camouflage hats, like the one that he was wearing, that he -- where he took that phone call from Kamala Harris accepting the nomination.

And that had a tremendous, legitimizing effect that, you know, Oprah, this kind of mainstream figure in America, and as John King said, somebody that millions of Americans invited into their home every afternoon, for her to come out and to endorse Barack Obama and really the campaign with the Obamas in Iowa and the Carolinas and across the country, had an enormous multiplying effect for Barack Obama.

And part of that is what you see with an Oprah Winfrey coming to the table here.And there have been these comparisons about Harris now and Barack Obama then. I mean, he was a cultural phenomenon in 2008. He changed the electoral map, right, that sort of landslide victory that he had there. I have sort of found that the 2012 Obama re-elect so far feels more similar to me in covering Harris events so far.

You know, their hope, obviously, is that the support for Kamala Harris and the opposition to Donald Trump will turn into a movement. And one of the things that Bill Clinton's going to be talking tonight is to let's turn the page on Donald Trump and, you know, this idea not of not going back, but actually moving forward.

Kennedy right now and the Trump campaign are in intensive discussions about a potential endorsement.It is clearly been heading this way over the course of the last couple of weeks. The running mate of RFK Jr., Nicole Shanahan, mentioned this as a distinct possibility yesterday on a podcast. But we're told behind the scenes with our colleagues, Kristen Holmes, Alayna Treene, leading the way for our reporting on this, is there have been discussions for several months really picking up in earnest to the course of the last five or six weeks. Among those pushing for this endorsement and those conversation between the campaigns, Donald Trump Jr., the president's son who has been very concerned about the possibility of RFK siphoning off Trump's voters, donors as well. (INAUDIBLE) has been pushing for this. What we know at this point when we look at surveys, it is clear most of those voters would go to Trump.

It is one of the central reasons that Governor Tim Walz from Minnesota was picked. We're going to hear a lot about his upbringing in Nebraska actually as well. And Bill Clinton, of course, back when he won in '92 and '96, he won many swaths of the country that are now red, that are now part of Trump country.
