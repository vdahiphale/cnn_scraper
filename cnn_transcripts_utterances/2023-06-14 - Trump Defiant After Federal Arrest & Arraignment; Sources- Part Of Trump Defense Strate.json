How sprinter Tori Bowie's tragic story reveals an all too common threat to American women. And leading this hour is Donald Trump, the criminal defendant, helping Donald Trump the candidate, while Donald Trump the candidate is hurting Donald Trump the criminal defendant, will explain. His public comments following his arrest, and arraignment might now be used by federal prosecutors to convince a jury of his guilt. CNN's Evan Perez joins us now live from Miami. And Evan, Trump's, now back at his Bedminster, New Jersey golf club. So, where does the case go from here?",

First of all, his codefendant, Walt Nauta, we're going to see him back in court before a magistrate in a couple of weeks. He, of course, as you remember, yesterday, he didn't have a lawyer who could practice here in the Southern District of Florida. So he's going to have to hire a new lawyer and get arraigned for the first time again in a couple of weeks.The former president, however, his case can move forward. We know that the judge who's overseeing this is going to have a lot of issues to face head on. One of them is the whole process of reviewing these national security documents that are at the center of this case. We know that the defense is going to want to start getting discovery, access to all of the evidence that the prosecution says they have showing the former president not only willfully withheld these national security documents, but also obstructed justice as part of this investigation. Of course, they're going to need to get clearances for whoever Trump decides is going to actually end up defending him in this case. Remember, the former president still hasn't decided on a legal team going forward in this case, Jake.",

They've been working in Washington D.C. on the January 6 cases. We know that they have witnesses that are related to the former president and other possible defendants who may or may not be charged in this case.

I can tell you that's not how the legal team is looking at it, and that's not how they've been looking at it for several months.And I don't think Trump himself is viewing it that way. I mean, you could tell kind of in his mannerisms yesterday, the way he was acting one way in court in a very different way when he was at that Cuban restaurant, Versailles in Miami right after, where there was a lot of upbeat and his supporters there. You didn't even see that reflected when he was back at his club by last night. Instead, he kind of went through this speech making his case against what he was accused of yesterday, what he pleaded not guilty. That was very different than what we saw even happening when he spoke after he was indicted in Manhattan, where he kind of briefly touched it and then moved on, talking about all the grievances he has, he seems much more concerned about his potential legal peril with this. I mean, I don't know what his political team says, and, yes, maybe it's good for him to raise money, but I do think they're actually concerned about having court dates while he's in the middle of caucuses.",

The witness said Neely had been acting erratically and had been shouting that he was hungry and that he was thirsty and had little to live for.

Neely was homeless.I want to bring in a CNN chief -- I'm sorry, CNN Chief Law Enforcement and Intelligence Analyst John Miller. John, tell us about the indictment. JOHN MILLER, CNN CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND INTELLIGENCE ANALYST: So, we are told by a source familiar with the process of this investigation that he has been indicted on a charge of manslaughter in the second degree. Under New York state law, Daniel Penny in charge with manslaughter in the second degree, a 24-year-old former Marine sergeant would have allegedly caused the death of another recklessly, which means under that charge, he didn't have to intend to kill Jordan Neely, the homeless individual, a 30 year old man who was well known in the New York City subway system. It is just a charge that says he should have known that his actions could lead to Neely's death. So, that is what he's been charged with.
