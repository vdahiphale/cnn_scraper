Trump, of course, has pled not guilty. CNN's Evan Perez is here with us now. So, Evan, you and your team are still going through these 2,000 documents.

I mean, eventually, we presume, if we have a trial, that the jury will get to see a lot of this evidence.But for now, the judge has kept a lot of this under seal. We are seeing, though, a few documents that really underpin what the prosecutors say is the evidence to prove that Donald Trump is guilty of these four crimes that you pointed out. One of them is a previously partially redacted document that is an interview with a White House aide that was there in the Oval Office, that was there in the presidential residence on January 6 as the riot is happening at the Capitol. And, again, this is an interview that was done with the January 6 Committee, and we're now seeing parts of it. You can see right there. He says: \"There's rioting down at the Capitol.\" And he says: \"What do you mean?\" I said: \"It's like they're rioting there at the Capitol.\" And he says: \"Really?\" And then he said: \"Let's go. Let's go now.\" And so they bring him a television, and, according to this aide, he says: \"I stopped -- I stepped out to get him a Diet Coke, come back in, and that's pretty much it for me. He was watching it, and he was, like, seeing it all for himself.\" This is the former president and his conduct on January 6. This is part of the evidence that Jack Smith wants to use to say that he could have tried to intervene to stop some of the violence and chose not to. That's again part of what they are going to try to bring this in court. Now, Judge Tanya Chutkan is the one who decided to release these documents, and the former president has argued that this is election interference, 18 days from the election. Why are you putting this out now? She responded to that with this statement. She said: \"If the court withheld information that the public otherwise had a right to access solely because of the potential political consequences of releasing it, that withholding could itself constitute or appear to be election interference.\" In other words, the public has a right to see this information, and, therefore, this is why it is coming out now.",

His argument is going to be splitting between candidate Trump and President Trump and trying to focus everything on what he did as a candidate. And I think that, in certain circumstances, that's very murky and, in other circumstances, it's pretty clear. But he's trying to just take the court's attention solely over to that. But even to Evan's point a couple of minutes ago, when he starts to get into the things that he could have done and didn't, that's when Jack Smith runs the risk of going right back over to, well, should the president have done something to intervene versus should the candidate have done something.

I do, Congressman, want to get your reaction to the timing of these court documents, even though they do seem to be considerably redacted. What do you think? REP. DAN MEUSER (R-PA):  Well, your own analyst -- good to be with you, by the way -- called it an October cheap shot. Jack Smith has more than just a legal case. He seems to have a personal vendetta against the president. I think his case was weak. It was, of course, taken down by a higher court. He's brought it back, which is completely inappropriate, again, according to one of your analysts.

There are conditions that Hamas has made that they will not retract from. And that includes ending the war. It includes releasing Palestinian prisoners. Hamas is not going to surrender. And I think this is the mention of defiance that we're talking about, but I think that each side has their ability to present in their own way their victory picture. And Netanyahu got his with the killing of Sinwar. And Hamas spokespeople have said we fought the Palestinian issue back to international attention. This is their victory here. But we can't really talk about victory when so many people have been killed, when so much damage has been done, when both Israeli and Palestinian societies are living in trauma. We need to get this done. We need to get the hostages home. And President Biden needs to use his influence and the leverage of the United States over the government of Israel to make sure that this is done. The Egyptians and the Qataris and others can put pressure on Hamas, but it's time for this war to end.",

We don't know if that's being done, if that will be done. It is a very dangerous moment for those hostages as well.And who will succeed Sinwar? They will find something. There's a competition for leadership already going on. We probably won't hear anything in the next days of a real decision because they will have a three-day mourning period. But there is a void of significant leadership in Gaza right now. Yahya Sinwar's brother Mohammed Sinwar is one of the military commanders there, but he's not a political leader. There are a few members of the Shura Council, the upper politburo of Hamas, who are in Gaza, but we haven't heard much from them since the beginning of the war. The primary leadership is outside of Gaza. There are at least two significant Gazans who are in Doha right now, Khalil al-Hayya, who was the deputy of Sinwar. And he's a contestant for leadership. And Khaled Mashal, the old leader of Hamas, definitely wants to come back as leadership. And then the question is, does the outside leadership have the ability to enforce a deal should they reach one with Israel? Can we ensure that they will release hostages and that the war will be over from the point of view of the Hamas fighters in Gaza? We don't know that. This is going to be tested and verified. MARQUARDT:  Gershon, we only have a couple of moments left. But you mentioned something that Netanyahu said yesterday, which was essentially calling on Hamas members to release hostages and they will be allowed to live. And this is something we're starting to hear from U.S. officials as well, an effort or pressure to try to get whoever's holding hostages to release them piecemeal, given the disorganization right now in Gaza. Do you think there's a chance of something like that happening?",

They need to be offered and guaranteed free passage out to another country. There are countries that would accept them. And I think they should be encouraged by knowing that they will also receive a large sum of money to encourage them to do this. This is breaking discipline, and it'll be very difficult for them to do it. But I imagine that some of those people holding hostages would rather take the money and run and let the hostages live than end up possibly getting killed by Israel following not releasing the hostages.",
