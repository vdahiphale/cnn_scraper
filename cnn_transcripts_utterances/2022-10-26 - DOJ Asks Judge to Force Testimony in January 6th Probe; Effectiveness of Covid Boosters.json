One is freeze Ukraine, and then the question is, how much does he squeeze the rest of Europe as it turns cold in an effort to try to split the alliance.",

Well, in a lot of ways, this is the ballgame for the January 6th criminal prosecutions and the grand jury investigation around Donald Trump and after the election.What's going on here, what they're trying to get at is direct conversations with Donald Trump. We know that Cipollone and Philbin have talked about a lot of their experiences after the election and then leading up to and on January 6th. The one thing they're not answering, either to the House Select Committee or to the grand jury is exactly what they were -- advice that they were giving Trump himself, direct conversations that they had with Trump. So, what's happening here is Donald Trump is trying to block those final answers from them, from going to the grand jury in this criminal investigation claiming attorney/client privilege, executive privilege. And whatever the courts decide here, we were waiting for some sort of court fight to materialize where Justice would try and force them back into the grand jury to answer. However this ends up with this court fight, it has implications for lots of different people, other people in the White House, very high ranking, very close to Trump, who have also been subpoenaed.",

A very similar court fight where Donald Trump was trying to block these final answers from being given by two people in the vice president's office, Greg Jacob and Marc Short. Greg Jacob was the chief council to Pence. Marc Short was the chief of staff.In that court fight, what we learned is the Justice Department won. Donald Trump lost. And both of those men had to return to the grand jury to give final answers that they were -- that Trump had blocked from them giving before. And they both did that at the beginning of October. Obviously, not a great sign when the judge has already ruled in favor of the Justice Department heading into this next round with Cipollone and Philbin, but all of this is really crucial in determining what exactly the Justice Department and the grand jury can get to.",

All of us should get that booster, even with this news that I'm about to tell you.So, we know there's this new bivalent booster. It's supposed to cover the original Covid as well as the new omicron version of Covid. And so what the folks at Harvard and Columbia labs both did is they said, well, does this new one work any better than the variants that are - against the variants that are out there. Is this new one any better than the old Covid booster that people have been getting for years at this point? So, they put it to the test. Let's take a look at the results from the Harvard lab. What they found is that the original booster, the one that people have been getting for ages now - well, not ages but certainly years, it boosted antibodies 15 times. The new omicron booster boosted antibodies 17 times. They said that's not much of a difference. It's not statistically statistic. So basically what they found was it didn't really matter which one you got. Now, I will note that this Harvard lab, they were instrumental in developing the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, which is a competitor to the mRNA vaccines that are out there. But, even having said that, the Columbia lab found something very, very similar. Bottom line, though all of this, is these boosters help. Go out and get it. You have to get the new omicron one. It's your only choice. It will protect you from getting very sick from Covid with Covid-19. It will go a long way to keeping you out of the hospital and keeping you out of the morgues. Alex.",

Areas of extreme drought all the way to the top of the chart. This weather brought to you by Safelite, your vehicle glass and recalibration experts. So, how much rain? Well, in some spots, four to six inches over the next five days. But this is what we're looking at, this snow, even into parts of Colorado. That's the snow that will melt and some of this here will get into the Colorado River and eventually hopefully into Lake Mead.
