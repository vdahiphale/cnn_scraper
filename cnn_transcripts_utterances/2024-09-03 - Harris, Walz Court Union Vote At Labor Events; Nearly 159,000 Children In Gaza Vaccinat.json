But the rank-and-file supporters, so far, are with Donald Trump. And so I think that flipping of the script that \"I'm in your pocket\" and the way Americans think -- we don't -- the average American doesn't think about the economy or inflation. They think cost of living. How much does that cost? What is it going to do to my pocket, right?

And what we're going to see is three phases, each lasting three days. That first phase taking place right now is focused on central Gaza.Already, as you mentioned, nearly 159,000 children now immunized against polio, so a significant feat there. But as you mentioned, they are aiming to vaccinate 640,000 children across the Gaza Strip. That equates to over 90 percent of children under the age of 10. Now, phase two will focus on southern Gaza and that is expected to begin between Thursday and Sunday. And then, of course, phase three will focus on northern Gaza. And what we've been hearing from the U.N. agencies and representatives on the ground is this has, so far, been successful. And the success of the this campaign is heavily dependent on these pauses in fighting -- area-specific pauses in fighting that the U.N. has called for on both sides of the conflict to ensure that this campaign can be rolled out safely and securely not only for those medical workers on the ground but, of course, for the families and children lining up waiting to get these vaccines. [05:40:00] And we have seen video showing a huge turnout of families. On the first day we saw families gathering around the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah. Yesterday we saw aid workers -- relief workers visiting U.N.-run schools which, of course, have become vital shelters for civilians in the Gaza Strip -- visiting classroom-by- classroom, tent-by-tent carrying out these vaccinations. So, of course, this is a crucial campaign. Gaza has confirmed the first case of polio in a baby. This is the first case according to UNICEF in 25 years. So there is a significant amount of urgency around this but so far U.N. officials have said that it has been successful. The hope is that will continue as they move to phase two and phase three that we continue to see that pause in fighting being respected and that they can achieve that goal of vaccinating over 600,000 children against polio.",

You know, it really is striking as I -- as I wrote that no matter what else changes in American politics these states always seem to be at the forefront.When I coined the phrase \"the blue wall\" in 2009 it referred to the 18 states, actually, that ultimately voted Democratic in all six elections from '92 to 2012. In 2016, Trump famously dislodged Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin from the blue wall. Biden won them back in 2020. And people talk about the blue wall now more often than they talk about those three states that fell out of it rather than the original concept. Biden's, I think, greatest asset in the 2020 election was that he improved over Hillary Clinton in 2016, not massively but enough among those blue-collar workers in those three states to win them back from Trump after he had dislodged them in 2016. So if she is going to deploy him -- you know, a president with a disapproval rating of 55 percent or more, as Biden has -- I mean, there's limits to how much he can help you. But if he can help you, it is clearly -- I think his greatest value is going to be among those workers in those states. By the way, those three states have voted the same way in every presidential election since 1980 except one. And even more remarkably, over the last 30 years they have voted the same way for governor in every election except one. So they tend to move together and that is the key to their influence.",

So there are limits to how much you can use Biden. There was a reason that he was -- with Biden's age, that he was failing in the election before he -- before he stepped aside.But, you know, I've always thought if there is an epicenter to the enthusiasm -- the positive enthusiasm for Biden in the Democratic Party as opposed to seeing him as a vehicle to stop Trump, it was among the blue-collar construction trade unions in the AFL. Voters who were enthusiastic about him in 2020 -- now with all of the historic investment in manufacturing construction, the infrastructure bill that has unfolded under him as well, he can be an asset with those voters.

If she doesn't win Pennsylvania, in theory, she could compensate for it by winning one of the southeast states, either North Carolina and Georgia, plus one of the southwest states, either Nevada or Arizona. But you would like your odds much better on either side if you can just win Pennsylvania. If Harris, though, is able to establish a separation in Michigan, Wisconsin, and also Nevada, which polling is suggesting, suddenly it's Trump who has pull the inside straight. At that point he would have to win all three of Georgia, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania in order to win. The most straightforward path -- you know, we're kind of ending where we started, Paula.
