He said that, you know, his law partners told him not to talk without an attorney, and there were a number of factors that he identified.

So aside from how ridiculous that assertion was, you know, again, they were also, you know, trying to establish definitive height of the shooter or that there had to be two shooters, you know, based on practical things like well, it would just be easy enough to empty out the clip in a blackout.

It comes the same day that President Biden hosted Germany Chancellor Olaf Scholz at the White House. It was a show of unity with both leaders expressing commitment to Ukraine.Also the same day, Attorney General Merrick Garland made an unannounced trip to Ukraine. Garland met with President Zelenskyy and other officials on the topic of Russian war crimes. We're going to have more on that in a moment with the chief prosecutor of the international criminal court, which is investigating crimes. First, though, an update on a young girl now in Russia, one of thousands of Ukrainian children brought there by Russian forces. We told you a bit about her earlier this week. Her name is Anna. She's 13 years old and she's from Mariupol. Now, we showed you video of how she was made to read apparently scripted words of thanks to a Russian soldier during a Moscow rally celebrating Russia. Tonight, CNN's Melissa Bell has learned more about who she is. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MELISSA BELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): As soon as Kateryna Pustovit saw the little girl on stage in Moscow that she'd sheltered with in Mariupol, she knew something was wrong. KATERYNA PUSTOVIT, FRIEND OF ANYA'S FAMILY (through translation): I was scared to look at it. You can't use kids like that. ANYA NAUMENKO (through translation): Thank you, uncle Ura, for saving me. BELL (voice-over): But who is Anya? CNN tracked down her family members, too scared to speak on air. She is Anna Naumenko, or Anya, as she's known, a 13 year old brought from her foster family's home in Mariupol to this rally celebrating the Russian army. CNN has no way of knowing how willingly she went, but Anya's social media gives an insight into her bewilderment. Look at all the rows, she says, before being told where she will stand and what she will say. It was a year ago that Anya's hometown of Mariupol was pounded, devastating heavy artillery, forcing its population underground to basements like this one. Anya and her family shared this space for much of the three-month long siege with Kateryna Pustovit, who's now in Germany. She couldn't believe her eyes when she saw her on stage. PUSTOVIT (through translation): We were like a family. We saved ourselves, saved our life. BELL (voice-over): But in early April, Anya's mother Olga, left the basement and was killed by Russian shelling. Anya shared her grief for her mother online. \"I want to be with you,\" she writes. By the end of a siege, Anya and her siblings were separated. Anya sent to a foster family in Mariupol. So does the International Criminal Court believe that Anya has been a victim of a war crime by being paraded in Moscow.",
