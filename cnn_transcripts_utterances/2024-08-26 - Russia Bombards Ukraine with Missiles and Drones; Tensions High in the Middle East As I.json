Russia launches a major missile and drone bombardment on regions right throughout the country. We'll have all the details for you. The Middle East on high alert after Israel and Hezbollah exchanged fire over the weekend. What does it mean for the risks of a wider war? We are live in Haifa and Cairo. And Donald Trump readies himself for an all-out sprint towards November, looking for a new approach to take on Vice President Harris. And we do begin with what's being called the most massive air attack on Ukraine since Russia's war began. Officials say more than 200 drones and missiles rained down on Ukraine and the country is bracing for a new night of terror now that the sun has gone down there.

The Polish military is searching for an aerial object believed to be a drone, it's likely entered Poland's territory during the Russian attack. Meantime, Ukraine says its troops are seizing more territory in Russia's Kursk region. The area is home to the Kursk nuclear plant, and there are fears the new fighting could lead to a disaster. Now, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency is due to visit the plant on Tuesday. CNN's Fred Pleitgen has been following all the latest for us from Berlin. I mean, Fred, good to see you, especially on this story. We've been listening to President Zelenskyy who has characterized this as one of the largest attacks of this kind. But he is also accusing the Russian military again, of deliberately attacking civilians with cluster munitions. What more are you learning?",

The largest attack I have experienced in Ukraine since the war started, morethan 200 missiles and drones all together were in Ukrainian skies. And though, Ukrainians know and were preparing that Russia will launch this kind of attack on Independence Day. So, people are preparing themselves, but still it was very threatening and frightening to see all these missiles and drones flying towards Ukraine because we started receiving messages of alert since morning, and when people were already going to their workplaces. So, many were urged to stay at home and not to go -- not to leave houses and to take cover until the attack, Russian attack will be over. But for example, in Kyiv, the air raid alert lasted for more than six hours today. Though, people were taking cover, taking precautions, but then, the aftermath was very big, and a lot of energy infrastructure was hit and immediate, there were power outages all through Ukraine, also in Dnipro where I am now in Kyiv, in Odesa, in many Ukrainian large cities, there   were outages of electricity and Ukraine has already experienced this to several times. But every time this is difficult because it puts a lot of people into the struggle for everyday life, and they don't have electricity, power and water, in many places and trying to get it from somewhere.",

Maria Avdeeva, as I said, another night falling thereand we hope everyone is safe this evening. Thanks so much. Appreciate it. Now, Israel and Hezbollah -- Israel and Hezbollah appear to have stepped back from the brink after some of their most serious cross-border fire yet. Israel launched what it called pre-emptive strikes on Lebanon over the weekend. Now, it says fighter jets destroyed thousands of rocket launcher barrages across dozens of sites, removing what it called a future threat. Soon after, Hezbollah fired hundreds of rockets and drones towards Israel, that was in retaliation for the assassination of a top Hezbollah commander last month. Now, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah called it in his words, a complete success, but suggested further strikes could be coming. Now, the attacks did not derail a new round of Gaza ceasefire talks going on in Cairo. The White House is reporting progress, but there's still no agreement, I'll remind you, between Israel and Hamas. Just a short time ago, a U.N. official said U.N. humanitarian operations in Gaza have been suspended at least for today because of the new Israeli evacuation order. For more on all of this, I want to bring in our Jeremy Diamond, who is in Haifa in Israel, our Nada Bashir in Cairo. Jeremy, I go first to you to really make sense of what we saw in the last 24 hours.

About 100 fighter jets carrying out simultaneous strikes on dozens of Hezbollah rocket launch facilities, and about an hour-and-a-half later, sirens sounding across northern Israel is one of the most significant barrages of rockets and drones from Hezbollah was fired into Israel. Hundreds of rockets and drones, but the Israeli military says that all of those drones were intercepted. None of the rockets hit bases in central or northern Israel. And that's why they're characterizing that aerial defense operation as a success of the Israeli Prime Minister did yesterday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, PRIME MINISTER, ISRAEL (through translator):  The Israeli army destroyed thousands of short-range rockets, all of which were intended to harm our civilians and forces in the Galilee.

But as we understand it, there are stillofficials present in the city taking part in working-level discussions to try to iron out, hammer out those final details, those key sticking points which continue to persist. And of course, the regional security situation has ramped up pressure on both sides and on mediators to try and push for an agreement to be struck as soon as possible. But also the deteriorating situation in the Gaza Strip. As you mentioned a little earlier, Paula, U.N. agencies now being forced to temporarily pause their operations because of security concerns there. We're seeing yet more evacuation orders in the Gaza Strip as well, and the U.N. warning that there is something there, well, safe left for civilians to turn. And this is really one of the crucial reasons why we have seen continued debate, continued discussions around those sticking points, namely around the permanent ceasefire turn. Now, Hamas yesterday upon leaving Cairo reiterated its position that it wants to see guarantees that there will be after that initial six-week pause in the first phase of what is a three-phase proposal, that there will be guarantees of a transition to a permanent ceasefire in that second phase. That is something that Hamas have said they have not seen guaranteed by the Israeli side just yet. And we have heard in the past, remember the Prime Minister Netanyahu's coalition, including Prime Minister Netanyahu himself in June suggesting that after that initial six-week pause, there would be a continuation of the war. That is something that, of course, Hamas does not want to see mediators continuing to try and work towards the establishment of some sort of guarantee that we will see a ceasefire. But of course, there also continues to be debate around the presence of Israeli forces in the Gaza Strip, questions around the terms of the negotiation of the deal rather, and what constitutes populated areas in Gaza. Now, Israeli officials want to see a continued presence in this ceasefire process of Israeli forces on the Philadelphi Corridor, a buffer zone separating the border between Egypt and southern Gaza. They have revised their proposal over the last week, introducing a reduced number of troops and military posts. But according to that statement that we received from Hamas yesterday evening, that still is not acceptable. They want to see a full withdrawal of Israeli forces as part of disagreement. However, we have been hearing from U.S. officials telling CNN that they believe there may be some flexibility around these in terms that Hamas may well agree to an allowance of Israeli troops being present within that first six-week pause. But again, that really hinges on the definitions that we see present in this agreement. And that is exactly why we continue to see these working level discussions taking place. U.S. officials say they believe this is moving in a forward direction. But at this stage, we aren't seeing any indications of breakthroughs from either the Israeli delegation nor Hamas.",

Now,earlier, he laid a wreath at Arlington National Cemetery to mark the third anniversary of the deadly bombing that left 13 U.S. service members dead in the American withdrawal from Afghanistan. Now, in a social media post blaming President Biden for the deaths, Trump called the attack the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country. The former President later visited a Vietnamese shopping center to help campaign for a Republican candidate. And we are joined by CNN's Oren Liebermann at the Pentagon and our Steve Contorno in St. Petersburg, Florida. Good to see both of you. Oren, to you first.

Afghanistan mattered to the wider public at two different times, when the U.S. went into Afghanistan and when the U.S. came out of Afghanistan. And certainly, in the withdrawal, the death of 13 U.S. service members and then includes 11 Marines, a sailor and a soldier in the Abbey Gate bombing was the horrific moment, that's the moment that everyone remembers three years ago today. But beyond that, has it lingered? I'm not quite sure that it hasn't, certainly not as a political issue, one that decides for example an election or swings a large amount of the population. Still, it is a point in which former President Donald Trump has repeatedly attacked both President Joe Biden and now Kamala Harris, pointing out, as you said, that he said it was the most embarrassing moment in the history of the country. So, there he is on your screen visiting Arlington National Cemetery. He was joined by several family members of those fallen service members. Meanwhile, of course, Biden, Harris, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin put out their own statements about the Abbey Gate bombing the deaths, the killing of 13 service members in that suicide attack. Speaking of essentially what it takes to serve and the importance of that service, not only to family and to loved ones, but to the country overall. So, you'll continue to see Trump and other Republicans attack the Biden administration over this. But whether it lingers, whether it matters, certainly when you compare it to issues like the economy, inflation, the cost of everyday items, it's difficult to see it stack up anywhere close to issues like that. It is worth pointing out also that House Speaker Mike Johnson will give congressional gold medals to the families of those 13 fallen service members next month.",

Now, just 15 days fromnow, former President Trump will face off against Vice President Kamala Harris, we believe in their first debate, but yes, I want to tell you, there is new debate about those debate rules. At issue is whether the microphones should be muted for the debate when it's not their turn to speak. The Harris campaign wants the mics to stay on in those circumstances, while the Trump campaign says they should be turned off. But earlier today, the former President said he'd rather keep the microphones on throughout the whole debate, which appears to be a break from what his campaign is saying. We want to turn now to CNN national politics correspondent Eva McKend, who is in Washington for us. And yes, you have the job of trying to make sense of this for us because it seemed to go back and forth, but it gets to a very important issue, right? Each candidate wants to handicap the debate in their favor, and they have different opinions about how the miking works, right? EVA MCKEND, CNN U.S. NATIONAL POLITICS CORRESPONDENT:  Paula, it is really important. We have seen with the stakes so high, how debates have become so consequential in this election cycle. Nikki Haley, who ran for President during the Republican primary, she was long-viewed as a long-shot candidate, but then she got a lot more attention following a breakout moment she had during the debate. And then of course, President Biden, he made a grave mistake during the debate and he's no longer in this contest. So, these debates really matter, and that's why you see these jockeying between the teams to get the best conditions possible for their candidates. So, the Harris campaign wants those mics live and not -- and hot for the duration of the debate. Trump's team seems nervous. They had a good thing going in the last debate in their view, and they say they agreed to the  terms already with the mics muted when it was not someone's turn to speak, when President Biden was the nominee. But the Harris campaign, they're pushing for this hard, saying the American people can see both candidates for who they are, suggesting that Trump will interject, he'll rant, he'll wave, he'll air his own personal grievances. And we're getting a statement from the Harris campaign, Brian Fallon, the chief spokesperson. He says \"our understanding is that Trump's handlers preferred the muted microphone because they don't think their candidate can act presidential for 90 minutes on his own. We suspect Trump's team has not even told their boss about this dispute because it would be too embarrassing to admit that they don't think he can handle himself against Vice President Harris without the benefit of a mute button.\" So, some fighting words there. Paula, we'll have to see how this ultimately resolves itself. But the former President expressing some openness different from his team to having those mics not muted.",

BUSH:  Yes, I think they'll debate and I think some of these back and forths are a little tedious about, you know, who wants what arrangements. You know, Biden and Trump had a little back and forth too. But ultimately, they need to debate. And I think it's actually pretty vital for both candidates. Trump needs to try to prosecute a case to define Harris as the incumbent and part of an incumbent administration that people don't like. And Harris also needs a chance to prove herself to the American people who I do think expect their presidential candidates to be tested. So, I think there's incentives for both of them to do this.

He is undisciplined. He can't stick to the program. And so, it's interesting that it's his campaign that's arguing for a closed mic, because they know that their guy is apt to go off into La La Land and that's actually pretty destructive and the country's kind of sick of this stuff.

Seven people were killed including British tycoon Mike Lynch and his 18-year-old daughter Hannah. Investigators question the 51-year-old Cutfield for a second time on Sunday. He faces possible manslaughter and negligent shipwreck charges. Two NASA astronauts on the International Space Station finally do have that ticket to go home eight months later than intended. NASA says Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore will catch a ride back to Earth on a SpaceX rocket early next year. The Boeing Starliner, though, the crew was due to travel on, will return unmanned due to safety concerns. CNN Space and Defense Correspondent Kristin Fisher is following this for us, as you have been from the very beginning. So, if you can fill us in on the latest, but also, how the astronauts are reacting, right? They're staying until February, and I add you would be a family member of two astronauts in your family. This must be a huge shock just on a personal level as well for them.",

      "sentences": "I think it's probably more of a shock for the people that are left behind on earth than it is forthe astronauts up in space because they really do train for all of these contingencies, in any time you launch on any spacecraft, but especially the first crewed flight of a brand-new vehicle, you know that you could end up being stuck, stranded, whatever you want to say, up there at the International Space Station for quite some time. So, definitely, probably not the thing their friends and family members wanted back on Earth. But you know, Butch and Suni, the two NASA astronauts that are members of this Starliner crew, they train for this, they prepare for this, and both of them have done long duration space missions up there at the International Space Station in the past. But what this means, Paula, is that this is really just a huge black eye for Boeing. This Starliner program was already way over budget, way behind schedule. And essentially, over the weekend NASA top leadership came together and they said this is just too risky for us to risk the lives of NASA astronauts. We just don't think this vehicle is safe enough, especially when you do have a backup spacecraft ready to come and get them, and that's -- that backup vehicle is Boeing's prime competitor, SpaceX. And so, now Butch and Suni are going to hitch a ride home on a SpaceX Crew Dragon. But like you said, not until February of 2025.",

Up until this point, spacewalks, whichare widely believed to be the most risky thing that you can do in space, they've only been conducted by NASA or government astronauts. Now, you are going to see four private citizens essentially conduct a spacewalk. And on top of that, they're going to be going deep into the radiation belt, a part of space that experiences extreme radiation from the sun. And so, all of these things are really important to help fulfill SpaceX's ultimate goal of getting humans back to the moon and then, of course, someday Mars. So, you know, a lot of people say, oh, this may be just another billionaire on a joyride into space. The commander here, Jared Isaacman, partially funding this mission, I interviewed him down in the Kennedy Space Center last week, and he sees this more as a test and development program, really helping fund SpaceX's ambitions for human exploration in space.
