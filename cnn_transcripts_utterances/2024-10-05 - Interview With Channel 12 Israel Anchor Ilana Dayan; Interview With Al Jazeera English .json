I'm Christiane Amanpour in London.A year ago this weekend, Hamas invaded Israel from Gaza in a land, sea and airborne wave of unspeakable brutality. It devastated the nation, shocked the world, and launched a 12-month Middle East war that is still expanding. October 7 was the darkest day in Israeli history. 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were murdered in their homes, in their shelters, in their sleep, or while dancing at a music festival. It was a massive failure of intelligence and military dominance. On the ground, soldiers were nowhere to be found and the terrorists rampage freely to commit atrocities including rape, sexual violence, and mutilation. Also, 250 Israelis, men, women, and children, were taken hostage and still today, more than 100 of them remain in captivity, 60 are believed to be alive. Israel's bubble of invincibility was shattered that day. But now after a year-long massive military campaign to root out Hamas in Gaza, decapitated Hezbollah, and wage war in Lebanon, Israeli is seizing back the initiative. To understand the implications for Israeli society, I spoke to top journalist there Ilana Dayan about how people have coped with all that's happened and what her reporting since October 7 has revealed.

I carry everything I saw, the bodies I saw, the atrocities I saw, the people I know, the second cousin of mine who was kidnapped at gunpoint, our political correspondent whose family, two parents and two kids, were executed at gunpoint. The grandmother was murdered with her autistic grandchild. So, I carry the scars because it's so personally experienced. It is something which we all experienced so personally that I have to tell you that the sense of detachment that you have to have as a reporter is something very difficult to implement.

Clearly, we were forced to leave our homes and houses under really heavy Israeli bombardment. We were forced to move from one neighborhood to another looking for some sort of safety. We we're forced to leave the north of the Strip after following the Israeli military orders to no longer remain in the north of Gaza because it will be an active military war zone.

In Gaza, every day for Palestinian journalists is a question of life or death. Like you leave your house, you're completely unsure if you're going to return back to your family or not. And this is a proper reflection about the systematic targeting of Palestinian journalists. We're talking about more than 160 Palestinian journalists were killed since the war began.

They took my father. They have done things that I'm not able to tell my therapist yet. And I still -- I can't even speak about it. I am upset that they profited from this.
