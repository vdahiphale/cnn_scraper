And let's just say that some of Elon Musk's rocket launches have gone better. The live stream crashed. The sound cut in and out. But eventually, DeSantis made his case. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL): If you nominate me, you can set your clock to January 20th, 2025 at high noon, because on the west side of the US. Capitol, I will be taking the oath of office as the 47th president of the United States. No excuses, I will get the job done. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And the queen rock and roll, Tina Turner, dies at the age of 83. So many classic songs, so many electric performances, and her challenging life story was an inspiration to millions. So, tonight, we'll play you our favorite Tina performances. Yes, we're going to have some music tonight in the program. All right, but let's begin with Ron DeSantis' glitchy Twitter launch of his presidential campaign. Here with me tonight, we have reality checker extraordinaire John Avlon, former Trump White House Communications Director Alyssa Farah Griffin, former Senate Candidate Joe Pinion and Scott Jennings, who worked for President George W.

And as they say in politics, if you're explaining, you're losing, and everything from Disney to all the things that have befallen him.So, yes, I think he had to go out there and continue with this kind of quest to do the behind the scenes work with those state legislature members.

They did harm on the tech front, but then looking presidential. It was a very strange platform, having him with two other people. You can't even see him. I mean, comm staffers, advanced staffers spend months to the T planning these things to make you see the candidate and say, that is the next leader of the free world. And in him hind of hobnobbing with billionaire Elon Musk about a variety of, by the way, important issues, but off camera, and then this other gentleman jumping in, it did not feel presidential.

Let's square that within the basic realm of what used to be chapter and verse within conservatism.Look, he's got nowhere to go but up. Obviously, he's got a strong lane and an argument to make. But let's not also kid ourselves that this launch with Twitter spaces was anything other than disastrous. It was a disastrous launch. From a tech standpoint, it was a mess. There were no visuals.
