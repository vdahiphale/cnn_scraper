Post debate polling from The New York Times and Siena College showing Kamala Harris and Donald Trump in a dead heat nationally, 4 7-4 7 among likely voters. I have no idea what voice that was. Just go with it. But then, if you take a closer look at Pennsylvania, it offers this snapshot, putting Harris ahead of Trump with a four-point lead now.Today, Harris is focusing in on Battleground, Michigan, bringing in the big guns with Oprah and a huge zoom event with more than 90,000 people expected to tune in. It's been built as an intimate conversation, though, it's a mostly virtual event, so as intimate as one can get there. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez is joining us now with much more on this. What are they going to do with this polling snapshot today, Priscilla?",

      "sentences": "Well, Kate, there are some bright spots in this polling and some things that the campaign has been cautioning about.So, let me just break this down for you. Pennsylvania, definitely a bright spot and some good news for this campaign because as you see there is an edge of 4 percentage points for the vice president. Of course, Pennsylvania has been a state that she has been very focused on spending a large amount of her time over the last two weeks in that state. Now, another point in this poll, though, is that the state of the economy and concerns about it are still widespread. And that is where the campaign is still trying to make inroads and getting that economic message to those voters and reassuring them that the economy is moving in the right direction or at the very least that her policies will help get it there. So, that is something that the campaign is certainly looking at. And then, two, she's winning 46 percent of white voters in Pennsylvania. That's an important bloc, one that usually leans toward former President Donald Trump. So, that's another bit of good news here. But when you look at this big picture, nationally, this is still a deadlocked. They are still in a very, very tight race. And when you talk to campaign officials, as I do, they know that it's going to be tight until the very end. So, presented with these polls, that's typically their response. And I'll also note that this polling, which was done after the debate, voters saying that the vice president did far better than former President Donald Trump. And campaign advisers, they were delighted after that debate performance by the vice president. But in that conversation, they would also say, but Hillary Clinton may have won her debates too in 2016 and she didn't win. So, they are also aware that even though they see these polls, that there is a resounding sort of positive review for the vice president, that it's not guaranteed that she wins in November. And she herself has been saying this on the campaign trail. So again, this poll, some bright spots, especially with the state of Pennsylvania, which they're so focused on as part of their pathway to 270, but certainly showing that the race is still remains deadlocked, despite that debate.",

And even as the Republican governor of the state asked him to tone down this divisive rhetoric, even as the people who run the city of Springfield are saying that these need to be debunked, he continues to double down, J.D.

Also overnight, Israeli airstrikes charted Hezbollah weapons and infrastructure sites in Lebanon.

We've been reporting on operations targeting Hezbollah members with exploding pagers and walkie-talkies. At least 32 people killed from these attacks, thousands injured.

[07:15:05] And, of course, this is causing a great deal of concern among ordinary Lebanese. The Ministry of Transport here, for instance, has banned walkie-talkies and pagers from all flights leaving out of Beirut. And the government, the army has been busy, essentially detonating suspicious devices. Just last night, right next to where we are at the American University of Beirut Hospital, the army blew up some suspicious devices and many people are essentially putting their phones and other communications devices as far away as possible, given the fear that perhaps a third day of these attacks will take place.

This was a rip the band aid off type move, as one analyst put it this morning. They also they're not done, right? They're penciling in another half a point of rate cuts this year, another full point next year. The other point here is they really tried hard to emphasize that they're not scared, that they don't see this as coming to the rescue moment for the jobs market. At one point, Powell even said that labor market is in a strong place. We want to keep it there. Now, some economists are relieved that the Fed is moving aggressively to address these cracks in the jobs market before they spread. Moody's economist, Mark Zandi, he tweeted out that this big rate cut, quote, all but cements an economic soft landing. And he added the Fed got policy right today. Now, as far as what this means for everyone at home, first, it means the Fed is serious about protecting the jobs market. They don't want the unemployment rate to rise. Of course, it also means good news for borrowers. If you're someone who is trying to get a mortgage right now, this does suggest that rates are going to continue to drip lower. Same thing if you're someone who needs to refinance a mortgage or perhaps you need to take out a home equity loan to pay for a major home improvement project, same thing for people who want a car loan right now, big, big help for everyone struggling to pay off credit card debt where you have record high interest rates. This is also encouraging news for all those mom and pop shops on Main Street because, yes, small business loans are going to get cheaper. And don't forget, small businesses are among the biggest job creators in this economy. So, at the end of the day, the Fed is making clear that their mission has switched. It's gone from fighting inflation to fighting unemployment. And, John, that does mean lower interest rates.",
