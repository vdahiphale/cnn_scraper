This is a historic day because it's the final day Donald Trump will ever campaign for President in his life. He says he will never run again. He's 78 years old, if he doesn't win, he's facing possible jail time, if he does win, the prosecutions go away. And he says he'll only stay in for one term. This is a historic day. He'll never be running for President again after today. He's going to try to leave it all on the field today. So, whether people love Donald Trump or want to see him removed from the public field and never running for President again, this is the day. But as we think about all this, you know, his bashing of the media and his appeals to violence in some ways, they are the two most memorable aspects of his runs for office. It is what helps bring together his crowds. It's his appeal that the media can't be trusted, only trust Trump. That's been his approach from day one. And here are the final stretch, we've seen this for three cycles now, he seems to bash the media the most intensely in the final days before an election. Maybe that's because he's superstitious, he's watching -- the coverage is getting frustrated.

Protesters calling the king a murderer. They are angry with the government's response to the disaster. The people of Oklahoma face another round of severe weather today.Yesterday, 11 people were injured when tornadoes and flooding ripped through the state. Similar conditions expected throughout the day today. And that does bring us to weather. That severe storm threat also stretching across other parts of the central plains today, tomorrow could be a wet election day in some parts of the country. Let's get to our meteorologist, the weatherman Derek Van Dam. Derek, good morning.",

Absolutely terrifying. There were actually two confirmed EF-2 or EF-3 tornadoes, that's winds of over 136 miles per hour.No wonder we're seeing this damage. And many of the tornadoes actually struck in the middle of the night. So, that obviously makes it that much more difficult to warn individuals. Here they are, seven tornado reports in total, unfortunately, a few of them causing the injuries and the destruction you saw in the video just a few moments ago. And no rest for the weary, another round of severe weather possible today. You can see the greatest risk where we have the shading of orange that includes Oklahoma city once again, tornadoes, some of which could be strong, that means EF-2 or stronger. We've highlighted the areas where we believe the greatest chance of tornadic activity exists, and that is across central and eastern portions of Oklahoma. Right now, satellite radar very busy, lots of lightning, but the tornado threat really ramps up later this afternoon and evening as our cold front advances further eastward, Kasie.",
