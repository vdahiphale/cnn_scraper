The estimates have grown more dire. There are only seven to eight hours left of breathable air for the five on board. But the U.S. Coast Guard making it clear earlier today this is 100 percent still a search and rescue mission. Every available asset is being put toward finding the vessel and there is still hope.More mysterious banging type noises have been picked up by sonar today. They were similar to the sounds that were picked up in the search efforts yesterday. But the Coast Guard still can't determine exactly what the source is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CAPT. JAMIE FREDERICK, U.S. COAST GUARD: I can't tell you what the noises are. But what can I tell you is, and I think this is the most important point, we are searching where the noises are and that is all we can do at this point. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But the focus is on an area 900 miles off the coast of Cape Cod, where this vessel was last believed to be on its search for the wreckage of the Titanic. It is called the Titan. But it is exact -- it is actually a very small vessel, about the size of a minivan.And just to give you an idea of how close those corners are, according to OceanGate's website, the total dimensions are 22 feet long, 9.2 feet wide, and 8 feet high and it only has the capacity for 5 people, one pilot and four members of the crew. There are not any seats inside. It is the size and the shape of the cylinder. So, passenger sit on the floor with their backs arched against the sides. You are looking there at a typical seating configuration for the people inside. And this, here is a photo of the actual inside of the sub posted on OceanGate site. So, you can get a sense, a visual of just how much room, or lack thereof, that there is on board. Now, it is impossible to know what the experience of these passengers what might be like right now. Oxygen is running out, the carbon dioxide levels are likely rising and the threat of hypothermia is also growing. But those conditions are undoubtedly harrowing. Joining us now is CNN National Correspondent Jason Carroll. He is in Boston. That is where some of the Coast Guard searchers are based. So, Jason, what is the latest on this search?",

And you can imagine how agonizing at this hour it must be for these families as they are waiting for some sort of word.A number of folks hanging their hopes on those noises that you talked about, the noises that we first got indication about, and that was yesterday, when this Canadian aircraft flying overhead had dropped these sonar buoys into the water and detected these banging sounds, the same banging sounds heard again today. So, there is some hope there. But as you also heard, there is no confirmation in terms of exactly what these banging sounds are at this point. And so what they have done is they have taken that acoustic data, they sent it to the U.S. Navy for analysis to get some sort of confirmation. Until that point, this is very much a search and rescue mission, though, time is clearly running out. Abby?",

There's only very few submersibles or machines in the world that can go down to that depth and very few that can actually, if they can get down on that depth, it can actually work.So, the first thing that we need to do is they need to do is find the submersible. And I know that they're working very hard. Most likely, this submersible is on the bottom of the ocean. It's not floating on the surface and it's probably not in the word of water column in between the bottom in the surface. It goes on to surface, most likely, it would have been found by the intensive air and surface search that they have had going on covering a very large area. If it's on the bottom it's probably much closer to the wreck of the Titanic, there's not a lot of current down there. It is dark, it is very cold, it's 2.5 miles deep, so for the Navy's ROV that can go down there to work. It's got 20,000 feet of cable. The ROV is the size of a cargo van. The 20,000 feet of cable that is hooked to it is about inch-and-a-half to two inches in diameter. So, that's on a big drum. Just think of it, that's three to four miles of this cable wrap around a big drum. So, that is a big piece of equipment. It's got its own crane that it comes with. It's got a tonics (ph) box full of control consoles and other boxes full of spare parts for it. So, it is a really big load out. It takes a while to get on-site. It takes a while to get on the ship. And it's going to be secured to the ship, loaded on the deck. And it takes a while for that ship to transit on there. Once it's on station, if and when they find the submersible, then they're able to put the ROV down and investigate the submersible, find out what kind of condition it's at, whether it is just lost electrical power, whether it stuck under something or whether it had a catastrophic structural failure.",

They died by violence. They didn't die peacefully. It wasn't like they fell asleep and woke up the next day in heaven. I mean, I wrote a poem called Titanic among the crowds, angels guide me home. And I feel that Titanic is in two places right now. She's in the sand and silt in the sea, and she is also in heaven. And we must revere that.

And, of course, that is where they talk about the evidence that each of the sides going to have here in this case. And what we are learning tonight from this new court filing, Abby, is that Special Counsel Jack Smith and his team have started turning over their evidence, what they have, to Trump's team, to Trump's legal team. Now, of course, that we are told here is that this includes the non- classified stuff. That is going to be another entire challenge for them essentially, but this includes things like witness transcripts of witnesses who went before the grand jury. It could give Trump's legal team an indication of who may be used to potentially testify against him in that jury pool. Of course, we know essentially everyone in Mar-a-Lago has gone in and spoken before this grand jury, ranging from people who were working in the kitchen, to maintenance workers, to his closest aides. But what is interesting here and what we were noticing, our team, as we were looking at this, is they used the word plural when talking about interviews in recordings that they have of Trump, which they said they were made it his consent. Of course, we know one of those was when he was speaking with people who were ghost writing that book for Mark Meadows, and that is where he was talking about seemingly having a classified document in front of him. We don't yet know what these other recordings are. We don't know what is on them. We don't know how relevant they are. It does say that they are made with Trump's consent. They could potentially even be public comments that he's made about the classifying, the declassification process, what he knows there. That has obviously been a focus this week. And so it still remains to be seen what those are. But it is significant that now discovery has started in this documents case.",

So, it was sort of like verdict today, trial tomorrow. And Nancy Pelosi did with Kevin McCarthy is going to do, which is they brought it to the floor and they tabled it, which isn't really a vote for or against it. It just basically says, we are going to put it on the side and it dies a slow death there. And that is what Kevin McCarthy is saying here. I will say, though, impeachment used to be kind of, yes, it had happened twice in our history, but prior to the Trump administration, it was kind of something that was unimaginable and then it happened very quickly in two years with Donald Trump. And I think a lot of Republicans, particularly in the ring wing, came in really looking for payback fright from the start. You impeached our president, we are going to impeach your president, even though as Kevin McCarthy said, it hasn't gone through a committee, and, in fact, what is the high crime and misdemeanor?

It was not.You know, he spent four years. He brought three cases, one minor fellow and the FBI pleaded guilty. And the two big cases he brought to trial, both men were found not guilty.

Kennedy Jr. is asking Americans to let him run the country as president while he spreads those baseless claims. But the question, are some parts of the media going soft when it comes to challenging these conspiracy theories? RFK Jr. is best known for spreading the vaccine misinformation, including this debunked claim that vaccines cause autism.But it is also worth noting that his baseless conspiracies go far beyond vaccines. And here is just a taste of it. Without evidence, he says that China and the U.S. are developing race-based bio weapons. Without evidence, he claims that COVID-19 was genetically engineered as a bioweapon. Without evidence, he claims that 5G technology is being used to, quote, \"harvest our data and control our behavior.\" Without evidence, he claimed mass shootings are linked to prescription drugs. Without evidence, he claimed the 2004 presidential election was stolen. Without evidence, he says that the U.S. may be plotting to assassinate him. That's a lot. So let's bring in senior media reporter at CNN here, Oliver Darcy. And Eric Deggans, he's the author of \"Race Bader\" and a TV critic for NPR. So, Oliver, you raised this very wisely in your newsletter this week that everyone should read, of course. One of the reasons that this is an important topic is because of where RFK Jr. is in this presidential process. Look at this poll from CNN. Biden is at 60 percent, and Kennedy is at 20 percent. I mean, maybe a lot of this is name recognition, but how should we be covering him? OLIVER DARCY, CNN SR. MEDIA REPORTER: Well, Abby, I think when you're thinking about covering a conspiracy theorist, someone like him, you need to first evaluate whether they're worth the coverage, because often conspiracy theories or theorists thrive when they're getting a lot of media attention. And if you do determine they are worth the coverage, I think it's important to be direct, to be clear with audiences about their beliefs. A lot of people in the media class, they follow RFK Jr., they know how delusional some of his ideas are, but to everyday Americans he might just be a Kennedy. And so if the news, the press is not relaying some of the things that you just went through to audiences, I don't think they're getting a clear picture of who he is and how unhinged from reality some of his ideas are. [22:55:21] PHILIP: Yeah, I mean, I think that it is not sufficient to call him, frankly, a vaccine skeptic. Eric, how do you think this balance should be struck in the media and how these lies and misinformation are covered?",

And so even when, you know, media outlets cover him and try to explain how, you know, out of line his views are and how, you know, unmoored in data or reality of facts they are.The fact that they're paying attention to him, gives him an imprimatur that I think is hard to overcome. And this is something that all kinds of media outlets have experienced with other people, for example, Donald Trump. It's hard to handle Donald Trump's misinformation when you're training a camera on him and talking about him for hours and hours in a day. And so, you know, my question is, why is he being covered at all? And if he's being covered, why aren't we asking the tough question, why are so many people willing to admit that this guy might be a good candidate for president? Maybe that's the question we should be asking. But if you bring him on television and you explore his views and try to debunk them, what you find is that just giving him that interview gives him more exposure than perhaps he should have.",

I mean, there won't be a story that's published or an interview that runs that does not call him a right-wing conspiracy theorist, someone who has trafficked in insane delusions. But when it comes to people like RFK Jr., a Kennedy or other prominent officials in government who do traffic in a lot of conspiracy theories and outright lies, I think there's this hesitation to call them out and to call them for what they are, even though they are really peddling a lot of the same delusions that someone like Alex Jones is. It's just, I think, much more difficult for the press, and frankly uncomfortable for them, to call a prominent government official or a Kennedy a conspiracy theorist, someone who is peddling lies to the American public. But frankly, because of their respected prominent positions in society, it really warrants that kind of coverage so people understand exactly who these people are. And the press is direct with them about this instead of really just beating around the bush with watered down language.",

They're doing stories about him getting sued for what he said about the Sandy Hook Massacre, which is a different thing. It's easier to cover someone who's mired in controversy where the story is about all the negative things that are being said about that person.
