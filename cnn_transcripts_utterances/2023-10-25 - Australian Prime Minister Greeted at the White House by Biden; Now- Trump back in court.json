Right now, in New York, Trump's Former Attorney Michael Cohen is back on the stand, testifying against Trump in the $250 million civil fraud trial that could take down Trump's business empire. Cohen testified -- started his testimony yesterday and talked about how he helped manipulate Trump's net worth, talking about reverse engineering.Also, there's this, in D.C., Donald Trump's former chief of staff, Mark Meadows, he has now been granted immunity to testify in the 2020 election subversion case. According to ABC News, Meadows has spoken with a special counsel Jack Smith in his team at least three times this year. Reportedly telling investigators that he did not believe the election was stolen and said so. CNN's Kristen Holmes following the story for us. She joins us now. Kristen, what more are you learning about Meadows, what he has said and what he could do here? KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Kate. I actually want to start with some breaking news because we actually just heard from Donald Trump addressing this directly outside of court when he was on his way to the courtroom. And he said, he doesn't believe these reports that Meadows was offered an immunity deal, took an immunity deal. And he also said that he's spoken to Mark Meadows many, many times over the last years and he, being Meadows, strongly believed the election was rigged. Now, this is important because, as you mentioned, in this ABC report it says that Meadows sat down with federal prosecutors on multiple occasions. And in those conversations, Meadows denied that he, himself, believed the election was stolen, and he said that Trump was being, \"Dishonest\" when after the election, after those polls closed in 2020, he went and said that they won the election. Claiming victory early on. The other thing, according to this report that federal prosecutors focused on were conversations between Meadows and Trump after he lost the election, as well as Trump's reactions on the day of the January 6th riot. I do think we cannot stress enough how important Meadows is as a witness. Now, we do not know any kind of details of what this immunity deal could be. But just given his proximity to the former president, he was not only his chief of staff. He was one of his closest confidants and he was, essentially, in the final days of the White House, a gatekeeper for Donald Trump. Keep in mind, people -- Donald Trump does not usually use his phone. He didn't in the White House. He wasn't getting calls on his phone or texting on his own phone. He was often going through Mark Meadows, so that's one aspect here. We also know from that January 6th Committee hearing that Meadows was essentially painted as being at the epicenter of everything that was going on regarding election denialism. So, he could not be a more critical witness, if this is true, if these reports are true and what exactly this immunity deal looks like. But of course, I talked to a number of Trump allies who are concerned.",

What exactly are they advising, particularly when it comes to a possible ground invasion?",

      "sentences": "Well, John, they're advising Israel to have a very clear strategy and one that doesn't get them bogged down in a long-term, kind of, occupation of the Gaza Strip. And so, what they have been telling the Israelis is to avoid the kind of street by street, house by house fighting that the U.S. did against insurgents in Iraq in 2004 in Fallujah. And focus more on precision airstrikes, as well as special operations raids to try to target some of these senior Hamas figures that Israel has said that it wants to eliminate in order to degrade the organization as a whole.Essentially, the message has been trying to steer them away from a large-scale ground incursion that does not have very clear military objectives, and towards something that is more precise and more well thought out in terms of not only the strategy to getting these Hamas figures, but also an exit plan. That is one of the key messages that the administration has sought to drive home from the Israelis is learn from our mistakes when it comes to the U.S. war on terror and have a strategy to withdraw and have a governance plan in place, right, for Gaza because Hamas right now is in control of the entirety of Gaza. And so, all of these things are being communicated to the Israelis via a three-star general on the ground there, General Glenn, who led marines in Fallujah back in 2004. Someone very well equipped to advise them on the complexities of urban warfare. John.",

In this latest move to rein in social media giant, state attorneys general have joined forces to essentially say, you are hurting our young people. 33 state attorneys general are now filing this lawsuit that alleges this, in part, and I'll read it. It alleges, Meta's design choices and practices take advantage of and contribute to young users' susceptibility to addiction. They exploit psychological vulnerabilities of young users through the false promise that meaningful social connection lies in the next story, image or video and that ignoring the next piece of social content could lead to social isolation.And they're not alone. In addition, eight other states are filing separate but similar lawsuits in state court. One of the attorneys general leading the federal lawsuit is the Attorney General of California, Rob Bonta, and he joins us now. Attorney General, thank you so much. First and foremost, why now to take this -- are you all taking this step? Because as we know, there has been concern and it has been studied and displayed for years the impact social media platforms can have on young kids' mental health.",

And over the last two years, we had an investigation that's launched. We've interviewed witnesses. We've received volumes and warehouses of documents and did our due diligence.So, now that that is complete, we've had an opportunity to discuss the federal and state theories of liability. We're ready to file. It's important that we -- when we do it, we do it right. And so, our due diligence is complete, and we have come to a very sober and somber conclusion that Meta is hurting our children, the nation's children, that they are doing it knowingly and that they're lying about it. And as a father of three, as the attorney general of California, I can't stand by and let that happen, so we have taken action to hold them accountable.",

We share the attorney generals' commitment to providing teens with safe, positive experiences online, and have already introduced over 30 tools to support teens and their families. Going on to say, we're disappointed that instead of working productively with companies across the industry to create clear, age- appropriate standards for the many apps teens use, the attorneys general have chosen this path.Was there another path here? Could you get a quicker fix and a quicker solution for the country's kids if you would work with the companies rather than take them to court?",

It's another thing to act on it. We need action, not words. And if you share that view, act on it. It's really that simple. They have known for the last two years that they have been investigated by attorneys general throughout the country.And by the way, multiple states, 33 states, bipartisan states, states that don't agree on a lot but agree on this. Red states and blue states, Republican states and Democratic states, they agreed that Meta is hurting our children. So, this is no surprise. They've had two years to act. You know, it's a -- I think those are empty words, really, to say that now, now that the lawsuit is coming. They knew it was coming. They had two years to act to change their course of conduct. They can still change their course of conduct. It's not too late. It's not a point beyond return. So, if they mean what they say, act on it.",
