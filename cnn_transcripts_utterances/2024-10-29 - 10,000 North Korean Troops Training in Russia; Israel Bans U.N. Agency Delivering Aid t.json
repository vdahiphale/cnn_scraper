Reuters is reporting that the Derzhprom building, which was one of the most celebrated landmarks in Kharkiv, was struck by a guided bomb on Monday. Kharkiv's governor says several floors have been destroyed.The building was completed in 1928, when Kharkiv was the capital of Soviet Ukraine. It was also on a tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites. And new this hour, South Korean lawmakers and media reporting that North Korean soldiers deployed to Russia are now being taught basic Russian commands, including words like fire, and may be sent to the front lines of the war with Ukraine. But it's unclear if they'll be able to overcome the language barrier. The U.S. Defense Department believes North Korea has already deployed 10,000 of its troops to train in eastern Russia. Pentagon officials say some of those forces have already moved closer to Ukraine. And NATO's new secretary-general says it's clear that Russia can't handle its own war. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
