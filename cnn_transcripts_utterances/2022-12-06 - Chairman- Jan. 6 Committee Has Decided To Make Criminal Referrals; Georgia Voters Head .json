So, obviously, front and center is the question, will Donald Trump in any way, will there be a criminal referral? And the language that we've heard from the committee is interesting, \"we'll be focused on the main organizers and leaders of the attacks.\"So, will that be people in and around Donald Trump? Will that have to do with people who might have organized in the more -- you know that they were involved in the attack? There are some people I think we should keep an eye on for when the committee is going to meet later today. We may know more details this evening. But let's think about some of the people who did not cooperate with the committee. People who took the Fifth, who worked within and around Donald Trump. Jeffrey Clark from the Justice Department, John Eastman, the conservative lawyer, Michael Flynn, Roger Stone, Alex Jones, the Arizona GOP chair, Kelly Ward, all of these people took the Fifth. What does the committee think about what they learned in those that they would send over to justice? There are also people who refuse to cooperate, Steve Bannon, Mark Meadows, Peter Navarro. And finally, there's another group that's going to be very interesting to watch. And those are the Republican members of Congress who were subpoenaed. Kevin McCarthy, who may very well be the next Speaker of the House, Scott Perry, Jim Jordan, Andy Biggs, Mo Brooks. I'm not suggesting that any of these names may be the final referrals, but they're ones we really have to watch.",

Of course, this is after the former president's social media -- social media posting about terminating the Constitution to I guess, bring him back into office. We'll turn that sound and bring it to you.But what I was mentioning before is that the family of Brian Sicknick walked by McConnell and Kevin McCarthy at the Congressional Gold Medal ceremony and walked by their extended hands.

And she told us -- she said -- and this was her quote that she's thought they were two-faced. She said that they say they support Capitol Police but then they go to \"Mar-a-Lago and \"kiss the ring.\" And I think it's worth noting that McCarthy has been down to Mar-a- Lago several times since then. McConnell who did not vote to impeach former President Trump over those actions has condoned those actions and spoken out very strongly against them after all of that unfolded. But that was quite a moment to witness during that ceremony today. And again, just to zoom out to the bigger picture. This is the highest honor that Congress can bestow on anyone and they are bestowing it on the Capitol Police Department officers and the Washington, DC Metropolitan Police officers who, of course, did everything they can to defend -- everything they could to defend the Capitol on January 6. I'll let you listen to a little bit from Pelosi and Schumer. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN.

NANCY PELOSI, (D-CA): The sound of blood-curdling screams, the smell of gas, and smooth, all remain raw.

My purpose for speaking out was because -- or not because of what I did on January 6, and it wasn't even because of what I experienced personally on January 6, it was because the things that I observed were so inspiring. The officers who I observed fighting alongside of me in the tunnel are so inspiring that I was willing to sacrifice my career and even my personal safety.And this has come at great personal cost to me, I think everyone knows that, to get those officers recognized.

The things that he hasn't been able to complete yet in the Senate. But he's also hit his opponent, Herschel Walker, hard on his character, and also talked about whether or not he's fit for Office.

There are three counties in the entire state, Jefferson County right there, Sumpter County, and Clay County.Now, these are not big counties, right? Sumpter County, which by the way, is the hometown of Jimmy Carter Plains, Georgia is there. You can just see. Sumpter County, you know, you're dealing with thousands of votes here, but not tens or hundreds of thousands of votes there. But these are three counties that Raphael Warnock won, and you can see Brian Kemp won. They were red for Brian Kemp, again, blue for Raphael Warnock. Again, why does this matter? I'm going to write this here so we remember it. You see Herschel Walker got 1.9 million votes in the election one month ago. Look at what Brian Kemp did. On the very same ballot, a Republican on the same ballot got 2.1 million votes. So, 200,000 more votes for the Republican Brian Kemp than the Republican Herschel Walker. That's where Herschel Walker needs to get some of that vote. Some of that 200,000, you can see the margin between Warnock and Walker was just 37,000 votes. So, somehow, he's got to eat into that. Let me just show you what Amara was talking about also in Cobb County right here. Cobb County is a very big County, unlike the ones I just showed you. You can see Raphael Warnock won by some 50,000 votes. But look at Herschel Walker's vote total, 125,000 votes, Brian Kemp there, 147,000, so 22,000 votes alone in Cobb County. And I was just showing you there again, the margin for overall is just about 37,000 votes for Warnock one month ago. Herschel Walker wants to eat into that.",

Duke Energy is saying that they were able to get about 3000 more customers hooked up in the last several hours, still about 35,000 customers without power. And they think that that will be the case through Thursday, sometime. They believe they can get those two substations to be powered up. But that's -- you know there's an army of people trying to get that power restored.And there's an army of investigators trying to figure out what exactly, who did this, and why. Saying that they don't have specific leads at the moment, but they are hearing from the public and chasing down every single lead they can. They have investigators from the local, state, and federal level, FBI involved here trying to figure out who did this. Interestingly, also looking at a very old incident that was similar. One in 2013 in California that took out the power around Silicon Valley there. The difference in this location -- these two substations went down, Duke Energy because of the way it's configured, they were not able to move energy through other channels to get homes energized in this area, but a Duke Energy spokesperson says look, they deal with outages all the time. This one was different. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But there are things like tornadoes, there's cars that hit poles, there's all kinds of things that happen every day on the system and so that's why it's so important that we have a resilient system because you can't always know and plan for everything that could happen. And you have to be able to respond so that you can recover quickly from that.But you know, from a personal standpoint, when this comes out of the blue, we understand that that is -- that is scary. That's uncomfortable. For our folks, this is what we're trying to do. This is what we go do every day, no matter what the hazard or what the outage is, we're trying to get the power back on.
