The Kremlin claims a deal has been reached to drop criminal charges against Yevgeny Prigozhin. It requires him though to leave the country and go live in Belarus.But Prigozhin has not confirmed the deal. And it has not been seen since Saturday night. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken warning quote, we haven't seen the last act, signaling the political threat may not be over. CNN's Nic Robertson joins us now from London this morning.

The fact that the Prime Minister does come out and speak about the challenge to internal security don't show us that Putin doesn't want to be associated with that message.This huge mess was on his watch. We don't know as you say where he is, we don't know where his Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu is at the moment, although he was also seen on camera today at location supposedly at a Western -- Russian Western military base, but again, without speaking, and we really don't know when it was shot either. What does that tell us right now, the Kremlin wants to move forward. But Prigozhin is the one that perhaps could offer the alternate narrative on all of this. And he of course, is the one who has completely disappeared, no sight nor sound extensively on his way to Belarus. The fact that he hasn't arrived there or appeared anywhere on camera, given his propensity to take him to social media to tell everyone whose views about any given situation that this stage now has to be something of a surprise.",

In fact, in some cases, you saw a reporter in Moscow standing in a peaceful, quiet garden showing just tranquil weekend traffic going around the Kremlin. You certainly didn't see any of the major commotion that we were showing. And that's indicative of them wanting to portray a stable Russia that their neighbor has this under control. Yet on Chinese social media, which as you point out, is tightly controlled, heavily censored at times, too. There were discussions of this, but they didn't go beyond questioning the relationship between China and Russia.",

We do have some breaking news, an audio statement released from Wagner Chief Yevgeny Prigozhin, not sure where he was when he released this, who has checked the validity. But in this statement, he says, that two factors played into his decision to turn around the march to Moscow. He said he wanted to avoid Russian bloodshed. He also said the march was a demonstration of protests, not intended to overthrow the power in Moscow.He also said the aim of the march was to avoid the destruction of the Wagner group. So with me now, CNN military analyst retired Lieutenant General Mark Hertling and CNN national security analyst and former CIA chief of Russia operations, Steve Hall. Steve, what do you make of what was said in the statement, and also the fact it's audio only. We haven't seen a picture of Yevgeny Prigozhin.",

My first question was what you alluded to, which is be fascinating to know where this came from. The comments to me is, we've looked at it very carefully -- very briefly, rather. It seems to me like this is part of the deal.So it's like, OK, whatever deal has been cut between Prigozhin and in the Wagner group and the Kremlin. However, that worked out whatever under the table backroom deal that was, it sounds to me like this is part of it. In other words, he's saying, hey, I wasn't going after Putin. I wasn't trying to overthrow the government. I did have some legitimate gripes. This is some part of an agreement that's, I think, supposed to validate this, probably with the Russian domestic audience.",

General, on a different subject to you, one of the fascinating questions I think that's out there is, if you're a Russian soldier, in a trench, you know, in the Donbass region, what are you thinking right now?LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: John, I always try and give you new things as I come on with you. And the one I'm going to give you this morning is that the greatest distance on the battlefield is the six inches between the ears of the commanders. In this case, what you just reported from Prigozhin, we don't know what's in his head right now. But it is going to echo within the line of troops. You know, what you're talking about is creating trust, trust between the leaders in the government and the soldiers, trust between the soldiers in one another, their cohesion and their camaraderie that exist on the battlefield. Those things have been affected, if not been destroyed. You can't step aside and move forward like Nic said, Mr. Putin is trying to do because what we're seeing is that is a disease that's inculcated into Russian leadership. Prigozhin is just a symptom of that disease, which really centers around dysfunction, distrust, personalities, greed, corruption, power, ego, all of those things. It is in my view, as a military commander is going to affect the soldiers on the front line. A lot of people are saying it's not, I contend that it will, especially if you start integrating those Prigozhin Wagner troops into the normal units of the Russian army.",

And when I say weakened, it's certainly true vis-a-vis, you know, the West, but that's been sort of a weakening thing over the past, you know, a couple of, you know, well, 18 months. But I think that he must sense that he's weaker vis- a-vis, the most important and the most dangerous people to him. And those are his close advisers, who I think are saying, so let me see if I get this straight. We were going to go into Ukraine. It was all going to be over in a couple of days.And now we have what really amounts to a coup attempt. What's next with this guy, with Putin? This he wouldn't be the first, you know, Russian leader who was removed in a coup, I mean, in a coup. I mean, Gorbachev suffered the same fate. So that's entirely possible. Prigozhin, you know, I think he's very suspicious that we don't see him. We don't really actually know where he is. We don't know when this was done. We don't even know if he's still alive or and if so how long it'll be? BERMAN: General, what about these Wagner troops, these thousands of people who we thought were loyal to Prigozhin and who were having some of the greatest success insofar as the Russians were having any success on the battlefield inside Ukraine?

He is about to hold his first public event since the insurrection in Russia, just as Russia is also saying that it is now investigating whether Western intelligence was involved in the revolt.

Moments ago, a spokesperson for the National Security Council Adam Hodge told me, quote, the United States was not involved and will not get involved in this situation. This was an internal Russian matter, he added.Now this speaks to the very quiet and cautious strategy that we have seen from the White House over the past few days. They have not wanted to provide any fodder or offer Putin any opening to try to use any of the White House's or the United States words to try to suggest that they're -- they were involved in this rebellion. And that is something a message that was also relayed in phone calls, President Biden made two key allies over the weekend. He convened calls with the leaders of the U.K., Germany, France and also a separate call with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. And additionally, he also spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. One thing in that call with those European allies that was stressed was trying to just let the situation in Russia play out try not to tip the scales in any way. And additionally, what the President was trying to do in these calls was made clear that the U.S. continues to stand behind Ukraine and will continue to offer support to the country as Russia continues to wage this war. One of the big questions has been how this rebellion in Russia not only impacts Putin's power in Russia, but also what it could mean the broader impact for the war in Ukraine. Now, so far we haven't heard directly from President Biden. He will be speaking at an event a bit later today on a different topic about high speed internet, but we will see whether he feels any questions from reporters on the matter, as officials here are still working to determine the broader impact of what this rebellion will mean.",
