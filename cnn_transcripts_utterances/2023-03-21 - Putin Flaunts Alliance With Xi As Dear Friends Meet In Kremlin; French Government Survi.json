It's created a dangerous situation in Eurasia. And so I think, you know, Xi is very carefully triangulating between Russia and the United States, and certainly closer to Russia.

There was heavy security outside the French Parliament Monday with the first of two new confidence loads fairly by just nine votes. And that sparks another round of protests across France.The protests have been ongoing now for weeks, hundreds marched in the streets chanting anti-government slogans. Or in Paris, there were violent clashes, at least 70 people were detained. CNN's Sam Kiley has the latest now on the vote, and the unrest reporting in from Paris. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): The government of Emmanuel Macron was ruling Renaissance Party narrowly survived a vote of confidence in the National Assembly here in Paris following an attempt to unseat it, which was the result of his decision or his Prime Minister's decision to ram through legislation to raise the pensionable age in this country from 62 to 64, last Thursday. Now last Thursday, and in all the subsequent evenings, there have been spontaneous demonstrations in Paris and elsewhere in the country, these demonstrations here in Paris, have actually been more muted than they were in the previous three days, with a change of tactics on the street, among the protesters moving in smaller groups, burning the large piles of garbage that have collected here in the French capital, as a result of the strike action that has been taken in response to these attempts by the government to reform the pension system as part of the wider economic reforms that Emmanuel Macron, the French president has been trying to bring in. Now, there'll be a lot more focus, though of the opposition on what will happen this coming Thursday when the unions are going to be involved in organized protests across the whole country, alongside a wide range of strikes that have already not quite crippled France, but certainly affected the garbage situation here in Paris, international and local public transport, and even the oil sector, those have already been affected. But on Thursday, there'll be much wider strikes, much more organized demonstrations, much more widespread participation across the country. The union's hoping the opposition to these policies hope, and that could be a test for whether Emmanuel Macron is going to stick with this policy. But at the moment, all signs are that he will and that he will probably succeed. Sam Kiley, CNN in Paris. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The scientists from around the world agreeing that humanity is unequivocally heating up the planet, and unsustainable ways, both with energy addictions to fossil fuels, land use problems, deforestation, agricultural practices and human consumption. And it calls for world governments to rapidly speed up any endeavor to try to put things right for this generation and all those to come beyond. They say at the current high emission rate, we could hit that 1.5 degrees Celsius cliff that the world has been hoping so hard to avoid by the 2030s. But, it lays out a prescription for so many solutions as the Secretary General calls it, a guide for defusing a climate bomb that is to decarbonize as quickly as possible big energy systems to renewables like sun, and wind and geothermal and nuclear energy as well to triple in some cases increase the transition by six times in wealthy nations like the U.S., at the same time helping developing countries avoid deforestation by supporting indigenous communities, also justly helping coal communities transition economically after the shutdowns that must be needed as well. But if you look at the real politics of what they're calling for a 50 percent reduction by 2030 in oil and gas use around the world and compare that to the fact that there has been no cut in fossil fuel emissions all throughout history. It is a huge ask. President Xi meeting with Putin and Russia just approved over 80 new coal mine projects in China. President Biden in the United States disappointed his climate voters by approving the willow oil project in Alaska, up there as well. And the market signals are that Saudi Aramco and ExxonMobil are some of the richest most profitable companies in the history of the world. So the social license to burn these fossil fuels is still very much in place. These companies and Petro states are not going gently into a decarbonized future. So at least in the near term, it looks like these desperate warnings from science around the world will be ignored a little while longer. Bill Weir, CNN, New York. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Cohen was on standby for several hours Monday afternoon to potentially be brought in as a rebuttal witness, but he left after two hours without being called. Meanwhile, security around the criminal court in Manhattan where Trump, if indicted, would be presented if tightening. NYPD officers installed security cameras on light posts and placed barricades in the streets surrounding the courthouse, all ramping up in anticipation that a decision by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg of whether to seek an indictment of Trump is coming any day now. Back to you. VAUSE: And then there is the ongoing investigation over election interference in the state of Georgia. A source tells CNN prosecutors are considering racketeering and conspiracy charges based on Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election, and the Fulton County District Attorney could decide on charges within the next three months. Attorneys for Trump call the investigation illegal and unconstitutional. They've asked a judge to throw out the evidence and the grand jury report. Joining me now from Los Angeles, civil rights attorney and legal affairs commentator, Areva Martin. Areva, it's good to see you. Let's just start with that effort in Georgia by the Trump team. This is a Hail Mary. Explain what's going on here, because this just seems so out of the ordinary. But grand juries have been, you know, acting this way for 50 years or something, and now suddenly it's unconstitutional? I don't really understand what's going on here.",

And this is a hush money paid by Michael Cohen, allegedly, to, you know, adult film star Stormy Daniels.She said she slept with Trump. She was threatening to go public before 2016, the election then. So there's two parts of this. There is the false record keeping charge, plus the possible campaign funding violation. So remind us of the legal details here. What could facing Donald Trump?",

And to basically catch and kill the quiet Stormy Daniels, this $130,000 payment was paid to her. Now, today, Robert Costello, who used to represent Michael Cohen, came forward at the request, we believe, of Donald Trump to give his version of events, to say that Michael Cohen is not credible, that Michael Cohen told him that it was his idea to pay Stormy Daniels $130,000 and not Donald Trump's. He has accused Michael Cohen of basically lying to the public, lying to the media, and lying to the grand jury. But I don't think the testimony of Robert Costello is going to in any way deter the district attorney in Manhattan from moving forward with an indictment. We know that Michael Cohen was on standby to give rebuttal testimony. He wasn't called to give that rebuttal. He might be called again tomorrow. But my hunch is that this district attorney has all of the evidence he needs to move forward.",

The reality here is there's a check, there's a tape, and it's clear that there was an agreement that Stormy Daniels would be paid this $130,000 from Michael Cohen.

That loss also fueling Monday's protest. Odinga rallying people to turnout. His motorcade greeted by cheering supporters across Nairobi. At times, he addressed the crowd through the sunroof of his car, urging people to protest every week until Ruto resigns, or prices come down.

Odinga says without evidence, the election was stolen and challenged the results. Though his appeals were later rejected by Kenya's Supreme Court. But Odinga still has many loyal followers, especially in areas like Kibera, Nairobi's biggest Islam, where protesters threw rocks at police and lit tires on fire. The unrest closing some businesses for the day, which were already struggling with high prices. Even some people who voted for Ruto reportedly joined the protests, saying he hasn't done enough for Kenya's working class since he took office last September. Ruto has promised to bring down costs, but inflation has remained high, rising above 9 percent in February, causing a growing discontent that could be harnessed by his opponents if conditions do not improve.
