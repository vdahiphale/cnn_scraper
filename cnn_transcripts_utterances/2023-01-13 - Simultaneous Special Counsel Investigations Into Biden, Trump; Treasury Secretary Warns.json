In terms of the special counsel probe of former President Trump, the Justice Department is questioning if he still has any of the classified files on his properties. You'll recall the FBI retrieved more than 300 from Trump's possession after he resisted requests to return those.So to get the latest on both situations, we are joined by CNN Chief White House Correspondent Phil Mattingly and CNN Senior Crime and Justice Reporter, Katelyn Polantz. Phil, did we learn any more from the White House Press Secretary today about the classified docs found at Biden's home and office?",

And to some degree, it aligns with a position that they had had over the course of the week before the special counsel was important appointed as the President's private attorneys were continuing their search for any additional documents. And as a Justice Department review being run by the Attorney General in Chicago was playing out. I think the reality is there are still significant number of questions about how the documents landed where they were, what the actual documents entailed beyond the information that we've actually reported. But this is a very different moment for this White House right now and I think their posture kind of underscores that point and that is a special counsel. And what the special counsel brings to the table in terms of its investigative power, in terms of its investigative authority, puts them in a position where they are not going to discuss something that's currently underway and they're going to be very limited in what they talk about as they enter a moment where they have to set up for a White House or for a special counsel, and what that means for the administration going forward, guys.",

But the Justice Department wants to interview and speak to two people that were hired by Donald Trump's legal team to go and scour for properties of his New Jersey, in Trump Tower in New York and two places in Florida to see if they could find any additional classified documents.So you'll remember last year, the Trump team sent back several boxes of documents a year ago that had classified filings in them. The Justice Department got an envelope from them later. There was that search in August, where they found more than a hundred. And then these two people were hired by the Trump team in November to go and look one more time to try and satisfy the Justice Department. And they found two additional classified documents that were turned over. This is all part of an ongoing criminal investigation. Something that distinguishes it from the Biden situation is that it's not just a criminal investigation with a special counsel. It also is an obstruction of justice situation where federal investigators really want to make sure that they have all of the national security secrets back, all of the records that they want to have in their possession no longer on secured with the former president. And so this latest step, Caitlin Collins and I confirmed, is that they do want to continue the investigation and do some more interviews as looks like that is a possibility going forward.",

I mean, look, there's a very logical investigative path, it's pretty straightforward that the FBI and DOJ have done time and again, that's to - in this case - figure out what the totality of classified information is, make sure you have it all back and then set aside - figuring out what the damage may or may not have occurred in terms of an intelligence context.And then there's the pretty straightforward similar investigative path of how did it get there, who placed it there, what instructions were they giving, what did they do, did they go through it, did they know it was in there, who had access to it. But at the end of the day, you need to sit down with the person who ultimately had ownership of this. In this case, President Biden, and ask them some pretty straightforward questions: What did you know? Did you have any supervisory responsibility over the packing up of this material? Who had access to this, whether it was at the office, whether it was at your residence in Delaware. There are very standard things that he needs to be asked and I really expect that at the end of the day, that he will be asked and that he will sit down and be interviewed by probably a mixture of both agents and attorneys from the Department of Justice.",

CUPP, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:   Well, listen, for all the folks that like to complain, myself included, that the Republican House is made up of a lot of conspiracy theorists and kind of quacks, QAnon folks, et cetera. This is not a conspiracy theory. Joe Biden had classified documents in places he should not have, I'm not comfortable leaping to assumptions that was by any kind of duplicity. But they certainly shouldn't have been there and I think we should all take that pretty seriously.   It sounds like Joe Biden and his team and the White House are and they are complying from everything that we have learned. But we don't have to paint equivalencies between what was going on with Trump's classified documents and Joe Biden's classified documents, but it's not good and it does give Republicans ammo and talking points, real ones this time, not made up ones or trumped up charges that didn't exist.

That is also earlier than had been forecast last year for a few different reasons, including that interest rates are higher, of course, because inflation has persisted for a while longer. And when interest rates are higher, that means the amount that the government has to pay for its debt goes up. You've also had the student debt, pause, repayment pause extended, that costs money. And if, of course, we have a recession this year, that would reduce tax revenues, which could move the date even earlier. So this time bomb is ticking.
