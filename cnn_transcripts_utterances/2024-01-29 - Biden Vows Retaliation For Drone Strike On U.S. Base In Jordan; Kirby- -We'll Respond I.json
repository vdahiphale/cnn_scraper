A region already reeling from war is waiting for President Biden's next move as he promises to retaliate against those responsible for a drone attack that killed three U.S. soldiers in Jordan.Plus, tanking the deal. Donald Trump is pushing Republicans to abandon a bipartisan immigration bill they've been working on for months, he hasn't seen the plan. His goal is simply to deny President Biden an election year win. And man up. That's Nikki Haley's message to the -- all but certain Republican nominee. She's trying to taunt Trump into debating her while planning more than a dozen fundraisers to bring campaign cash in for a needed or long fight. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. We start with a major escalation in the Middle East. Today, President Biden is weighing options for how to respond to this weekend's deadly drone attack on a small U.S. outpost in Jordan. The White House blames Iranian backed militant groups, the regime in Tehran denies any involvement. President Biden is battling to retaliate but to do so in a way that avoids an even wider regional conflict. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

With the goal U.S. officials say of killing American service members. And we are learning that three U.S. army soldiers did -- were killed in this drone attack, more than 30 were wounded, including eight who had to be medically evacuated because their injuries were so serious.Now, we are learning a little bit more this morning about just how this occurred. How this drone managed to make its way into this base and hitting near the living quarters of this facility. We are told that an American drone, which was returning from a mission was approaching the base at around the same time that the enemy drone was approaching. The enemy drone followed the American drone onto the base. And it delayed the U.S. response because there was some confusion over whether that enemy drone was in fact, an enemy rather than an American drone. And so, all of this is contributing to the picture. U.S. officials now have of what happened here. But still, as you said, the U.S. doesn't know which group was responsible exactly for this attack. Now President Biden is under increasing pressure to respond and respond forcefully even presidential candidate Nikki Haley is weighing in on this, saying that the U.S. needs to hit back hard. Here's what she said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIKKI HALEY (R) 2024 GOP PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The very first strike that hit, you punch, and you punch back hard. What they should be doing is going after every ounce of production of those missiles. Wherever those missiles are, you take that out. You keep -- you take up the training sites. (CROSSTALK)",

They're putting up ammunition depots and stuff. They've killed leaders of these groups. So, what do you do? And one potential avenue is massive cyberattacks perhaps that are deniable. But you know if you're not going to attack Iran, what are you going to do? And so, we'll see. But, you know, obviously, what they sought to avoid has happened.

And you know, the issue is that you have to understand that it's not about just one strike. It has to also be -- deterrence isn't about one act, four months, three months after the Soleimani attacked, two U.S. servicemen were killed and a case soldier in a strike inside Iraq.

Giving that person more room to shut down the border, if there's an emergency, or if crossings increase at a level that is really high.

And the question is whether Republicans are going to listen to Donald Trump who wants to preserve chaos at the border because he thinks that it's a winning political issue for him.
