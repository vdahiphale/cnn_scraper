And they then extracted them. And then the airstrikes began just one minute later. Now, these airstrikes were on buildings kind of in the area and all designed to both divert attention to prevent Hamas militants from getting there and also to provide cover. They managed to successfully extract the two hostages. Just one Israeli soldier was mildly injured. They got them out and then took them by helicopter to a medical facility just outside of Tel Aviv. They've already been visited by members of their family, some of whom were previously released in the previous hostage deal with Hamas. And so, they all seem to be reunited now.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, typically, especially in the wake of having had prostate surgery, it means that someone who's unable to empty their bladder, it's something known as urinary retention. It can be really painful and cause a lot of abdominal pain. But it can also cause other symptoms in the body as well. People can actually drop their blood pressure. They can have heart rate abnormalities. This was described as an emergency. So, you know, in addition to the pain, he may have had some of those other things going on there. Also, just again, the timeline of this, just to remind you, it was in early December that he was first diagnosed with prostate cancer. And then December 22nd, when he had the operation, probably scheduled it over the holidays, some people do that. And it sounds like that operation went well. I mean, he was discharged the next day. But it was a couple weeks later, actually January 1st, not even two weeks later, that he was admitted to the hospital for an infection at that point, and a significant hospitalization, two weeks at that point. And now, as you point out, he's back in the hospital again. It's described as a bladder sort of issue here. We don't know specifically what that is. But again, in the context of having had prostate surgery, the possibility that he has developed what is known as retention, urinary retention, that seems to be the most likely culprit here. And that can lead to an emergency. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "Well, Bianca, we know what Donald Trump thinks of NATO. When he was president, he threatened to pull the U.S. out of the alliance. He has also called it obsolete in the past. So, the sentiment is not a -- but just how far he has gone in these comments has taken many by surprise.And it will be listened to very closely by leaders around the world, especially those who remember that alliances were not as sacred to Donald Trump as they are, for example, to the U.S. President Joe Biden. There are many world leaders who will be expecting a certain level of disdain from a future president, Donald Trump, if he were to win the U.S. presidency, because they have seen what he has done in the past. So there is a concern because within NATO, the core nature of NATO Article 5 is that if one member nation is attacked, then it is attack on all and all other member nations come to the defense of that one country. That's really what it hinges upon. And if one country in particular, one as large and powerful as the United States decides that it is not going to step up, if that were to be the case, then there are serious repercussions. We've heard from the NATO Secretary General himself Jens Stoltenberg saying, quote: Any suggestion that allies will not defend each other undermines all of our security, including that of the United States, and puts American and European soldiers at increased risk. We've also heard from the European Council President Charles Michel saying that these comments are reckless, adding they serve only Putin's interest. So, there will be concern about these, these comments that there have been some within the Republican Party that have dismissed them or even agreed with the sentiments of the fact that they want more member nations to pay more within NATO. But when it comes to many of those, those member nations, there will be concerns. What we've seen in recent years is that the U.S. President Joe Biden has managed to sustain a certain level of unity within NATO, in particular, after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. And this is really just a reminder to all of what a potential second U.S. presidency of Donald Trump could entail -- Max, Bianca.",

And we have seen consistent movement forward. In 2014, there were only three members hitting that target. Now there are over 10. There's a long ways to go. But again, you know, if you look at who's spending on defense, the top defense spender in NATO was Poland. It's not the United States. Europeans have stepped up a lot, especially since Russia invaded Ukraine. So, I think the commitment is serious. The direction of travel is correct. I think Europeans know that they need to do more. But there is a question of how do you -- how do you motivate and creating chaos and fear and signaling support in effect to Russia is not a sound way to do it.
