Federal prosecutors are expected to unseal an indictment in the coming hours, and the Securities and Exchange Commission announced it will file its own separate charge.FTX filed for bankruptcy last month. The Bahamas had become its base of operations and Bankman-Fried was living there. He denies he defrauded investors, but the U.S. government appears unconvinced. For more, I'm joined now by Ivan Watson who's tracking the story from Hong Kong where FTX was based for some time.

They say they arrested him upon the request of U.S. authorities and that they anticipate an extradition request will come from the U.S. and they've already telegraphed that they will likely promptly hand him over to U.S. officials.As you pointed out, federal prosecutors, they are -- or have announced that they're probably going to unseal an indictment on Tuesday morning in the U.S. against Bankman-Fried, and that's also been backed up by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission who say that they're conducting their own parallel investigation and may press their own charges as well. A as you pointed out the, 30-year-old former CEO of FTX has kind of denied that he believes that he committed fraud. He has been speaking very publicly since his company essentially collapsed and he was forced to relinquish his role as CEO. Here's a taste of what he said at the beginning of the month at a conference sponsored by the New York Times. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SAM BANKMAN-FRIED, FORMER CEO, FTX:  That's not what I'm focusing on. It's -- there's going to be a time and a place for me to, sort of think about myself and my own future, but I don't think this is it. I mean, look, I've had a bad month. This has not been any funny for me. But that's not what matters here. Like, what matters here is the millions of customers. What matters here is all the stakeholders in FTX. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

A regional leader says missiles and heavy artillery were fired at three communities, but no one was hurt. Meanwhile, there are new indications Russia is struggling with its war efforts. A senior U.S. military official says Russian supplies of new ammunition are, quote, \"rapidly dwindling, and their forces have resorted to using 40-year-old artillery. The official says that's why Russia is reaching out to Iran and North Korea to try to get more weapons. The exiled mayor of Melitopol in Ukraine says Russian forces are panicking and redeploying after Ukrainian strikes on the city over the weekend. There are conflicting casualty counts. Melitopol has been occupied by Russia since early in the invasion, and remains a major logistics hub for the Russian military. Later this hour Ukrainian aid conference -- so Ukrainian aid conference will get underway in Paris. Dozens of allies and institutions will discuss how to help Ukraine survive this winter and how to repair its badly damaged infrastructure. The Ukrainian prime minister arrived for the meetings earlier today, and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is expected to speak via video link. CNN's Jim Bittermann is following this live from Paris.

      "sentences": "Yes, it's just an absolutely tragic story. What we know happened is that on Sunday evening, the Israeli military carried out an arrest raid in Jenin. This is something that has become common, especially this past year. There have been these nearly nightly arrest raids across the occupied West Bank.The Israeli military saying that they are targeting militant strongholds before they say they can carry out attacks. But it seems as though this arrest raid didn't go necessarily as planned because what we're hearing from the 16-year-old's family, her name is, Jana Zakarna. They say that after the raid began and they began to hear very heavy firing, that Jana decided to go up onto her roof to see what was happening, and that it was about 20 minutes after the soldiers left the area that when her family went to go see where she was, they found her on the roof. They said that by that point she was already dead, and they said that she had been shot four times. Now, according to the Israeli military, they say that during the raid that they were fired upon from roofs and from the streets, and that they say that one of their soldiers fired at what he believed was a gunman on a roof nearby to where Jana was standing. And they said that following an initial inquiry, this is from the Israeli military, they determined that the girl who was killed was hit, they say by unintentional fire aimed at armed gunman on a roof in the area from which the force was fired upon. The IDF said that it regrets any harm to uninvolved civilians. We're also hearing from the Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid who says that he expresses sorrow for the girls' death and sent condolences for the family. But he adds that he has complete trust in the soldiers of the IDF and said they do their utmost -- their utmost to prevent harm to bystanders. But Jana's family is not believing these statements. They say that there were no militants in the area. They say the only militants in the area were on the street and not on the roofs, and they say there is no way this is a mistake. They say you can be mistaken with one bullet, but not with four. Now, the Palestine authority, Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh, has also issued a statement calling on the United Nations to investigate this incident, and specifically calling on Israel to be placed on a blacklist.
