And that, of course, is just one of the building, that is the moment, as you can see, when the quake struck and entire building just collapsed into rubble. More than 2,300 people have now been reported dead. The death toll continues to rise, and it has been rising, frankly, exponentially. In this video here, the moment a child was pulled from debris in Northwest Syria. That region, of course, also dealing with the heavy impact of years of a brutal civil war there.",

One rescue there, and so many others feared for now.Also this morning, as the U.S. Navy is working to recover debris from the suspected Chinese surveillance balloon shot down by an U.S. F-22 this weekend, the Pentagon is pushing back against China's threat to reserve the right to use, quote, necessary means to deal what it calls similar situations around China. A DOD spokesman, General Patrick Ryder, told me that the U.S. does not conduct such operations in Chinese airspace. And, by the way, U.S. surveillance flights are going to continue. We are going to have more on that in just a moment. First, though, to those rescue operations underway, as we speak, in both Turkey and Syria, CNN's Jomana Karadsheh is in Istanbul. We see so many videos and pictures of entire buildings collapsed. Of course, you fear for all those who were inside those buildings when that happened. What are we learning about rescue operations and the rising death toll?",

This is one right there, that was at 6This earthquake, the first one, was not really an epicenter earthquake where all the shaking happened under the dot. This was an epi-line. It was a line. It was a fracture of the Earth's crust that was almost 120 miles long. So, this fracture, this breaking of the crust happened along this line in the initial one. And now, all of these other aftershocks are happening here. Well, it is because there are fault lines. Obviously, there are. We have the Arabian and the Anatolian right through here, and even the African plate making almost a triple- point where the initial earthquake happened. Yes, it is cold. We have a cold front coming through. Temperatures in the morning are going to be somewhere around 20. Now, think about this. In this zone, there won't be a single person living in their apartment or their home. They are just not going to go back tonight. There is no way they can, because the earth is going to continue to shake and their homes are already severely damaged. The temperatures in the 20s with snow, and being outside, it is a very tough night for the survivors who are trying to dig through for survivors that are still under these buildings.",

AMJAD RASS, PRESIDENT, SYRIAN-AMERICAN MEDICAL SOCIETY:  Well, in the hospital, they are overwhelmed with the number of casualties and the number of injured that impact (ph) our emergency rooms. And the shortage of staff and now we're seeing shortage of the supplies and medication with all of these patients need, basically the same treatment with head injuries and fractured bones. This area has been a shelter for many of the displaced. Half of the 4 million who live in the area, 2 million, have been displaced at least once. Some of them have been displaced three times. Close to a million still living in temporary shelters, like tents, makeshift arrangements, and now they are displaced out of their homes.

      "sentences": "Yes. Look, Erica, the administration is saying that this was a very deliberate method of action here, that they essentially briefed the president on Wednesday about the fact that this balloon was hovering over Montana for an extended period of time, something that was very unusual given the flight path of past balloons like this.And so what happened was the president said, okay, shoot it down right now, but the military advised him not to do that because of the risk that the debris could pose to civilians on the ground as well as infrastructure. And not only that but we are told that the officials also told the president that the best way to potentially preserve the payload of this balloon, essentially the equipment underneath the balloon that is used, according to the U.S., for that surveillance would be to shoot it down over water. Because, of course, it would not be shattering over land and it will be able to be recovered by the Navy vessels, for example, and divers. So, that really why the president decided to wait until Saturday when it was projected to be over the Atlantic to have this balloon shot down, guys. SCIUTTO:  Well, we should also note that the U.S. has jamming capabilities, which U.S. officials say they did use while that Chinese balloon was over the U.S. Natasha Bertrand at the Pentagon, thanks so much. Right now, there are hard questions about what China could in retaliation for the U.S. taking down their balloon, the Chinese foreign ministry over the weekend reserving the right to act similarly. We should note, the U.S. flies both and crewed and unscrewed surveillance aircraft Chinese airspace. This include the unmanned Global Hawk aircraft. It's remotely operated. It can fly at high altitudes, you see a picture there. Also the P-8 Poseidon, that aircraft is crewed. It's armed with weapons, such as missiles and torpedoes. I had a chance to fly on board one of those during a mission, this over the South China Sea, in 2015, when the Chinese Navy angrily confronted that aircraft. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It's good to have both of you with us this morning.When we look at how this is playing out, I found it interesting, Susan, that one of the things that David Sanger pointed out in The New York Times that this entire incident really speaks volumes about just how little communication there is between Washington and Beijing. And he also said that it was revealing that once this was spotted, Chinese officials did not reach out to try to come to some sort of understanding or a deal. Do you read anything into that?",

It's -- we have so little understanding of the decision- making process inside China, which, of course, makes it much more dangerous for everyone.And the United States made major efforts to communicate with the Chinese side at every level. And they were -- basically, the Chinese either didn't answer the phone or said that they needed more time. And, of course, we didn't have a lot of time. So, having those lines of communication during a crisis is very important, as I tell myself even back in the Clinton administration with the accidental bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade.",

And I think whether this was China's plan or not, China now has a real test case for how Americans could react both socially and politically to future intrusions into U.S. space. Will the military shoot it down right away? How will Republicans message against the president? And if they do, who will Americans perceive as the enemy or the problem, China or the opposing political party? And because the U.S. Media is not centered, China can see all of this happening in real-time, in polling, on Instagram, on cable T.V. And so, yes, there is an intel -- like a military intel-gathering operation but there is a also major political and social intelligence gathering operation happening right now.",
