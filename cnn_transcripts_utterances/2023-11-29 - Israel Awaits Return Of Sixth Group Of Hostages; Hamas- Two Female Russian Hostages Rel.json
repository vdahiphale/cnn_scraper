And we continue with our breaking news out of Israel tonight.We`re waiting for confirmation as to whether a sixth group of hostages has been freed by Hamas. The Red Cross convoy was recently spotted at the Rafah Crossing. And sources say Hamas has given Israel the names of the hostages set to be released. Now, the IDF says two Russian hostages have now entered Israel. You see the video there. Hamas said the Kremlin helped negotiate the release of Yelena Trupanov and Irena Tati. Now, right across Israel, of course, those kinds of reunions were bittersweet news amid uncertainty about the youngest hostage held in Gaza. Hamas claims that ten-month-old Kfir Bibas was killed in an Israeli airstrike. Hamas says his mother and four-year-old brother were also killed. The Bibas family released a statement. And I`m quoting now, \"Our family has learned of Hamas` latest claims. We are waiting for the information to be confirmed and hopefully refuted from military officials. We thank the people of Israel for their warm support, but kindly request privacy during this difficult time.\" And they go on to thank everyone for their thoughts. Ben Wedeman has been following all of this in Jerusalem for us. Ben, and again, we do have fast breaking developments and all punctuated by so much suffering and loss as witnessed there by that family. What more are we learning about the hostages to be released here, the timing, and if both sides held to their bargains?",

We still haven`t seen the 10 Israeli captives held byHamas in Gaza that are the core of this deal between -- mediated by Qatar between Hamas and Israel. What we have seen, as you said, is -- are these two women, elderly woman and her adult daughter, Russian-Israeli dual citizens who have been released. Hamas put out a video, which showed a fairly raucous sendoff by a crowd as Hamas fighters took these two women from their vehicle and they were escorted to a Red Cross vehicle. That was in Khan Younis, according to eyewitnesses. And those two individuals are now in Israeli custody. This was a deal worked out by President Vladimir Putin of Russia, completely independent of that other deal. So the 10 that are expected to be handed over, including, according to sources, one American, have not arrived in Israel yet. And as a result, the 30 Palestinian detainees and prisoners are still waiting to be freed themselves to have some happy moments with their loved ones and relatives -- Paula.",

That young boy, Kfir Bibas, just 10 months old, nine months when he was taken into captivity by Hamas on October the7th, has really become a symbol in so many ways for Israel. And so many Israelis really feel connected to him and to his family. Sadly, today, Hamas claims that Shiri Bibas, the mother, along with her two children, Kfir, 10 months old, and Ariel who is four years old, claiming that they were killed in an Israeli airstrike in Gaza. They did not offer any evidence to back up that claim. The Israeli military, for its part, says that it is still assessing that claim and trying to verify the veracity of it. They were -- they did inform the family -- the relatives of the Bibas family who are held captive in Gaza of Hamas` claim. In a statement from the family, they say that they have learned of those claims and that they are, quote, \"waiting for the information to be confirmed and hopefully refuted by Israeli military officials.\" What we also don`t know is the status and the fate of the father of that family, Yarden Bibas, who is also believed to have been taken captive on October 7th. There is no information either from Hamas or from Israeli officials about his whereabouts or his condition, but very sad news if, indeed, it is to be confirmed. But, of course, we do need to be mindful that Hamas has been known to use kind of psychological tactics in the past with regards to claims like this. We know that another militant group, Palestinian Islamic Jihad claims that one of those Israeli women captives had actually been killed, but she was actually released by Hamas earlier this week. So again, important to take these claims with a grain of salt but, of course, very sad if indeed true.",

If Hamas, in the coming hours delivers another list of 10 hostages who they are -- hostages` names, I should say. That they are willing to release tomorrow then the pause will be extended into a seventh day. The same thing if they presented a list tomorrow into an eighth day. There is a belief that Hamas has at least 20 more women and children they can release, which would extend this temporary pause in the fighting for at least two more days to bring to a total of eight days. After that, that is where things start to get a little bit more complicated. Does Hamas have more women and children they can release? Do they start to release some of those civilian men you talked about? The CIA director, when he was in Doha yesterday, wanted to start the discussion about those groups of hostages beyond the women and children.

When you look at the extraordinary level of devastation in Gaza, particularly in northern Gaza, where Israel has been carrying out strikes both from the air and also from land and sea. And you look at the extraordinary civilian death toll, what we understand from the Biden administration is they say they have been communicating very clearly to the Israelis that they do not want to see that level of destruction. They do not want to see that level of aggression because of the impact on the civilian  population, should they start their operations back up again, which we believe would be mainly focused on southern Gaza. Now Paula, remember, the Israelis told northern Gazans to move to the south. Now you have almost 2 million displaced Gazans mainly in the south. So where do those people go?

Here is what I`m going to compare this to. What you are talking about over the last seven days or so, since this pause has been in effect, the military operations of both the Israeli Defense Forces and Hamas has not stopped. We have focused our attention on the hostage release and the humanitarian aid and what the different players want from this. But I guarantee you, from a military perspective, the IDF is planning their next set of operations. Where will those operations go? Alex gave a little bit of an indicator when he talked about the south. I`m not sure that is exactly correct. There are four major cities in the Gaza Strip -- Gaza City itself, Deir al-Balah, Khan Younis and Rafah. Under each one of those cities, you have those extensive tunnel complexes. Some are bigger than others. So while the IDF has been gathering intelligence, some of it from the movement of Hamas, some of it from actually questioning the hostages that have come back, they have probably gotten a better indication of what is going on underground in that subterranean area. Hamas, on the other hand, is doing the same thing. They are maneuvering as well. But all of their maneuvers, for the most, part is underground. Where are they going? Well, they are going to the places that could cause some of the uproar again if they were struck by Israeli forces. We are talking about Deir al- Balah, Khan Younis, specifically, where more tunnel complexes are. And you can bet that Hamas, as part of their operations -- and this has been from the very first day the war -- has been planning their defensive based on what they anticipate getting from international reaction to the IDF campaign. Then you have the U.S. We want the hostages released. We want to try to get aid in. We want to stop a humanitarian disaster. Those three areas are all competing.

There is reporting from the Hamas ministry, the Palestinian ministry of health,, which is run by Hamas, and they are giving numbers again to stoke the outrage on the world stage. We do not know if those numbers are correct or not. Truthfully, in some of these operations, the difference between Mosul or Fallujah or Sadr City, that was all above ground. There was not this subterranean fight that Hamas has made their specialty. And you cannot get to the location of the location of the Hamas forces without going through the buildings and the residences on top of those subterranean tunnels and shafts. So that is what makes this so difficult and so very different and you cannot compare it at all to any of the operations in Iraq because this is much harder. There were not these kind of underground fights in a different level of operation as Israel is facing.

But everyone should understand also what misum japaki (ph) said. We have a monument of humanity, the Parthenon. And it is being divided. This a disgrace for our civilization. The Parthenon is a symbol of the classical civilization. All the Western values of democracy, of human rights, of philosophy, of poetry were born in ancient Athens at the time the Parthenon was built. And all of us have the responsibility to work, to unify this unique monument. This is what we say to our British friends. We do not want to quarrel with anybody.
