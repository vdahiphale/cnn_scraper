We will much more on what we're expecting to learn from that release in just a moment.We do begin this hour with the latest on that mass shooting, one of several in the last couple of weeks, at Michigan State University. CNN Correspondent Adrienne Broaddus is in Lansing, Michigan. Adrienne, press conference is about to start. What do we expect to learn from investigators?",

      "sentences": "It is expected to start any minute now. Just moments ago, Jim, I heard from a university spokesperson, Dan Olsen, and he said that we will learn today, this morning, updates on the students who were physically injured. At last check, we told you they were in critical condition, and at least four of them we know underwent surgery. So, we will learn more about their progress.Olsen says we will also have what he calls, quote, high level updates from members of the law enforcement. And a lot of folks that we heard from at the vigil last night told us they want to know why, why did this happen, why did the shooter purchase the gun, why was he targeting MSU, if, as members of law enforcement officials have told us, that 43-year-old shooter had no ties to the university. So, again, we will hear high-level updates from members of the law enforcement. And also we will learn about the next steps at the university. I spoke with professors who have taught on this campus for years and those professor that I heard from say they are supposed to return to class on Monday, but members of their staff are concerned, they're still concerned about the students, and wondering how do they walk back into the classroom on Monday after what happened here today. So, part of that update will be outlining what is next for Michigan State University as well as talking about the different counseling services that will be provided. Meanwhile, we have been sharing with you and our viewers throughout the morning about this note, investigators say, they obtained from that 43-year-old shooter. Our very own John Miller spoke with a law enforcement official who is close to the investigation who says this note was two pages. And the 43-year-old started the note with an introduction, saying his name was Anthony McRae. He also goes on to say, I will be shooting up MSU and he says another team will finish this city of Lansing. But that is not all. There are also targets in that note. So, it is unclear if the members of law enforcement that we will hear from at any moment will talk about these targets. We do know one target was a warehouse, the other, an employment agency, a discount store and a church. As you can imagine, all of this is difficult for the folks who are still coping with what happened here Monday night. Alumni who returned to the campus for homecoming, some saying, myself included, never thought they would be back on campus to cover a mass shooting. Jim and Erica?",

      "sentences": "Well, I mean, we're waiting to see -- we will be getting their introduction, the grand jury's conclusion, as well as this section where the special grand jury had concerns that there were witnesses who were appearing before them who may have lied during their testimony. So, again, we're really looking for the tenor of the grand jury in all of this.What we're not going to get, which I know everyone is very eager to see, is whether the special grand jury recommended that anyone should face criminal charges. The judge was pretty clear that he felt that it was premature to release this information. He did not want names being dropped in the early release of this report, because people have not officially been charged. So, they have some ability to defend themselves. He did not think it was fair to put that all out there. Again, all of this stems back to an investigation that started in 2021 when former President Trump called Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and pressed Raffensperger to just find the votes needed for Trump to win the state of Georgia, which he, of course, lots. This is a panel that heard from 75 witnesses over the course of their special grand jury investigation, people like Rudy Giuliani, people like former Trump attorney -- or current Trump attorney Boris Epshteyn, people like South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, as well as Georgia Governor Brian Kemp. So, there's a lot they had to dig through. We're only going to get a sliver of that today, and a lot of it we are still going to be waiting for as the district attorney there decides whether she is going to bring indictments against anyone.",
