Jake Tapper is on assignment today.And we start today with breaking news, five fired Memphis police officers have not been charged with murder in the death of 29 year old Tyre Nichols. The Shelby County district attorney announced the charges this afternoon, which include second degree murder, aggravated kidnapping and aggravated assault. Police say officers pulled Nichols over on January 7th and, after a confrontation, Nichols ran away. When officers caught up to Nichols, police say there was another conversation before he was taken into custody. Nichols then complained of shortness of breath, was taken to the hospital and then died three days later. The district attorney said today there was a quote elapsed period of time in getting medical help for Nichols when he was injured during the traffic stop. Now, video of the incident is expected to be released tomorrow night. Attorneys for Nichols' family who saw the video Monday described it as a heinous police beating. And the Memphis police chief called it inhumane. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The planning in this, not releasing the videotape ahead of the police chief and ahead of the charges, they wanted to get the charges out of the way, but they wanted to speak to the family and that they wanted to release the videotape.Now, there is some concern, quite honestly, about releasing that videotape after 6:00 on a Friday night. Some believe that it may escalate the violence, because it is a Friday night and people aren't working or what have you. But there, others when I just spoke to, the president of the NAACP here. It actually gives people the time to absorb. And they believe the circumstances on this are different. Honestly, there isn't the element, they believe, speaking for the community members are saying, the element of race. All the officers are Black. The victim is Black. The police chief is Black. The community is Black. But the one constant that we have here is that the officers involved are blue. No matter the ethnicity of the officers. Obviously, this was misconduct, according to the district attorney, and to the police chief herself, saying that this is heinous. Her words. So, releasing the videotape was surprising to some on a Friday night. They weren't sure when they are going to really, say I got information earlier that it was going to be tomorrow, turns out that was indeed the case. Initially, Pamela, I thought it would probably be around noon. To give people midday chance to digest, it get off work about their business. But after 6:00 on a Friday, night tomorrow night, it's one that videotape is expected to be released. Three different angles. One from a sky cam or pull cam, that's according to our John Miller.

So, we know that Tyre Nichols was pulled over on the evening of January 7th at around 8The statement went on to say that as officers approached the driver of the vehicle, a confrontation occurred. And Nichols ran. Officers, they say, then pursued Nichols, attempted to take the suspect into custody, they were into the statement. All the time to take the suspected to custody, another confrontation occurred. They say ultimately the suspect, Nichols, was apprehended. The second confrontation is what it's been characterized by Nichols family as this savage and violent beating. The statement went on to say that, afterward, the suspect complained of having shortness of breath. I wish time an ambulance was called. The suspect, Nichols, was transported to Saint Francis Hospital in critical condition. The statement concluded by saying, due to the suspect's condition, the district attorney generals office was contacted and it was determined that the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation would handle this investigation. Now, we did reach out to the Memphis Police Department a try to get our hands on the police report, the incident report. They declined to give that to, as a citing an active investigation. But earlier this afternoon, we did speak to a family friend of one of the officers involved, and Emmitt Martin III. We spoke to his longtime family friend Bennie Cobb, who's a retired Shelby County sheriff captain. And Cobb said that Martin showed up in the days after the incident with Nichols, appearing nervous about his future with the police department and remorseful.

I think that's important to note, because we've seen too many of these cases where it's a routine traffic stop, a nonviolent encounter with police that should not end in the death of a civilian like Mr. Nichols.",
