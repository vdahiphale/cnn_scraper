(END VIDEO CLIP) PHILLIP (on camera): Good evening, I'm Abby Phillip in New York. Let's get right to what America is talking about. Tonight, families fear and the fragile politics of guns. The country's attention today turned to Winder, Georgia, where four souls there are now gone, two students, two teachers, after a 14-year-old high school student shot them, gunned them down. Those students were caught in the chaos and the simple act of going to school forced them to live through the terror of those uncertain minutes where everyone inside Apalachee High School was unsure if they were going to be next. Listen here to Isabel Rosales on the scene of the shooting retelling what one student told her, a child who's reckoning now with her own mortality. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I actually went to Chardon after the mass shooting there. I was at Maryville hole shock (ph) in Washington State. And I looked into the eyes of those kids. And my op-ed started with never again, again. That was back in 2018. But it really should be never again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again.It's time for the adults in this conversation to take this seriously. 77 percent of the people in this country believe that we need to have stricter gun laws. Why don't we start doing that? And number two, I'm sorry. We just found this out right before it came on the air. A year before this happened, that 14-year-old, as a 13-year-old, had the FBI knock on their door and ask their family and ask him if he was talking about something like this. And the father said well, you know, I do have guns in the house, but he can't have access to him. Really? Well now it's time to start holding the people who have for children like this. Let's start holding these parents more accountable. Let's start locking those parents up for 15, 20 years, then we're going to start seeing at least responsibility in the gun ownership world.",

And all of us are one second away from getting a phone call that we never want to get. And so it's amazing that a very small sliver of the country that holds the Second Amendment orthodoxy that is so different than where everybody else is holding the rest of us in a position where we can't do anything to fix a problem that is really just a uniquely American problem. And it's amazing that we haven't been able to figure this out.

And, you know, the week before we had sort of, you know, parents come in and scope out the school, talk to the teachers. You know, the very first thing I looked at was the security. She's pre- three. Yes, she's pre-three. But that's the very first thing we look at. And, you know, I agree, you know, with Montel. You know, something has to change.
