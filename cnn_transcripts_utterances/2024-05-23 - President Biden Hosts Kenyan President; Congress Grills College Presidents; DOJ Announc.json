It would set up an antitrust fight that could reshape the multibillion-dollar live music industry.And President Biden sitting down with Kenya's president, William Ruto, with China's expanding role in Africa looming over the state visit. Also right now, Congress is grilling the presidents of three major universities. This is the first hearing since a wave of protests erupted at campuses across America. And a short time from now, officials in Louisville will update their investigation into Scottie Scheffler's arrest. They're expected to release new video of the incident last week involving the world's number one golfer. Hello. I'm Wolf Blitzer in Washington, and you're in the CNN NEWSROOM.",

      "sentences": "Any minute now, the U.S. Department of Justice unveils a groundbreaking antitrust lawsuit against Live Nation. That's the parent company of Ticketmaster.The suit alleges Live Nation abused its industry dominance for years to stifle competition and to harm concertgoers. This was on full display, apparently, back in 2022, when a Ticketmaster glitch blocked millions of fans from buying tickets to Taylor Swift's Eras Tour. That incident led lawmakers to demand answers from company executives last year at a congressional hearing. It also fueled the Biden administration's so-called war on junk fees. Trial and defense attorney Misty Marris is joining us right now. Misty, how big of a deal is this antitrust lawsuit against Live Nation?",

      "sentences": "This is absolutely huge, Wolf, because this could change the way that these types of ticket platforms actually function.And one of the biggest things that could result from this lawsuit is actually breaking up the Ticketmaster and Live Nation companies. So, the government can actually make a determination ultimately that this is too large of a monopoly and that this business actually has to be broken up into smaller pieces in order to avoid that unfair lack of competition that essentially dominates the marketplace.",

      "sentences": "Wolf, so it's really important to understand the history of how we got here.So, the merger between Live Nation and Ticketmaster was approved back during the Obama administration in 2010. And one of the primary tenets was, this will be approved, but there cannot be retaliation against any venues, any platforms, any other basically business entities involved in the music business because of the strength of this company. So it was very, very focused on this anti-retaliation element. Back in 2019, the DOJ brought a lawsuit saying that Ticketmaster, Live Nation, had actually violated that. So they entered into what's called a consent decree. And some of these tenets were again set forth in that decree. Well, is there anything Taylor Swift can't do, right Wolf? So now, in 2022, there's a laser focus on what happened during this absolute debacle with the Taylor Swift tickets. But, keep in mind, Live Nation had already been under the microscope for their failures during that 2019 lawsuit. So, based on that history, the government comes in with a position of strength, because this is not just something that's been created out of the ether. This is the result of a two-year investigation since 2022, but it's actually the result of a pattern of conduct since 2019. So this is not something very isolated. This is looking back from a significant period of time and then bringing this lawsuit in conjunction with 30 states.",

      "sentences": "It signals that the Biden administration is taking a look at these large companies and doing that assessment and really, really focusing on whether or not there have been violations of antitrust.So, yes, we have seen Apple, we have seen Google, we have seen Amazon. But this administration is not going to let these issues lie. To the extent that there is a potential violation of the longstanding antitrust rules that are in effect, it signals that the DOJ is not leery to actually take action, whether it be another what's called, as we spoke about before, consent decree, which sets forth changes that needs to be made to a company in order to remain in its current form. So, Live Nation and Ticketmaster, they stay together. This was the result in 2019, but they have certain parameters that they have to fulfill in order to remain that way, but also the potential to break up these companies. It seems like the DOJ is really looking at this from that trustbuster perspective. If there is a violation, they're not leery to take action.",

This, by the way, is the same congressional panel that blasted the heads of Harvard, Penn and MIT for failing to condemn antisemitism as harassment and bullying.

Now, some of the toughest questions have been reserved for Michael Schill. He's the president of Northwestern. Listen to this exchange between the president of Northwestern and Republican Elise Stefanik. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP.

The Northwestern president, he also faced tough questions over that agreement that the school made with the pro-Palestinian protesters to end their encampment. Then we had the UCLA chancellor. He also faced a lot of tough questions over their handling of the encampment there. During his opening remarks, the chancellor of UCLA, he acknowledged that, with the benefit of hindsight, they should have been ready to move faster to end that encampment, because what ultimately happened there is, by the time police were ready to move in, we saw counterprotesters and violence on the campus of UCLA. At the end of the day, these university presidents, they are in a very difficult spot, because they are facing a lot of pressure from Republicans and donors who feel that they have tolerated antisemitism on campus, which is something that the presidents, of course, deny. But they're also facing pressure from students and faculty who feel these universities are silencing protesters and their freedom of speech. So we're going to continue to monitor this to see what other interesting segments come out of this as lawmakers really grill these college presidents -- Wolf.",

And they also acknowledge that they're going to talk about a broad range of issues. That includes elevating Kenya from a regional partner to a global one, the importance of democracy, as well as private sector investments. But there is no doubt, Wolf, as you mentioned, that a lot of this also has to do with countering China's influence in Africa. Of course, the U.S. and China have been jockeying for economic and geopolitical influence in that region, and China, of course, providing those high- interest loans to Africa. So, investment is important and that economic cooperation in these ongoing talks. They will also be announcing a spate of commitments, including, for example, a document known as the Nairobi-Washington visit to call on creditors to help ease the financial burden. Then, two, the president is going to designate Kenya as a major non- NATO ally, so a lot more to hear from this visit. And we will also see the two of them again later this afternoon for a press conference, where we will hear directly, but, of course, all of this, again, to shore up that partnership between these two countries, and particularly for President Biden, who in 2022 said that he was all in on Africa -- Wolf.",
