But tell us more about what the Trump campaign, how they have been reacting? They immediately started fundraising off of these attacks that Walz is a liberal. ALAYNA TREENE, CNN REPORTERRemember, when the Biden campaign or President Joe Biden ended his campaign, I should say, and Harris quickly became the torchbearer and it became clear to them that she was going to be the Democratic presumptive nominee, they had struggled and they still are struggling with how to best define Harris. They have a bunch of attacks that they have pulled on, but they're still trying to figure out which ones are the ones that are most effective, particularly with more of the moderate and independent leaning conservative voters. Now they see Walz and her selection of him as an opportunity to try to define them together. And that's what you saw them do yesterday. Now, part of this is they really want to focus, I'm told, on his last four years. He's been a governor in Minnesota since 2019, but they think the last four years will be the most effective in messaging against him. Part of that is because Walz was in Congress for 12 years. While in Congress, he actually was considered more of a moderate Democrat. He voted with Republicans on trying to strengthen the border. He pushed for lowering the national deficit by trillions of dollars. He also had the backing of the NRI, although they later pulled that support when he was governor. Now, as governor, Walz was a lot more progressive and they're trying to focus on a couple of specific bills. One is that he enshrined abortion rights into law in Minnesota. He protected the rights of gender affirming care, and he also expanded universal gun checks or gun background checks in the state. So, those are the things they're trying to seize on in their attempt to paint him as even more liberal than both Kamala Harris as well as Joe Biden. Now, I do want you to take a listen because one interesting thing that I heard a lot from Donald Trump's senior advisers yesterday was that they were very happy Harris did not select Shapiro. Trump addressed that on Fox &amp; Friends this morning. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) FORMER UNITED STATES PRESIDENT AND PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: But when he didn't pick Shapiro and I don't think Shapiro was the second-best person or the third. I think there were other people better than him. I know the all. And so, but I was shocked when it came in to the final two that he didn't pick Shapiro. I was very surprised. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

U.S. Futures pointing to a positive open on Wall Street in the next hour. This follows solid gains in Asia. Investigators taking heart from the Bank of Japan's deputy governor, who says the central bank won't raise rates while markets are unstable. CNN's Julia Chatterley joining us now live from New York with more. I know that you've got -- you are a bit cautious about what's going on. But first off, what's behind this big turnaround we're seeing? JULIA CHATTERLEY, CNN HOST OF \"FIRST MOVE\": A couple of things, after a big down day like we have on Monday, you tend to see bounces. So it's not unexpected to see big gains. And what we're seeing already pre-market is that, and of course, we saw those gains yesterday. It's not often that U.S. investors really follow and take a hint from what's happening across in Asia. And I think what you said is critical here, a lot of the shakedown that we saw on Monday was those fears of the Japanese Central Bank raising interest rates. A lot of people had borrowed in Japan and invested abroad, including in the U.S. and as they start raising interest rates, that money then was sucked out. When the bank of Japan goes, whoa, OK, we are not like king the volatility that we're seeing and we're not going to do anything for a while, that calmed things over in Asia. In fact, it took stocks in Japan from negative to positive, and it's fed through I think into the U.S. session.",

The big three themes here, U.S. growth. We need more data to ascertain how significant the slowdown is in the economy. Tech stocks too, they've been the big support for financial markets this year. I can show you if you've got it, what happened with the big magnificent seven, the AI winners. Yesterday, they we're gaining for most of the U.S. session; they fell actually into the close. We need stability there. And then of course, we continue to watch Japan. So in an absence of stability on all these fronts, and that's just going to take time, and perhaps I'll say less geopolitical risk and perhaps the U.S. election result, I think things could be choppy for a while.

It comes as Tehran mulls its response to the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh last week. Meanwhile, Hamas has named Haniyeh's replacement, Yahya Sinwar, the alleged mastermind mind of the October 7th attack on Israel. He will take over as the new head of the group's political bureau. All of this, as Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, vows his group will also retaliate to avenge the killing of the group's top commander, also a week ago. But he says keeping Israelis waiting for a response is \"part of the punishment.\"CNN's Chief International Correspondent, Clarissa Ward is in Tel Aviv with the very latest. Hi, Clarissa. So, if we can first start with Hamas naming the alleged mastermind of the October 7th attacks as the new head of its political bureau, what message does that send? And what do we know about him?",

      "sentences": "Well, I think this actually caught people a little bit by surprise because while it was understood, Amara, that Yahya Sinwar was absolutely kind of pulling the strings behind the scenes. Traditionally, Hamas' political leader has not been on the ground in Gaza. And in the case of Ismail Haniyeh, within the context of Hamas, he was seen as a relatively moderate force. A lot of people expected that he might have been succeeded by Khaled Mashal. [08So, by saying that Sinwar is taking over that role, it's definitely sending a message and the message is to some analysts, at least, listen, if you're going to assassinate the moderate than you're going to have to deal with the hardliner. What this does effectively is it really dims hopes for those ceasefire talks that the Biden Administration and so many other diplomats in the region have been seriously trying to push ahead in light of this imminent expected retaliation from Iran. That seems less likely with the appointment of Sinwar, he is a hardliner. He has pushed to prolong this conflict. He has pushed to broaden the conflict regionally. He has very close ties to Iran. But at the same time, it is important to remember that he was always effectively calling the shots from behind the scenes. And so now, this is just basically getting rid of the idea that there is any real separation between Hamas' military face and its political face. Everybody here in Israel responding, as you might expect, to the news of Sinwar, basically saying -- the IDF spokesperson, for example, saying that Sinwar is designated to be under the ground by Israeli Defense Forces, and that's the only place we're interested in seeing him. But certainly, this is not doing anything to alleviate the tensions that we're seeing, to alleviate the anxiety. There has been this furious, last-ditch round of diplomacy. You mentioned, of course, the OIC foreign ministers gathering in Jeddah in Saudi Arabia, trying whatever ways they can to essentially persuade Tehran not to engage in some kind of a retaliatory attack. But given the rhetoric that we've seen from Tehran, Amara, given what we heard from Nasrallah again yesterday, the leader of Hezbollah saying, as you mentioned, it will come, the waiting is part of the punishment. They understand full well, Hezbollah, that the weighting has a very corrosive effect on Israel, both psychologically and also financially, economically. The effect that it's had on the airport, with all these various airlines either canceling or suspending flights in and out of Tel Aviv. So, there is a sense that perhaps they want to try to milk this moment and of course, the Biden Administration and others are trying to take advantage of that and furiously kickstart this diplomacy to stop a retaliation before it happens, Amara.",

Let's talk more about all this with CNN Military Analyst, Colonel Cedric Leighton. Colonel, what is your take on Yahya Sinwar being named the head of Hamas' new political bureau, in terms of the message that his appointment sends.COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: I think -- Amara, good morning. I think Clarissa hit it right on the head, this is one of those situations where, now, everybody has to deal with the hardliner directly and that is I think going to be very difficult to go through the diplomatic process at this point in time, when everyone in Hamas, in Iran, in Hezbollah, in all of these organizations, and Iran (ph) in the form of the country, they are looking at conducting military action of one type or another. So, we're on a very dangerous path at this particular point in time in spite of diplomatic efforts to try to move this in a more diplomatic or less confrontational direction. I think the appointment of Yahya Sinwar really shows the fusion of the military and the political efforts, that fusion has always been there, but now it's actually demonstrated in the form of this appointment.",

I think what we're most likely to see is some kind of massive rocket, drone, missile attack against Israel, probably from several sides. So the Iranians, like they did in April, they will probably send missiles and rockets from their territory crossing over Iraq and Syria, possibly Jordan, into Israel. That's one route that they will take. And if they do a coordinated attack, there would be a lot of rocket fire from the Hezbollah forces, which are stationed in southern Lebanon.So, this is going to be at least some kind of a two-front, possibly a three-front effort against Israel. That's the most likely course of action. Another possible course of action is that Iran could opt for more discreet attacks and then engage in other realms like the cyber realm, and in the terrorism realm against Israeli targets. But that doesn't get as much bang for the buck, so to speak, as a rocket attack would in their view.",

And we're told by a U.S. official that the FBI believes that Donald Trump and several other former and current U.S. officials were the intended targets of this murder-for- hire plot. Merchant, a Pakistani national, as you said, did spend time in Iran, has family in Iran, according to prosecutors and according to his court documents that were unsealed yesterday.Merchant came to the U.S. and contacted someone in New York who he believed could help him carry out these assassinations. Unfortunately, for Merchant, that person turned around and told the FBI what he was planning and became a confidential human source for the FBI. Eventually, that led to Merchant's arrest last month. Now, look, this is separate from -- we should note, separate from the assassination attempt on Donald Trump's life in Butler, Pennsylvania, the shooting of course, that happened at his rally. The FBI believes the timing between these -- of these two things is a coincidence. But at the same time, we do also know that intel related to this Iranian threat was passed along to the U.S. Secret Service who ramped up security around Donald Trump in response. So of course, that contributed to questions about the security protocols around the former president after the assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania.",
