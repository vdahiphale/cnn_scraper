      "sentences": "Today on Inside Politics, as Bon Jovi might say, whoa, we're halfway there. It's been 38 days since Donald Trump became President-elect Trump, and 38 days from now, President-elect Trump will be President Trump. With the latest on the transition, including how wild Pete Hegseth spare to confirmation is looking a bit smoother. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. may be getting a well bit rock here.Plus, Donald Trump says, he may pardon January 6 rioters within minutes of taking office. We have new CNN reporting on whether that will include the hundreds of defendants accused of assaulting police officers that day. And he may be the most powerful figure in Trump world that you have never heard of. We tell you about the 38-year-old conservative in charge of hiring thousands of Trump loyalists to staff the federal government. I'm Manu Raju in for Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. President Trump is back in Mar-a-Lago today after a quick trip to New York to ring the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange. Tomorrow, he'll be in Maryland for the army, navy football game. And in five weeks, he'll be on the steps of the Capitol being sworn into office as the nation's 47 president. Now, inauguration -- it's a celebration of American democracy. And this year, Trump is hoping for a more global event. CNN's Kristen Holmes joins me now from West Palm Beach, Florida. So, Kristen, what are you hearing about these plans?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Manu. Isn't unsurprising that Donald Trump wants a more global event and that he and his team are essentially reaching out directly to these foreign leaders. This is a little bit unprecedented. It's not how it usually works. Foreign leaders don't generally attend the inauguration.But we are told that Donald Trump has had these informal conversations where he's asking foreign leaders to come to the inauguration. Among them, probably the most notable is China's Xi Jinping. We are told that he is likely not to come. He's going to send a delegation instead. But also, the prime minister of Italy, the presidents of Argentina, and El Salvador, all of these people have received some sort of outreach, whether it be from the president himself directly or from his team with an invitation to come down here. Again, unclear who is going to come. Well, we are told that a lot of these conversations are happening kind of in passing, that Donald Trump might be on the phone with one of these world leaders, and mention at the end, why don't you come to the inauguration? Or when he was in France at Notre Dame, the reopening there that he was having conversations with these leaders, and it might have come up there as well. In fact, some of these conversations are so informal that even as close as aides weren't sure who Donald Trump had invited to the inauguration. And just to give you a little bit of an idea of how it usually goes, again, foreign leaders don't generally attend. Instead, this bipartisan committee that plans the inauguration. They reach out to diplomats with the state department, and that's who ends up coming. But Donald Trump, he wants it to be more of a global affair. He, of course, wants the fan fair. None of that is surprising, knowing the former president now president-elect, but we'll wait and see how this actually plays out. Since, again, much of this is unprecedented.",

He put out a post on Truth Social last week about Pete Hegseth, and then the controversies that he's facing.But he has been very quiet. He has been pretty out of sight. He has the army, navy game tomorrow. But really, we have not gotten much of a sense of what he's really doing outside of just spending time at Mar- a-Lago and meeting with people and making phone calls. ZOLAN KANNO-YOUNGS, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: It's contained thus far in Mar-a-Lago, you talk to reporters that are out in West Palm Beach, there's, they're not seeing that much. There's not, you know, a lot to be done because of the lack of movement. It's basically the president- elect surrounded by, you know, these advisers that he have, ranging from an Elon Musk to some of the people that were around the first time around. And I think what's extraordinary is, you know, within Mar-a-Lago, just how ad hoc some of these calls are that they're making, both the vetting but also calls to foreign leaders.

As you can see him on your screen. Would you vote to confirm Pete Hegseth, as the question asked to voters. 31 percent say yes, 40 percent say no. Still a sizable amount, though. 29 percent of the public just have not heard of him or don't know who he is. Lauren, you up on the Hill everyday with me talking to members.

The interview happened late last month about grocery prices. Trump, of course, on the campaign trail, said time and time again that he would get grocery prices down.Well, he kind of is acknowledging reality here in this interview, saying, I don't think so. When asked about bringing down prices in groceries, and if there's presidency would be a failure. He was unable to do that. He said, look, they got them up. I'd like to bring them down. It's hard to bring things down once they're up. You know, it's very hard. But I think they will. That is categorical as we heard on the campaign trail, tempering of expectations. KANNO-YOUNGS: I think this is going to be the thing to watch, you know, especially as we go into the first year. The aspirations and sort of the rhetoric of the campaign, colliding with the reality of actually governing. You're starting to see comments that are start, that are hedging those expectations. When you have somebody that goes out and makes these, you know, sprawling broad promises, you're also raising the expectations of your base, of your voters, right? And people have expectations. And you see that comment hedging on grocery prices. There was another comment as well this weekend when it came to tariffs, and whether or not that actually goes on to pass to consumers. And also, you know, I follow these immigration policies too. Where are you going to get the resources for mass deportations? Where will you actually build mass detention facilities? Some -- and you said you would hire 10,000 border patrol agents from where? You know, there's recruiting issues there. I think that this is going to be a theme. You know, when you take these big campaign promises, the high expectations that he has set, and now the realities of actually going down.",

Because when you have someone like Tarrio, the chairman -- former chairman of the Proud Boys.He wasn't even in Washington that day. He was not directly involved in the violence, but he was urging his followers to be violent. He was convicted of seditious conspiracy. He's in jail for decades. What do you do with someone like him? Is he what you mean by non-violent or violent? How are you assessing these cases? Now Tarrio has not formally asked for a pardon. His lawyer has suggested that he will. But look, it's really complicated. When you say you are going to pardon people who were non-violent related to something like this. That's why we wanted to do this reporting and figure out the process. We realize that there really isn't a process. At this point, it's unclear how they're going to do this. It's only clear that they're going to do this quickly and in sort of a broad manner. And when you push back on that, Manu, a name that keeps coming up is that of Hunter Biden. I'm told by multiple sources that they believe that the president's pardon of his son. Remember, the pardon of Hunter Biden was for over a decade of potential conduct. They say that that really helps support if they want to do some sort of broad, sweeping general pardon here. So, that's why we're watching this so closely to see exactly how Trump handles this. But at this point, the one thing we know is, whatever they want to do, they want to do it quickly. It's just unclear exactly what they're going to do.",
