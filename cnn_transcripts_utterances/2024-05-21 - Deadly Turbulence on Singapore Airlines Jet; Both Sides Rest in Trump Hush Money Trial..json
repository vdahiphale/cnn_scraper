And, soon, the judge and attorneys for both sides are expected to go back to go over jury instructions in this historic criminal hush money trial of the former president. Earlier today, jurors were dismissed for the week, the judge telling them to be ready for closing arguments next Tuesday. It comes after the defense's second and final witness, attorney Robert Costello, took the stand for a second day. And, once again, the former adviser to Michael Cohen faced some tough cross-examination.",

And Costello wrote to Cohen -- quote -- \"I am sure you saw the news that Rudy is joining the Trump legal team. I told you my relationship with Rudy, which could be very, very useful for you.\" Costello denied that he was pushing Cohen to retain him because he could provide a back channel to Trump.

We will move on. That elicited some laughs in the courtroom. And I saw some smiles across the faces of some of the jurors. But, for the most part, throughout this trial, now in its sixth week, this jury has been poker-faced. They haven't revealed much about what they have thought of the testimony, and the judge telling them today that they are going home for a week and that they come back next Tuesday for closing arguments. He warned them that that could go all day. It's possible it could even go into Wednesday. But he said he would expect them to work on Wednesday. This trial is normally not sat on Wednesdays. So he would hope that they would work, and then they could begin deliberations in this historic case -- guys.",

So these words, these instructions are going to be very important. And the judge has asked the parties, both the prosecutors and Trump's team, for the past several days and weeks to come together to try to come up with some language they can agree on. And so today is going to be hammering out those areas where they still do not have agreement on some of this language. Key elements here, this is a case where Trump is charged with falsifying business records to commit or conceal another crime. And the issue here is, what are those other crimes and what will the jury be told about them? The judge said the other day that he wanted to keep this as simple as possible. He didn't think they needed to overcomplicate it. And he asked the parties to come together and give submissions to him. He got them this morning. He thanked them for it. And we're going to get into the nitty-gritty of that this afternoon before -- and this will be the makeup of what the judge charges the jury with just before they leave the room to begin deliberations next week.",

Third of all, they contradicted Bob Costello with his own e-mails. I found him to be not at all a credible witness. And thinking back to all of the witnesses in this case, I think the total number was 22 different witnesses. I really think, in my view, at least -- interested maybe what other people think -- I only think there was two witnesses that I -- that I found with substantial credibility issues, Costello, as I just said, and, of course, Michael Cohen. Whether one fully believes him or not, the guy has serious credibility issues. Maybe Stormy Daniels, but I didn't find anything too outrageous about what she said. But I think the jury is going to be focused on really Michael Cohen, above -- above and beyond all else, because, let's be real, Bob Costello was a terrible way to end this. You leave a bad taste in the jury's mouth. But Michael Cohen's testimony is a hundred times more important to this case than Bob Costello's testimony. The guy -- I won't even rehash it. We know. He lied to everyone. He made a bunch of money off this. It turns out he stole from the Trump Org. So the question is, can they live with it? Can they live with it, based on the other evidence?",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KITTIPONG KITTIKACHORN, DIRECTOR, SUVARNABHUMI AIRPORT (through translator):  The plane landed at the airport, and the medical team was sent to the scene.

When you're in your seat, please, by all means, buckle up. The individuals who are seated, just sitting there watching a movie and who weren't buckled in were making an assumption that they were on their couch in their living room. And you are, after all, five or six miles above the planet in a (AUDIO GAP) metal tube approaching the speed of sound. You have to respect the technology and physics of where you are and at least buckle your seat belt. Other than that, try to watch out for those signs when the pilot puts on that \"Buckle your seat belt\" sign. Do your best not to get up and -- but, sometimes, nature calls, especially on a 12-hour flight. Statistically -- you got to go when you got to go, there's no question.

Any time an aircraft like this goes through what we call severe turbulence, which clearly this was, they need to make sure there hasn't been significant fatigue to the structure. It's possible the aircraft will be a total loss in this case, if it was enough stress on it. Marching forward, I think the industry has to push for technological solutions, better forecasting, better ways of identifying this. It should be noted that there is a climate change component to this. Scientists have been looking at this issue of clear air turbulence over the past decade or so, and the numbers of incidences of severe turbulence over the North Atlantic are up 55 percent. And this has something to do with the jet stream flows changing, causing more wind shear, which is what causes that turbulence. So it's a difficult thing to predict for, but I think more study needs to be done, clearly.",
