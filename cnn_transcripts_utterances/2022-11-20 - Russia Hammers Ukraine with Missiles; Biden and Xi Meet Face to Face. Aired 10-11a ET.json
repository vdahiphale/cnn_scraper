I'm Fareed Zakaria coming to you from New York.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ZAKARIA (voice-over): Today on the program, a Russian made missile lands in Poland and Biden and Xi meet for three hours. I explore what we learned from NATO's would-be crisis, and what we can glean from talks between the world's two most powerful leaders, with Richard Haass and Tim Naftali. Also, is China ready to seize Taiwan? That is the question the reporter Dexter Filkins sought to answer in a new story for \"The New Yorker.\" What did he learn from his trip to the embattled island? And it's now been more than two months since Mahsa Amini died after being arrested by Iran's morality police. What do we need to know about Iran's Gen Z, the young people leading the protest? I'll talk to Atlantic Council's Holly Dagres. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And the reason they were scared was they were looking for some lack of resolve on the part of John F. Kennedy and they didn't see it.And when John F. Kennedy imposed a blockade and stuck by it, Khrushchev realized, I don't want war. I've got to find an offramp. So what I was trying to share was don't look to history to give you a reason to go to Putin and give him an offramp. If anything, it's the opposite. Don't give Putin a sense that you want to end this because he's been looking for that. He's desperate for straws. Force him to want an offramp the way that John F.

That is the backdrop.I'm really skeptical that we can have a cooperative relationship. China has had decades to rein in North Korea. I have seen zero evidence. You know, remember that old line, the French (INAUDIBLE) about Germany. We like Germany so much we're glad there are two of them? That's what China feels about Korea.

Taiwan shouldn't declare independence and China shouldn't invade.But the problem is, the thing that might change the status quo is what you report in your piece, which is younger people in Taiwan are increasingly very fiercely independent minded. I don't know if that means they would vote for independence, but they are absolutely clear they have nothing to do with China, they have no connection, they're a separate country. The party that represents them, the DPP, seems to be most likely to win again. You know, the -- it feels like in other words what is changing and what China must be noticing is that every day Taiwan becomes more pro independence, even if not formally, but de facto. FILKINS: Exactly. I mean, that's the problem in a nutshell. China is watching this and they see Taiwan drifting away. It's generational. So it's -- I mean, the young people are just like, China? Like, forget it. You know, we've got a democracy here. Like, the economy is booming. It's super sophisticated. We don't have anything to do with those guys. China sees that. They see what's happening, and the DPP, the party -- the ruling party is giving voice to that.

Since 35 percent of the world's Web sites are censored in Iran so they use circumvention tools like VPNs. And it really -- social media is the only way for Iranians to have their voices heard. So what's interesting is when Mahsa Amini was brutally murdered, she was actually a hash tag, her name, the pictures of her at an ICU and later her family embracing each other post mortem, went viral in Iran and it was actually that anger online that poured into the streets.And so a lot of these videos and images coming out of the country they -- Iranians want their voices to be heard. They want human rights organizations to document what's happening. They want the media to pay attention. Because they don't have any other way of connecting to the world. And so, this is exactly why social media is so integral right now to the people of Iran.",

I remember the Arab Spring, they were also leaderless, but that doesn't mean that because a moment is leaderless that it's meaningless. I think that protesters don't need our skepticism, they need our support. And right now, the point of why protesters are in the street is because they don't want an Islamic republic. And, yes, it is a David and Goliath moment, but I think that the more attention is given to what's happening in Iran, especially the plight of the protesters, the more that it helps their cause.",
