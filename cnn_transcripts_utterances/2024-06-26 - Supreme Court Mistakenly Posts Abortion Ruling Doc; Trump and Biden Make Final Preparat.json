      "sentences": "A very warm welcome to the show everyone, I am Isa Soares. Tonight, breaking news from Washington. Amistake by America's top port tips its hand regarding one of the most contentious issues in America. Then a look at how this could impact final preparations, of course, as well as strategizing ahead of tomorrow's debate between U.S. President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump right here on CNN. But we begin of course with that breaking news from the U.S. Supreme Court on abortion, something that's divided voters as you all know for half a century. Now, according to \"Bloomberg\", the high court is poised to allow abortions to be performed in the case of medical emergencies in Idaho, the opinion was apparently inadvertently posted briefly on the court's website. And to be clear here, this is a draft of an opinion and not yet a ruling. In response, the high court referred to the opinion as a document. Let's get more now from our justice correspondent Jessica Schneider who joins us from Washington. So, Jessica, just explain to -- here, what are you learning about what happened here?",

      "sentences": "This is really a stunning error made by the Supreme Court's staff here. And at this point, theSupreme Court is in fact admitting this was an error. They just released a statement, they said that the court's publications unit inadvertently and briefly uploaded a document to the court's website. They don't allude to affirming that this was in fact the opinion for this abortion case. Instead, saying, we will be issuing the opinion in due course. So, maybe, tomorrow or Friday. But it appears that somebody in that core publication unit inadvertently put up the opinion related to abortion when they weren't supposed to, when the court wasn't officially ready to release this opinion. But somehow, reporters -- you know, when these opinions come out, we're all sitting on the Supreme Court's website refreshing it. And when an opinion comes out, it pops up on the website. And these reporters at \"Bloomberg\" law, they must have seen it, inadvertently posted, somehow none of us saw it or at least, you know, nobody else in news organizations that we know of saw it. So, this was posted, and what it tells us is that the Supreme Court will essentially be side-stepping this Idaho abortion law issue, Isa, and by side-stepping it, it means that the Idaho abortion law that severely restricts abortion and doesn't allow for any exception in the emergency room when a woman faces severe injury, that law will no longer be able to stand in that context. So, in the short term, this is a win for abortion rights advocates in Idaho, because doctors in Idaho now in the emergency room will now be justified in performing abortions if need be to help out women who are facing severe injury when the Idaho law said that they couldn't. But I will note, as part of this opinion that \"Bloomberg\" reporters saw, even though this was a 6-3 decision, and the liberals signed on board Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson of the liberal wing. She did sort of warn in an opinion that we will see eventually -- just saying that this isn't really a win. She said this is not a victory for pregnant patients in Idaho because what it does is, it just lets the litigation and the lawsuit continue in this case while putting a pause on Idaho's law, but it doesn't definitively settle the issue, so, you know, we could still see Idaho's law prevail, but for now, Idaho's law is being put on hold while this continues to move through the courts, or at least that's what we're seeing from the opinion that is still yet to be released. But as at least been previewed by what -- by what \"Bloomberg\" law saw.",

DAVID WEINSTEIN, ATTORNEY &amp; FORMER U.S. FEDERAL PROSECUTOR:  This is not the first time we've had this type of error. I mean, the last error we saw there was a leak related to another opinion. There was an investigation, this time it seemed like more of a technical glitch where somebody pushed the wrong button and they published momentarily an opinion that was to be issued perhaps tomorrow, perhaps on Friday. So, not quite as much investigating is going to go on as it did with the last one. But the opinions out there, and so, it appears that we all know which way they're leaning.",

Speak to the impact of this decision, of this ruling? BRITTANY FONTENO, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, NATIONAL ABORTION FEDERATION:  The impact of this ruling would be quite significant. It would provide a momentary sigh of relief for abortion providers, patients and advocates across the country, it would show that state bans that are extreme, and that are anti-abortion do not actually trump federal protections. However, I think it's really important that we don't lose sight of this. And that is that, this case should have never found its way up to the Supreme Court. Supreme Court justices and politicians should not have any say in emergency medical care. That is a conversation that is best left between patients and providers.",

It's almost as if you see the wheels turning in his head as he decides whether he's going to go off teleprompter and speak extemporaneously. There will be no audience in that room, and it's almost as if they've stepped on his oxygen hose, because he won't be able to feed on the crowd.

And similarly, relative to Israel, relative to the situation in Gaza. I believe that a President Trump would be lockstep with Prime Minister Netanyahu and probably give him whatever he wants.

What can we expect in this debate and explain more importantly, how both men are preparing. JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF U.S. NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, look, I mean, this debate is certainly the biggest moment yet in this presidential campaign. And perhaps, one of the most monumental events in the entire campaign. It has been four years since Joe Biden and Donald Trump have been in the same room, but alone on the debate stage together. The stakes are incredibly high for both of them, for President Biden, he is running a bit behind in most battleground polls and national polls as well. But more importantly, just in the minds of some of the very people who supported him four years ago. So, he is trying to show through much practice really over the last week or so at Camp David that he is up for the task, not only for debating Donald Trump, but up for the task of serving a second term and winning election before that. But look, he is trying to draw a sharp contrast and kind of shake Democrats if you will, to look perhaps more carefully at the contrast between the Biden administration and the Trump administration. Talking to one official, they said he's trying to remind American voters what Donald Trump was like, not to define him necessarily, just to remind them. Now, for the Trump side, they are trying to make this all about Biden's record, about the record on inflation, on immigration and his record abroad as well. So, certainly, many differences between the two, but perhaps the most important thing of all, just how do both of these men look? The oldest presidential candidates in the history of the office, 81 for President Biden, 78 for Donald Trump. How do they perform? How do they stand up literally on stage?",

And this would allow emergency abortions to continue in Idaho. The document was not the final ruling by the court. Now, turn our attention to Kenya. I concede, those words coming from Kenya's president, William Ruto, a day after deadly as well as chaotic protests engulfed the capital.

They feel just a little too late. What President Ruto said is that he had paid attention and listened to the young people who wanted even more concessions. President Ruto, in this finance bill, tried to raise an extra $2.6 billion to plug government revenues and pull Kenya from the brink of debt distress. After public outcry, they reduced that target, made some concessions, and it was now $1.6 billion. But people still said, no, we cannot afford any more taxes. The cost of living is high enough as it is. And that's where things stand. So, now, finally, after this chaotic scene on Tuesday, where people were protesting outside parliament, police using live ammunition to protect MPs who are passing the finance bill, the people outside were telling them not to pass, President Ruto said he cannot sign it because that's not what the people want. He said six people died in protests on Tuesday, but other human rights bodies say the number is actually four times higher. Twenty-three people at least died and they're still looking through mortuaries and other people that remain unaccounted for.
