(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JONATHAN DEKEL-CHEN, FATHER OF ISRAELI-AMERICAN HOSTAGE: But clearly over the course of the last three weeks, since President-elect Trump came out with a very strong statement with a deadline of January 20th, his inauguration, clearly all of the sides and the intermediaries, Egypt, Qatar, Hamas and Israel have put into motion a negotiation process that had been stalled for months until that statement.

Eight days of talks after three months of almost no talks. So, definitely his statement made a difference.The problem is that I think what President Trump is going to find out pretty soon when he's in the Oval Office, if there is no deal, he'll find out that he's been played by all parties, by the Israelis, by the - by Hamas, obviously, and by the Qatari and Egyptian mediators, because I think that all parties made every effort to be on their best behavior after his statement. The problem is that none of them really moved on. The core issues of this negotiation. And, you know, there's one bottom line, that, you know, we've been through this for a year now, and the bottom line is that at least, in my assessment, there is no deal to be made without the out - the outcome. After the three stages of this deal, after implementing these three stages of this deal, the outcome needs to be the end of the war. If the outcome is not the end of the war, I don't see how Hamas agrees to this deal. And the result will just be that you have no deal. The hostages are still in the tunnels. And every day more and more of them die of, you know, the very difficult and bad conditions that they're being held in. And if you want to get the hostages out, unfortunately, the only way to go is to end the war. And until people don't understand that, we'll just be in this ongoing loop.",
