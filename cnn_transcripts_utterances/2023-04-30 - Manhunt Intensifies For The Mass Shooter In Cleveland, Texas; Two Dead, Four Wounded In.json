He has been the focus of a desperate manhunt since Friday night.That's when neighbors asked him to stop firing his rifle in his front yard because they were trying to get a baby to go to sleep. Police say Oropesa entered their home and began shooting. An 8-year-old boy was among the five neighbors slaughtered almost execution-style in the words of the sheriff.

They believe that he has.But so far, those communications and those connections have not led investigators to his whereabouts.

They have been under pressure to help U.S. citizens. We have been hearing from the relatives of some who are dual citizens in Sudan, who are trying to evacuate. SO, this has been something that the White House has been having to answer to. They are under pressure to get these U.S. citizens out of Sudan.

Joining us now to talk about this is CNN's Matt Egan. Matt, you know, this is a -- these are some tense moments. What do you think?

You know, in the past, U.S. officials, they've tried to come up with solutions during crises before Asian markets open, and that's happening next hour, certainly before U.S. markets open tomorrow morning. Now, the best-case scenario here would be a white knight emerges, a big bank comes to the rescue of First Republic Bank.A more concerning development would be that the FDIC seizes First Republic and ends up having to own and control this bank for a certain amount of time. Now, this bank, First Republic, it's been teetering really for weeks. The stock price is down by 97 percent since early March. On March 1, it was trading at $122 apiece. Now it's below $4. It's really a breathtaking drop. Now, in case you're not familiar with First Republic, this bank is sitting on $233 billion in assets. That means if it were seized by the FDIC, it would be the second biggest bank failure in American history. Now, it's based in San Francisco, has 82 branches across eight states and really for the longest time, it was the envy of the banking industry because it caters to wealthy clients. But two-thirds of its deposits are uninsured as of the end of last year, and that is a problem because of the Silicon Valley Bank collapse of last month made uninsured depositors, those above $250,000, very nervous. First Republic said that it lost 41 percent of its deposits during the first quarter alone. That equates to a loss of $72 billion in deposits, and that's despite the $30 billion injection from big banks that came up with this lifeline. Now, Jim, the question is whether or not big banks are going to step up with another rescue here for First Republic.",

So as long as you don't have more than $250,000, that money is being insured by the FDIC. I think the bigger question here is what this means for the broader economy, right, because credit is really the lifeblood of the economy. It makes the whole economy run.And the more nervous bankers get, the less likely they are to extend credit to all of us, right? So, that could mean more expensive mortgages, more expensive credit cards, harder to get car loans and small business loans. And obviously that has an economic impact. So, U.S. officials, for the last seven weeks, they've been scrambling to try to prevent a full-blown credit crunch because that is something that would really slow the economy or, Jim, could even cause a recession.",
