I ask its Minister of Strategic Industries what he needs to turn the tide on the battlefield. Then Journalist and director Mstyslav Chernov takes us back to one of Putin's first and most brutal assaults on Ukraine, with his eyewitness documentary, \"20 Days in Mariupol.\" Next, music for the masses, by the masses, my conversation with the award- winning prodigy, Jacob Collier, on voice layering and cathedrals of sound. Plus, the state of America's higher education. Journalist Michael Powell joins Michelle Martin to discuss cuts to public universities and long-term consequences. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. America's, up until now, unwavering support for Ukraine is hanging in the balance as Senate Republicans block a move to pass an aid package, bundled with support for Israel and Taiwan, they've tied the bill to major border security measures. The White House warns funds for Ukraine's defense could run out soon, and with global attention on the Middle East, Kyiv is struggling to plead its case. David Cameron, the former British Prime minister turned Foreign Secretary, is in Washington trying to stress the importance of backing Ukraine for both American and European security.

So, that's how we get fast solution for air defense already now in Ukraine. And this framework of projects is developing. And I'm happy that we got fast solutions. Meanwhile, we keep working on long-term solutions that will feed Ukraine, the defense industry, and U.S. defense industry strategies in years. Because again, building defense industry takes years.

Harmony is what happens when different forces, different energies come together and create like a sort of synergy between themselves.

I mean, you've pointed out that he made deepcuts to the math department, but there's a shortage of math teachers in the state, as there is really in most places around the country. So, that's one thing. But then also in educational administration. I mean, education is another thing that the state really needs. But the other thing that you pointed out is this little quirky program in puppetry, which -- that you, you know, took pains to highlight and you said that they've had 100 percent postgraduate employment going back for years and that some of these -- the graduates go on to work at, you know, major companies like entertainment and Disney and all these other sorts of places. So, one of the sources of skepticism that I detected from your piece is that you thought, well, Gee, if you really want to match sort of the need with the educational experience that would seem to be -- some of that would be counterintuitive. Presumably you put that question to President Gee. What did he say?",

We're trying to aim at, for instance, meeting the needs of West Virginia. Fine. I mean, it's an economically, you know, kind of storm-tossed state. It needs help. But again, so you're -- you want to increase your engineering program that he wants to, wants to put money into that. He wants to -- he's putting big money into a neuroscience center. But at the same time, he's cutting his math graduate program. You know, and there's an interplay between those. And if you're a top neuroscience student, and there's a lot of competition, you know, from schools that are in, you know, major cities and that sort of thing, it seems to me paradoxical that you would cut programs that are, if you will, kind of cousin or adjacent programs.

And thatwhen all of these other state universities are having problems, West Virginia University after he will have left, because he's going to leave in the next year or two, he says, will be positioned to survive in a very kind of practical and utilitarian way. Maybe the problem is, I mean, when I looked at the University of Kentucky, when I looked at the University of Arkansas, places with pretty similar demographic profiles to that of West Virginia, their enrollment is soaring. I mean, they're adding classes. They're adding professors. So, if nothing else, I guess he's made a petri dish of West Virginia University, in that we're going to see if -- you know, if this works. You know, I think in the short run, I think it leaves students with some hollowed out programs.",

And you are seeing -- I don't want to make it entirely about West Virginia. I mean, you have University -- State University of New York, Potsdam in far northern New York that's made some, you know, very, very deep cuts and programs, cut out all sorts of what would have been thought of as essential majors. You've seen this in North Dakota. You've seen it in Missouri. So, you have a real challenge there. And you also have a challenge, I think, in getting -- as alluded to you, you have a challenge in getting parents and citizens of the of these states to understand the value of a college education. And I guess that's what I'm struck by -- one of the things I'm struck by in West Virginia is that from the president, to the governor, to the head of the legislatures, to the provost, everyone's just sort of taking it -- you know, the starting point is -- we've lost the confidence of people. We're not going to get that. Enrollment's going to decline. And therefore, we need to kind of manage decline. We need to manage decline with a few sharp programs there.
