We have a team watching this right now. And what is happening here, what is at stake here is that this is the case against the five leaders of the Proud Boys, people that the Justice Department have accused of not just wanting to have a war against the U.S. government after the 2020 election, after Donald Trump's loss. But then going to the Capitol on January 6th, revving up the crowd and being what the Justice Department says was the tip of the spear of the crowd of Trump supporters that broke into the Capitol. The defense team have tried to distance these men, these five men on trial from Donald Trump, even though the former president during his candidacy told the Proud Boys \"Stand back and stand by,\" at a public debate. But the defense has said there was no plan, there was no conspiracy and we are waiting right now to see exactly what the jury has decided after seven days of deliberation.",

My guess -- and we'll find this out in a few minutes -- is that they probably reached a verdict on some of the counts and might have hung on some of the other counts.And when you have jurors hanging on counts, that means they could not come to a unanimous agreement on those charges and the jury is considered a hung jury. If that's the case, the Justice Department can choose to bring those charges again down the road. That's a decision the attorney general and his advisers would have to make. So my guess, they were able to find unanimity in some cases. But as you said, it's complicated, both with the number of charges and the number of people and their relative different level of conduct. We'll just have to see where they landed on all of this.",

That's the big signal. I think the extension of that question is, what happens to groups like the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys? Do they survive this? Do they go away? Do they gain strength from people who want to be part of this resistance? The Proud Boys has an interesting history is that it was started as a joke by Gavin McInnes as kind of a satire of male chauvinism and patriotism and then got away from him when they started actually having fights with Antifa groups. A number of Proud Boys were arrested when I was in the NYPD intelligence bureau for attacking Antifa protesters outside a Republican club. They were convicted and faced jail time. That was when Gavin McInnes distanced himself from the group, when the group found new leadership that took it from being a satire to being kind of an alt-right fight club, the white version. And, you know, in Washington, just days before January 6th, in a December rally, they ended up in a fight with suspected Antifa people on the street. Enrique Tarrio was arrested for possession of a knife and magazines containing ammunition, which is why he wasn't there on January 6th. He was in a hotel room in Baltimore. So you've seen this group morph but also grow into an national organization. Canada has listed it as a terrorist group.",

In closing arguments I think it was Enrique Tarrio's attorney, called, said Tarrio was a scapegoat for Trump and those in power. And that's what DOJ was trying to do. That turn in all of this, when it comes to the defense teams and how they tried to turn this and say, no, this really was on Donald Trump and all of these people are scapegoats because of it is an interesting twist.",

And they actually have reached a verdict on many of the counts, maybe just one or two they have not reached a verdict on. We're still waiting because they're still reading.But all five Proud Boys who are on trial, who have been on trial for several months, have been found guilty by this jury on various charges. There are some charges where some of the leaders have been found not guilty specifically related to assaulting officers. But all five men, there have been convictions that are being secured by the Justice Department. Right now, first and foremost, seditious conspiracy, four of these men:  Enrique Tarrio, the leader of the Proud Boys; Zachary Rehl, Joseph Biggs, Ethan Nordean  -- all four of those men are found guilty of seditious conspiracy, a plot potentially to overthrow the government on January 6th after the 2020 election. And I was just looking back at what we have learned from this trial. And one of the things -- I wanted to read one of the things that the prosecutor had argued to the jury and the jury clearly agreed with, after listening to all of this evidence, seeing video, seeing audio, seeing text messages between these men. This was an issue where the Capitol was the focus from the start, the prosecutor said. They were there to threaten and, if necessary, use force to stop the certification of the election. And when Capitol Police officers were testifying and when their audio recordings were playing in court, when they were calling for backup on the Capitol, as the Proud Boys and others were entering into the Capitol, breaking windows, herding (ph) barriers of the police, prosecutors say that those radio calls are the sound of a 200-year tradition of the peaceful transfer of power being shattered. So really a substantial verdict for the Justice Department and quite a historic moment in bringing to justice men who took part and were interested in the violence on January 6th.",

And that's going to have an impact for questions of, who's going to want to be in the leadership of the Proud Boys if they are going to continue down this path? On the other hand, what we've seen in these groups as they morph and grow is national leadership can be largely irrelevant. We've seen Proud Boy chapters independently spawning in cities across the country. We have seen on our own broadcasts, as we've covered the controversy around drag queen story hours, Proud Boys showing up in full military uniform with AR-15 rifles, loaded magazines in states where open carry is allowed and lining the other side of the street, where a library is, where children are coming for these stories.

So the jury looked at that and said, if you are leading this organization from wherever part of the country you came from, you planned this. You plotted this and you are guilty of seditious conspiracy. The only person interestingly that didn't get seditious conspiracy conviction, Dominic Pezzola, the person who used the officer's shield to smash through the window.

It is incredibly common for juries to say, look, we've tried, we've deliberated, we've talked about these charges but we simply can't come to a point of unanimity on one or two or three of them. It happens, I hesitate to say in every trial I ever did. But it happens quite frequently, right?The view of the court is, no, it is the obligation of the judge to ensure that the jurors get as close as they can to unanimity on every count. Now you can't force them to do that. But often, when jurors think they're not unanimous, they can actually get there if they negotiate or debate more. So typically you'll see them come back two or three or however many times, saying they can't come to an agreement. And then usually it's after a few times of saying, look, we've  got one or two holdouts in here. We simply can't come to an agreement. It's then and only then the judge will declare a mistrial on those counts and just let the other verdicts that they came to move forward.",

But he did on camera say, I don't think that our members should have gone into the Capitol. And he said that he did not plan this.

That appears to be what the judge is asking the jury to go back and see if they can reach a verdict on, along with a couple of other charges they've reached no verdict on.That one is interesting because it has been untested. There have been some appeals courts -- one of the appeals courts has ruled that it is a valid charge and it is something they've upheld. Again, something that I think Justice Department officials were a little bit wary of and weren't sure whether the courts were going to uphold that. What happened, what was happening at the Capitol that day was an official proceeding. And, you know, so far, again, the courts have upheld it. But there are some more legal challenges that we expect to come from that charge. And that's an important one, because, again, many of the people who went into the Capitol, where 1,000 people have been charged now, they've been charged with this charge. And it's one of the things that prosecutors have really relied on, to try to -- again, to try to make people who went into the building -- -- some of them who carried out violence, for them to pay a price for what happened on January 6th. So It is going to be interesting to see, again, in the coming months, when we see additional challenges of this charge, whether it holds up. For now, the courts have ruled that it is OK for people to be charged with this for what they did on January 6th. And for now, for today's verdict, it appears that the jury has not been able to reach a verdict on Dominic Pezzola, who is one of the prominent faces you see in some of those videos that have been shown from January 6th.",

But the Justice Department has secured major convictions for all five members of the Proud Boys, leaders of the Proud Boys, and people who were leading the charge at the Capitol on January 6th. Those men are Enrique Tarrio, the chairman of the Proud Boys; ZacharyRehl, Joseph Biggs and Dominic Pezzola, a man who is seen in many images, breaking into the Capitol with a police riot shield in a window, climbing in there at what prosecutors say was the tip of the spear at the U.S. Capitol. Leading the rioters around the back of the building to get inside. That really caused things to unravel that day for police that were trying to protect the building. And this prosecution and this conviction is so important because it is not just about what happened on January 6th; it is about the planning that the prosecutors are able to argue here and how they have been able to prove to the jury that these men wanted something like this to happen on January 6th. That the Proud Boys were coming together as a team and they wanted to create something similar to a war on the grounds of the U.S. Capitol on January 6th. The prosecution has not yet gotten some sort of result on just a couple things. But those are relatively minor compared to the seditious conspiracy charge, where the jury has decided that these men are guilty. There's just a few things where Dominic Pezzola, that man with the riot shield, there's not a verdict for him on a couple of counts. There was also the issue of a throwing of a water bottle and a charge to that, that someone else in the crowd threw a water bottle, the jury has not reached a verdict on that. But that is really relatively minor, compared to what the jury has found today. And this is monumental for the Justice Department, especially because they were able to secure convictions for several of the Oath Keepers related to seditious conspiracy charges, too. Now the Oath Keepers, the Proud Boys, those two groups that were at the Capitol on January 6th and were interested in coming together, planning, that they had suited up, that they were communicating to one another, juries are bringing them to justice in this federal court in D.C.",
