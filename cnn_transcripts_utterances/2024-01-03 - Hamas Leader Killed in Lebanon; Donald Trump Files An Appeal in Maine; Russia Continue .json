I think they are first targeting Israel, they announced that the targeting of Hamas leader is one of the missions of the Israeli operations, Israeli war in Gaza.

Yahya Sinwar, the head of the Hamas leader in Gaza Strip who claimed the terror attack in Israel on October 7th.And Yahya Sinwar is hiding in one of the tunnels, huge tunnels that Hamas built in Gaza Strip. It's the most important for Israel to caught him to eliminate him. And even to declare this is a kind of ending the war in Gaza. Because I think that Israel from the beginning, Prime Minister Netanyahu announced and promised Israel to eliminate Hamas movement. I think after a three months war in Gaza strip, I think the Israeli government, the Israeli leadership, even the IDF leader can understand that eliminate Hamas totally elimination, it's impossible. But the way to hurt Hamas, it's by hunting the leaders. And I can give one example for 2004 during the second intifada, Israel assassinated two leaders of Hamas, the most important leaders in Hamas, the sheikh Ahmed Yassin who founded the movement, and his inheritance successor is Abdel Aziz al-Rantisi in three weeks, during three weeks in March and April 2004. And this was the end of the second intifada. Hamas leader, the political group, Khaled Meshal offered Israel an understanding. So will stop the terror attacks, sending the terrorists and bombing themselves, suicide bombing in Israel. And you, Israel, stopped the assassination. And it was a deal.

The death toll stands at five, just a measure of how bleak this new year has been. Not the Kyiv military administration has just said one more person has died in hospital as a result of injuries sustained on December 29th, which Ukraine says was the biggest aerial bombardment of a city since the beginning of the war. So that fallout is ongoing. Meanwhile, this has been actually an exchange of aerial attacks, Ukraine also being accused by Russia of continuing its aerial assault across the border in the Belgorod region. Some dozen missiles, Russia says that it shot down this morning after a number of attacks on Tuesday. Where the governor of Belgorod said one person was killed by shrapnel and 11 others injured, three of which are still in hospital. So that region is feeling the pressure as well. But Ukraine has not claimed responsibility for that. But Ukraine is also making it clear that it is not powerless against this Russian assault. Despite the hesitation the (Inaudible) that we see in Congress over more aid, it did manage to shoot down the majority of missiles that were fired at them on Tuesday. Among them, 10 out of 10, it says Kinzhal, these are missiles that Russia calls hypersonic, they're some of the most vaunted elements of the Russian arsenal. And I think a measure of that is that General Zaluzhnyi, the head of the armed forces, came out and spoke to CNN exactly about that element. Let's take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VALERII ZALUZHNYI, COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF, ARMED FORCES OF UKRAINE (through translator): Today, the air force of Ukraine has shot down 10 of 10 Russian X47M2 Kinzhal air defense missiles using Patriot surface to air missiles.

But we've also learned that French authorities are sending their aviation sector to Japan as well, to Tokyo, to take part in all of this.This was an Airbus A350, a European-made aircraft by Airbus. So, it does make sense for France to have a role in all of this. Among the different task that will likely take place in an investigation like this are interviews, interviews with people in the control tower, interviews with people on the flight deck, but also members of the cabin crew. As we have been hearing since this disaster unfolded, a lot of credit is being given to the flight attendants who quickly evacuated that aircraft. And if you talk to flight attendants, they will tell you during their training, it is certainly rigorous, it is certainly intense, but it's so there is no hesitation that in the event like this, their response is almost instinct, almost second nature. As we have been reporting, after the plane came to a stop and flight attendants tried to initiate this evacuation, there's problems with the public address system. So, these flight attendants used megaphones and they shouted using their own voices. These are protocols, procedures that likely came from their training. So that will be a big part of this discussion through the safety investigators. Obviously, they want to know how things happened, exactly what happened, but also a big takeaway from this disaster will be guidance for the future. What can be learned from all of this? And you know as we look at this video, as we look at you know the smoke, we look at the flames, it is amazing, Rosemary, when we hear some of these accounts from people.

Zvika Fogel of the Jewish Power Party said, quote, \"First we will destroy Hamas, then we'll take care of Hezbollah, and for dessert we will sort out the Supreme Court.\" Well, Israel's interior minister responded, saying there is no place for including the Supreme Court in the same sentence as our worst enemies. Elliott Gotkine has more on the court's ruling.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ELLIOTT GOTKINE, REPORTER (voice-over):  It was a bombshell. In an 8-7 ruling, Israel's Supreme Court struck down legislation that removed its powers to throw out government decisions on the grounds of reasonableness. It rejected the amendment because of the severe and unprecedented blow it represented to the core characteristic of Israel as a democratic state. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had argued the change was required to restore the balance of power between the executive and the court. The law was the first of a multi-pronged government plan to weaken the judiciary to be passed by the Knesset last year. The Supreme Court's decision could now reopen the deep divisions in Israeli society. That saw the country convulsed by months of protests and even fears of civil war. With Israel now almost three months into an actual war, after the Hamas-led terrorist attacks of October 7, those divisions had felt a lifetime away. Indeed, Justice Minister Yariv Levine, the architect of the government's judicial overhaul plans, assailed the timing of the court's decision, saying it was the opposite of the unity the country now demanded. Strange as the timing of the Supreme Court's decision may appear, it had no choice. Two of its justices officially retired three months ago but had until this month to submit their final ruling. When the reform was introduced last year, massive crowds regularly took to the streets to decry Prime Minister Netanyahu's plans, which they saw as a serious threat to the country's democracy. In Israel, which has no written constitution, the Supreme Court serves as one of the only checks on the executive and legislative branches of government. In an interview with CNN in July, Netanyahu rejected the notion the overhaul posed a threat to democracy, but declined to say whether he would abide by a Supreme Court ruling that went against him.",
