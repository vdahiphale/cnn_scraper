And, in the case of the misplaced classified documents, the White House is very quiet. That's after President Biden's legal team found a second set of classified documents. It is not clear where they were found. But, wherever it was, they shouldn't have been there. President Biden is already facing questions about why the first set of highly sensitive material was in his former private office. Republicans are pouncing on the issue, claiming there is a double standard for how the government treats politicians. Phil Mattingly is at the White House with more. MATTINGLYNow, the president and his team, again, never said that there weren't any other documents out there. They spoke only about that initial set of 10 classified documents. In fact, to some degree, they have been very careful not to say anything about what else may be out there. Let's take a listen to the White House press briefing. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, what actually happens next, or if there even any more documents out there, is still an open question. So, two is what the actual documents, the second set of documents actually included. There are their sparse details about where they were found, what is inside of them, but it certainly exacerbates a situation that has been politically perilous for the president over the course of the last several days.Republicans on Capitol Hill, both Senate and House Republicans, say they believe they should investigate the matter. They have called on the Justice Department to appoint a special counsel to look into the matter, obviously drawing clear parallels even though these situations are quite different to former President Donald Trump and his classified records issues right now, his legal problems. How this actually ends going forward has very much remained an open question. The White House says they are fully cooperating. That isn't going to change, according to White House officials. But, certainly, finding a second set of classified records only complicates a problem that had only been growing in the hours before it was eventually revealed.

A lot of it is consistent underfunding over the years. Some of it is an aviation culture which is a little bit hesitant to embrace new technologies for obvious safety concerns. But, what you've ended up with is a system that was built essentially in the 1950s with spinning radars and people talking on radios, VHF radios that really hasn't moved in to an age of the Internet, to an age of computers, to an age of satellites. And, this NOTAM situation isn't directly related to that, but it speaks to the overall culture there of allowing antiquated technology to persist. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And, of course, that is why throughout much of Wednesday we saw the number of delays and cancellation continuing to tick up into the thousands. Of course, this has been a huge inconvenience for so many passengers, many of whom still have the debacle of the holidays still in mind where two to three weeks ago we saw a winter storm really cripple the airports and airlines, and of course subsequently the Southwest Airlines meltdown.One passenger I spoke with told me that he actually missed a funeral because of the delay after delay that he had to deal with. So, he was unable to attend a funeral in New York. But, all in all, passengers seem to be taking this in stride, although in general there is a sense of frustration. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We have some satellite imagery that we can show you that was provided this week that shows some apartment blocks, I think if we can bring that up, we have the before and after, showing just the scale of the destruction in that city that we go. We have the before. You can see sort of rows of apartment blocks. And, if we go to the after that you can see the destruction there. I think we have another one that shows a school and some surrounding buildings around that, similar story, sort of built- up area. They're fairly rural. And then, the after shot, you can see pretty much everything destroyed. President Zelenskyy said this week that there was not a wall left standing in solidarity.

They lost Kherson in November. Then there was the attack on Makiivka on New Year's Day which killed 89 soldiers. So, it looks like they want to change things up. The other backdrop to this, which is significant in terms of solidarity, is Wagner has been gaining momentum, Prigozhin, the head of that mercenary group, has claimed credit for what's happening in Soledar, which if Russia does take that city, would really be the only victory they're brought home since the summer, Max.",
