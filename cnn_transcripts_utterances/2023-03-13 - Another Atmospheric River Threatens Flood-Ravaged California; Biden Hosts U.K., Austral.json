At least two people have died and hundreds were forced to evacuate.Fortunately, floodwaters drastically receded over night and this rainbow rose above the region today once the sun broke through the clouds.

Now we're getting an update, a significant update on the progress of that, and accelerated time line for getting those nuclear powered submarines.At least three nuclear powered submarines, very much like one of the submarines that's behind me -- where the president is going to be speaking -- delivered to Australia early next decade. And in the meantime what you will see is increased rotations of U.S. and British submarines to Australia before ultimately what's set to happen in the 2040s, which is the development of a new submarine between the United States, Australia and the United Kingdom that is expected to be able to sail in that decade. All of this, of course, intended to counter China's growing military dominance and presence in the Indo Pacific. The U.S. has really watched China very cautiously on this front and increased the U.S. military footprint as well in other countries including the Philippines, for example. And when you listen -- when you talk to U.S. officials what's clear that this is multipronged strategy. There are these military moves that the U.S. is making. At the same time American officials are trying to normalize diplomatic relations with China. Trying to establish crucially those military to military communications which U.S. officials say are sorely lacking and heighten the risk of a miscalculation. I spoke to a senior administration official who told me that so far China has not been willing to setup those kinds of dialogues that the U.S. officials say are necessary. This is just the first stop of three stops that President Biden is making here out West. He's holding several fundraisers tomorrow. We expect him to address gun violence in Monterey Park -- which was the site of that January mass shooting. And then on Wednesday the president in Las Vegas set to address his plans to lower prescription drug prices.",

You know, it's always fun to try and pick an upset in the first or second round. If I met Cinderella and is going to win a bunch of games that you can brag about.But if you really want to win your bracket competition and brag to your co-workers and your friends, you need to be concentrating on the final game, right. The teams to make the final. You've really you got to pick the winner. Because more often than not, the team -- or the person that picks the team that wins the title is going to end up having a chance to win their bracket. And there's a stat that you should follow when filling out your bracket. It's called KenPom. It measures the team's offensive and defensive efficiency in every single champion since 2002 has been in the top 40 in offense and top 22 in defense. And these teams right here, they already qualify. All seven of those teams, a solid pick to win your bracket. These four over here, by the end of the tournament if they play well, they could qualify. So, those four teams also should be in range or in your thoughts when you're filling out your bracket. Now two teams that were not on that KenPom, they have a chance to win the tournament this year, according to KenPom Gonzaga and Arizona. Gonzaga in the 70s in defense, Arizona in the 40s. And check this out. Look at this map. Look at this map. Since 1997 every single champion has been on the east side of that red line right there. So, if Gonzaga, UCLA, Arizona Tech are on the wrong side of that line. It's been a long time since a West Coast team has won the NCAA tournament. Who should you pick then? Well, if you want to be the safest since 1979, a one-seed has won 26 times. So that's the most probable thing to happen now. Kansas won last year. Since 1974, these are the only two teams that have been able to repeat as champions. Winning the NCAA tournament two years in a row is a very hard thing to do. Where is the tournament this year? It's in Houston. Who is the betting favorite to win it all right now? It's the Houston Cougars. You got to go back to 1988 when Kansas won in Kansas City, for a team to win near their campus. So, what do you do with all this information? I don't know guys. I went to the University of Houston. I'm a Houston Cougar. John, I know Harvard is not in it, go with the Harvard of the south, the Houston Cougars this year to win the national championship. How about that?",
