Hegseth denies the allegations and was neither charged with a crime nor named as a defendant in any civil suit. That said nominations, especially for national security positions, have been withdrawn over far less. But the president-elect is standing by him.

But it's not really most of the Republican senators that the Trump team is worried about. It's just a handful of them because Matt Gaetz can only afford to lose about three Republican senators before he would not be able to get confirmed for this position. Otherwise, JD Vance may have to get involved in breaking the tie or casting his vote there. Basically, there's not a lot of room here. And it's not just these allegations. This is also someone who has gone after a lot of these Republican senators, who will be voting on whether or not to confirm him as the next attorney general. But the other part of this that I've heard from Trump people is that obviously, Trump just was overwhelmingly re-elected or elected back into office. And so, that is something that is weighing on these Republican senators. Do they want to start off this four-year term that he's about to have by defying him and going against one of his picks to put in his Cabinet. The question is whether or not there are other people waiting in the wings, certainly with the Pentagon. I've talked to two sources over the weekend after CNN reported and other outlets also reported that Pete Hegseth had paid a sum of money to the woman who accused him of sexual assault, something that he denies that his attorney says is not true and was consensual. And what we've heard from them is that they're not bothered by that. That they are still standing by Pete Hegseth and they're not making any kind of alternative plans when it comes to the Pentagon.

There are a few ways for them to be able to do so. They could send it just to Judiciary right now in the Senate Committee and say, hey, you guys are looking at this nomination, here's our report.

And previously as you saw up there, he has intimated this would essentially be NATO, the United States and Europe joining the conflict against Russia and that would require a fulsome response. Now those comments were echoed by a foreign ministry spokesperson today but we've seen Putin in the past make his red lines a bit fuzzier when he's put in a more uncomfortable position. Does Russia really at this point, exhausted by the war in Ukraine, have the muscle to take on NATO in its entirety? Probably not. But what this move has really done, Anderson, is deeply complicate the next two or three months of the war. It puts Ukraine potentially with a short term advantage over a few of these longer range missiles. Indeed, they have at their disposable, but the ultimate effect is to complicate that which Donald Trump, the president-elect inherits in January the 20th. He said he's keen on some kind of talks or at least stopping the killing, but this escalation from President Joe Biden, something this White House was so reluctant to do, has certainly made the idea of rapprochement harder.

And while it's believed, the Prince William, the Princess of Wales and their three children slept in their home elsewhere on the sprawling property.Now, the breaking happened last month. It was confirmed today by police. CNN's Royal Correspondent Max Foster has to tell us. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) MAX FOSTER, CNN ROYAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): You would have thought it was one of the most secure compounds in Britain, a base for all the U.K.'s senior royals. But that didn't stop burglars from breaking into Windsor Castle grounds. Police say thieves entered a farm building on the Crown Estate land late on Sunday, October the 13th, stealing a pickup truck and a quad bike before making their escape. The farm just minutes away from Windsor Castle and from Adelaide Cottage, where the Prince and Princess of Wales have a family home, and they were likely there that night. There's no indication the royal family was targeted or ever in danger, but the incident does show yet another security breach surrounding the royals. Kate and William live on their own without staff at their home on the estate, but with security on the premises. For their part, both Kensington and Buckingham Palace saying they don't comment on security matters. The break in just days before King Charles and Queen Camilla's long flight to visit Australia and Samoa. The couple weren't at Windsor when the break in took place. Incidents like this aren't new, and this one certainly not the most serious. In 2021, a man broke into Windsor Castle itself wearing a mask and armed with this weapon, a crossbow. The 19-year-old was hoping to kill Queen Elizabeth II, but he was stopped before he could harm her. Still, the incident raising serious concerns about security around the royal family.

Is there a sense of how security around Royals changed after some of those previous break ins?FOSTER (on-camera): Well, it's such a difficult issue to get information on, frankly, Anderson, because as soon as you ask the palace about it, they closed down as does the government, as does all the various police forces involved here. That's for a very practical reason. They don't want to give those security arrangements away, but also because of the sheer cost of it. So it's by far the biggest cost to the public for having a royal family. The only estimate we've got is from the anti-monarchy group Republic. Estimates it around $200 million a year. We don't get much information on it, I'm afraid.",
