A court found the evidence against him was made up. And Hong Kong is rolling out the red carpet to welcome two giant pandas from China, while Finland is sending pandas home. We've got all of that and more. We must begin in Florida, where Hurricane Helene is approaching fast, and with it, potentially deadly storm surges and powerful winds. It's expected to become a Category 4 hurricane when it arrives on land, that's about four and a half hours from now. So, far, at least 60 million people are under some sort of watch or warning across at least 12 states in the southern and eastern U.S. The warnings are of an unsurvivable storm surge of six meters, that's 20 feet or more.

Thousands have fled here from Israel's bombing campaign. Uhm Mohammed (ph) walked 12 hours with her two children, her feet still blistered, her son running a fever.

They were given a welcoming ceremony at the Hong Kong International Airport, and then, they were given a very special escort by elite police officers on motorcycles to their new home here at Hong Kong's Ocean Park. The two five-year-old pandas are named An An and Ke Ke, and they're from a conservation and research center in Sichuan Province. Now, An An is male, Ke Ke is female. They were both born in June of 2019. They are not genetically related and they're said to have complementary characteristics. They're also said to be in good health. Even so, they have to spend 30 days in quarantine here at Ocean Park. And then after that, they have a month to acclimate and to get used to their new habitat.
