Now instead, the President and the administration has been pushing for humanitarian pauses, which would allow for the release of hostages held by Hamas, as well as for more humanitarian aid to get into Gaza.But notably, the President touches on two other points in this op-ed, that includes, for example, a warning against extremists who are attacking civilians in the West Bank, saying that the U.S. is prepared to issue visa bans. This has all been an area of concern for the administration. And also, the President taking a moment to call again, for a two-state solution. This has been an idea that the President has long endorsed and says is the solution for the Israel Hamas conflict. And in it, he says the following, quote, \"A two-state solution to people's living side by side with equal measures of freedom, opportunity and dignity is where the road to peace must lead\". He goes on to write, \"Reaching it will take commitments from Israelis and Palestinians, as well as from the United States and our allies and partners\". Now, the President goes on to say that Israel should follow humanitarian law and protect innocent civilians. But zooming out here, the President acknowledging both the Israel conflict and the conflict in Ukraine, noting that these conflicts while they are unfolding abroad do affect U.S. national security and are significant and the U.S. support for these conflicts is important. And it is important too to not cede any ground to Russian President Vladimir Putin, as well as to Hamas. Now, the President and the administration have a supplemental request to Congress for billions more in funding to support both of these conflicts. That funding is currently stalled, so the President taking a moment in this op-ed to remind Americans why it matters now at what the administration sees as an inflection point. Victor and Amara?",

However, they do have to adhere to some very strict regulations and restrictions. I want to show you just a few of what those are. For example, donations -- individual donations, they cannot exceed $5,000. All of those legal expenses, they have to be disclosed. Adams also cannot solicit any money from any subordinates or anyone doing business with the city and also they cannot accept any money from corporations or companies.

It's not as bad as I thought it would have been in 2020 or 2021?DR. MORGAN: So, one thing that we know is that the issue with COVID as opposed to other viruses like measles and mumps is that as it spreads from person to person it mutates. So, we're not able to get that herd immunity. We certainly had an opportunity early on in the pandemic to reach herd immunity, but we couldn't get enough people vaccinated within that time frame to reach that. The other concern is the spillover effect that we see in our children with regard to vaccine uptake of all of our vaccines. So, for the first time since we've been tracking this with the CDC, we see that children have filed more than a three percent exemption out of getting these vaccines. And we need to have at least 95 percent of the population vaccinated to continue to have herd immunity. And even more alarming, there are 10 states in the United States that have greater than that five percent. So, already are outside of what we deemed to be safe for herd immunity for measles. And there are 40 states that all have an increase. So, you can see what this spillover effect from COVID over to vaccinations in general and parents' attitudes towards them.",

Well, SpaceX engineers are going to spend the next several days and weeks pouring over all of this data and trying to figure out what exactly went wrong. But it's important to note that this is what SpaceX likes to do. They like to push their rockets and spacecrafts all the way to the point of failure.This is what they did on all of their previous successful rockets and spacecrafts. And now, they're trying to do it with Starship, the biggest rocket, most powerful rocket that's ever flown. And the ultimate goal is to put 100 people on top of this rocket, send them to Mars, and then colonize the red planet, that's the ultimate goal. But first, they have to figure out how to safely get this thing into orbit. Now, the test flight that we saw yesterday was a success. And that all 33 of the raptor engines ignited, the launch pad did not sustain any damage, there was a successful stage separation between the booster and the spacecraft, and it made it all the way up to the very edge of space, flying much farther than that first failed test flight back in April. But then something happened, and that's why yesterday's test flight was also a failure. There were two big explosions. The booster and the spacecraft both exploded. And if this had all go perfectly, according to the flight plan, the spacecraft was supposed to complete almost one full lap of planet Earth before splashing down in the Pacific Ocean. That clearly did not happen. So, now this becomes what the FAA calls a mishap, and that's triggered a mishap investigation with the FAA. It will be led by SpaceX, but they now have to get the green light from the FAA to attempt to fly Starship for a third time, and we don't know how long that will take. But certainly, a step in the right direction. The NASA Administrator, Bill Nelson, congratulating SpaceX yesterday. Calling it a big step forward. A sign of progress because NASA needs this Starship spacecraft because they're using it to land American astronauts on the surface of the moon for the first time in 50 years. It is a centerpiece of its flagship Artemis program. Victor and Amara.",

You've also got rain going through the forecast Monday for Chicago, Springfield, St. Louis. And then on the southern edge, we actually have the potential for severe thunderstorms tomorrow. We're talking damaging winds, tornadoes and even some hail. Places like Shreveport down to New Orleans and even just south of Memphis as we go to tomorrow afternoon and especially into the evening hours. And it's all because of this low-pressure system here that's going to be spreading eastward as we go through the next few days. So, by Tuesday, unfortunately, if you've got some air travel, a lot of the big connecting airports, Atlanta, Washington, D. C., New York, and Chicago all looking at rain in the forecast.

So, Boston, New York, stretching all the way down the coast, likely going to have some travel problems. Now, for today, it's mainly going to be the western cities.
