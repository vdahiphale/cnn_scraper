Video showing it falling out of the sky. Was Putin behind the crash? Plus, Trump's arrest. The former president is expected to turn himself in tomorrow night. And we are now learning new details about what to expect. Plus, Giuliani reports to jail. The former New York City mayor turning himself in on charges connected to Trump's efforts to overturn the state's election. His mugshot just released. Let's go OUTFRONT. Good evening. I'm Brianna Keilar, in for Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, breaking news, Putin's biggest enemy appears to have been eliminated. Yevgeny Prigozhin who led the attempted coup back in June is now dead after the jet that he was flying in crashed, according to a group linked to the Wagner group. This is video of Prigozhin's plane. You see it here, falling out of the sky minus one of its wings. A large trail of smoke billowing behind it. There were nine other people on board that jet which was in a cruise altitude of 28,000 feet before it disappeared from radar. Video from the ground showing the jets debris burning. So far, no word on what caused the plane, which was traveling from Moscow to St. Petersburg to go down. But U.S. intelligence is now most likely trying to determine if there was an explosion inside of the plane or if there was a flash on the ground which could suggest that it was hit by a missile. So far, Putin is not commenting on the crash. We have a lot to get to tonight. I want to start with Fred Pleitgen. Fred, what more are you learning about the crash that is said to have killed this leader of the Wagner Group? FREDRICKA PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Hi there, Brianna. Well, the Russians are saying the investigators are on the scene are actually still working and trying to gather evidence. They say they're looking at multiple scenarios as to what might have happened to the plane, including mechanical errors but of course also as they put it, tampering with the aircraft as well. And, of course, it's no secret that Yevgeny Prigozhin more than fell out of favor with Vladimir Putin. In fact, Vladimir Putin called some of the actions of Prigozhin treasonous. Now, of course, right now, it's unclear what exactly happened to the plane, who was behind it, but there are very few who believe that it could've been an accident. Here's what we're learning. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): Probably the last moments of Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin. This jet, an Embraer Legacy 600 seen falling from the sky, a wing appearing to be missing. Russian authorities confirming Prigozhin was on board of the aircraft. CNN is unable to confirm the authenticity of this video but RIA Novosti claimed it was the moment that an Embraer jet fell from the sky in the Tver region north of Moscow. Flight data shows that the plane traveling from Moscow heading to St. Petersburg before it suddenly stopped transmitting. Russian media say ten people were on board, all of them believed dead and that Prigozhin's name was also on the passenger manifest. The Wagner mercenary group fought bitterly in Ukraine, notably in Bakhmut, gaining some territory but also incurring heavy losses. Prigozhin ripping into Russia's defense minister and his top general, accusing them of withholding ammo leading to further deaths of his fighters. YEVGENY PRIGOZHIN, WAGNER CHIEF (through translator): You think you are the masters of this life. You think you can dispose of other lives. You think because you have warehouses full of ammunition that you have that right.",

So, now, we see a reversal of accusations where Putin was calling what Prigozhin did two months ago exactly to the day two months ago treason. Now the ex- Wagnerites or the Wagnerites are calling what Putin did to Prigozhin treason. So we are poised to see some interesting developments in Russia in the next few days.

I mean, the reason why we on this program discussed a couple of weeks ago that Putin must avenge, must eliminate, neutralize Prigozhin once he called them a traitor, because otherwise, he will lose the ability to govern by ruthlessness.The only problem with the timing is that it happened a bit too fast. It happened before Putin was able to essentially destroy the influence of Prigozhin in Africa, destroyed the influence of Prigozhin on the remaining Wagner troops. And I think that this has to do exactly with Africa. I mean, in the last week, we saw a lot of escalation of deep fights between the Ministry of Defense and Putin and the Kremlin on one hand. And Prigozhin on the other hand who will reclaim control over some of the most lucrative market in Africa over Mali, over Central African Republic. In fact, Prigozhin wasn't Africa the last two days and he was on the way back from Africa trying to retain control over Mali and not to yield control to the Ministry of Defense. I think it is this escalation of the interest in Africa that precipitated the action against Prigozhin.",

Because if Prigozhin did one good thing, if this cold-blooded criminal and war criminal did one good thing, he actually created some sort of pluralism of media and Russia and in a worse and a very perverse sense.

I know you think that Rudy Giuliani could be a prime candidate for flipping on Trump. Of course, as you are aware he only has that option, right, if prosecutors think that he is credible, that they can trust him, prosecutors took that trust on you. They might not take that chance on Giuliani and he knows that.So as long as Trump gets his legal bills paid, why do you think he would consider turning?",

Because any individual whether you believe him to be credible or not is not the issue. It is a documentary or the information, testimony that you can provide to the prosecutors that they can use to create that conviction.You know, as we all know, we've seen organized crime right? RICO Rudy in the past has these many people who would not be considered credible as witnesses to put away other members of organized crime. So that I don't buy, what I do find interesting is that Rudy went to Mar-a-Lago with Bob Costello in order to make a plea for money. And interestingly enough, Donald is not putting up $1 of his own money for Rudy's benefit but rather he's going to host a fund-raiser and ask other people to fund Rudy's legal fees as opposed to again Donald doing it. Donald at least finally smart and up a little bit and he realized the danger that Rudy could potentially put him in and so, at least he is doing something. Maybe he's not as dumb as I said the other night on CNN with Kaitlan.",

He understands that Donald is going to throw each and every one of these individuals under the bus in order to protect himself, starting with Rudy, going to Jenna Ellis, going to, you know, Sidney Powell. He's going to go through each and everyone under the bus to save himself. And, finally, there's one person out of this entire group that understands that.

Putin was leading a ceremony, marking a World War II battle between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany.And we're also now seeing just released data from FlightRadar24, that reveals what happened in the plane's moments. The jet, according to the tracking site, leveled off at 28,000 feet. But it had erratic climbs and descents in its final minutes. And the plane dropped 8,000 feet per minute before data transmission stopped. OUTFRONT now, Mary Schiavo, former inspector general for the U.S. Department of Transportation.

First of, all as you mentioned, it was a 28,000 feet in cruise, that's the safest part of the flight, with the look -- seemingly missing the wing. This simply doesn't happen -- commercial airliners, commercial planes, modern aircraft, do not lose the wing. In my decades of working on plane crashes, I've only had one commercial plane that lost a wing. It was 54 years old.And also, the rate of descent, a normal rate of descent is 1,000 to 3,000 feet per minute, not 8,000. It was clearly falling. And if you look very closely at the video, you can see some other, not just the plane, you can see some flashes, you can see other smoke. You can see debris, separating from the plane. So, so many clues here that this was an explosion on the plane or a missile strike, and by the way, the descent is like other shoot downs we've, seen like MH-17, the jetliner that was shot down by a Russian missile, and the Ukrainian airlines that was shot down by Iran. So, we have a lot of clues in this video.",
