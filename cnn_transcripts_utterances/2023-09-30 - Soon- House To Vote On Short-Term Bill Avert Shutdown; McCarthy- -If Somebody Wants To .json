      "sentences": "Hello again, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me this Saturday. I'm Fredricka Whitfield.Right now, we are watching on Capitol Hill, lawmakers on the House floor with a potential government shutdown just less than 12 hours away. They are now trying to discern whether a proposed last ditch effort measure to keep the government funded will be something that they'll be voting on momentarily. Right now, we're looking at pictures of House members voting on trying to get extra time so that Democrats feel that they could spend more time to look at this latest measure before it actually goes to vote. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy's latest plan is a 45-day spending bill that would allow for the government to continue working for at least 45 days while they try to work things out. We've got it covered from all angles. CNN's Lauren Fox is joining us from Capitol Hill. Priscilla Alvarez is tracking the potential responses coming from the White House. Lauren, let's go to you first on what is a procedural vote right now, because Democrats say they need a little bit more time before making any decisions on McCarthy's latest plan.",

They are basically trying to buy themselves a little more time to have a conversation within their caucus about whether or not to support this short-term spending bill.So, this is just a delay tactic and opportunity to try to give their members a little bit of wiggle room to go downstairs, have a conversation and figure out if they come back this proposal that would fund the government for 45 days through November 17th, and would include billions in disaster aid, but no money for Ukraine aid, and that is the key flashpoint right now between the House and the Senate. The Senate's proposal includes $6.2 billion for Ukraine aid, this House proposal doesn't. Democrats are irate right now. They feel as though they are being squeezed by the House Speaker. They say that, you know, they are trying to read through the details, scrub the legislation to understand what is actually inside of it before voting on it. And a couple of them are calling out the House Speaker for this being sort of a rich move by him, given the fact that House Republicans and conservatives for the last several months in the House of Representatives have been saying that they want to give their members 72 hours to look over legislation before they vote on it. So, Democrats trying to understand what is inside this bill, trying to make sure that they are making the right decision. But obviously, this is a move by Republicans to try and have a position in this negotiation with the Senate. To try to force Democrats to decide would they rather have a shutdown? Or would they rather have Ukraine aid? And I think that, that is the pivotal moment, and something that House Republican leadership is trying to force right now, Fredricka.",

But bottom line to keep government going.This is the measure that he wants to go for a vote today. Democrats are saying, wait a minute, we need a little bit more time to read through all of it. They are consulting with the White House to see in which what direction what kind of leverage there might be before any vote is to transpire. But the House Speaker there, making it very clear that it would allow for money to keep paychecks going to U.S. military, Border Patrol, but it would not include money for Ukraine. The $6.2 million in U.S. aid money that many Democrats and many Republicans have said that they want. Lauren Fox, they are asking many of the questions to the House Speaker. Lauren, he is making it sound really simple, you know, that everyone should be on board with this, that he's worked really hard. And he's also placing blame that it's many Democrats who have not been on board with this.

Just again, when we pressed him on the fact that Democrats are frustrated, that they feel like they have not had enough time to look over this proposal. That, once again, if the government is shut down, he says it will be on Democrats that he is acting as the adults in the room. But repeatedly, you see there a defiant Speaker, because he knows that even bringing this up, even entertaining the idea of a 45-day clean C.R. that includes funding for disasters, that, that could potentially trigger a vote to oust him. And that is why he says, you know, if they want to make that decision, that's up to them. But he said he is not afraid of losing his job. And he is not going to make decisions when it comes to government funding based on that reality. But let's just play back the tape a little bit, because over the last week, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has made every effort at every turn to try and get his Republican colleagues to back something on a short- term spending bill to keep the government funded. He has given conservatives intense cuts on domestic spending. He has tried to include robust border provisions, all as a way to try to satisfy that hard, length -- hard right flank that he claims he is not afraid of. So, it's a huge question right now. The two biggest questions looming for me are whether or not this bill can pass, whether or not Democrats are going to rally around it. They are meeting in a caucus right now, trying to make that decision as a Democratic caucus, who also have the other looming question: What does this mean? What does this decision that McCarthy made today mean for his future? Fred?",

Is he trying to appease the small -- the minority of the Republican majority there, many of whom Republicans who said, they're on board with earlier proposals, bipartisan proposals that have been set forth by the Senate?

Perhaps, those members were never going to get to yes, and they wanted to force the Speaker into a potential position where maybe he had to work across the aisle with Democrats. Now, the question, of course, is, did he wait too long to try and work with Democrats? And are Democrats going to rally around this proposal at the last minute now? But you can hear the through the conversations that Republican members had today in their conference meeting for about two hours, that they, as a conference had to work through this as well. That when they went into the meeting, they had one plan. When they came out of the meeting, they had another. This is a very, very fluid situation.

And that is a line that you could expect that House Republicans were going to be making, because even though they are bringing this up at the last minute, his argument is that if Democrats just voted for it, they could potentially be on a path to avoid a government shutdown.House Democrats are having a conversation right now about what they are going to do. Our colleague, Annie Grayer, who is outside of that meeting, said a lot of Democrats coming out of that are saying that they just want more time to review the bill. But you heard from House Speaker Kevin McCarthy that he doesn't understand why they need so much more time. His argument is, is this just a short-term spending bill that keep the government open through November 17th. There is really not a lot to see there. They need to just decide if they're going to vote for this or not to potentially avert a shutdown. But obviously, the House Speaker believes that House Republicans now have a plan to try to stop the shutdown, as Senate Republicans and Democrats are still working through their bill in the Senate. And because of some procedural hurdles by Senator Rand Paul, because of the Ukraine aid over there, they potentially may not actually finish their bill until Monday after a shutdown has already started. So, McCarthy's argument is this is really the only bill right now that could potentially avoid a shutdown.",

That would not be impacted, but I am standing in the building that it would be very noticeable should a government shutdown happen. And that is the building containing the library and the museum. This would shutdown if that government funding does not come in.So right here you can see that there is a celebration happening. They moved it up. Jimmy Carter's birthday is tomorrow, his 99th birthday. They're celebrating it today. Most of the activities happening today to make sure to give folks a chance here to celebrate and honor America's oldest living president. So right in that direction, they're taking video messages for the 39th president. And then right over here, look at this. They are signing birthday cards for him in crayon, giving well wishes. Over here, folks of all different ages having their well wishes be sent forward to the former president. And in that direction, right over there, a birthday cake celebration. A little bit of a line here, folks, trying to celebrate his birthday. And I do also want to say to you, Fred, that according to the National Archives, some of the most beloved museums, national parks, presidential libraries, they would be impacted by this government shutdown. All Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo would be closed. However, we did hear from a press release yesterday that they would remain open until at least next Saturday. That is thanks to some money that they've had there in the bank from some previous years. And the National Park Service, also saying that it plans to close most U.S. national parks. That's a lesson learned from seeing all that trash piling up, seeing toilets overflowing, and also vandalism due to the reduced workforce. So visitors, what should they expect? Locked gates, closed visitor centers, and no trail or road updates as thousands of park rangers are furloughed. But I do also want to say, Fred, we did see the former president, Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, in their hometown of Plains, Georgia, celebrating, riding, taking a ride through town for the Plains Peanut Festival, so incredible video just to see him doing so well. He's been in hospice care for seven months now. Fred?",

      "sentences": "Fred, as you know, the New York City subway system is the lifeblood of the city. So as you can imagine yesterday as this storm was dumping record amounts of rain over the New York City tri-state area, that system, many aspects of it, was practically paralyzed as officials were trying to get it back online. So the result was an absolute nightmare of a Friday for so many people in America's largest city.However, this morning we heard from New York State Governor Kathy Hochul, who announced that system is back up and running 100 percent, at least in terms of the weekend service. So that is certainly a positive development. We have not seen any major issues here in Manhattan. But I tell you what we've also heard from officials is commending not just the response, but also residents themselves, who, according to the governor, largely heeded those warnings coming from officials if you can stay home to do so and for those people living in basement apartments to be extra alert. And that, according to the governor, was really one of the main reasons why we did not see any injuries or any potential deaths, which is something that we've seen during previous storms. So there really is sort of a feeling of relief, even some pride, but also some really important questions about what can be done in the future to at least minimize the impact as we heard from Governor Hochul say that she blamed climate change for seeing these sort of weather events happening on a more frequent basis, saying that the infrastructure simply cannot keep up with the changes that we've noticed here. And so because of that, the governor, the mayor certainly, has been calling on increased investments in the infrastructure, especially some of those drains that are equipped to handle about 1.75 inches an hour, Fred. But when you look at what we saw yesterday, some sections getting a rate of three inches an hour. So because of that, officials are certainly taking a hard look at that. But overall, standing by that response that we saw not only during the storm but leading up to it as well.",

      "sentences": "Unfortunately, a little bit more rain, Fred. We've still got this cluster of showers right here that's starting to push its way into the Northeast. The heaviest rain right now kind of right across Nantucket and the Cape. Also some moderate showers at times starting to spread into Long Island. Once we can get through this last cluster, we'll finally start to see an end to all of this rain.Now, most of these areas only expected to pick up about an extra half an inch to maybe one inch of rain. That may not sound like much, but you have to remember it's on top of what we've already had. You have several flood warnings in effect across the Northeast. Still, that's not necessarily for the additional rain expected today. It's for all of the rain that fell yesterday. You get a lot of rain, it comes in quickly, but it doesn't necessarily go out very quickly. It takes time for that water to recede. As you mentioned, we picked up over eight inches of record at JFK, but also picking up over nine inches in Valley Stream, New York, and numerous other locations across New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, five and even six inches of rain. Again, it takes time for that water to go away, and that's where the concern becomes today. So even if they do only get a half inch or another inch of rain on top of what they've had, it's just going to slow that progress of getting rid of that water and likely exacerbate some of that ongoing flooding. Here's a look at the rest of the day. Again, there's still that final cluster still lingering across some areas, especially the farther east locations like the Cape, Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket, maybe even around Montauk, New York. We're looking there. Those places still likely to kind of linger into the afternoon. But by the overnight hours tonight, that rain finally recedes. And then once we get to Sunday, finally a nice dry day from start to finish. And a lot more sunshine than these areas have really been used to. So, again, Fred, just kind of got to get through the next 12 hours or so, and then we will finally start to see big improvements in the forecast.",

Twenty-seven years after his death his music is as relevant as ever. Then, this week, a stunning announcement.
