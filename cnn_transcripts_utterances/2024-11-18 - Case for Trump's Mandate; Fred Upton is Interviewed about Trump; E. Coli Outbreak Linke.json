In fact, his popular vote win at this point is the weakest going all the way back - you have to go all the way back to 2000 to find a weaker one, a smaller popular vote victory than Donald Trump currently has.

Let's talk about this.Joining us right now is a former Republican congressman, Fred Upton, of Michigan, who is among one of the many Republicans to come out in support of Vice President Kamala Harris in this election. It's good to see you, Fred. Thank you. As you had told me a few weeks ago, it was the first time you ever voted for a Democrat for president. Trump's lead in the popular vote, what John and Harry were just talking about, it's smaller than what people thought it was going to be starting on election night. And Trump has said, and pointed to his popular vote victory, is giving him a mandate. So, this new reality of a smaller popular vote, do you think it means what for that mandate? FRED UPTON (R), FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE: You know, when I was listening to Harry give his little outline, I thought, Trump is probably going to use the word huge when he when he talks about the popular vote here. But, you know, he won, and he got over 300 electoral votes. He views it as a mandate. And he's - he's - particularly when you look at some of the controversial picks that he's chosen for his cabinet, he's going to move forward thinking that it was like everybody.",

So, they knew that that was going to be an issue. So, it was close in Michigan, that's for sure, but at the end of the day Trump won narrowly and, obviously, got all 15 electoral votes.",

So, it went from in essence a one seat majority for the Democrats to now I think Republicans picked up four seats. So, a slight change there.You also saw that, in the congressional delegation, the Slotkin - the congressional seat, her house seat actually flipped to a Republican. So, Republicans gained one seat in Michigan. And a couple of other seats that were up were razor thin. The Democrats prevailed, but it was razor thin for them to win. So, Michigan is going to stay one of those purple states and the coattails really weren't there for Slotkin, who beat a really able candidate, Mike Rogers, former House colleague, FBI agent, terrific biography in terms of him. It was close, but he - Trump would have had to win by a few more - by another point or two. Actually, I think it was about 75,000 votes difference between the two.

I'm not a Matt Gaetz friend. I don't think we barely had a conversation in the years that we served together. But I'll tell you this, Trump knew what he was getting into. He's going to make sure that that nomination goes forward. And when you look at the Senate Judiciary Committee, their - most of those Republicans that are on the committee, it's going to change a little bit because, of course, the Senate flipped. But it's probably going to be something like a 12-10 majority for Republicans. I'm sure that for any new member getting on that committee, they're going to have to approve of the litmus test that they're going to support Gaetz to get it out of committee. And when you look at the members that are on that committee, Mike Lee, Josh Hawley, Lindsey Graham, Marsha Blackburn, they're pretty hardcore Trump supporters. And I don't - I see that committee actually voting to affirm Matt Gaetz.

We're looking into it.And Sean \"Diddy\" Combs now accused of obstruction of justice from behind bars. Prosecutors say he's been reaching out to witnesses, and even tried tainting the jury pool. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [08:51:43] SIDNER: Prosecutors are now accusing Sean \"Diddy\" Combs of continuing efforts to obstruct the federal investigation into his sex trafficking case and trying to taint the jury pool from his jail cell. In a court filing prosecutors say the music mogul had been trying to evade government monitoring by using the telephone accounts of at least eight other inmates. Prosecutors also argue that Combs should not be entitled to another bail hearing after he sought to contact potential witnesses, including accusers, with the goal of blackmailing them to keep quiet or help his defense. Joining me now is defense attorney Misty Marris. Thank you so much, Misty, for coming in this morning. These allegations are really serious, trying to blackmail people from jail. He's talking to, according to prosecutors, potential witnesses. How will this be handled by the court? And is it something that gets addressed swiftly since, you know, the witnesses, if they are sort of being threatened, would need some assistance here?",

He may have additional monitoring to ensure that he cannot engage in this conduct, specifically taking the numbers of other individuals or improperly contacting witnesses.Now, that's all about what could happen to him while he remains behind bars. It is of incredible detriment to his bail proceeding to say that he's engaging in this conduct while he's already under the thumb of the corrections. Now he wants to be out. Even with 24 hour monitoring, it really, really is something that's going to impact his arguments moving forward and make it very unlikely for him to be successful.",
