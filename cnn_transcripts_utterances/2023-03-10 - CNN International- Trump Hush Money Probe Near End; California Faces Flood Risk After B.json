It's known that Jehovah Witnesses have long been discriminated against in Europe. In Germany itself, there's about 170,000 members of the Jehovah Witnesses and about 2,000 congregations. And the discrimination has taken all kinds of forms. Here in France for example in the late '90s, the organization lost its tax-exempt status and that was something they fought hard against it. They eventually won it back after taking an appeal to the European Court of Human Rights. So, it is a group that has faced this kind discrimination in the past not only in Europe but other parts of the world. That might have something or nothing to do with it or it might have nothing to do with it. We'll have to see.
