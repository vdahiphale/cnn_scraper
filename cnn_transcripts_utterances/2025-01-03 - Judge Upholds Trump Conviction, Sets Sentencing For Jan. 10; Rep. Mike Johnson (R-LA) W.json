A New York judge is ordering Donald Trump to appear for sentencing one week from today after rejecting the president-elect's efforts to throw out his hush money conviction.Also breaking, Speaker Mike Johnson just survived a very dramatic vote on the House floor to keep his gavel. Johnson earning another term with a razor thin Republican majority, but not before a handful of conservative holdouts sent a powerful message. Plus, America's top doctor raises the alarm about the link between alcohol and cancer. This hour, the U.S. surgeon general, Dr. Vivek Murthy, joins me to discuss his new push for warning labels. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. The breaking news this hour, Donald Trump's hush money conviction upheld by Judge Juan Merchan, the president-elect now ordered to appear for sentencing just ten days before he takes the oath of office for a second term. Our Chief Legal Affairs Correspondent Paula Reid is on the story for us. Paula, take us through this ruling and what it means for the president-elect.",

But in a sort of unusual move, he's previewing what he will do next Friday, saying that is not something he is going to do. He says, quote, it seems improper at this juncture -- it seems proper at this juncture to make known the court's inclination to not impose any sentence of incarceration. So, he's imposing a sentence of what he describes as unconditional discharge, because that, he says, is the most viable solution. Now, unconditional discharge just means there'll be a sentencing, but there'll be no penalties, no community service, no fine, no jail. So, what happens next Friday will largely be performative. Now, it's also notable, the judge is making a real concession about the demands that Trump faces as president-elect. This is something that his lawyers have continuously argued. Judge Juan Merchan says, quote, to assuage the defendant's concerns regarding the mental and physical demands during the transition period, this court will permit the defendant to exercise his right to appear virtually for this proceeding if he so chooses. And this is notable because over the course of this case, Judge Juan Merchan has not been terribly sympathetic to many of the presidential- related arguments that Trump's lawyers have made. But here, they're saying, yes, we know you have a lot of time on your hands, a lot of things to do, not much time, so you should not be burdened with having to travel up to New York for this sentencing. Now, the Trump team was trying to get the entire case dismissed, have the verdict tossed out. They were not successful here, but they can continue their appeal. But in a statement today, Trump's communication director, Steven Cheung, making it clear they're not overall very happy with how this turned out, saying, quote, there should be no sentencing. And President Trump will continue fighting against these hoaxes until they are all dead, likely referring to the four criminal cases Trump has faced. Of course, the two federal cases filed by Jack Smith are dead, they have been dismissed. The Georgia case is on life support, and here in New York, Trump was convicted, but the judge here signaling he will not face any penalties.",

But that would mean that Trump is going into office having been sentenced as a convicted felon.Neither of these are options that Donald Trump loves. You know, he's looking -- he's facing a different reality now. He's not facing a reelection campaign. He has been elected to a second term. Constitutionally, that's all he can serve. So, the political benefit to him in, you know, showing up in court and fighting for himself is maybe less than it would be. Otherwise, that having been said, he's very angry about these cases and that hasn't changed. He's very angry about this case in particular. And he may decide that he wants some kind of a display of fighting it. I don't think we're going to know that for another two days or so.",

Now, if he goes to sentencing on the 10th, as was already stated, he'll be able to appeal on the merits of the case. And then they will go back into these rulings and to see whether or not an appellate court agrees with Judge Merchan that no official acts were at play. And because this is so new, it's just hard to tell.Now, with respect to President-elect Trump being the sitting president, again, because of his likely sentence, which is nothing, no penalty, I think, very much will happen, except his legal team will fight very hard to have this conviction reversed.

They were uncertain whether they would back Mike Johnson, but Johnson decided to provide some commitments to assure them that they could be part of some of the negotiations going forward over some of the big ticket bills that are moving forward on Capitol Hill. I caught up with those members in the aftermath of those votes, including one congressman, Congressman Chip Roy of Texas, who did ultimately vote for Mike Johnson, who also warned him that if he were not to go ahead with some of the changes to allow more members in the process to potentially cut spending to levels that Roy and other hardliners want, that, as he said, there could be consequences.

So, today, whle it's a chaotic day on the Hill, it is a good day for America, and we got, because we have a speaker of the House.

But again, it's not the only action we can take. Health care organizations, doctors and nurses can play a role in educating patients about this. And I want everybody to know out there that especially if you're concerned about cancer risk, if you have a personal history or family history of cancer, that one of the things that you can do to reduce your risk is to reconsider how much you drink, because we know that less consumption of alcohol means less risk of cancer.",

It is possible there may be some benefit to some types of heart disease, like heart attacks, for example, with, you know, low levels or moderate levels of drinking. It's possible -- it's still being debated and investigated.But we also know that other types of heart disease, like atrial fibrillation, which is an abnormal heart rhythm, heart failure and high blood pressure, that the risk of those conditions increases when you drink. So how it nets out overall for your heart is still a subject of intense debate.

Tobacco is a big one for my office. Just two months ago, we released a major report on tobacco and tobacco related health disparities. It still remains the leading cause of preventable death, nearly half a million lives taken in the United States each year due to tobacco. But yes, there are other areas that we've got to look at as well. I do think food is an important one of those. Like we can do more to ensure our food supply is healthy, very high proportion of our diet right now is ultra processed foods, particularly for our kids. And I have real concerns about the health impact of those on our children and all of us. But it turns out that alcohol is, again, is one of those areas we've got to look at as well.

So the snow that we're seeing today, that's nothing. That's out of here. That's just the whimpering effects of the -- of the lake effect. There's the storm we're talking about. In Colorado, it starts to get into Kansas tomorrow. But, Wolf, everywhere that's pink on this entire map. That's a foot of snow or more. Think about what that's going to do to the interstates. If you are planning on going home on Sunday from all of your vacation travels, think about doing it tomorrow instead, because it does start in Kansas tomorrow, and it makes its way all the way to the East Coast by Monday. And yes, we could see a half to one inch of ice in some spots bringing down trees, power lines, making the roadways completely impassable. So, here's Saturday, here's tomorrow starts out to the west, but then all of a sudden, by Sunday morning, you've got a large swath I-70, 35, all the way up here to now, I-75, almost all the way to D.C. by Sunday night. And now we're getting way out in the weeds here almost 60 hours from right now. And this storm still has a lot of energy to it. A lot of snow could be coming down D.C., Philadelphia, Baltimore. If this storm is 100 miles farther to the north, New York, you're going to get walloped. A hundred miles farther to the south, Richmond, Virginia. So this is a big event.
