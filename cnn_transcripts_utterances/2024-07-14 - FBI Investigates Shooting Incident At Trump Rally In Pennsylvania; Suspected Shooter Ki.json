But the question is, what was supposed to happen at the building. Was someone is supposed to be posted there? Was there a sweep? When did the sweep happened? Ultimately, how did this shooter get up onto the roof? And the other major question here, Wolf, is that in the planning, how did the Secret Service determine the relevance of that building in this larger operational plan? Did they look at that building as a vulnerability? Did they just simply say it's outside the perimeter, this perimeter is wide enough and move on? These are the questions that need to be answered by the Secret Service and certainly the questions that the Secret Service is asking themselves at this very moment. What we know, Wolf, is that what the Secret Service does at events like this, and certainly this happened at the rally, is that they rely on local law enforcement to fill in gaps. That happens all the time. It is extremely routine for the Secret Service. And in this case, for example, they had two Secret Service counter-sniper teams available on the ground with the former president as well as two local counter- sniper teams. But again, there are so many questions, Wolf, about was somebody supposed to be posted there and why wasn't a member of law enforcement posted on the roof.",

      "sentences": "Well, Erin, I'll start with the newest information that we just received from a briefing that the FBI conducted in the past hour or so. We're talking about Thomas Matthew Crooks. This is the 20-year-old suspect who is accused of the attempted assassination of former president Donald Trump.According to the FBI, we now know that they believe that he acted alone. And the FBI also believes that there's no indication of mental health issues with Mr. Crooks. We also have learned in the past hour that part of this investigation is the FBI has actually gotten access to Thomas Crooks' phone, but at this point they don't have access to the information inside the phone and they have shipped it to Quantico, according to the FBI, the FBI headquarters, to try and figure out how to get inside. And the other thing, Erin, that perhaps is surprising, but the FBI said it on this briefing, is that they have not at this point identified any sort of ideology that would give clues to, again, the big question that everyone has, what caused this man to go to this Trump event and open fire at the former president ultimately injuring him, killing one and injuring two other rally goers in the crowd. Now I do want to just go over some of the things that we do know in addition to some of this information, Erin. We also learned in the past hour or so that Mr. Crooks was a dietary aid at the Bethel Park Skilled Nursing and Rehabilitation Center. It's like a nursing home that's very close to where we are, not too far from his home about five minutes away here in Bethel Park, Pennsylvania. That organization confirmed that he was an employee, confirmed that he was a dietary aide, said that they were shocked and saddened by this news of the shooting overnight. But also noted that Crooks performed his job without concern and did pass background checks prior to getting this particular job. Now, the last thing, Erin, that I'll mention is just a few of the things that we have been reporting, as you said, all throughout the day. We know that Mr. Crooks was a registered Republican. We also know that he donated a small amount of money to a Democratic aligned group back in 2021. And we also know that he was possession of an AR-style rifle, which law enforcement sources tell us was actually not just obtained legally, but also traced back to Mr. Crooks' father. And that's actually how law enforcement was able to identify their suspect in the first place because Thomas Crooks was not found with any ID after the U.S. Secret Service agents neutralized him yesterday. But again, Erin, the big question that we still do not have an answer to, what led him to go to that Trump campaign event and open fire -- Erin.",

Someone else should take over the investigation. But they have to find out what took place so it doesn't happen again. I mean, clearly a gunman to be able to get that close to a protectee and actually wound that individual, there's just no excuse for it.Something broke down and the more we find out about things like seeing a suspicious person. I mean, did anybody make physical contact with this individual? How did he get on the roof? And then there's one report that there was a cop up there who looked after he saw the individual. Who that is, I don't know. But the bottom line is, something broke down and they got to find out and find out quickly. Tomorrow starts the RNC, a month later, you got the DNC, and in between, you're going to have a former president, a current president, and both their vice presidents out actively campaigning.

I had been consistent and it's difficult to talk about this now because there was an assassination, but a consistent in that the divisions that we have which are natural part of our democracy historic cannot be extended to violence.And in other words, that cannot be a natural extension of our politics. We, I'm just quoting the FBI, we have seen the rise of exceptionally challenging times for public officials, in particular judges, secretaries of state, in terms of right-wing focus on them, and then as we've seen with the Supreme Court, Congress, and now former president Trump, violence against them. This sort of permissiveness that has become part of the way we talk as a nation. It's not sustainable as a democracy. I'm going to be it entirely clear here. We have got to stop this permissiveness of the use of language because even if the speaker doesn't mean it, clearly people are hearing it as a permission structure. And so that, you know, look, I agree with Chief Ramsey like something went terribly wrong in terms of communication, in terms of planning, in terms of all sorts of aspects of law enforcement.

So it was really not a convention at all in the traditional sense. He gave a speech on the South Lawn of the White House. But you'll remember eight years ago in Cleveland at that convention, there were many Republicans who were not with him, who were not on board with him. This is an entirely different moment. So he is calling the shots here. But his advisers say that he will be coming here spending the weekend. And of course, he is going to be announcing his vice presidential running mate. That could come as early as tomorrow. Of course, the timing is his choice. But that is going to be one of the biggest decisions of course he makes as the presumptive nominee. By the end of this week he will be the nominee. So, Erin, I think we'll just have to watch very carefully. Of course, there are limits to how much some Republicans and Democrats want to talk about unity. They are dug in here and it is a brutal campaign. But I think the direction from the top, what Donald Trump says, what he does will be very instructive to what type of campaign he thinks he can run from here forward and if it is a moment to try and win over some of those voters who up until now have been skeptical of him -- Erin.",

It may be too much reliance on state and locals and their determination is it -- is it just, you know, that they think, well, if we have a counter-sniper, it's going to be okay. There's lots of things that you can do before you get to that moment, including security the building, so that its not it seemed like it was relatively easy access for him. So, I'm actually not looking at Saturday. I'm looking at, you know, Monday and Tuesday of last week when there really tightening the security around that area.",

And you know, Wolf, I think it's interesting as we're waiting getting them here any moment, we know that the purpose of this press conference is to talk about security at the RNC in light of what happened yesterday. But, obviously, there are reporters in that room, Shimon is one of them, our Shimon Prokupecz. And they are going to have a lot of questions, right? We've just gotten this reporting that a local -- local law enforcement yesterday had seen the shooter, had told Secret Service about it. We don't know what happened then. There are so many questions that even in the context of a press conference extensively about security at the RNC, there's going to be questions, a lot of them about what happened yesterday, Wolf.",

But more importantly, I think will be for all of us to hear their answers if they do answer questions and we're told they will be taking questions from reporters, including our own Shimon Prokupecz who's there getting ready to ask questions? The answers to what happened yesterday, the assassination attempt. This will be the first time that the Secret Service will be answering questions. We hope about what happened and what didn't happen, what the Secret Service did, right? What potentially they did wrong? There'll be an enormous amount of questions. There's high interest rate now in what happened yesterday, was there a major intelligence blunder on the part of the Secret Service? So those questions will be really significant, and we'll see how that goes at this briefing that is about to begin, Erin. All of us are waiting anxiously. Yesterday, there was a briefing. The FBI was there, Pennsylvania state police were there. The Secret Service didn't show up for that briefing, which raised enormous amount of questions in my mind as someone who's covered these issues for a long time, why was that the Secret Service there. They are now getting ready. We hope to answer some questions. We'll see how they do.",

There's going to be an investigation and everything that happened.But as you point out an investigation is one thing and important hearings obviously could be important but what also matters is what we find out now, not finding out in months from now. You know, there are real questions, obviously. The numbers we've talked about, Wolf, 150 yards away in terms of where that sniper had located himself from where the former president of the United States was. And all of this, Wolf, the context is, of course, the president's okay, another person died. People are seriously injured, and they have to answer the question of nobody wants to be in the situation of saying, well, we got lucky, right? They got lucky that shot didn't hit.",

That there was someone there with a weapon, an AR style type of rifle, and what are the Secret Service do if anything? And there were other reports that even law enforcement local law enforcement were alerting the Secret Service to a potential threat from that rooftop location. And apparently not enough was done in advance to protect the former president and others who were there, who were gathered at this political rally.

We as a city cannot legislate out of that, and our mayor wants to speak on any more in regards to that. And so, we in regards to our law enforcement has to say, we'd have to operate within those guidelines. Unless there's something that is against state law, we have to respect Second Amendment right to carry your firearm, especially in regards to open carry or carry or conceal if you're licensed. And so that is a -- again, issue that we have to navigate and I will say this and I've said this many times as that is your right, please exercise your right in a responsible manner, please ensure that the behaviors that we would like to see for those with that responsibility aligns with our responsibility.
