      "sentences": "Hello and a warm welcome to our viewers joining us in the United States and around the world. I'm Anna Coren sitting in for Max Foster.Just ahead, extreme weather in the U.S. with fires, floods, mudslides and a tropical storm. We'll tell you when there will be a break from the record-breaking heat. Plus, U.S. President Joe Biden and Donald Trump will meet face-to-face one week from today for the first presidential debate. We'll show you how the two candidates are preparing for the event. And Russian President Vladimir Putin touches down in Vietnam just hours after signing a mutual defense pact with North Korea. It's Thursday, June 20th, 4 p.m. here in Hong Kong, 3 a.m. on the southern Gulf Coast of Texas, where more than two million people are under a tornado watch right now due to Tropical Storm Alberto. The National Hurricane Center says Alberto has been strengthening and will continue to bring heavy rains, coastal flooding and gusty winds along the coasts of Texas and northeastern Mexico through the day today. Flash flood warnings are also up in some areas. Storm surge combined with the tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded. And mudslides are also possible, especially in higher terrains across northeast Mexico. The center of the storm is about 120 miles east-southeast of Tampico, Mexico, and is expected to make landfall near there in the coming hours. The winds have knocked out power to more than 10,000 customers in Texas. That's according to poweroutage.us. And Texas Governor Greg Abbott has issued a disaster declaration for 51 counties impacted by the tropical storm. Well, meantime, extreme heat is still posing a threat to other parts of the U.S. CNN meteorologist Chad Myers has the latest forecast. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CHAD MYERS, CNN METEOROLOGIST: It sure would be nice to get some of those rains here from parts of Texas into New Mexico where the fires are. And yes, we will see a few scattered showers here, but really more we're going to get will be the wind. We're going to see winds 20 to 25 miles per hour in areas where the fires are. Now, the wind is from an opposite direction that could put firefighters in some danger but also could push the fires back onto areas that have already burned. But you never like to see 20 to 30 mile per hour winds over a fire zone. I'd like to see some wind here in the east, maybe blowing this heat away for a change or at least giving you a wind chill factor, which certainly won't be the case. Again, we're talking about heat index. About 260 million people or more going to see temperatures above 90 over the next few days. Maybe not every day, but certainly you will. There's where the heat will be for today, a little bit farther toward the west tomorrow, and really just expanding toward even D.C. by the weekend where temperatures will be almost 100 degrees. And that's not heat index, that's thermometer. We still have these excessive heat warnings and watches all the way across the U.S. where we're just now seeing just long-duration days where it's day after day over 90 degrees, over 95 degrees in some spots, even New York City today all the way to 92. And if you are not in the wind or if you are in the sunshine or between buildings with the concrete, it will feel warmer than that without a doubt. Today's heat index in Syracuse, a lovely 99 this afternoon. And 99 not with heat index but with the air temperature for D.C. Saturday and for Sunday. A lot of folks going to be doing things out and about in D.C. Make sure you try to stay cool there. Lots of water for you, the pets, the kids, and even the plants because they're going a little bit of water, please. Have a great day. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
