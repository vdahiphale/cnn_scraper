And the vice president has seized on that today, she could do so again tonight in this town hall, the main event is, Jake, you were saying kicks off at nine Eastern -- Jake.

      "sentences": "Well, Jake, as you said, Donald Trump will not be on stage, but he will be at the center of the conversation and he certainly has been really for the last several days as Vice President Harris has been seizing on every remark he made, including talking about the generals. Of course, those new reports in the waning days of this campaign.The vice president has a couple of objectives tonight. Talking to her advisors, they said she still wants to persuade some of those undecided and persuadable voters over to her side. She also wants to motivate some people who are likely to vote for her, but are either have not yet made a plan to do so, or are ambivalent about voting at all. She has 13 days left to do it, even as millions of Americans have voted more than a million here in battleground Pennsylvania, more than 25 million across the country. So her objective is to fill in some of those blanks, really try and close the sale with some of those voters here, but there's no question the former president is at the center of it all. She calls him unhinged. She called him unstable. Millions and hundreds of millions of dollars of television ads are behind a similar message here. We're learning that she's going to be closing next week with a campaign speech on The Ellipse. That of course is the spot just outside the White House, where Donald Trump gave his speech on the morning of January 6, 2021 that led to the attack on the Capitol. So this is now he is central part of her message. The question is, is that going to move voters? So many voters as we travel around are concerned about the economy, they're concerned about immigration, inflation. She is closing, of course, with really drawing sharp distinctions with the former president talking about democracy, abortion rights as well. But tonight, those unscripted questions from those undecided and persuadable voters certainly will be revealing as she tries to fill in some more blanks and get more voters to her side. Advisers believe this is a deadlocked race in all seven battlegrounds, none more important than right here in Pennsylvania -- Jake.",

She's done many of them with CNN. It was a very different kind of town hall when she was doing it in 2019 and running to the left in her primary for the Democrats.But coming out tonight, you how does she handle Donald Trump? How does she handle these questions from the voters that we're talking about that she's trying to reach, that are persuadable that are undecided, and what that looks like. I think the choice to go to The Ellipse is an interesting one because that was of course a day where so many of Donald Trump's, members of his administration, his own cabinet resigned that day. But how this has been remembered now four years later by even those same people is completely different. I mean, Betsy DeVos, who is his Secretary of Education, resigned because of how he acted on January 6th. She was at a donor dinner with him the other night just to give you a window into the insight of how a lot of the Republicans who disavowed him that day have come back into the fold. So how does she handle that in terms of rubbing up the Democratic base and getting them excited, but also seeking to turn out those disaffected Republicans that she has been trying to reach.",

But to your point, Jake, they need to understand that she is a sturdy leader. They want to believe that she can be president, that she can handle what the presidency comes with and there is something about, you know, if you are going to do this, if you're going to create a symbolic moment to show that you are in the space that represents American democracy, that's a good point to make, but she has to convince people that she has the gravitas for the job and for some voters, for all kinds of different reasons, some of them, some of it sexism, some of it is other things, for a lot of voters that is still an unanswered question.

He said, excuse me, but essentially he was attacking, I don't have that quote right in front of me, but essentially he was attacking John Kelly, arguing that he was making these comments because he's fell out of favor with Donald Trump.He claimed that none of this was true. Essentially, everything that we had been hearing, his aides were saying as well. I have some in front of me. So, here's what Trump said. He said, \"Thank you for your support against a total degenerate named John Kelly, who made up a story out of pure Trump derangement syndrome, hatred. This guy had to qualities which don't work well together.\" Again, he went on to attack him as being dumb and other things, but I do want to talk about what's happening here in Georgia tonight, Erin, because there has been some very interesting comments made here tonight. First of all, this is a massive stadium and there have been very high profile speakers that includes people like Tucker Carlson, RFK, Jr., Charlie Kirk, who is the founder of Turning Points Action, who is putting on this rally tonight. You also heard from Tulsi Gabbard and country music star, Jason Aldean. But one thing that is new that I haven't heard us when Tucker Carlson was speaking tonight, he started to say that if Donald Trump were to win, it would be like, \"Daddy's home.\" Daddy is coming home and he said that Trump, like God loves all of his children talking about the mainstream media in his words. And Democrats and said that Trump would need to give them a good spanking. Now, this is something that crowd went wild for here. There are thousands of people here. And when Trump came on stage, as you can see speaking behind me, they started screaming and chanting \"Daddy's home\" and \"Daddy Don.\" So this is something I have not heard at a Trump rally so far, but I can tell you the vibe in the room tonight does almost feel like a mini RNC and we have heard Trump so far. He's just going through his typical stump speech. He's talking about how bad Harris is for the border. He's talking about his record on the economy, but I'm sure were going to hear some of those personal attacks increase any moment now on Harris.

So far, more than 24.7 million Americans have already voted in this year's presidential election, according to data from 47 states and D.C., and we still have just under two weeks to go for early voting. Let's take a closer look here at the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.I know, Jake, that's where you grew up, a place that very well could decide who wins this election. 1.1 million voters have already voted early. 61 percent of those voters are registered Democrats compare with 29 percent of registered Republicans. Overall, the early voting number is down there compared to 2020, and that's the case for registered Democrats, as well as you see here on this pie chart. But when it comes to registered Republicans, that number is actually up compared to 2020. Now, Pennsylvania won't start processing mail-in ballots until Election Day, but election officials I've been speaking with there are optimistic. We're going to find out sooner than in 2020 when it took five days. I spoke to Philadelphia City Commissioner before coming on, and he told me that new technology to open ballot envelopes more quickly, combined with fewer mail-in ballots this cycle, will lead to a faster count in Pennsylvania's largest city, Jake.",

Now, Trump appears to be encouraging it, saying in an interview earlier today that he will be voting early himself and his running mate, Senator J.D. Vance also said today that if Republicans don't vote early and by mail, they're going to \"Get killed at the ballot box.\"So, we can't say for sure if that rhetoric is behind more early voting in some battleground states like Wisconsin, where on its first day, today, the numbers exceeded the first day of early voting compared to 2020. The Elections Commission says more than 97,000 people voted compared to more than 75,000 in 2020. We should know -- we don't have the party breakdown in Wisconsin, and just like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin won't start processing those mail-in ballots until the morning of Election Day, Jake.",

As Pam just noted, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and you know this, all of us know this from past elections, but it's Jake Tapper's birthplace, it matters the most. So where are we right now? Let's just tap down in here.We're in Delaware County. Joe Biden won 63 percent of the vote here, right? These suburbs, when I started doing this, used to be Republican or Republican leaning. They are safe blue territory now, but watch this number on election night, right? In the first election in the suburbs, post the Dobbs decision, does Donald Trump improve his standing in the suburbs? Let's say Donald Trump doesn't have to improve his standing in the suburbs a lot. Look at 2016, 37.2. You say, oh, John, that's just a point. That's just a point, yeah. But a point here and a point or two there makes a difference. Donald Trump needs to improve his standing in the suburbs to have a chance to win the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Vice President Harris, the flip side, if you're going to lose a little bit in urban areas, maybe black men goes down a little bit, maybe Latino men goes down a little bit. Can you boost it in the suburbs in the first post-Roe election? This place and this race is a defining challenge. So where does that matter when you come out to this map? It all matters because as we know, as we come to the race for 270, and we can get into this more throughout the night and the next 12 days, here's where they are right now. 226, safe we believe for Harris. 219, safe for Trump. Well, of all the yellow states, the battlegrounds, this Pennsylvania is the biggest prize, 19 electoral votes. If Harris can do that, and that Michigan, and that Wisconsin, just hold the blue wall, she is most likely the next president of the United States. So, this is the biggest prize. If Donald Trump gets this, it makes her math a lot more complicated, his math a lot more easy. So Pennsylvania is the biggest price, which is why she agreed to do the Town Hall here, which is why both campaigns are spending more money here than any other state. There's other ways to get there, but if you're trying to get to 270, getting that 19 is huge.",

This is room full of people who say that they are undecided and persuadable in Pennsylvania and they are there waiting to be with the vice president at CNN's Town Hall. With me now is Pete Buttigieg, and I should note he is here in his personal capacity as a surrogate for the Harris campaign. And I appreciate your time, sir.So, what do you make of the fact that Vice President Harris has the stage to herself tonight, right? We had hoped this would be a debate between her and former President Trump, and of course, then perhaps that there would be a Town Hall with President Trump after the vice president. But, she is the one who accepted the invitations to both, so she is there alone. What do you think the significance of that is for her? PETE BUTTIGIEG, (D) UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION AND FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, the significance of it is that, clearly, he does not want to have to compete with her in a debate and he does not want to have to explain in a Town Hall environment his unpopular positions. Remember just about everything he's about, his proposal for tax cuts for the rich, his proposal for tariffs that would increase the prices that families pay, the fact that every woman in America had their national right to choose taken away by Donald Trump, any of the Project 2025 agenda, this is really unpopular stuff. So I'm not completely surprised that he pulled out of what was supposed to be a debate tonight. I mean, look, he won't even go on CNBC, let alone \"60 Minutes.\" She's of course doing the opposite, finding voters anywhere she can, talking to everybody from Fox News to 'Charlamagne tha God.' And I think she's going to have a great opportunity tonight as well to demonstrate that while you have one candidate who is focused on himself, you got another candidate in the Vice president who is focused on voters, on the American people, on our everyday lives.
