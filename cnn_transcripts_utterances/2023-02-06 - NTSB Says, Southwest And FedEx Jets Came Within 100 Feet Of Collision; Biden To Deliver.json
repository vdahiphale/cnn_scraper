We have a lot to talk about.We are one night away from what will be the unofficial kickoff of Joe Biden's likely re-election run, also known as his state of the union address. What case will he make to the nation to elect him to a second term? A lot of political types think it's not just what he says, it's how he appears. President Biden would be 82 if he wins re-election. He's already the oldest American president ever. Is that why so many people are still on the fence? Plus, LeBron James is on his way to breaking the NBA's all-time scoring record. Remember when he was advised to just shut up and dribble? He did not take that advice. Now, he's just 36 points shy of Lakers legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's record. We will talk about it.

You still have to make your decisions.The only thing I think could have happened here is the air traffic controller as Southwest to takeoff and Southwest took a little longer than normal to actually hit the guns and go. So, that could've caused the timing to be off. But it should never have been that close in the first place.

I think the bigger question for him is how does he approach? Does he approach this as a launch for his 2024 presidential campaign? And if so, what is he running on? He has benefited I think largely, politically, for a few years now from instead of telling people what he's for, proving to people who he is not.

I'd lean into it and say, we have got a lot of work to do. I would also, to John's point, keep making the contrast, because the threat is still inside the House.

As you said, she will -- she is so gracious, she is so graceful and she is the queen, and that is just the way it's going to be. And I'll tell you, it was amazing to see her. I mean, she's got, you know, sports are objective, right? We could be objective. We could talk about Jordan has got six, Lebron has got four.
