(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Israel says after two months of fighting, it is still battling Hamas in two different strongholds in northern Gaza where militants have held out but Israel claims they are now on the verge of being dismantled. One area is the Jabalia refugee camp, where residents said dozens of civilians were killed over the weekend. Since the fragile week long pause in the fighting ended, Israel has pounded the Gaza Strip and focused on the south in Khan Yunis, the second largest city there where Israel believes senior Hamas leaders may be hiding. As Israel expands its operations, the number of civilians killed and wounded grows. The entire house fell on my head and I was pulled from underneath the rubble, this woman said. We would have been better off dead with my children rather than living in this grim reality. An urgent appeal was issued by the IDF this weekend for even more civilians to evacuate parts of Khan Yunis, but it's unclear how many would have heard the orders. And it isn't a guarantee of safety or shelter, medicine, food and water, which are all in short supply. We were displaced from the north to the south for safety. But there is no safety in the South, this woman said. It has led to deteriorating chaotic scenes. The United Nations Secretary General warning the public order will completely break down soon.",

Good morning to you, Elliot.So, what is the latest on the fighting in northern Gaza and also Israel's military presence at the Jabalia refugee camp? ELLIOTT GOTKINE, JOURNALIST: Rosemary, as Alex was noting in his report there, the focus in recent days seems to have been on the second city of the Gaza Strip, Khan Yunis, in the southern part of the enclave as Israel expand its ground operations. But the job is still not done as far as Israel's concerned. In the northern part of the Gaza Strip, particularly when it comes to Jabalia and Shuja'iya which Israel describes as Hamas strongholds. Now, what we heard yesterday from Israel's defense minister, Yoav Gallant is that Israel is encircling those two places. At the same time, Gallant talking about Hamas battalions being on the verge of dismantling, adding in his words, the number of those who surrender that come out of these places shows us what is happening. And he was talking about Hamas fighters complaining that they were running out of food, that they were running out of weapons and he called on those who are still holding out to lay down their weapons if they want to spare their lives. So, fighting continuing there in the north as well. At the same time, the last half hour or so, the IDF saying that in one of its raids in the Gaza Strip yesterday, discovered around 250 rockets, rocket propelled grenades and shells which were ready to be used against Israel. And of course, all the while this is going on, we know that the United Nations General Assembly is due to hold a vote, it won't be legally binding like the U.N. Security Council vote last week that was vetoed by the United States. But it will is expected to gain overwhelming support and to be more or less along the same lines calling for this humanitarian ceasefire to happen. And of course, at the same time as all, that is going on. We know that Kerem Shalom and which is the southernmost entry between Israel and the Gaza Strip. And also, Nitzana, which is about 50 kilometers to the south, are due to be open today to allow for more screening and security checks of humanitarian aid to in Israel's words, double the volume of aid that can go into the Gaza Strip, but it was also at pains to point out that no aid will be going into the Gaza Strip directly from Israel. And that may well be because the person that oversees COGAT, which is the Israeli body that oversees the Israeli occupied West Bank in terms of civilian matters and the Gaza Strip is Bezalel Smotrich, who is the finance minister and also heads up the religious Zionism party, one of the most right-wing members of the Israel's governing coalition, Rosemary.",

Well, in current emissions cuts, we're nowhere close to getting to those targets.

Now, a spokeswoman for Alexei Navalny, she said that he was supposed to show up for a video link hearing today from the jail that he's being kept in so far with a court and that he simply didn't show up for that hearing. Now, when Alexei Navalny's lawyer asked what was going on, they were apparently initially told that there had been power issues at the jail where he was. However, upon further questioning, the authorities at that prison called the IK-6 prison, which is about 150 miles to the east of Moscow said that he simply wasn't on their list anymore of prisoners who are inside that jail. Now, upon hearing this, the legal team then went on to ask other jails whether or not Alexei Navalny was there and all of them said that he simply wasn't. So as of right now, Alexei Navalny remains missing as far as his foundation is concerned and as far as his family is concerned, as well. Now, the big question, of course, is what could have happened to Alexei Navalny, and there's certainly several possibilities that are out there. One of them is that Alexei Navalny apparently was supposed to be transferred to a jail that has an even harsher regime than the one that he's been staying in so far. And it's not uncommon within the Russian prison system for prisoners who are in that transfer phase, that they are out of communication, that they're not allowed to communicate. In fact, that's something that happened to Alexei Navalny, when he was taken to the prison that he's been in so far in 2022. However, the Anti-Corruption Foundation also says that Alexei Navalny has been having some serious health issues as of recently that for instance, last week, he fainted inside his jail cell and had to be given an I.V. The other thing that the associates of Alexei Navalny are also looking at is the fact that his disappearance right now within the Russian jail system comes just at this almost the same time that Vladimir Putin has announced that he will run again in the upcoming Russian presidential election.
