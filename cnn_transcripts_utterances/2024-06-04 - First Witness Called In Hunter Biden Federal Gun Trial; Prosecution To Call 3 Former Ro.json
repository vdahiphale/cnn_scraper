He said, quote, \"For the first time in American history, a former president that is convicted -- a convicted felon is now seeking the office of the presidency. But as disturbing as that is, more damaging is the all-out assault Donald Trump is making on the American system of justice.\"I want to bring in Dan Pfeiffer. He's a former senior advisor to President Obama, author of \"Message Box Newsletter\" and co-host of Pod Save America. Another person with a lot of jobs. I feel like I have a lot of guests who have a lot of jobs on lately. Dan, thanks so much for joining me. First question is about what President Biden said at that fundraiser last night. Is that the kind of message that he should continue to sharpen? How much should he focus on this conviction over the next five months?",

It's been sort of baked into the cake for a long time. For 80 percent of voters, they made the decision years ago.But the polling has shown -- and CNN polling in particular has shown that there is a swath of voters, a pretty significant swath of voters, who are, you know, concerned about the idea of sending a convicted felon back to the White House. And so, this is a moment when people are paying attention to this election. And so he should be doing what he can to shape it, to sort of flesh that choice out for voters, to give some of those voters who may not be in love with either candidate, pause about going back to Trump. I think it's the right thing to do. And I'm glad that he is doing it.",

One, David is exactly right that for most voters, inflation and abortion and issues like that are incredibly important.So he cannot see the ground on those. I just believe that in this moment, in this media environment where it's so hard to get people's attention, when something pops out of the hermetically sealed bubbles that most people live in, that's the time to shape it, right, and to talk about it. And so that doesn't mean he should put aside all the economic events, all the inflation, stop talking about the real threat to democracy in reproductive freedom that Trump presents. But we should be -- should Trump is out there shaping it, the right wing media is out there shaping it. Joe Biden should do it, too, because we know there are voters who care about this, and we want them to think about it from our perspective, not Trump's.",

You're looking at me, I can take you too.\"Question, \"Did you consider not running again because of your age?\" Biden, \"No, I didn't.\" Question, \"And what do you say to Americans who are worried about it?\" Biden, \"Watch me. Look, name me a president that's gotten as much done as I've gotten done in my first three and a half years.\" If he called you up and said, tell me how to deal with this issue, would you say, do that, do what he just did in that interview, or would you say, maybe you should tweak it, Mr. President?",

That second debate's going to be huge.Using the huge amounts of money his campaign is raised to run ads showing him speaking to voters is going to help, but he's going to have to be aggressive about it. No doubt. I think his campaign is pretty clear about that. Because if you really think about like, what an aggressive move for an incumbent president to try to have a debate as early as June in the election cycle, right? That is a sign that they know that -- they want voters to see the president in a moment to make the vast majority of voters who aren't paying attention yet tune in.

It's just critically important we rebuke extremists that some would have take over the Democratic Party.\" Left on said is that the district Mondaire Jones wants to represent has one of the largest Jewish communities in the country. My panel is back. This is really -- it really does spotlight what is happening in the Democratic Party for a whole host of reasons. I mean, if you just go back, not that far to 2020, Jamaal Bowman, Mondaire Jones, they were both elected in neighboring districts in New York. They were the first black men to represent parts of Westchester County. They both defeated Democratic incumbents. And now there's this massive split.",

And right now, I think Gaza is driving that kind of question is, is where, who are you kind of placing blame with? Where, who are you kind of launching criticism with?And Bowman has let that charge. But we should also say to your point about the side note here is that Mondaire Jones is doing this for Mondaire Jones. This is helpful for him politically. And I think specifically he's been someone since 2020 who's taken a couple interesting changes. He was someone who was saying words like defund the police and then backed off. He's, you know, kind of had a hot and cold relationship with the progressive movement. Now, Bowman has stood firm, but that's cost him some political allies. And so I think we've seen there Mondaire kind of following the political winds on this question, but from Ritchie Torres to Jamaal Bowman to AOC, we have seen this issue certainly split specifically New York Democrats.",
