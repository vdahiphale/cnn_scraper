I'm Abby Phillip in Washington, where today cameras captured what might be the final chapter in a truly American story. A June jury sentenced the man once known as America's mayor to what is essentially a financial death penalty. Rudy Giuliani is now on the hook for $148 million, $148 million for the harm that he caused to two women, Shaye Moss and Ruby Freeman. Moss and Freeman are the Georgia election workers whose lives were forever altered after Giuliani made them the crux of a nonsense voter fraud conspiracy. Now, the sheer size of this penalty is really stunning, $16 million for defaming Freeman, $16 million for defaming Moss, $40 million for emotional distress to both women, and $75 million in punitive damages. Now, just moments following the verdict, the two women thanked the jury, but they said that today's result does not atone for two years of turmoil. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

MARCUS CHILDRESS, FORMER JAN. 6TH COMMITTEE INVESTIGATIVE COUNSEL: Yes, this was all about accountability, accountability for democracy, accountability for the big lie that Mr. Giuliani was so central to spreading. But like Ms. Moss and Ms. Freeman said today, this isn't making them whole. In fact, it's still super sad to hear what they're having to go through. When they testified to our committee, they talked about how they received threats, such as, you're lucky it's 2020 instead of 1920, right? Those are threats filled with racism and bigotry that Mr. Giuliani is at the central of spreading, of amplifying. And so while I'm happy with the verdict here today, this doesn't make them whole.

He has done this all himself, and this is complete self-destruction. And here's the thing. He's going to think that Donald Trump is going to help him out. Donald Trump will not return his phone calls, pay his bills, will not pass, go and collect $200 for Rudy Giuliani. He is not going to get anything out of Donald Trump.

That was feeding his base, saying, treat them like dogs. But today, our justice system did right by them. And money doesn't make you whole, but it does tell other people -- and I don't think Rudy is by himself on this. There's a whole lot of folks, particularly folks who came to the Capitol on January 6th, and said that they believed the lie, but it must stop. And if they won't stop the words, then the justice system has to stop it for them. I am humbled to have heard the stories of those two women and I hope other people who are election workers and who are poll workers stay the course and realize that the system will protect you.

There are also individual plaintiffs. There are shareholder lawsuits.Already, we've seen Trump's allies have to pay more than a billion dollars, if you count today's judgment, which Rudy can't afford, but if you add it all together, more than a billion dollars in legal fees and fines and settlements related to Trump's big lie of 2020. So, you have this incredible, you know, track record that's been that's been produced here and we're only at the very early stages, as you all were just talking about, the criminal cases being another. So, your question, does this affect the folks who are out there peddling, does this affect the smear merchants who are out there? I think in some cases, yes, around the margins They'll be a little more careful next time. If Trump loses the election next year, they'll be a little more careful in the way that they smear certain individuals. They might not use certain companies' names out loud. But this playbook, right, of still denying reality, it will continue, right, Abby, because this isn't just political, it's psychological in nature. This is about people's psychological needs. And that's why I think today's verdict, today's ruling, it was a plea for civility and sanity There's a quiet majority in this country that does not want to put up with this anymore, that does not want to be lied to.

Fox says that's crazy, but that's heading toward trial in 2025.Fox would love to settle and make that go away, but Smartmatic is busy deposing people like Rupert Murdoch, trying to get even deeper into what went wrong in 2020. So, the fact this is all going to play out through the 2024 election, you know, it is a remarkable thing and it might cause some people around the edges to be a little more careful. You know, Moss and Freeman, they're still suing a far right blog alleging defamation against the site called the Gateway Pundit. So, they are still seeking justice in other forums as well.
