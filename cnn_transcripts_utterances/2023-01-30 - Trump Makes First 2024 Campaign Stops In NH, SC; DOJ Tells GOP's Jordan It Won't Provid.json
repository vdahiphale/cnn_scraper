They want to see if there's a better alternative early on, and it's very early on still. Ron DeSantis, you know, has taken the spot as that guide. But there is only one announced candidate, and we are seeing a flip flop of the dynamics.The last time around, in 2016, where the primary was underway and Trump came late to the game and, you know, down an escalator, and there it is.

And the Justice Department is doing what its role is, which is to try to firewall off the stuff that's truly sensitive and that if it got into the wrong hands and became politicized, could actually jeopardize, right, their investigation. I would say two differences, one, we know, I think, a lot more about the documents in Donald Trump's possession because of the warrants. We know almost nothing publicly. The public knows almost nothing about the Biden documents. So there is a public desire, I think, to have at least a basic understanding of what some of that is.
