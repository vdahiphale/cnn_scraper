Air raid sirens ring through the Ukrainian night, as Russia loves artillery, drones and missiles at every corner of the country. That as the United States delivers a public warning to China, do not dispatch weapons to Vladimir Putin.Plus, the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee thinks she can get Donald Trump to put pen to paper and say yes to supporting the party's 2024 nominee, even if it's not him. And new intelligence pushes the energy department to change its view of how the COVID pandemic began. The agency now believes the virus leaked from a Chinese lab. Up first for us this hour though, turnover and triage in Ukraine. Today, a shakeup at the top of Ukraine's military ranks. President Zelenskyy dismissing the commander of joint force operations. Mr. Zelenskyy did not explain why or why now, as this leadership shuffle collides with a new Russian offensive. Overnight, a staggered drone assault, 14 Iranian made unmanned attack aircraft buzzing over Kyiv. Ukrainian air defenses say, they shot down 11 of those drones. In Ukraine south and east, Moscow trying to fracture the line, Russia launching 81 artillery strikes over the last 24 hours. Russia hopes the bombing frenzy chokes off Ukrainian forces in and around Bakhmut and breaks the battlefield stalemate. Let's begin in eastern Ukraine, with CNN's Alex Marquardt with the latest from the battlefield. Alex?",

As we focus on the fighting in the east, we have also been reminded that Russia continues to try to bomb cities all across Ukraine with drones. Overnight, at least two people killed in the city of Khmelnytskyi. That is in southwestern Ukraine very far from the frontline. They were both first responders who were responding to an earlier strike by a drone, a so-called double tap attack.Then there were some 11 drones that were sent over Kyiv, nine of those shot down. There were sent in at least two waves, and the air raid sirens in Kyiv ringing out for some five and a half hours. Reminder that even as life continues relatively normally, in many cities all across the country, there is the constant possibility that those cities may be attacked by drone. But the fierce is fighting, John, is taking place in the eastern part of the country, particularly around the eastern city of Bakhmut. It does appear that Russian forces primarily from the Wagner mercenary group are making some progress. They claim that they have taken several villages north of the city as they try to encircle it. Ukrainian forces say that they are standing their ground that they are repelling attacks. We have not heard any talk from the highest levels of the Ukrainian government about surrendering the city, but President Zelenskyy softening his tone on that saying, that he will not defend it at all costs. We're watching that very carefully. At the same time, as this general whose area of command was much of the east, Major General Edward Moskaliov was dismissed by a presidential decree with little explanation from President Zelenskyy's office, John?",

They still are leaning towards that direction, meaning they just feel that they likely fall short of having enough definitive evidence to conclude that in a more robust manner.And as you point out, there's a lot of division over this, particularly within the U.S. intelligence community, which if you go back to 2021, President Biden had put forward a 90-day review from the intelligence community, trying to get to the bottom of figuring out the origin of COVID-19. And really, they fell short of any sort of unanimous decision that would suggest it came from one place over another. And really, we look at the lab leak theory as one location that perhaps this is where it started, and the other is natural, and that would be jumping from animals to humans. It's interesting, having been in Wuhan, as you point out, we've been three times since the start of the outbreak. And one of the things that you can't miss is the amount of security that you encounter when you try to get to places like the Huanan seafood market. That's the place that was deemed the original epicenter of the outbreak where they saw the first number of cases really linked to or if you try to go to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, for example. You will notice it is more heavily secured than perhaps most buildings here in Washington D.C. You have a lot of guards out front and it's heavily fortified. That's the BSL-4, that biosafety-4 lab. We also went to the Wuhan CDC.
