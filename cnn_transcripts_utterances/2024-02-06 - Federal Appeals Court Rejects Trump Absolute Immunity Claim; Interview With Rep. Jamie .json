And later, a jury's verdict on a school shooter's mom and the unprecedented charges against her in connection with his crime. We'll hear from the parents of two of his victims. Good evening. Thanks for joining us. In addition to all of that, there is breaking news from the Capitol as Republicans tried to do something which hasn't been done since 1876, impeach a Cabinet secretary. Their effort and their failure for now just ahead. But first, the other big breaking story out of Washington. Today's court ruling, one which if it stands will be taught in history classes and law schools for generations to come.   A three-judge panel from the DC district federal appeals court rejecting Donald Trump's appeal in the January 6 elections subversion case. Their unanimous decision laying waste to his claim of absolute immunity for crimes he may have committed while in office, especially crimes to help him stay there, unless that is, he had already been impeached and convicted by Congress first, which sounds outlandish even to say now absolute criminal immunity, but it was chilling to hear during oral arguments last month when Judge Florence Pan confronted a Trump attorney with the implications.

It is the first time an appellate court has had occasion to consider the rather extravagant claim that being president puts you above the law, enables you to commit crimes, at least when they are within the outer perimeter of your office.But actually, in Trump's case, he was making even more remarkable claim that he could commit crimes, regardless of whether he was doing it in his official capacity. All of those arguments that he made to put himself above the law, were dismembered piece by piece methodically in this historic opinion, which, as you've indicated, is likely to be studied by law students for generations, especially because there is very little reason for the US Supreme Court to weigh in.",

There is no reason for it to review.If it were, as I said, to decide to review the case, it could put it on an accelerated track. Either way, we're going to get an eventual decision in this case, unless the Supreme Court, basically disgracefully just lets it drag out. Now, you know, there are people who thought that the three-judge district or the three-judge Court of Appeals was acting unfairly by letting it drag out just for this month, but I must say, even though I was one of those who was impatient to get the result, it seems to me that it would have been almost humanly impossible to write as careful, thorough, decisive, and bulletproof an opinion as this Court did in less than a month.

Afterwards, some Republicans said it was unwise of House Speaker Mike Johnson to put the bill on the floor without knowing the vote count on their side. Quoting Republican Ralph Norman: \"They're good on the other side of knowing that. Is it that hard?\" The number of votes Republicans can lose increased by one vote in the last moment. That's when Democrat Al Green who was thought to be absent and recovering from surgery was actually wheeled onto the floor. Sources say he wasn't even wearing shoes. Three Republicans joined the no vote, a fourth join the no side to allow the House GOP to bring up the vote again, and more on that in a moment. This was the scene when the final vote was announced.

Jennifer Crumbley was convicted of four counts of involuntary manslaughter, one for each of the students killed by her son at Oxford High School in 2021. Crumbley faces up to 15 years in prison.Prosecutors said she and her husband didn't do enough to properly store the gun they bought for their son just four days before the shooting. The jury forewoman agrees, saying that, quote, \"really hammered at home\" is that the mother was, quote, \"the last adult with the gun.\" The prosecution also claimed Crumbley cared more about her horses and an extramarital affair than getting help for her son's mental health issues. Her husband is expected to go on trial for the same charges next month. Joining me tonight are Steve St. Juliana and Buck Myre. Steve is the father of 14-year-old Hana St. Juliana, the youngest victim. She was on the school's basketball team. Buck is the father of 17-year-old Tate Myre, who's remembered as an honor student and a standout athlete. Steve, I'm wondering what your reaction to the verdict is. STEVEN ST.

If he wins South Carolina, a lot of people think this one is over. So you mentioned the polls.Let me just pop the state. The most recent poll showed Trump ahead by about 25 points. So what Haley has to do is change the electorate, there's no voter registration in South Carolina. So Democrats, Independents, Republicans, anyone can vote if you're a registered voter in the primary. The problem for her is it's never happened before. It tends to be a very conservative electorate. What do I mean by that? This is from the Washington Post-Monmouth University poll taken just a little more than a week ago. Forgive me for turning my back. 57 percent of those who say they are likely to vote in the South Carolina Republican primary, 57 percent of them say Joe Biden was elected because of fraud. That's simply not true. Simply not true, but that's what they believe. [20:55:09] Nearly -- so it's nearly 6 in 10 of the people who say they're going to vote in two weeks say Joe Biden shouldn't be president. Guess what? 85 percent of those back Trump over Haley. So if it's almost 60 percent of the electorate and more than 8 in 10 back Trump, you can see right there, the huge advantage he has in what used to be, as you noted earlier, Haley's first state. Here's another thing. She needs to change the composition of the electorate, get more moderates, more Democrats, more independents to vote. But right now, she's not doing that. In Iowa, 55 percent of the voters there identified themselves as white evangelicals. In New Hampshire, it was only 19 percent. Remember, that's where Haley did, at least, in the 40s. South Carolina looks a lot like Iowa. 54 percent of the voters who say they're likely to vote describe themselves as white evangelicals, and look what happens. Trump gets nearly 70 percent of that vote, Anderson, to 22 percent for Haley. So, she has two weeks, but she has to completely change the composition of the electorate. We've heard candidates in past years say, I'm going to do that, I'm going to do that. John McCain said it back against George W. Bush. It simply has not happened in the past. And remember, she last ran a decade ago, as I said. In 2016, Trump won all but two. All but two. Back in 2016, when he was brand new, when he was less known, he won all but two of the 46 counties. This state is even more Trumpy now. And he did pretty good back then.",
