It is Monday, May 6th, 9 a.m. here in London, 11 a.m. in Rafah, where the Israeli military is urging people in parts of eastern Rafah to evacuate.And as you can see in this video, from a short while ago, some people are already fleeing the area. An IDF spokesman says people will have days at least to evacuate and it affects about 100,000 people. The IDF posted this map on social media today, telling people in the area marked in red to move to the area marked in yellow. There are well over a million Palestinians taking refuge there from the fighting. That's five times Rafah's pre-war population. Experts fear a potential IDF ground offensive in the southern Gaza city could lead to many civilian deaths. On Sunday, Israel's defense minister told IDF troops to expect intense action in Rafah in the near future. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YOAV GALLANT, ISRAELI DEFENSE MINISTER (through translator): We identified alarming signs that Hamas actually does not intend to go to any agreement with us. This means we will start military actions in Rafah and the entire Gaza Strip in the very near future. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "It does. There are several ways to look at this. This looks and feels like every other military operation that Israel has gone through with inside of Gaza over the last six months.They tell a small area of people to move what they're actually describing not as a safe area, as a safer area. And when people move to those areas, they're often not safe. They're often still killed in airstrikes and bombings. These areas are supposed to be humanitarian zones where people are supposed to be safe and have food supplies and water supplies. That's not what they're going to get in these safe areas. U.N. agencies say that there are shortages of water. There isn't enough water in those areas to be told to move to. But is this actually the Rafah offensive? We don't know. As you rightly say, the Israeli government has been talking about this. The prime minister talked about it again last night, saying that we can't leave Hamas battalions in their tunnels there. They've always said that they intended to go in there. And they tend to start in small district neighborhoods, as it is, 12 different sort of residential blocks of housing. That's not just the original housing, but obviously all those displaced Palestinians as well, telling them to go to this expanded safe area now that stretches further north and east than it did before. But the Israeli forces have been preparing and getting ready for this possible offensive for some time, and Hamas appeared to hit a number of them in a rocket strike, killing three soldiers just outside the southern part of Gaza yesterday. So it does seem as if, from a military perspective and a Hamas perspective, that this could be the beginning of the next substantial phase of the military operation in Gaza.",

Officials in Kyiv and human rights officers believe thousands of Ukrainian civilians are being detained in prisons deep inside Russian territory. Some family members are doing what they can to find answers and bring their loved ones home.CNN investigative producer Katie Polglase brings us the story. (END VIDEOTAPE) YULIA KHRYPUN, FATHER DETAINED IN RUSSIA (through translated text): My father turned 48 in captivity. On February 22, before the full-scale invasion, he went to work. He was supposed to stay there for a week, but he hasn't returned from there yet, because he is now in captivity. KATIE POLGLASE, CNN INVESTIGATIVE PRODUCER (voice-over): Yulia is one of many people in Ukraine desperately seeking information about their relatives. Since Russia's full-scale invasion of the country, thousands of civilians are believed to have been taken and held in detention, the Ukrainian government says. Yulia's father, Sergei, is one of them. KHRYPUN (through translated text): I know that where he worked, on that territory, there were Russian rear serviceman. On March 24, at about 10 o'clock, he called me and told me that there were two new cars driving around the village and that he didn't know these servicemen. I asked him if everything was OK. He said, \"Yes, we are sitting.\" I told him to stay, don't come out. He said, \"fine.\" It seems to me that at that moment he already knew that he would be taken away. That was our last conversation we had. POLGLASE (voice-over): Yulia's father is now thought to be held in a detention facility in Kamensk-Shakhtinsky. But due to legal black holes, the chances of his release are slim. KHRYPUN (through translated text): From the very beginning the answers were just a set of words, a set of laws that were completely irrelevant. From the very beginning, they had no understanding   of civilian hostages and that someone could enquire about them. POLGLASE (voice-over): International laws prohibit warring parties from detaining civilians unless there is a serious security reason for it. Ukraine's human rights commissioner says that Russia is pressuring Ukraine to recognize detained civilians as prisoners of war and exchange them for captured Russian soldiers. This is not something Ukraine is willing to do because it would put more Ukrainians in occupied areas at risk. Russian authorities have not responded to CNN's requests for comment. Yulia and another relative of a detainee decided to set up a civic organization to raise awareness about the issue and to help them get better access to officials. Now they hold regular meetings with the coordination headquarters for the treatment of prisoners of war and the ombudsman's office. In the face of uncertainty, memories of her father help Yulia stay strong. KHRYPUN (through translated text): It was evening, and my father came home and brought Darla, the cat. Of course, she reminds (me of my father). (END VIDEOTAPE) FOSTER: CNN's Ivana Kottasova has reported extensively on missing Ukrainians. She joins me now from Prague. First of all, Ivana, if I could just ask you about the, you know, the news that we've had, these increased strikes.

And it's obviously even worse for the families who are, you know, trying to find their loved ones who are lost somewhere in Russia. Most of the time, the only information they can get is from eyewitnesses who were detained in the same locations, in the same facilities, in the same prisons, who are then released, come back to Ukraine, and then give information to the families of their former fellow prisoners. But there is absolutely no confirmation and no official information from Russia. We've been told about cases where there would be a public trial, so Russia would hold a trial, it would publish photographs from the trial, and yet at the same time, it would tell the family of the person who is on trial that they don't know where they are, they have no information about it. So Russia is really tight-lipped on this, and it's just adding to the desperation of these families -- Max.",
