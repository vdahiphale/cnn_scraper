      "sentences": "Yeah, of course, Kim. So the fact that Japan's GDP is now the fourth largest in the world is very significant, and it's a reflection of Japan's changing demographics. So as we know, Japan is facing a demographic crisis.Over 10 percent of its population is over the age of 80, and nearly a third of the country is 65 and above, which is of retirement age. Now, what this means for the country is that it's less productive. There are less people making money in the country, less people spending money in the country. So naturally, the GDP shrinks and shrinks. Now according to the latest government data from the Japanese government, the 2023 nominal GDP in Japan was 4.2 trillion U.S. dollars. Comparing that to Germany that was 4.4 trillion U.S. dollars so naturally Germany is now the third largest economy in the world. Now I've been living in Japan for over three years and the fact that it's a super age society I mean it's very obvious if you go to the doctor's office for instance most other patients are elderly people, beauty salons, on the street, wherever you go really, it's a constant reminder. And these demographic changes that we've been seeing in the last 10 to 15 years are reasons for Japan's shrinking GDP. But it's not the only factor. We're also seeing that currency developments, currency movements are reasons for Japan's GDP getting smaller and smaller. So as we know the GDP is calculated in dollar terms and right now the Japanese Yen is very weak. Last year on average, it was about 141 Japanese Yen to the dollar. 10 years ago, it was 80 Yen to the dollar. Now, the third and final factor affecting Japan's GDP is also to do with private consumption. So less people in Japan are spending money, which means that private consumption went down 0.2 percent in the last quarter. So all these factors, Kim, affecting Japan's GDP, it's now the fourth largest in the world.",

Average Haitians are fed up holding anti-government protests and calling for new elections last week. The violence is driven by rival gangs which clash over territory.

They have not presented a security plan. They have not presented anything that looks like something to move forward with the youth. Haiti is two-thirds of the population is under 24 years old.
