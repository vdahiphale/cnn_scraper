And it's going to serve as an alternative to the SAT And ACT tests.The new entrance exam is popular among Christian schools and conservative political groups. But it's been criticized by educators as being narrowly focused on religion to predict academic success in college. If approved, Florida would become the first state university system to accept the test. It is the latest move by Governor Ron DeSantis to shake up Florida's education system. CNN's Carlos Suarez joins us live from Miami. Carlos, what more can you tell us about this test? And then what happens next?",

      "sentences": "Well, Boris, the governing body for public -- for Florida's public universities will meet, as you noted, come the top of the hour and they are expected to approve the entrance exam, which is used mostly by religious-affiliated colleges.It is important to note that the decision to allow the Classic Learning Test, or the CLT, for use in admissions does not replace the SAT and ACT. The CLT test is rooted in what the organization says is a classical education model that focuses on Western tradition and texts. For example, an example test found on CLT's Web site, students are asked to read and answer questions on John Paul II's on \"The Christian Meaning of Human Suffering.\" The CLT tests grammar, English and math. Now according to the organization, the CLT is currently accepted by more than 250 colleges and universities in the country, including 13 right here in Florida. If approved. Florida will become the first state university system to accept the exam. Now, the SAT and the ACT, of course, are more commonly widely accepted with over 3,000 schools that allow both of these tests when it comes to the admissions process. The CLT, Boris, is also the latest chapter in this ongoing fight between Ron DeSantis and the college board, the organization that administers the SAT and the advanced placement classes, earlier this year. Before the Department of Education blocked a new A.P. course for high school students on African-American studies, saying it violated state law and lacked educational value. Of course, the college board made changes to the course amid the criticism -- Boris?",

To a certain degree, the reaction I got from some former intelligence officials that I spoke to about this was that old line from \"Casablanca,\" \"I'm shocked, shocked to find there's gambling going on here.\" But we have seen in recent years a number of pretty high-profile espionage cases involving Russian agents in the United States. In 2018, the Trump administration kicked out 60 Russian diplomats they identified as intelligence officers, shut down the Russian consulate in Seattle. Earlier this year, the Justice Department, under the Biden administration, announced charges against another Russian national, who had been allegedly collected information from U.S. citizens in the run up to and about the war, the pending Russian invasion of Ukraine. Important -- one other important element that I think Wray touched on is it's not always just traditional intelligence officers they Russia uses. They also use cutouts, like this Mexican citizen that Wray mentioned that was arrested by the United States in 2020 for allegedly assisting Russian intelligence.",

Because they're worried that some of these European intelligence agencies are more porous. At the same time, there's always the assumption that if you've told more than one person, something is going to get out. That's the whole reason between high levels of classification and need-to-know information that is siloed off for certain groups of people. Because humans are going to talk, that's what we do.

He posted an apology saying, quote, \"Emotions got the best of me and I was out of line in the things I said. I support law enforcement as much as anyone can. I was just frustrated in the moment. It was unlike me. I'm just trying the best I can. I love you guys and I'm truly sorry to the officers.\" Also Spain's national prosecutor has filed a sexual assault and coercion complaint against the soccer federation chief. Luis Rubiales is accused of kissing star player, Jennifer Hermoso, on the mouth without her permission after the team won the women's World Cup. Hermoso has also filed an official complaint. This all paves the way for a formal investigation now. Rubiales, you may remember, is suspended from his job. He refuses to resign. And a major upset for the reigning Superbowl champions. The Kansas City Chiefs lost their regular season home opener to the Detroit Lions, 21 to 20. Lions' rooky safety, Brian Branch, picked off Patrick Mahomes for a touchdown early in the third quarter, which tied the game. The Chiefs regained the lead with two field goals until Detroit running back, David Montgomery, found the end zone for the game- winning score. Tough one, Boris, but I have to say, it was a nice pass from Mahomes, a tip off from the Chiefs wide receiver.",
