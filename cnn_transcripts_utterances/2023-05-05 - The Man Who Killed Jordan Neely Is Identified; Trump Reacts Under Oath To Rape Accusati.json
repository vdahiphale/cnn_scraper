Tonight, we have the first statement from that 24-year-old.Plus, Donald Trump has until 5:00 p.m. on Sunday to tell a judge whether he wants to take the stand in the E.

He claimed Carroll was not his type, but then mistook her -- mistook her photo for his second wife, Marla Maples. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, you have a right to exercise self-defense not only on yourself but for a third party. Number two, after you get through immediate threat of harm, of fear or death, the issue is, was there any reasonability to his actions, right? Meaning, when he put him into chokehold, did you need to do it? Was that reasonable? Number three, was that force proportionate or disproportionate to what, if any threat, was being posed at the time? And then you can get into all the questions of, well, did he know? Did he foresee?

At the end of the day, I think what happens, you can be in a grand jury, you give all the information to the grand jury, you get all the witnesses and statements and everything else. A grand jury consisting of 23 people makes determination as to whether or not there's proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. But whether there is reasonable cause to believe a simple majority of the 23, if there's reasonable cause to believe a crime has occurred, you bring it before a jury, you get indicted, and a trial jury will make an assessment as to guilt or innocence.",
