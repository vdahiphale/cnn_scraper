      "sentences": "Hello, I'm Christina Macfarlane, and you're watching CNN special coverage of the devastating earthquake in Southern Turkey.Authorities are racing to rescue survivors after one of the worst earthquakes in 100 years. The 7.8 magnitude quake left at least 2,800 people dead across Turkey and Syria, more than 14,000 are injured. Entire buildings collapsed in the aftermath. This video is from Haliliye, about 270 kilometers east of the earthquake's epicenter, there have been at least 120 aftershocks, some almost as strong as the original. The impact has been felt as far as Lebanon and Israel. In Syria, the destruction is particularly severe after years of Civil War. The country's Civil Defense says they do not have the resources to handle the disaster. White Helmets are calling for international cooperation to deliver aid. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh is joining us live from Istanbul at this hour where night has fallen, Jomana, across the region, but that has not stopped rescue efforts, which continue despite freezing conditions. Bring us up-to-date, if you will, with those efforts, and also the situation facing people now who have been displaced by this earthquake, where have they gone? What are they doing? You know, what is the situation facing them?",

      "sentences": "Well, Christina, as the Turkish President described, this is the biggest disaster Turkey has faced in the last century, I mean, the unimaginable devastation that we are seeing across this massive earthquake zone stretching across at least 10 Turkish provinces and across the border into Syria, in rebel-held parts in Northwestern Syria, as well as government-controlled areas.We are seeing the death toll on both sides of the border continuing to rise by the hour pretty, much more. Than 2,800 people so far confirmed killed, thousands and thousands injured, according to Turkish officials. And the concern is, Christina, that the numbers are expected to rise. A lot of concern that the real casualty figures in the coming hours are going to be much, much higher than that. In Syria, what aid agencies are saying is that they are really struggling to get information out of the country. Of course, as you mentioned, a country that has been devastated, dealing with the aftermath of more than a decade of a Civil War that has decimated the country's infrastructure and services. And now, you've got this earthquake on top of this, aid agencies are saying communication disruptions, power outages, making it very difficult for them to get information. But they fear that Northwestern Syria home to some of Syria's most vulnerable, internally displaced people has been really hard hit. So, we'll have to wait and see in the coming hours what the local search and rescue teams there will say about the update. And then here in Turkey, thousands and thousands of buildings have been destroyed. Many buildings flattened. Of course, this striking -- this earthquake at four o'clock in the morning while people were indoors sleeping when this happened. So the fear is that you could potentially be looking at a situation where thousands of people remain trapped under the rubble. I mean, you just have to look at the images that are coming out from across the earthquake zone to just imagine the kind of horror that people have gone through and are continuing to live through right now. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KARADSHEH (voice over):   A young man trapped, desperation in his eyes. Then in the pre-dawn darkness, a moment of joy. Rescuers haul him from the wreckage of a building in Southern Turkey. (UNIDENTIFIED MEN speaking in foreign language.) KARADSHEH (voice over):   As the morning sunrises, all many others can do is pray. BIRCAN RIZVAN, DIYARBAKIR RESIDENT (through translator):   We'll see what happened to those living on the ground floors. May God give us a speedy recovery. KARADSHEH (voice over):   This was a residential building full of families, asleep in their homes when the massive earthquake struck just before daybreak. IHSAN CETINTAS, DIYARBAKIR RESIDENT (through translator):   I was sleeping when my wife suddenly woke me up. The quake was very severe, very scary. It took almost two minutes until the shaking stopped. [15:05:06]   KARADSHEH (voice over):   We can't yet know how many people could be trapped in a building like this, in wrecked homes like this across Turkey and into neighboring Syria. More buildings brought down, a toddler found. (UNIDENTIFIED MEN speaking in foreign language.) KARADSHEH (voice over):   The White Helmets have done this before, heroes of the Syrian Civil War now pulling people out from under a very different disaster. So many in rebel-held Northern Syria had very little yesterday, people will be left with nothing today. In Turkey, too, foreign help will be needed. The government in Ankara has asked its neighbors to come to its aid. The search and rescue will stretch on for days, hope will remain for as long as possible. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Some people telling me they were woken up by what seemed like their entire house shaking, and then that incredibly strong aftershock, people in Northern Israel actually evacuating office buildings due to the strength of that aftershock, but no major injuries or damage had been reported in Israel, across the Palestinian territories, or in Jordan.The Israeli Military meanwhile announcing that they are immediately sending around 150 search and rescuers, part of two flights, will be landing in Adana, just a couple hours' drive from the epicenter and the Israeli Military saying that actually so far, the Turkish government had only requested search and rescuers, but that the Israelis are ready to send more including field hospitals. Other Israeli aid groups have also told me that they are currently preparing planes to go to Turkey in the coming days. Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying that Syria had requested aid from Israel via what he called a diplomatic element, an Israeli security source actually telling CNN that that diplomatic element was actually Russia, that the request was conveyed to the Israelis by Russia. Now a request of that kind would be rather extraordinary because although Israel and Syria are neighbors, they are formally at war and they have no diplomatic relations. However, an unnamed Syrian official has categorically denied there had been such a request telling the pro government media outlet Al-Watan that Netanyahu was trying to, as he said, exploit the catastrophe. In the meantime, in places such as Israel where they felt that initial tremor, this has triggered the governments to start preparing for the next earthquake.

And it's even worse than Syria. Because for all these recent years, the Assad regime and the Russian Air Force were systematically destroying the health care facilities in Idlib, in northwest Syria.And that was one of the hardest hit areas now in this earthquake or these earthquakes. And to make it even worse, the main delivery point for aid to that part of Syria was through Gaziantep, Turkey, which has also been hit by the earthquake. So, there's a huge level of humanitarian complexity that derives from the geopolitics. But having said that, when I look at the countries that have offered assistance to Turkey and Syria, I have hope. I mean, you know, my -- I'm in so much pain, my whole family is in praying so much for the poor people still under the rubble, and for their families, and for the rescuers. But if you look at the offers of assistance, I mean, you see Israel offering assistance to Turkey, with whom there have not been normalized diplomatic relations and to Syria with whom Israel still at war. We see Armenia and Greece offering assistance to Turkey. So, I hope that in this case, as in 1999, when Turkey's last huge earthquake hit, and Greece and Turkey relations improved as a result of mutual assistance because Greece had a subsequent earthquake a month later, both countries helped each other. I hope we'll see the sort of trivial diplomatic disputes in the context of this enormous human suffering being put aside, and it seems like that's beginning to happen. How long that will last?

What really surprises me is Israel making the effort to Syria as well.So, I, you know, I don't know how far things will go. But I do believe that Turkey, at least will welcome this assistance from Israel. And I think that factor will -- is already beginning to change the calculus. The diplomatic and strategic calculus in Ankara, again, which is going to move away from politicizing relations with Israel because Turkey has this huge election coming up, right? In May, when the future, the fate of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan will be decided. And Israel is a difficult issue in Turkish domestic politics. But by offering this assistance, I think Israel is depoliticizing the whole domestic political issue of Israel-Turkey relations. And that's got to be a good thing for regional stability in the longer run. But as I was just saying, the election is coming up. And shifting to domestic politics in Turkey, this is really make or break for President Erdogan. If his government delivers, as it seems to be really trying to do now, it'd be very difficult to defeat him in the election.

It's punishable by up to life in prison and the trial begins today. This is Hong Kong's largest national security trial since Beijing imposed sweeping legislation in the wake of the 2019 antigovernment protests.And the 47 include a wide range of pro-democracy figures from the high-profile activist Joshua Wong, to former law professor Benny Tai and former journalist turn pro-democracy lawmaker Claudia Mo. Now they have pleaded guilty. And among the defendants declaring their innocence is former journalist Gwyneth Ho. The group is accused of organizing and participating in an unofficial primary vote in July of 2020. Hong Kong held a primary vote before without incident 2018 but when this primary vote took place, authorities called it a vicious plot intended to paralyze the government and undermine state power and China's liaison office said it contravenes the law. July of 2020, the office said in the statement this, \"With the support of external forces, opposition groups and leaders have deliberately devised plans to hold the so-called primary election, which is a serious provocation to the current electoral system and cause serious damage to the fairness and justice of the legislative council elections.\" A small group of protesters gathered outside the courtroom today and one banner read crackdown and shameless. Now critics say that the law has been used to crush the opposition movement. In a note last year, the senior China researcher at Human Rights Watch wrote this, \"Hong Kong's biggest national security case is wrapped in legal language, but it's just part of the Chinese government's relentless efforts to smother Hong Kong's democracy movement. The very real threat of life in prison for peaceful activism shows Beijing's utter contempt for both Democratic political processes and the rule of law.\" This landmark trial comes as the government is seeking to rebuild Hong Kong's image to revive tourism with 500,000 free flights. And this trial is expected to run for at least 90 days but its implications could last for years or even decades. Kristie Lu Stout, CNN, Hong Kong",

The league accuses city of breaching more than 100 financial rules over a decade. It has now referred the club to an independent commission, and if found guilty city could be suspended or have points deducted according to the Premier League handbook.In a statement, the club says it's surprised by the allegations. It says it welcomed the independent review. CNN Senior Sports Analyst Darren Lewis joining me now live via Skype. Good to see you, Darren. Darren, it's been said that it this is proven, this could be one of the greatest offenses committed in Premier League history. But Manchester City have been accused of breaking financial fair play rules before. So, why is it different this time? What is different? DARREN LEWIS, CNN SENIOR SPORTS ANALYST (via Skype): Well, the difference back then was that the Court of Arbitration for Sport cleared Manchester City when they were suspended from European competition in 2020 for a period of two years. Now some of those charges that were -- that pulled out them did timeout, they exceeded the statute of limitations. But they were cleared at the time by the Court of Arbitration for Sport. An independent panel will (INAUDIBLE) and adjudicate in this case with the Premier League charges have been leveled at city. And there will be no recourse to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. That's why this is so different. That's why it's so great. You mentioned a second ago, the scope of the punishment that is within the Premier League independent panels grasp because as far as they're concerned, they can recommend to the Premier League board that as you've been saying there was a post deduction or potentially, that there is an expulsion from the Premier League. Now, it's got to be made clear in this case to a city deny any wrongdoing. In fact, there is a feeling coming out of the Etihad that perhaps the club is being used. Well, there is a soon to be released a white paper here in the U.K., which may well recommend the setting up of an independent regulator. In effect, it would be as far as city are concerned, the Premier League saying, we don't need an independent regulator, we can take on the club the size of the champions of England. They've won the title four times in the last five years. We can take them on, we don't need to be governed by an independent regulator. The Premier League's contention is a two -- are unrelated. And that the -- and in any case what had been the white paper due to be released on Wednesday, that's been postponed. That will now happen perhaps later in the month of maybe next month.",
