And we've got brand-new polling from Georgia, and the swing states. We're going to talk about that, coming up. Plus, some new backlash over newly-resurfaced tape of Donald Trump's running mate, J.D. Vance disparaging people without kids. This time though, childless teachers, including our prominent source, here tonight. And brand-new reporting on the Trump assassination attempt. CNN has learned the would-be assassin studied a U.S. government document, as he hatched his plot. He used that document to help him. It's breaking, right here, tonight. I'm Pamela Brown, in for Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. On the road again, and trying to make major inroads, with voters, in a state, where she defied the odds, with President Biden in 2020. That would be Georgia. And Vice President Harris is taking her campaign, through GOP strongholds, in southern Georgia. It's part of a two-day tour with her running mate, Minnesota governor, Tim Walz, their first appearance together, in the state, and first time back on the trail since the convention, visiting a barbecue joint and dropping by a high school.

And so, I think it's important for us to acknowledge the work that has been done. Their state directors talked about 35,000 new volunteers, on the ground, since Kamala Harris announced. They have well over 24 offices in that state. They're doing the work. And so, what you do see with polls, and what you do hear from folks who are registered voters, is that the tide is changing, that they're excited about the change and the excitement that Kamala Harris brought to the top of the ticket.

We could start with the mere pronunciation of her name. We could start with understanding that she is actually an American citizen. We can start with the fact that she's the most qualified person to ever run for the United -- for the presidency. So, there are a number of things that do need to be fact-checked and clarified. And I also think that the media has a responsibility to be fair to Kamala Harris. When Lenard talked about her pivoting, and her being in obscurity, essentially, it's not because she wasn't doing the work. A lot of the work that she was doing wasn't being covered, right? We know that once the -- everybody else on social media, and there was this, this excitement around her announcement, all of the sudden, the media said, Oh, ratings, we're going to follow this. But that's not what was happening before, right? And so, I think there is an acknowledgment that we all have to make that she is doing the work. She has been clear about her policy proposals. Her website might not be all the way ready, because all of us were surprised by Joe Biden pulling out. But those things are all in the works.

JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD): No, only if you rip it completely out of context. Remember that Donald Trump sat on his hands, or sat around on his couch, watching the violence unfold, from his Oval Office Suite, and refused to send out the National Guard. So, I think the point Nancy Pelosi was making was, why did we ever trust Donald Trump, and the Executive branch of government, to help us. We should have insisted, from the beginning, that they send the National Guard out. And in the future, obviously we'll have to do that, since they've created a new low for standards of political behavior in the country. Remember, America has never seen anything like what happened on January 6th. The closest was in 1861, when Abraham Lincoln was elected, and there were a pro-Confederate, pro-Secessionist Forces out there. But General Winfield Scott said if anybody tries to get into the building that he would release the cannons on them, and manure the fields of Arlington with their bodies. But we didn't have any support like that from the Executive branch of government. And despite all of the desperate calls, for the National Guard to be sent out, not just by Democrats, but by Republicans who got Trump on the phone, Trump did nothing.

I mean, he's said it repeatedly now. I mean, he is laying the groundwork, in the same way he did in 2020, in the same way he did four years before that, right? President Biden, when he was running for office, focused a lot on Trump being a threat to democracy. He focused a lot on January 6, and this kind of rhetoric from Trump. You're not hearing that focus, that messaging from the Harris campaign. Do you think that's a mistake? Or do you think that's the right move?",

But what I'm seeing is the Harris campaign properly laying out what the relationship is between democracy and freedom.Democracy exists to protect our freedom, as Abraham Lincoln said. It is the beautiful silver frame upon which the golden apple of liberty rests. And the rule of law is there to protect our democracy. Now, Donald Trump and his cult of personality is against all of them. Against our freedom, as we saw by him packing the Supreme Court to destroy Roe versus Wade. Against our democracy, as we saw on January 6. And against the rule of law, as he tramples it every single day. And he is a convicted felon himself. So, we've got to defend the rule of law, democracy and freedom at the same time. And insurrection is no trivial matter, from the perspective of the Founding Fathers and the Constitution. I can find you a half dozen different places, in the Constitution, where insurrection is specifically forbidden and opposed. For example, Article I, Section 8 says Congress has the power to call forth the militias of the states in order to suppress insurrections. Section 3, the 14th Amendment--",

What are the key elements of an IED, meaning the essential parts in hardware. What can an IED be made of, in terms of energetic material, meaning, which are the best explosives?The four-page document is still online on the DHS website. And the question that we asked the Department of Homeland Security, since, according to our sources, the gunman didn't just have this in his searches. He downloaded images of all four pages, and he kept the document, indicating he wanted to refer back to it. Is, does this document have too much information for a document that's not law- enforcement-sensitive, not just meant for bomb squad community people, but for anybody with a Google search. The Department of Homeland Security answered by saying, The department provides information to the American public to protect against a range of security threats, which is not exactly the answer to our question--",

How could he walk around with a rifle, and not be spotted by police or all those other people?
