      "sentences": "Yes, Christine. I'm standing amongst the graves of those fallen soldiers. These are, many of them, young men. Right around me I see one was age 22, one was age 19.And amongst the flowers and the candles that families have left here some of them have signs, and these signs say \"Dear my loved brother, my loved son, we will not attend the ceremony today.\" And it's essentially in protest of the politicians, some of whom have still chosen to attend these ceremonies despite the protests from the families of the fallen -- some of whom are protesting the ministers themselves because of their positions; others because they fear that the ministers' presence at these ceremonies unnecessarily politicizes what should be such a solemn day. At this cemetery, one of the most controversial figures in the Israeli government, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir spoke. And even before he showed up there was tension -- some scuffles between the families of the fallen, and as he started to speak there were some people who started to protest, shouting at him. Some people turned their backs and left. Other people started singing songs of protest. And there were expectations that this would happen. Some ministers heeded the call to not attend the ceremonies but Itamar Ben-Gvir was defiant. And some families, in particular, were offended by that by Ben-Gvir himself has some -- some people consider more extremist positions and he, himself, actually never served in the military here. Despite the compulsory draft he was essentially denied from serving because of some of his extremist views even at a young age. But despite some of the protesters here, there were others who were in support of him who said may God bless you. And Ben-Gvir, in his speech, said let them yell. They are patriots as well. He said that he was going to bow his head. And some of the tensions even continued after the ceremony ended. Outside of the cemetery there were some further scuffles between families. This, despite the fact that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and opposition leader Yair Lapid, and the Israeli President Isaac Herzog said that this day should be above politics. That people should come together and act as one nation. But it goes to show you that, of course, the emotions are high today -- Memorial Day. This is a very emotional day for so many people in Israel, but also tensions and emotions have been so high here now for at least 16 weeks after 16 weeks of regular protests against this judicial overhaul plan that has been paused for now. But the Israeli Parliament will be starting up again in the next few days and that judicial overhaul plan could come back onto the table -- Christine.",

The criminal complaint says Bowers started shooting outside and then inside, targeting people praying, and expressing his desire to kill Jews. Bowers faces 63 felony counts and prosecutors are seeking the death penalty in this case. His defense team offered a guilty plea with life in prison in exchange for taking capital punishment off the table. One of his defense attorneys is Judy Clarke. She has represented other federal death penalty defendants like the Unabomber and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev from the Boston Marathon bombing. But federal prosecutors have not budged and the judge prepared potential jurors if they make it to the sentencing phase they should expect to weigh the death penalty in this case. Ahead of the trial, congregants from the Tree of Life synagogue gathered Sunday to pray as their fellow worshippers' day in court has finally arrived.",

Bank execs claim the situation has since stabilized but they still plan to cut its workforce by as much as 25 percent.Looking at markets around the world right now, European markets are lower at this hour. Asian markets finished mixed here. The Hang Seng fell nearly two percent despite better-than-expected GDP figures in China. And on Wall Street, stock index futures right now all leaning lower here.

All right, a change in mortgage fees became the hot topic this past weekend. Now before you stop paying your credit bills in the hopes of getting a better deal on your mortgage let's go over what's fact and what's fiction in these mortgage fee changes. Joining us now is Bill Corbet, managing director at BlackFin Group. Good morning. Thank you so much for dropping by here. So let's set the stage. May first up-front fees for loans backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac -- they're going to change. And in some cases, Bill, borrowers with higher credit -- higher credit scores -- they may pay a little bit more in fees, and lower credit score people will pay less. This is what sparked the unfairness debate on the internet. Is there a new unfair mortgage tax? BILL CORBET, MANAGING DIRECTOR, BLACKFIN GROUP (via Webex by Cisco): So let me break it down into two parts, first. The changes are effective for loans sold as of May first, but lenders built these price changes into their rate sheets back in the end of February-early March. So the pricing has been in effect now for several months. And what changed in there is the rate of add-on for different credit attributes. So while the credit premium, if you will, increased slightly for high-quality borrowers and was reduced for higher loan- to-value lower credit score borrowers, it was the rate of change. There is still a fairly steep difference in price add-ons between a high-quality borrower and a lower-quality borrower.",
