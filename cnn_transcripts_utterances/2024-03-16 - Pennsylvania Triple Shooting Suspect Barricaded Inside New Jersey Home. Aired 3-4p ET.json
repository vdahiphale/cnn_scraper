I'm Fredricka Whitfield and we continue to follow our breaking news.A tense armed standoff with a suspect involved in a triple killing, it continues this hour in New Jersey. Police say several people who were held hostage by the suspect inside a residence there in Trenton, New Jersey, are now safe after being evacuated by SWAT officers. Now this all comes after three people were shot and killed earlier in the day across state lines in Pennsylvania, outside a Philadelphia suburb in what officials are calling a violent domestic related incident.

Following the shootings at approximately 9:01 a.m. Gordon drove to the unit block of Edgewood Lane, Levittown, where he forcibly broke into a residence after which he shot and killed 25-year-old Taylor Daniel, with whom he has two children.

And police consider that person armed and dangerous.We have team coverage of this unfolding situation. Let's begin with CNN's Polo Sandoval, who is not far from the focal point of this investigation there in Trenton, New Jersey. Polo, what are you able to see? What are you learning? POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: And as you and I are speaking right now, Fred, you can hear off in the distance, may not be able to make it out, but actually police using a PA system, a loudspeaker to actually make contact -- apologies, I'm trying to listen here, Fred. But essentially what they're doing right now and they have been doing for the last 10 minutes, they have actually been asking 26-year-old Andre Gordon, who's barricaded himself inside the home. Police believe he is by himself inside that home here in Trenton, New Jersey, and they are asking him, again, just now, to step out of the home with his hands up to essentially surrender. And again this is happening right now. This is as close as we can take you and as we monitor the situation and listen for any more developments, Fred, I can tell you that that house that he's actually believed to be inside is just down the street. You may be able to make it, an ambulance just past a stop sign. If you take a left, that is where the home is. So I would say I'm about maybe 150 yards or so from the house. Some neighbors behind the yellow tape being asked to remain inside but on the other side of the yellow tape clearly certainly drawing some other people out to see. This is anything but a normal Saturday for the folks in this. It was usually described as a quiet Trenton neighborhood. What we know, again, as we still listen for developments, is that Andre Gordon, according to investigators, this morning at 9:00 a.m. about a 15-minute drive south of here on the other side of the Pennsylvania-New Jersey state line believed to have shot and killed his stepmother, 52 years old, along with his 13-year-old sister Kera Gordon before he then made his way to another home, shooting and killing a third individual according to police. And then investigators believed that he carjacked an individual in a parking lot and then made the drive here to Trenton, New Jersey, and it was about just past noon that investigators received the report that Gordon was inside that house in this neighborhood with several people inside. We've seen those pretty dramatic images of individuals escaping that house. Police only describing them as residents. And you see them actually successfully escaping from the second-floor window. And that brings us to where we are right now where investigators are essentially in a standoff. SWAT team, both local, state, and federal here on scene with a standoff with this 26-year-old man pleading with him to peacefully surrender in order to avoid any further violence -- Fred.",

      "sentences": "I think that's important to keep in mind is this, according to investigators, this all started as a form of family dispute. This was a family related violence but what takes this really expanded beyond the obvious tragedy there is how some of the neighborhoods in and around those shooting locations, so in those communities, were asked to shelter in place initially. This was an individual who, according to police, basically proved his intent carjacked a random individual.Fortunately, it did not hurt them according been to police, but that is why many of these neighborhoods went essentially into lockdown. A St. Patrick's Day parade had to be canceled during the press conference that took place in the last hour or so. We heard from the Bucks County district attorney, as well as other law enforcement personnel to describe police officers going down that parade route, asking people to seek shelter. This is when they had no idea where the suspect was. Of course, eventually once they were able to place him at this particular location, they were able to remove those shelter-in-place orders. But that just speaks to the impact for so many people who were, as you pointed out, trying to go about their Saturday. It's usually supposed to be a quiet Saturday but now for people in this Trenton neighborhood, now ending in this fairly tense standoff. At this point police are really trying to bring this to a peaceful end. Still able to hear a police using that system to try to communicate with the suspect inside.",

All right, Commissioner, you know, talk to me about that familiarity here. I mean, this is very similar to what a lot of big cities and how they would handle what seemed to be a barricaded suspect in this case since Polo was able to hear, they're using a megaphone. That means communication might be limited, right? Sometimes there's a cell phone involved or a landline involved but they're communicating with this suspect because they still want it to all end peacefully. They want to be able to take this suspect into custody. Tell me what you understand to be usually the protocol in situations like this?",

Because while we're looking at these images right here from earlier in the day, maybe about two hours ago when we saw that the law enforcement came, they put the ladder to reach the second floor, they were able to bust out a window. They were able to safely bring out some of the hostages. That in and of itself brought great risks as you were just underscoring.But now there's continued risk, too, because, like you mentioned, there may not be the cooperation they were looking for from the suspect. They're still trying to negotiate or communicate with this person, but they also know that that person, the suspect has a vantage point that perhaps they don't know, given that he is inside presumably this unit. Talk to me about the risks that still persist for law enforcement, that's there whether they have to move around continuously, they have to worry about what communication or information the suspect is getting about the activity around the home.",

These bullets can cut through wood and plaster and literally just basically blow through anything that that building is constructed on. So there really is no effective cover from an attack from someone who has a rifle like that. That's uppermost in their minds.But one of the things that they're trying to do is determine exactly where the individual is in the house. And they may have eyes on him. There could very well be sniper posts that are watching him through the windows. And there are a number of different strategies that police use to try to isolate the person to make sure that they can safely evacuated people from the front of the building if, say, he has barricaded himself in a bathroom in the back of the building or something like that. So we've got to hope that the officers have good intelligence and they're making these decisions that clearly are dangerous, but probably with a bit of sort of calculated risks involved.",

So there has been a net that's been cast upon that neighborhood. So there's really going to be nowhere to go. So if the suspect is considering trying to escape there's really going to be nowhere to run at this point.So, you know, they're being watched, you know, by a 360-degree net of officers on the ground, potentially in the air, or whether it's via drone or via aviation by the way of helicopters and so forth. At some point, you know, they -- I'm not sure exactly what sort of tools that they have there, but New York, for instance, they may send him like a robot, you know, with a camera, which will kind of go in there and take a look around. If the suspect brought harm to himself and is unable to respond to the police. So that may come with -- you know, time is on their side because they're isolating and containing the suspect as they would with anyone who's emotionally disturbed, especially emotionally disturbed, with high-powered weapon as was previously mentioned by our other guests.

Yes, he crossed state lines with a car and so therefore it's theoretically a federal nexus but really this is a state homicide case along with carjackings, et cetera.This has all the hallmarks, Fred, of a domestic beef gone really bad. I mean, interesting, think about this. He killed his loved ones and one of his offsprings. He killed his wife or the person he shared children with, and then he goes to a different place and he doesn't know this person and he takes their car and doesn't harm them. And then he goes across state lines. He goes to I guess his ancestral home, where his relatives are in Jersey and they get out. Maybe he let them get out. So his real beef was something happened and so I'm sure the Bucks County DA's office will be seeing whether there were domestic violence restraining in orders, stay away orders, custody orders, whether there were 911 calls for domestic disputes before, maybe there's a child custody thing going on.

But that's certainly wouldn't be surprising. If we do hear that down the line from investigators after this hopefully comes to a peaceful end that he may have been familiar with that home possibly with the owner.Fortunately, though, there was no further violence that took place inside that house after he arrived here just after noon. But important to sort of summarize the chain of events that took place earlier this morning at about 9:00 a.m. That's when police say Gordon arrived at the first location already in a stolen vehicle, shooting and killing two of his relatives. You mentioned his stepmother and a little girl before he then made his way to another residence nearby after he allegedly committed that third murder. That's when police say he then carjacked the driver of a small SUV and then made his way over the state line here to New Jersey. And that's why there are so many law enforcement agencies involved, many of them still here on the ground, on the air and in surrounding homes to make sure that they can try to bring this to a peaceful end.

It is an extreme -- case of extreme violence against women. But it is all too common in the United States, thousands of women are killed every year by domestic partners. And in this particular case, this man has killed every female that was close to him, his stepmother, what was described as either his daughter or his sister, the mother of his child, and then he bludgeoned the grandmother of his own children.
