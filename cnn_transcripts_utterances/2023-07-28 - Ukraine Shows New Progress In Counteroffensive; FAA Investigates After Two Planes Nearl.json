And that's roughly 25 miles from the Ukrainian border. Some 10 people were injured. Ukraine isn't taking credit for that attack to this point. But do you anticipate we're going to see more incidents like this one?",

If it gets military effectiveness out of it, that's great.But this war is being waged at all levels. You know, from President Putin's perspective, what he's got an African charm offensive going on right now. He's avoiding being blamed, even by the South American nations, for the war in Ukraine. They wouldn't name him when they met. He's pointing at the U.S. presidential election, no doubt. He believes, if Donald Trump gets elected, his problems are over. Donald Trump will solve this in 30 days. He'll simply stop assistance to Ukraine, tell the Ukrainians they have to surrender and give it to Russia. So Putin's playing this at multiple levels. And don't forget, the Wagner group is in Belarus. Our Polish member of NATO, they are moving forces up to the Belarusian border because they're listening to the threats. The Lithuanians are very nervous about this. Putin is playing this at multiple levels, not just at the defensive level. At the defensive level, at the military level, the pressure is on the Ukrainians to bust through that Russian defense. But without more material delivered sooner to the front, and more logistics and maintenance up there, they have got a very tough fight ahead.",

The pilot of Allegiant flight 485, bound for Lexington, Kentucky, was forced to take evasive action after nearly hitting a Gulfstream business jet.A flight attendant on the Allegiant jet was hurt. A passenger, Jerrica Thacker, seen here on the flight, said it felt like the plane went straight up. She was visibly upset after she and the injured attendant, who Thacker says fell backward as the plane ascended. CNN correspondent, Gabe Cohen, joins me now. Gabe, first, tell me how the jets got so close together. There are so many systems, fail safe, fail safe, some automatic, humans involved and air traffic control. How did this happen?",

Allegiant, this flight takes off from Fort Lauderdale on Sunday, headed for Kentucky. Right around the Orlando area, about 23,000 feet up, when suddenly the pilot is told to go east. We have this statement from the FAA explaining what happened. They basically said that air traffic control in Miami directed the pilot to turn eastbound over the ocean at that 23,000 feet altitude, when it crossed in front of a northbound Gulfstream business jet. At this point, these two aircraft are headed in the same path, but both pilots, fortunately, got an automated alert that basically there was another plane flying at the same altitude and immediate action needed to be taken. Bear in mind, they were about two and a half miles apart. That may sound look a big distance, but -- (CROSSTALK) SCIUTTO: They're going really fast.",

The Allegiant plane went up, the jet went down, and they were able to avoid a disaster.We know the Allegiant maneuver, that pilot's maneuver was dramatic enough that it injured at least one flight attendant onboard. They had to turn back to Fort Lauderdale so that person could get medical attention. Remember, it is rare that an incident like this, a pilot's maneuver ends in an injury.
