That's what former President Donald Trump says he will have to do to cover the massive judgment in his New York civil fraud case as he appeals the ruling. On Truth Social this morning, Trump continued to rail against the judge in the case and make baseless accusations that his legal troubles equate to election interference, despite the fact that it is he, not President Biden, who's charged with conspiracy to overturn a free and fair election. Joining me now is law professor at Syracuse University, investigative journalist David Cay Johnston. David, good morning. You know, this Truth Social post, we obviously don't put all of them on T.V., but this one stood out as it just came out earlier this morning. He's basically saying he's going to have to sell off assets to get out of this situation that he's in. You've been looking into his financial situation for years. What do you make of all this? Is he going to have to sell off assets? Is that coming maybe soon.",

And just like happens to a homeowner, Donald faces this problem. You have a first mortgage on your property. You need some money. You say, oh, I'll get a HELOC or a second mortgage. The first bank has to agree. And I think it's pretty clear the first banks are not willing to agree. So that's very limiting on Donald.And the reason they're likely not to agree is exactly what this case is about, inflating the value of assets, claiming they're worth in some cases 16 and 30 times what the market shows that they're worth.",

And later, a document showing he was worth minus $325 million, which means you and I are worth more than Donald Trump, at least at that time.Today, it's the same thing. Nine years ago, when he came down the escalator to announce his campaign, he said he was worth more than $10 billion.

Guys, thanks very much for being on with us. Mark, you're there in the studio. I've got Kristen and Joe next to me. Kristen, let me start with you first. I mean, I was talking about this with David just a few moments ago. For years, and you and I know this, we're out on the campaign trail together, Trump and his aides and his allies have talked about how much money he has, how rich he is, and all of a sudden, now he's saying he has to sell off these assets.

And that really was a selling point for him in 2016, particularly when you talk to working class voters.Now, if you talk to his team about what exactly they're doing or what they think of this, they point to two things. They argue that there is no billionaire on this planet who is that liquid who could come up with this amount of money. They also blame the underwriters and they say that they're not going to go anything over a hundred million. And if you do talk to financial experts, there's a little bit of a gray area there because usually you don't have to come up with half a billion dollars.",

They've been asked about lower sums.But as David was saying, they've known about this for months. It's not that he just had to become liquid overnight. They had time to deal with this. So, the question is what exactly happens next. You can hear, obviously, Donald Trump is ranting on social media, saying this is unfair. I'm going to have to sell my assets. I think they hope that there is going to be a stop to this so that when they can appeal, because that's what he's arguing for, right, that he wants to say that he doesn't have to pay until after his appeal and that something will come through.",

The Czech president has started an initiative to buy ammunition around the world and that's happening. There was a recent meeting of the Polish, German and French prime ministers who are recommitted also. So, it's not as if the United States is doing this alone. It is true that there is a gap this year. The European weapons production is not up to providing Ukraine with what it needs this year. And, really, only the United States is capable of filling that. And, of course, the Russians know that and that's why there's so much Russian propaganda. You can see it on the internet. It affects members of Congress because Putin isn't able to win on the ground but he could win through Washington. He could win through pressuring Congress to block that aid.
