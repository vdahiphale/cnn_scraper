Now the Rapid Support Forces had this paramilitary group that's so powerful that's involved in this conflict with us in the military, the head of that group, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo or Hemetti has said he is open to another ceasefire.

A third of the hospitals in Sudan are not operating. In Khartoum alone, 70 percent of the hospitals are out of commission, have been bombed or they've been shelled. They've run out of basic necessities. They don't have water or power because in some cases even the water and power lines have been bombed. And sometimes staff can't even get there because it's not safe for them. The few operating are getting inundated by the wounded. So that is why this humanitarian cease-fire is necessary just for the medical system, which is on the risk of collapse but also for so many people who've been cared since Saturday that they haven't gone out. They are running out of food. They're running out of water. They're running out of medication. And they just don't see an end to this. So many people who can are fleeing Khartoum to other parts of the country that they consider to be slightly safer. But still in the grand scale of things, a major problem here, especially considering that these two warring generals will not agree to any sort of mediation efforts from the region, from the United Nations, from the Arab League, from the African Union. In this hour, the Arab League, the African Union and the U.N. Secretary general are meeting virtually to try and find a way out of this. We're waiting for a communique to see exactly what came out of that, if there will be some kind of white smoke and if they can find a way to convince General Hemetti and General Burhan to talk and to cease fire.",

Several days ago, Elon Musk was talking about just being happy if the rocket ship cleared the launch pad. And we did experience that here this morning. It was a stunning sight to watch this Starship clear the launch pad. Those 33 engines inside that heavy booster launching and it was seconds after it had cleared the launch pad that we could feel the rumbling and the vibration from where we are, about seven kilometers away from the launch pad. In about three minutes or so roughly this started going out east toward over the Gulf of Mexico. And what this rocket was supposed to have done, best case scenario, is travel out and about three minutes in the booster was supposed to separate from the Starship and then continue eastward and make almost one pass around the Earth and land somewhere around the state of Hawaii in the Pacific Ocean. But it was about around the three minute mark where things went wrong. And as you mentioned there, that disassembly, which is just a technical way of saying that it exploded. Now the question is, why did it explode? And we don't have an answer to that at this point. We don't know if it was a technical issue on the rocket ship or if it was deliberately done by officials in the control room of SpaceX. We're trying to get answers to that to see exactly what caused this. But really a stunning sight to see, a historic sight to see, given the importance of this Starship rocket system. Just so people know that this is, this Starship that, in the years ahead, is contracted with the U.S. NASA space agency to help shuttle supplies and astronauts to the moon. And the ultimate goal is to incorporate and create human travel to mark.

The science is very clear. Homosexuality is a natural and normal variant of the human sexuality. So there was no debate to be had about whether this is a nurture or nature debate. So will President Museveni take this into account? He has called homosexuals deviants in the past and has a very strong anti gay stance. So he -- this is this is very much being framed as a Western import into Africa. And it's not just Uganda. Tanzania is also looking very, very kind of harsh for LGBTQ people in that country.

And for me to be an artist, to be partly Nigerian, partly from Czech Republic, you know, representing the young people who also feel like they maybe don't have a chance to dream big and maybe they cannot change and shape their future, I think for me, it's all about creativity.

I've been doing lots of media communication, havebeen talking to lots of interesting people who were invited me and wanted to hear from me. But at the same time people would be showing me this images, images of exploding  spacecraft, images of this race car doing the belly flop and asking me, so, how does it make you feel? Are you afraid? And it would be -- it would be silly to say I'm not afraid. I think fear is a -- is a necessary element of survivor -- of survival. And -- but my curiosity and just trust that this matters, that this is very meaningful. This just is more powerful than my fear. And also I have seen -- I'm in such a great hands with SpaceX. You know, the fact that, in the past, there was almost all about space race, right? Trying to push it, you know, like being on time because the press is watching and we need to satisfy the optics. But here at SpaceX, I've seen something else. I've seen them, you know, calling off the launch because of that -- of that failure and not really caring about how it looks but really caring about making it work.",
