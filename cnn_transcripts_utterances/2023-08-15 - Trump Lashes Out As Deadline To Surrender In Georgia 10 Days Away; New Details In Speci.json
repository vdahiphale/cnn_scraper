Georgia's Republican governors shutting down Trump's latest tirade after the former president was indicted by a Georgia grand jury.Trump's former White House lawyer Ty Cobb is my guest. Why he says these charges pack a real punch. Plus, ten days to surrender. The clock ticking for Trump and his closest allies to turn themselves in. So, how did Trump allegedly get so many people to do his bidding? Someone who knows Trump better than many, better than most, one of his former Trump Org executives for many years is my guest. And Russia ramping up its attacks, targeting apartment buildings and a kindergarten far from the front lines. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, ten days to turn himself in, as Trump slams the D.A., Fani Willis, as failed, and promises to flood the zone with false details about fraud in the Georgia election, forcing Georgia's conservative Republican Governor Brian Kemp, who by the way supported Trump and said he voted for him, prompting him to say, quote, the 2020 election in Georgia was not stolen. For nearly three years, now anyone with evidence of fraud has failed to come forward, under oath, and provide anything in a court of law. Our elections in Georgia are secure, accessible and fair, and will continue to be as long as I'm governor. Well, of course, the facts remain facts, but the fiction, the falsehood is still believed by tens of millions, many tens of millions of Americans. And tonight, as Trump and 18 others have ten days to turn themselves in, facing serious criminal charges. And by the way, serious prison time, as in possibly more than 20 years if convicted. One of them is making a move for a get out of jail free card. Mark Meadows, Trump's former chief of staff, filing a court order to move his case to federal court, in effort to get it dismissed. Now, we're going to have more on this breaking development in just a moment, because the reality here is that the clock is ticking. Fani Willis says she would like to try Trump in the next six months, which would be just one case against Trump, of many going to trial, in the winter and spring. And just think about it, in all, Trump, who is by far the front runner in the Republican presidential field, is facing an astounding 91 criminal total charges and four criminal cases. Let's just say this again, can you imagine, the person who's right now sort of in line to get that Republican nomination, is facing 91 criminal charges? It is historical, it is incredible, and it's astounding. Well, in a moment, I'm going to speak to Trump's former White House lawyer, Ty Cobb. But first, I want to go OUTFRONT live to Paula Reid, still at that Atlanta courthouse. And, Paula, now, ten days to turn themselves in. But these breaking developments in the past few minutes here, what more can you tell us about this filing by Mark Meadows, who was so crucial, and so central in all of this. And, what's next in the case?",

His attorneys believe that if they are successful getting this moved to the federal jurisdiction, that they will be able to get it dismissed.Now, even if he is successful at getting this move to a federal, a federal court, it doesn't move the entire 19 defendant case. This is something that would have to happen defendant by defendant. And we were not reporting that multiple other defendants are also expected to attend this. Rudy Giuliani said today, in an interview, but he is going to try to get his case moved through federal court. And we also know that former President Trump is expected to try as well. Now, even if they are not successful in getting it dismissed, it's just impossible to know if that will prevail. If they can get this move to a federal court, the one big advantage for the former president and his allies would be the jury pool, because here in Fulton County, jury pool skews heavily Democratic. But the federal jury pool would draw from a more broad selection of people. So there would be at least a slight advantage there. There is also the possibility that anyone who is convicted could be eligible for a pardon, from a future president. Now right now, Erin, right in front of us, they have just ten days for their surrender. And then a judge will set dates, for these initial appearances.",

And, the fact that he didn't have immunity, or whatever deal he got with the feds, with Fani Willis does not indicate that he did not cooperate with the feds. They are very active, on their behalf.And with regard to his attempt to move the venue to -- and move the case to a federal court, of the 19 defendants, I think Meadows is the only person with an arguable chance of succeeding. He is charged in the RICO count, and then two counts related to the telephone call with Brad Raffensperger, where Trump asked for one more vote then they had. As I believe his motion reflects, he is charged essentially with setting up and attending meetings, doing scheduling, and going to a federal building, which is actually not compelling, for keeping it in a state court. I think there is a chance, not necessarily a great chance, but there is a decent chance that Mark Meadows's case could be removed. Trump can never be removed. None of the other defendants actually have the benefit of federal service during the time for their offenses, that would qualify them under this statute.",

The reality is, you don't get to appeal a lot of trial court motions, absent the permission of the judge, or a constitutional opportunity. So, I wouldn't worry so much about that. But this case will take a long time to be prepared, there will be motions for severance, motions to dismiss. And, if it takes her two years -- I mean, heaven forbid that Trump wins the presidency, then there will be a fight to the Supreme Court, over whether she can proceed against a sitting president during his term. That's an issue that's never been resolved. The federal prosecutors are not allowed to indict or prosecute a president during his term.

      "sentences": "Yeah, Erin, so what we see is we see the warrant itself. It outlines just a really broad scope. We want all of these things. The special counsel was seeking this at the beginning of this year before they decided to bring charges against Donald Trump, related to January 6th.But the meat of what we can see in these new filings, these filings are now unsealed by the federal court in Washington where that case now is public. And these filings captured the transcripts of hearings, where prosecutors and then the lawyers for Twitter, are talking to the judge about what the special counsel's office is seeking here from the account of Donald Trump. And, Erin, the thing that jumps out the most is something we didn't even know existed related to Donald Trump's Twitter account @RealDonaldTrump, which was shut down after January 6th. It's that he had direct messages. And at one point in one of the hearings, a lawyer for Twitter says they did a search to find how much direct messages may be part of this account. And he says that there was a volume for this account, that there are confidential communications. He confirmed that to the prosecutors. Apparently, the prosecutors are able eventually to obtain this data. They, from the court record that we have already, has shown that they were able to get where they sought from Twitter. And there are some other pieces in these transcripts where prosecutors let on to what they were looking for. They say they were looking for communications between Donald Trump's Twitter account, and government officials, maybe officials on his campaign. And also, they were looking for communications related to his account, when or around the time it was suspended, and terminated, after January 6th. Now the thing is, we don't know what they found, when they got this bulk of data from Twitter, including what may have been in those direct messages, even deleted direct messages that Twitter was able to pull up. But what this shows is, just the depth of how far the special counsel's office was able to go in collecting evidence. The indictment against Donald Trump doesn't have any direct messages from @RealDonaldTrump cited in it. It's just his public tweets. But, there may be information that the special counsel's office still has, that we could see at a trial, or that they may still be investigating around. We just don't know what they got, and what they will do with it -- Erin.",
