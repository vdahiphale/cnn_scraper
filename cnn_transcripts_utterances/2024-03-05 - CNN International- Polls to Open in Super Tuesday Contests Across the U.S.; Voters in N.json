If you're just joining us, here are some of our top stories today.Israeli War Cabinet Minister Benny Gantz will meet with U.S. Secretary of State Blinken in the coming hours. On Monday, he met with Vice President Kamala Harris during which they discussed the situation in Rafah and the need for a credible humanitarian plan. The Supreme Court unanimously ruled to keep Donald Trump on the ballot in Colorado. It's a decision that follows months of debate over whether Trump violated the insurrectionist clause in the Constitution's 14th Amendment. It's Super Tuesday in the U.S., the biggest day of presidential primaries with voters in more than a dozen states and territories preparing to cast their ballots for their party's nominee. Donald Trump is expected to emerge from today's primaries within touching distance of a third straight Republican nomination. CNN's Jeff Zeleny spoke to voters in North Carolina, one of the battleground Super Tuesday states, as some are dreading another Biden- Trump rematch. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Official data shows 41 percent of voters showed up to the polls for last Friday's legislative elections. This despite the regime making multiple pushes to get people to the polls. Early results show mostly hardline politicians won seats following the Iranian Guardian Council's decision to disqualify thousands of candidates.Some in Tehran tell CNN that people didn't vote because of the country's poor economic conditions, its crackdowns on dissent, and a lack of trust in leadership. Ukraine's military intelligence agency says it has destroyed a Russian patrol ship in the Black Sea that was reportedly worth $65 million. These images just coming in to us. The ship was operating near the Kerch Strait, which separates Crimea from Russia's coast. Ukraine also says it is responsible for blowing up a railway bridge in southwestern Russia on Monday. The explosion took place in the Samara region, more than 800 kilometers inside Russian territory. Russian state media says there were delays to train services, but no casualties. Kyiv says Russia used the railway to transport military cargo, including ammunition produced at a nearby plant. By all measures, the situation on Ukraine's eastern front is bleak. Frontline towns are in danger of falling into Russian hands.

CNN's Richard Quest has details on that. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RICHARD QUEST, CNN BUSINESS EDITOR-AT-LARGE: The announcement by the Malaysian government that it is open to reopening the search for MH370 will be very welcomed by the families of those that perished on board. But Ocean Infinity is doing it on a no-find-no-fee basis, it's believed. In other words, if they don't find the missing plane off the Australian coast where everybody believes it is, then they don't get paid. There have been two previous attempts by Ocean Infinity to find MH370 and both failed. The hope is that new search techniques, new equipment and better understanding of what happened to the plane will make this search successful. Despite all that's happened over the last 10 years, the real truth is we are no closer to knowing exactly what caused the plane to go missing. Yes, we know roughly where it is off the Australian coast. The various bits that have washed up in Africa have confirmed that. But whether it was the captain, whether it was mechanical, whether it was some mass act of mass murder, that we simply don't know. Richard Quest, CNN, New York. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
