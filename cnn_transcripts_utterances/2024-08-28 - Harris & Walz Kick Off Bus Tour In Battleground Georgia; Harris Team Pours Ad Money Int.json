Ahead, that new video shows her evacuating the Capitol, demanding to hold Trump accountable for what transpired that day.And the former president's rallies are famous for their soundtrack, but some bands would just as soon not be a part of the set list. Why it's so hard to stop Trump's campaign from using their music? We're following these major developing stories and many more all coming in right here to CNN NEWS CENTRAL.",

What does this tell you about her strategy, even as polls show she's got a tough road in Georgia? TIA MITCHELL, WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, ATLANTA JOURNAL-CONSTITUTION: Well, it - definitely like Priscilla said, the strategy is to get every vote they can in Georgia because we know states - you know, we have the Electoral College, but that depends on the popular vote. Harris needs every vote if she's going to try to carry Georgia again, because the polling shows that she - it's close, but that Donald Trump does appear to have the edge in Georgia. I think it's also worth noting, you know, we talked about Biden winning Georgia narrowly in 2020. Well, the last president to do so before Biden was Bill Clinton in 1992. He was also the last president to - last presidential candidate to make a campaign stop in South Georgia.",

So in 2020, Biden carried the state, but he was helped by the fact Ossoff and Warnock's Senate races were also on the ballot in 2020. In 2024, the presidential contest is the only statewide race on the Georgia ballot, and the polls showed that Joe Biden was having a lot of problems rebuilding that coalition, making sure his base was ready to turn out, particularly black voters. And so that was a change in 2024.Now, again, with Harris at the top of the ticket, those numbers are looking better, but it's still going to be tough for Harris because, again, there aren't other races and other candidates to help her make that make that pitch.",

He said, you know, he thinks that some of their rhetoric had contributed to perhaps this shooter and other people being very angry with him. He mentioned particularly the line about him being a threat to democracy. But one other area that he also focused on that I found very interesting is, remember when a couple of months ago, Donald Trump had spoke to a room full of Christian voters and he said, you know, don't - like you only have to vote once more this time. You won't have to vote again in four years. Some people were saying, how are we taking that meeting? Are you saying you won't have more elections?Dr. Phil asked Donald Trump about this.

John, we wanted to get into the conversation with you. This detail about Trump facing this superseding indictment, this updated indictment and the federal election interference case against him. Official Counsel Jack Smith revising the original filing, taking into account that Supreme Court decision, the ruling that granted Trump some immunity for official acts taken as president. What do you think are the most significant differences between the first indictment, the original one and this one? JOHN DEAN, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: I think the most significant thing based on the two - comparing the two indictments is that the new indictment, the superseding indictment is tighter and does not address the issue that the Supreme Court seems to be concerned about, which was his relationship - Trump's relationship in his scheme to overturn the election with the Justice Department. So all that material about his dealing with Jeff Clark has been excised from the original case and not in the revised case. They've tweaked the language here and there. It's about 10 pages shorter, but it is a much more powerful indictment in its new elegant form. It's the same four charges. They have not changed. But it is a sleeker document, if you will.",

In this instance, the delay is really Trump's fault. He got the Supreme Court to delay after delay after delay, and that was his strategy. So it's not surprising it has come up in the middle of the campaign now.And the 60-day rule, as I say, doesn't really apply to cases that have already been filed.

The photograph you were just standing in front of, where it shows the gun disassembled next to the backpack.A lot of people were asking, how is it that at a Secret Service- protected event with cops everywhere that someone could walk around with a long gun, an assault weapon and climb up to the roof and not be spotted? But the theory has been that that gun has a folding stock and a detachable barrel, which would have fit into the backpack. So he would have just looked like a guy with a backpack walking around until he got into that alleyway. And today we learned that he climbed up on top of an air-conditioning vent and used that to boost himself onto the roof, presumably with the backpack which was found there. We also learned that he was fixated on doing some kind of attack, attack planning, attack research, but when it came to motive, well, attack who and why, he looked at a large number of events, political figures, but then became hyper-focused on the Trump rally because it was coming near to his home. You see this improvised explosive device that was found in the trunk of his car. There were two there. There was another in his bedroom. We learned today during the briefing that he had been researching how to make bombs in different configurations going back to 2019. So without a motive, what the FBI said, quote, he was interested in, quote, \"a mixture of ideologies.\" It almost seems like he plotted to do an attack and plotted the why later.",
