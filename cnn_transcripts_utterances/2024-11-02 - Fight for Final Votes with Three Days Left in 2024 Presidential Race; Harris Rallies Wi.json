More than 68 million Americans have already cast their ballots in early voting.In the coming days, Trump is set to stop in North Carolina and Virginia, while Harris is expected to hit North Carolina and Georgia. On Friday, both candidates held dueling rallies in battleground Wisconsin, though, as we already know, polling is extremely tight in the election battlegrounds, including those crucial Rust Belt states of the Democrats' blue wall. New Marist polling shows Harris with slim leads in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan. But those figures are all within the margin of error. Now in those same states, Marist finds Trump pulling ahead with men while Harris leads with women by even wider margins. Some pollsters say the race now comes down to turnout. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

To me, I'm trying to figure out what the turnout is going to be. And the group that I'm watching more than any other are young women. If they come out in significant numbers, if they make a bigger percentage of the overall voter pool, then that is great news for Harris. That may propel her. The other group that I'm watching are Latinos. Some of that has been muddied over what happened in Madison Square Garden earlier this week. But the Latino population is voting in good numbers in the Western states. And that's critical in Arizona and Nevada. What they do could also be decisive. (END VIDEO CLIP) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

On Friday, a jury found Brett Hankinson guilty of using excessive force on Taylor. He fired 10 shots into her home. Although the bullets didn't hit anyone, prosecutors argued he was reckless since he couldn't see the target and that violated a basic rule of using deadly force. He faces up to life in prison. Two other officers who shot Taylor have not been charged in her death. Prosecutors say they were justified in the shooting since Taylor's boyfriend fired at them first. Liam Payne's family still hasn't been able to bring his body home. On Friday, the musician's remains were transferred out of a mortuary in Buenos Aires. The former One Direction member died there after falling from a hotel balcony on October 16th. A source told CNN that his body will be preserved at another facility and held until paperwork is finalized. At that point, his family will be able to receive his body in England. It remains unclear if Payne fell or jumped from his hotel room. Early toxicology reports showed he had cocaine in his system at the time. (MUSIC PLAYING)",

Have a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BRUNHUBER (voice-over):  This is a look at some of the damage in the city of Tira. The Arab majority town is about 15 miles northeast of Tel Aviv in northern Gaza. The United Nations says the situation is apocalyptic. The U.N. says virtually all incoming supplies and humanitarian services have stopped. Meanwhile, the World Health Organization says it plans to resume polio vaccines in northern Gaza on Saturday. The vaccinations were suspended last month because of security concerns. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is said to be waiting for the results of the U.S. election before considering any ceasefire proposals. Netanyahu met with a pair of White House officials this week but one U.S. official tells CNN they didn't reach any resolutions on Gaza and Lebanon. Last hour I spoke with Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa Programme at Chatham House. And I asked her about the differences between Harris and Trump when it comes to the Middle East. Here she is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So I would imagine that if Vice President Kamala Harris wins, there will be much more of a double down on calling time on the war in Lebanon but also the war in Gaza. Donald Trump's approach is a bit more ambiguous. He is not someone that is generally supportive of war. But he and his team could see this as a historic opportunity to continue to degrade these terrorists and Iran backed groups around the region. But at the same time, there could be a longer tail and blowback for the United States through those efforts. (END VIDEO CLIP) (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Do you think the likelihood of a deal depends on who wins the White House? GIDEON LEVY, COLUMNIST, \"HA'ARETZ\":  It depends much. I mean, first of all, it depends on one other person, namely Benjamin Netanyahu. But it depends much on the next president, because the United States is the only one who has the leverage, which they didn't use until now unfortunately. So they have the leverage to bring a cease-fire. And it depends if the next elected president will want to use the leverage or he will refuse to do it, like President Biden did.",

Should Palestinians hope for a Trump victory because perhaps he would have more of a relationship with Netanyahu? Or hope for a Harris victory because she might be more likely to support their cause?

But none of them is really going to solve it once and for all, namely, to give the Palestinians their rights and solve the problem. I don't see it coming from Donald Trump.
