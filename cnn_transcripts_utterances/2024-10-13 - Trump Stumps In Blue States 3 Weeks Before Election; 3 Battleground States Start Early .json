And then he will step into that consular-in-chief role as he greets first responders and also many of the people impacted by this storm. And all of this, of course, comes after he signed a major disaster declaration for Florida that unlocks some additional federal funding. But as he has said, Congress is still going to need to step up and pass additional aid because this has just been a very challenging hurricane season. So as you mentioned, he has said that some of this recovery from this storm in particular was easier because of infrastructure investments made on his watch as president. And to that end, he is going to announce an additional $612 million in funding that's from the Department of Energy for projects aimed at bolstering the electric grid. About $94 million of that is going to Florida. And the aim here is really to create more resiliency for that electric grid when there are major disasters just like this one and we're seeing more extreme weather due to climate change.

We are getting that troubling warning now from the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, essentially telling the U.N. peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon to get out. He directed that video message earlier today to the U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres, saying it is time for you to remove UNIFIL from Hezbollah's strongholds and combat zones.He has previously said that he believes the UNIFIL presence there is aimed at providing a human shield for Hezbollah. Now, again, this is a sort of rhetoric that we have heard in the past with regards to the situation in Gaza and, of course, in Lebanon, often with regards to areas that are known to be densely populated with civilians. And, I mean, this is a presence by the U.N. peacekeeping missions that has been in place for decades. They have been in place along the blue line separating Lebanon and Israel since 2000. The mission's aim there is, of course, focused on ensuring and maintaining Israel's withdrawal from Israeli territory. And now, of course, we are seeing the deepening ground incursion by Israeli troops inside Lebanese territory. And we've heard previously from the U.N. peacekeeping mission rejecting any calls for them to be redeployed across Lebanon. They have maintained their positions there. But, of course, just in the last few days, we have seen already a number of U.N. peacekeepers coming under attack and being injured as a result. On Thursday, UNIFIL reporting that two peacekeepers were injured as a result of Israeli tank fire on Friday. Another two injured as a result of two explosions, which took place around an observation point. And later on, Friday, another peacekeeper injured as a result of gunfire. And of course, in addition to that, we are seeing also other volunteers being injured, two Red Cross volunteers who work in coordination with this U.N. peacekeeping mission also injured as a result of Israeli strikes in Southern Lebanon. So, this is a deeply troubling and concerning situation if we are, indeed, seeing now U.N. peacekeepers coming under attack. This has been condemned by the nations which represent the peacekeeping mission on the ground. At least 40 countries, signatories of a statement condemning and expressing deep concern over these latest developments, including the U.K., Spain, Germany, India, France, all expressing condemnation there. There has also been concern, of course, from the Biden administration. We've heard from the defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, speaking to his Israeli counterpart, Yoav Gallant, again, expressing deep concern. The Israeli military has said it will be conducting a thorough review, but that came ahead of this latest statement from Prime Minister Netanyahu. It is a troubling warning. And, of course, as we've seen in Gaza, in the occupied West Bank, we have seen U.N. workers, we have seen health care workers, and volunteers coming under attack by the Israeli military, often with impunity. So, this is a deeply troubling development. A lot of focus will be on this. And, of course, the situation Lebanon for civilians across the border in the country is only growing more desperate.",

If escalation comes, they are ready for a big fight. That's something quite frankly, Victor, that we've heard from a lot of people that we've been speaking to on the ground here, a lot of Iranian officials that we've been speaking to on the ground as well. And one of the things that the Iranians have also said is that they say that if there is an attack by Israel, Iran will retaliate no matter on what that attack is. The Iranians are saying that they have conveyed that message to the countries here in this region, but also specifically to the United States. Of course, Iran and the U.S. do not have any direct diplomatic relations with one another. So, that would happen by intermediaries. But it's clearly a fairly clear message that the Iranians say that they're trying to send. One of the interesting things that we also picked up on as well, Victor, is that the (INAUDIBLE) commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps, which is, of course, the elite wing of Iran's military, said that if the Israelis, for instance, attack oil and gas installations in Iran, a lot of those --",

Washington, D.C., the high today is 83, by the time we get to Tuesday, they won't even make it to 60 for that high temperature. And it's going to infect a lot of other areas too.
