      "sentences": "Well, Max, there were two rounds of strikes over the weekend, and officials say they were actually unrelated.So, on Friday night, there was the strikes by the U.S. on Iraq and Syria, which targeted 85 different targets in the countries. And we are told that, according to a preliminary battlefield damage assessment, 84 of those targets were \"destroyed or functionally damaged\". And that is a preliminary assessment. They're going to continue to try to assess just how much of the facilities that they targeted were degraded in these strikes because they targeted weapons storage facilities, command and control centers used by groups like Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as well as Iran-backed militants that have been using them to attack U.S. and coalition forces in Iraq and Syria. So, they broadly believed that those strikes were successful. And then on Saturday night, you have the separate round of strikes by the U.S. and the UK on Iran-backed Houthis inside Yemen, targeting weaponry and supplies and weapon depots used by the Houthis as well as helicopters and radar systems that they have been using to attack commercial shipping in the Red Sea. Now, the U.S. says at this point that the attacks on the Iran-backed militias in Iraq and Syria are going to continue because the militias launched a drone attack at a U.S. outpost in Jordan last month that killed three U.S. service members. And the U.S. says that it has not done retaliating for that attack. And so, it remains to be seen just what that response is going to look like. But, National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said last week that we should expect additional action in the coming days. The big question now, of course, is whether the U.S. has been able to destroy a significant amount of the weaponry and supplies and facilities that the Iranians and their militias are using to conduct these attacks? That really remains to be seen, as they continue this analysis of what they destroyed. But, as of right now, we are told that for the U.S. to strike inside Iran directly that remains extremely unlikely because the U.S. has repeated many times that they do not want to go to war with Iran, Max.",

And we know that already about 300 millimeters of rainfall has fallen on top of the mountains just to the north of Los Angeles proper. Now, Los Angeles had three to five inches, so somewhere 150 millimeters of rainfall. And yes, there was some street flooding. The danger right now is that water that's on top of the mountain in the rivers, creeks and streams getting collected and rushing down through Los Angeles County, all the water from up there, and we were talking about 3,000 meters up there, all has to get down into the Pacific Ocean eventually, and waters are still rising.We talked to a police officer earlier today, and as somebody went right through the barrier on a closed road and it was like, nope, you're not doing that. And the policeman right after said, you cannot go there. Do not put yourself in danger. Don't put us in danger having to rescue you. And that's the real issue right now. By the time this is done and it's still raining in many spots north of LA, there will be 400 millimeters of rainfall that has fallen in just about 24 hours. There is not any area with mountains that can handle that type of rain and have it soak in. It has to and it is running off, and those mountains with the dirt, sliding mudslides, it is a dangerous situation going on right now just to the north of Los Angeles proper. In the Hollywood Hills, in the Pacific Palisades, where people put very big homes on very big cliffs, and those cliffs are dirt. They're not rock. So, sometimes that dirt turns into mud and the mud begins to slide. Max.",

      "sentences": "What's really fascinating here is that the border communities, like the one that I'm in here in Eagle Pass, really see the impact, Max, because while U.S. Congress fails to act, the state of Texas is the one that is taking matters into its own hands. And what does that look like on the ground?Let me show you, because here in Eagle Pass, there is razor wire along the Rio Grande, and in a public park. And just to give you an idea of what this looks like and means for people here, imagine if you have - you are at Central Park, wherever it is that you live around the world, and all of a sudden the state wraps razor wire around it. They put up gates, and there are soldiers with long guns patrolling, and you don't have access to those green spaces anymore because your governor says that he is stopping illegal immigration, which is really not true. And I can tell you because I've witnessed this. Yes, this razor wire goes along the Rio Grande for several miles, but then it ends. And what we've learned from law enforcement sources is that smugglers simply go to the end of the razor wire and that's where they're still smuggling people into the United States. So, it doesn't stop the problem, even though the governor here claims that it does. And Max, so long as Congress doesn't act, we're going to see more and more of this. As a matter of fact, this weekend, about a dozen governors from across the United States visited with Governor -- Texas Governor Greg Abbott here in Eagle Pass, at Shelby Park, this park, this was taken over by the state, not only to support the governor for doing all of this, but saying that states should do more to enforce border security. Now, here in the United States, the U.S. Supreme Court has upheld that immigration is a federal function, meaning that it's federal law enforcement who should be enforcing the laws. And here is what's curious about all of this, Max, is that Texas is not allowing federal law enforcement officers inside this area which is -- leads to the Rio Grande, which is where migrants usually come in and a lot of the times turn themselves into immigration authorities. The state doesn't allow the federal government, the federal law enforcement agencies to go into this area. And so even though the state of Texas is saying that the federal government is not enforcing federal laws, well, the question is, if you don't allow the federal government on the river, how can they enforce federal laws? So, we're going to have to see what happens in Washington, Max, regarding this bill. As you mentioned, the House Speaker Mike Johnson has already said that it's dead on arrival in the House. So, we'll have to see. Max, back to you.",
