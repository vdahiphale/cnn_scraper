Honestly, John, within minutes of arriving at this facility, there was a large strike nearby, and about 10 minutes after that, we saw the first casualties of that strike arriving at the hospital, man and a young boy of 13 years old who had both lost part of their legs.The doctor said it is like that all day, every day, sometimes 20 strikes a day. And you're talking about one single area of Gaza. We also talk to children who have been severely injured, often maimed due to the ferocity of the bombardment there. It was truly harrowing and horrifying, honestly. At the end of it, of course, we had the privilege of leaving. Most Gazans, of course, do not. And of course, most importantly, Gazan journalists who have been dying in record numbers doing heroic work to cover this story also, do not have the luxury of leaving the Gaza Strip, not that they would want to, they're very committed in doing the incredible work they have been doing. But it was a short, however, very illuminating window onto the hellscape that is Gaza right now, John.",

SARA SIDNER, CNN NEWS CENTRAL CO-ANCHOR:  Now, to a war on another front. Russian President Vladimir Putin, making clear his stance, has not changed on his war with Ukraine. In his end-of-year news conference since the country's invasion into Ukraine, he said that if Ukraine does not stand down and accept Russia's terms then Moscow will have to solve the problem by force. Putin said, the goals of his so- called special military operation in Ukraine have not changed. Joining us now for more analysis on this is Former U.S. Ambassador to NATO Kurt Volker. Thank you, Sir, so much for coming in. You know, you have this morning President Putin, sort of, coming out and, sort of, staying with his same stance that he's been talking about. Saying, there will be no peace in Ukraine when we achieve our objectives, which is denazification, demilitarization and its neutral status. Those are his words. What is your takeaway from his language here and the fact that he's talking about bolstering the army as well? KURT VOLKER, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO NATO, FORMER U.S. SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE FOR UKRAINE NEGOTIATIONS AND DISTINGUISHED FELLOW, CENTER FOR EUROPEAN POLICY ANALYSIS (CEPA):  Yes. Well, there are a couple of things in that. First off, we have to remember that he just announced, of course, that he is running for president again next year. And so, he is trying to convey a position of strength and confidence and success to the Russian people on that kind of New Year's or Christmas message. The other thing he's trying to do is take advantage of the uncertainty that we see in the west right now. The E.U. having difficulty passing their aid package for Ukraine. Maybe or maybe not granting a session talks for Ukraine for E.U. membership. The difficulty we're having in the U.S. of passing the aid for Ukraine as well. He's trying to play on that theme by projecting confidence and strength on the Russian side while the west is having difficulties. That's meant to convey to the Ukrainians a sense of hopelessness and fear, and is trying to convey to the west that why that are you bothering to do this because we're in such a strong position. Doesn't mean any of this is true. I think they're in far worse shape that he is projecting, but he's projecting this for his own purposes.",

That seems to be playing out. I mean, how much damage is this doing to the west, to the United States, to the European Union to watch this play out like this?",

Sometimes it takes time. Sometimes we have to hash out other issues. Sometimes there are disagreements. But at the end of the day, we are far stronger than Russia, and we are far more committed to our values and our interests and able to realize them.You know, one thing that was brought home to me just a week or two ago in meetings in Europe was a reminder that the United States and Europe together, have an economy that is 22 times the size of Russia's. And yet we have committed about equal amounts as Russia to the war in Ukraine. That means we have a lot more capacity than we could draw on, and that Russia is really maxing out. Almost 45 percent of its budget now is going toward this war. That's an extraordinary amount and not sustainable.",

As President Putin was speaking, we noticed that behind him, on the screens behind him at times, there were some flashing questions. Most of the things were innocuous. They were praise worthy of him. But one of them started flashing, saying, when will Russians stop killing Russians? Should we read anything into this? This is flashing behind him while he's making this big grand speech and taking on the Kremlin, really, and him.",

They've added more patrols and they're trying to find the suspect.This morning, a dozen people stranded off the coast of the Dominican Republic. They are now safe, thanks in part to a carnival cruise ship. The captain got an emergency alert about a small cargo vessel that capsized. He altered the cruise ship's course, sailed to the site. They rescued six of the crew members who were clinging to a life raft. The captain then saw more people in the water holding onto pieces of what was left of their boat. Notified the Coast Guard. They sent a helicopter and rescue swimmer to pull the remaining six people out of the water. Kate.",

Announcing trial data is showing real benefits for high-risk melanoma patients.CNN's Meg Tirrell has much more on this. Meg, I'm seeing just a few details of what your reporting is on this. I'm fascinated. What exactly did this trial find? MEG TIRRELL, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes. So, you know, just as Moderna makes the mRNA vaccine for COVID, this is a very similar approach but for people with melanoma. And so, this is an individualized treatment where they're actually looking at what is driving each person's cancer and then designing a vaccine to deliver to them that will recruit their immune system to better fight that cancer. And what they found now in three-year follow up data is that three years out from that treatment, combined with an existing immunotherapy called Keytruda, they can reduce the risk of the cancer coming back or of the patients dying by 49 percent versus just using Keytruda alone. And so, the real key here is that they're seeing that result out to three years because previously we'd just seen two-year follow up data. So, it's being seen as a very promising approach to really improving outcomes in this high-risk melanoma, Kate.",

He was saying they're preparing potentially to have this available if they get accelerated approval as soon as 2025.
