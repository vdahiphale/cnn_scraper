It's not an easy route for 4,000 of the members of the armed forces to take part here. There's a sharp corner at Trafalgar Square for carriages and horses. What is special is remembering King Charles' relationship with the armed forces. With the death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth, he became the commander in chief. He also has personal links with all of the armed forces. He was trained by the RAF. He served with the Royal Navy. And on being made colonel in chief of the Elite Parachute Regiment, he actually decided he wanted to go through the training of that as well so he could look soldiers in the eye. So he earned the respect of the military that he's commander of chief of. Today will be spectacular. There will be 200 in the Sovereign Escort from Buckingham Palace to Westminster Abbey.

Following that, the crown will be placed on his head, St. Edwards crown. As I said, the act of homage, we'll see Prince William step up and pay homage to his father and the Archbishop of Canterbury. Then we'll have a public declaration from the general public here. I think we're seeing the doors -- someone is standing by to open it. That's coming from inside the abbey. No one on the outside. But as I say, these sacred moments, within the service, the things to look out for. Also, the involvement of the members of royal family. We know Prince George will be in attendance. He will be actively playing a role in the service. We're also going to have the crowning of the queen consort.

The king has to swear an oath by law to uphold the Church of England but he sees himself as a multifaith monarch.And we have the chief rabbi. Allowances have been made to allow him to keep the Sabbath and still attend the coronation. We have representatives from the Muslim faith and of Hinduism, of Sikhism. We have representatives of the Orthodox Church and something that isn't surprising now but would have been surprising 70 years ago, representatives of the Catholic Church.",

It's the only time he'll wear that crown. It's then removed and taken back to Tower of London.He'll then wear the imperial state crown going forward. So that's a special moment. It goes back to 1,000 years of history. It was created in 1661. But I'm also looking forward to the multifaith elements. It's so important to see the different communities. In the most recent census, England and Wales was 46 percent Christian. So to bring in the other faiths is really important.",

It's a normal day, just like any other in Lagos.There's a sense that the British monarchy is not really relevant to the lives of Africans and particularly young people; 70 percent of people here in sub-Saharan Africa are under 30. And there just a sense, a growing disconnect between these populations and the monarchy. There's not a lot of relevance to their lives. We have a Nigerian artist performing at the coronation. She's very popular here. Besides that, people aren't that interested. They're just going about their daily lives. There's more pressing issues they have to get on with. For them, it's a great day for England but not really something I have to concern myself with. Of course, some African leaders are attending, Cyril Ramaphosa alongside other high profile African leaders. Beyond the political and diplomatic ties, there's a sense it's a day like any other here.",

At least eight of them have accepted immunity. The rest face legal exposure. The DA said she will charge Trump and his allies between July 11th and September 1st. Portions of his video deposition from E. Jean Carroll's civil lawsuit are public. He is being accused of battery and defamation from an incident in the '90s. The tapes have been played in front of the jury. Trump has denied allegations, saying that Carroll was, \"not his type.\" At one point, as he answers questions from Carroll's lawyers, Trump mistakes an old photo of Carroll for his second wife, Marla Maples.
