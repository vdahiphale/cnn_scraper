Kicking off a bus tour with Tim Walz, in a place that Joe Biden was struggling to keep on the map. We'll tell you why they're making a push all over the Peach State.Plus, he's got to pay a price. That's what Nancy Pelosi said about Donald Trump, as she was evacuating the Capitol while rioters stormed the building. It's part of brand-new video from January 6, you'll see only on CNN. And don't leave a blank space on your ballot. Democratic Swifties are trying to get out the vote for Vice President Harris. But the question they can't shake off will miss Americana herself get on board. I'm Manu Raju. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. We start with Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, taking the afternoon bus through Georgia. Their first joint campaign swing since becoming the official nominees. The vice president and her running mate, think they'll put the pivotal state of Georgia back in play after Democrats began writing it off when Joe Biden was at the top of the ticket. Harris is flying into Savannah this afternoon, and she and walls will make stops today in southern Georgia, far from deep blue cities like Atlanta. And tomorrow night, Harris will hold a big rally in Savannah. But first, she and Tim Walz will sit down with Dana Bash for an exclusive interview, her first in months and her in Walz's first joint interview. And before heading to Georgia, Walz took the campaign's message to Boston for a convention of firefighters. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. TIM WALZ (D-MN), 2024 VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We know exactly who built this country. It's people like the folks in this room. Words are cheap, actions is all you should care about. Make sure you're counting on what was delivered. When Donald Trump was president, he blocked overtime benefits for millions of workers. He opposed efforts to raise the minimum wage, and he even proposed slashing budgets for federal fire service programs. Those are just simply facts. But look, it's not just what they've done, it's what they're going to do. This is the big thing. One of the goals of their Project 2025 is to screw the middle class. Look, I've said this, I'm an all-time football coach. If you draw up a playbook, you plan on using it. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, it's a little bit of a barbell strategy. It's been described as a rural bus tour through Georgia. But remember, Savannah has a population of 150,000 people, so she's trying to have her cake and eat it too. Hit Savannah and then go across the southern part of the state of Georgia, because narrowing the margins in rural counties is paramount for this campaign. It's borrowing from the Biden playbook from 2020.That's one of the ways that he was able to win states like Georgia and win some of those blue wall states as well. And there have long been democratic ad buyers who have had entire strategies built around, perhaps not winning some of these rural counties, but just narrowing the margin enough to try to tip those scales. And it's played out for Harris personally, behind the scenes too. I'm told by some Harris aides that early on in the Biden administration, when they were discussing potential personnel appointments, that she raised some objections to the appointment of Tom Vilsack at the agriculture department because he'd already done the job for eight years. And she said, it's voters in rural America, in the south, especially farmers of color who helped deliver some of those states for Biden. Biden eventually won out with that argument, saying this massive, sprawling agency is operating remotely with a massive budget, we need someone who knows the building inside and out. So obviously, Vilsack has been there. But she feels very strongly about the importance of voters in the American south, specifically those rural voters enrolled voters of color.",

Listen, I am from the black rural south, a very small town in South Carolina. This is also part of the Stacey Abrams strategy, right? She is somebody who would go to those rural counties as well and try to swell the ranks of the black southerners in those rural counties. And then, you know, maybe attract some of these rural white -- white southerners as well. I think somebody like Tim Walz can connect particularly with those white southerners in those rural small towns. He's sort of from a small town in Nebraska. So, I think his story will play well there. You know, she's got the personnel to do it. Not only as Tim Walz, but with Clinton (Ph) folks who was there, who kind of perfected this strategy with Raphael Warnock in those small towns too. So, it's very smart, Georgia, obviously, very much in play. It wasn't in play under Biden. Even though he was nearly able to win in 2020. They're trying to replicate what he was able to do.",

Biden ran up the score in urban parts of the state. 35 points he won the state. According to exit polls in Georgia from 2020, Trump did win suburban Georgia, but not by as much as he needed to there.In rural America, he won by 39 points. The Georgia 2016 exit polls had Clinton winning more of the urban areas, but Trump winning, you know, about the same the Trump era in the rural areas. Trump doing better in the suburbs when Clinton was on the map. But this is similar to the other state strategy, right? Like they want to do better, run up the score in big cities like Philadelphia or Detroit and not do as bad in places where they've traditionally struggled.",

But you've seen lower-level media attention to way is that -- which Republicans empowered election deniers, people who didn't want 2020 to be to be affirmed and to be sent to the Electoral College that they have more power in the system now.So, there are a lot of interlocking messages the Harris campaign gets into by going to Georgia. I mean, they wanted to go here in the first tour got canceled because of weather. But they also back up a step -- a step to, Donald Trump has not had in 2016 or 2020 to run against a Democratic campaign that had enthusiasm, kind of everywhere. Hillary Clinton could not go to rural Georgia and get a big crowd. Couldn't go a lot of places get a big crowd. Joe Biden couldn't try because of COVID. He was going to big cities for car rallies, and that was it. So, this is -- their opening a front that Donald Trump has not had to compete with before ever in three runs for president too.",

But there has been some polling that has been taken since the Democratic convention last week. The first really that we've seen, we expect a wave of more polling to get a sense of where this race is right now. The question about the economy, of course, central to this election, central to pretty much every single election. Trump was winning in the aftermath of the RNC. Trump versus Harris in late July, up by 11, three points now, according to the Reuters/Ipsos poll -- Reuters/Ipsos poll.

But he keeps under the mind the message.I think that interview with Dr. Phil, though, is also part of this other thing the Trump campaign is doing every day, hammering home the message that Harris is not doing enough interviews. Trump is doing a ton, but they're usually with people who are asking him -- I wouldn't say, friendly softball questions, but getting in his comfort zone.
