It's about rule of law in their country, they had to give that.Norway had to give someone up, a prisoner, without getting someone in return, right? So this -- and this fits in with Biden's theory of the U.S. role in the war and the importance of alliances. That alliances are not purely transactional, as someone else currently running for president has often treated them and described them as in Donald Trump. That they involve long term relationships over time, where you give, they give, sometimes not at the same time and that by relying on each other together, you're stronger. It's a demonstration. And you see it and this is a real tangible result of those alliances in the freedom of these Americans.",

It really reinforces the human aspect of what this deal was all about. You know, Alsu Kurmasheva, a U. S. Russian journalist who's part of this prisoner swap. It's an immensely happy, euphoric moment for her family and, of course, the family of Evan Gershkovich and Paul Whelan and Vladimir Kara-Murza and all the others that are part of this swap.And so in that sense, it really is a big, you know, Biden tactical victory. But I think it's hard to escape the fact that strategically this is handed Putin a win. And it's a sort of validation of his strategy of taking bargaining chips and then using them to extract as many concessions as possible from the United States and from the West at large. And that's certainly what's taken place. And this -- of course, there's no guarantee that Putin won't continue with that in the future as well. In terms of my contacts and what people in Russia are saying, well, it is remarkable. And I've obviously been texting people for the past couple of days trying to get them to comment on this and I'm getting really virtually nothing back. There has been something posted on Telegram by Dmitry Medvedev, who's the former Russian president, and he's, you know, he's become, you know, kind of very vitriolic and hard line in his stance. And he said this, I'd like to -- the traitors of Russia to rot in a dungeon, but sometimes it's more useful for them to bring our own people home. And so that's his justification for the Russians undertaking this swap, Dana.",

These are some conversations that Vice President Harris had going back a number of months, particularly the Munich Security Conference that the Vice President attended back in February. You'll recall that she did have a meeting with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.I'm told by a White House official that there was a moment when the meeting was wrapping up that she asked all of the staff in the room to vacate the room, and really asked for a restricted bilateral meeting. That means just one aide on each side remained in the room. And it was in this private conversation with the Chancellor that the Vice President really stressed the importance of Vadim Krasikov as a part of this deal. This, of course, is the Russian assassin who was being held in Germany that U.S. officials now say was sort of the biggest fish that the Russians were going after. So this was a push that she had made back in February with the German Chancellor. And then there was a separate meeting that the Vice President asked for at the same Munich conference with the Slovenian prime minister. And we are told that the main point of this meeting was for her to press the prime minister on moving forward with the release of two Russian nationals that were in Slovenian custody. Top priority for the Russians, as the U.S. officials had determined at the time. When you look at the readouts of those meetings from back in February, Dana, they didn't mention discussions about this potential prisoner swap, which gets to the point of how sensitive and private those conversations were. And we should just finally know, you know, as Vice President Harris is now out there campaigning for the presidency, this is sort of the ongoing work that she would inherit if she were to win the campaign for the White House. Of course, as we sort of watch the celebration of this moment and the release of those four Americans and four people that were -- the families that were here at the White House, we should just again remind everyone that it is also a bittersweet day for other Americans who still have loved ones that are abroad. Certainly we expect the Vice President to continue talking about that cause as well, Dana.",
