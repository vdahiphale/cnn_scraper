It is just over 11 -- just after 11It has been 17 days since the horrific terrorist attacks by Hamas caught this country, and frankly, most of the world by surprise. Setting off a cascade of responses, consequences, that now includes a humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Tonight, we're hearing, for the very first time, from one of the hostages kidnapped and just released by Hamas about what she endured. Hamas held 85-year-old Yocheved Lifshitz captive for more than two weeks. It's an experience she described as going through hell. Speaking in Hebrew at a hospital here in Tel Aviv earlier today, she describes how Hamas beat her as they forced her into Gaza. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YOCHEVED LIFSHITZ, FREED HOSTAGE (through translator): It was a painful act. They brought us into the hutch of a tunnel. On the way, I was lying on the side on the motorbike. Legs to one side, body to the other. The Shabaab were hitting me, so they didn't break my ribs, but it was very painful and made it difficult for me to breathe. (INAUDIBLE) (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Israel has, so far, held off on a ground incursion into Gaza. While those talks appear to be playing out, but that does not mean that Israel's missiles have stopped flying.

It's a reminder that Hamas is not stopped trying to reduce Israeli civilian population centers to rubble. In fact, Hamas has fired about 7,000 missiles at Israel, according to the IDF, on and since October 7th.Now, the Iron Dome defense system stops most of those Hamas rockets, but not all of them. The IDF has since, of course, returned fire. Israel is, without question, tragically killing innocent Palestinians. As it, says it is targeting Hamas. But the fact that Tel Aviv does not look like Gaza isn't for lack of trying by Hamas, and the fact that Israel civilian death toll is not far higher, again, not for a lack of trying by Hamas. The difference is the Iron Dome. The IDF is, right now, prepared for a ground incursion. The air campaign has limitations, because Hamas operates inside a vast array of tunnels beneath Gaza. It's a sophisticated underground layer that one of the just released hostages described as a spider's web of tunnels. I want to bring in CNN's Clarissa Ward who's live in Cairo, Egypt. Clarissa, let's start with these hostages negotiations. Has Israel said how long it will delay its ground invasion to try and get more hostages released?",

They will not be able to continue their operations. In addition to that, Jake, multiple hospitals now saying that they are going to be forced to shut down. According to the World Health Organization, six hospitals have already been forced to shut down, because they don't have fuel to power the generators that they need to keep their operations moving. Another two hospitals have been forced to partially shut down, or shut down parts of their hospitals because of the desperation for the need for fuel. Now, earlier on today, we heard the head of the IDF come out, and he said that they were working on a mechanism to try to get fuel to those hospitals, and to ensure, or into Gaza Strip as part of this humanitarian aid, but to ensure that Hamas never got their hands on it. Then, literally, just a few hours later, a spokesperson for the IDF came out and said, no fuel, it's not happening, and we can't allow to happen, because Hamas will take it and use it for military operations. So, you have a complete impasse here and everyone warning, really issuing a siren at the stage, Jake, that this could have disastrous consequences if there's not movement on it by tomorrow.",

Just this morning, former Trump attorney Jenna Ellis pleaded guilty to a count of aiding and abetting false statements. This follows guilty pleas from Trump campaign lawyer Sidney Powell, pro-Trump attorney Kenneth Chesebro, and Georgia bail bondsman Scott Hall. Jenna Ellis earlier today delivered a tearful statement in court in which she threw Trump under the bus for her actions.

I relied on others, including lawyers with many more years of experience than I to provide me with true and reliable information.
