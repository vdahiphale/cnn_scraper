Vice President Harris is speaking live, this hour, as we are digging into brand-new polling on that critical blue wall of Wisconsin, Michigan and of course, Pennsylvania. And meanwhile, Donald Trump in a garbage truck, and wearing an orange vest, as the former President is trying to keep the focus on President Biden's garbage remark, from last night, and recreate a moment from the 2016 campaign trail. Also, that Georgia election official, who Trump pressured to find him 11,000 votes that did not exist for him, has a new plan to fight back tonight against bogus lawsuits and threats against officials. He'll join me live, this hour. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. We are expecting to see Vice President Harris on this stage shortly, in Madison, Wisconsin, not just the home of the famed Camp Randall football stadium, but also a critical voting area for Democrats, where college students could help put her over the top, in that state. She's rallying just a few hours south of where we saw Donald Trump earlier, wearing that vest, and also with Brett Favre in Green Bay. As Harris and Trump are making their closing pitches, in Wisconsin, we're getting brand-new numbers tonight from that blue wall that includes Wisconsin, including numbers that show Harris is just ahead of Trump there, just outside the margin of error, 51 percent to 45 percent. We're going to get more to this brand-new polling in a moment, including the all-important Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, where Donald Trump tonight is baselessly claiming there's widespread cheating underway. And if history is any guide, as far as Trump is concerned, as we know, sowing doubt about the vote now will help him raise hell later, if things don't go his way. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We'll get into the irony of Donald Trump wanting more mail-in voting, after, of course, he spent years trashing it and discouraging people from doing so.

I was in Michigan, last weekend. I'm from there. I was there visiting. I got to tell you, I talked to people on the ground. They were feeling very good about the canvassing. They were feeling very good about some of the turnout models that were happening. They're feeling better about the early vote. Now, a month ago, that wasn't the case. People were feeling a little more skeptical about what was going to happen. But the campaign has done a lot of work, over the over the course of a very short period of time. Remember, she wasn't even the nominee three months -- four months ago. So, they've had to basically rebuild the campaign around her.
