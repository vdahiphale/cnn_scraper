It includes the cities of Orlando and Tampa. The severe storms could bring large hail and damaging wind gusts. Brazil's President Lula da Silva is expected to visit the state of Rio Grande do Sul today. At least 149 people have died from recent flooding and more than 800 others have been injured. The grandson of former U.S. President Jimmy Carter said Tuesday that he is, quote, coming to the end. Carter has been in hospice care for nearly a year and a half. At the age of 99, he is the oldest living U.S. President in history. U.S. President Joe Biden currently increasing tariffs on $18 billion worth of imports from China to counter what the White House calls unfair trade practices by Beijing. The new tariffs apply to a range of products such as steel and aluminum, electric vehicles, battery components, solar cells, cranes and medical products. Electric vehicles will see the biggest hike, going from about 27 percent to 100 percent. It's meant to challenge Beijing's practice of encouraging very low pricing by domestic EV makers while charging a 40 percent tariff on U.S. car imports to China. Here's President Biden.

And Chinese relies on other anti-competitive tactics as well, like forcing American companies to transfer their technology in order to do business in China.Sometimes it's just outright steal through cyber espionage and other means. And it's been a well-documented and internationally recognized. And when you make tactics like these, you're not competing. It's not competition, it's cheating. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "That's right, Max. So far, their rhetoric has been quite predictable. Strong protest, firm opposition accusing Washington of politicizing trade issues.And, of course, they have promised so far unspecified countermeasures against these new tariffs. But if you talk to Chinese officials and analysts, many of them do understand election year politics in the U.S. And many of them say this is simply Biden's posturing aimed at key voters in swing states, especially those union workers in the Rust Belt. So the question becomes whether or not they will take that into consideration when they make their next move. When is their retaliation going to be symbolic? But when you look at the numbers, $18 billion, quadrupling of current tariff rates, they are very eye-catching. But in the bigger scheme of things, this is only some 4 percent of all of Chinese imports into the U.S. So we're not likely to see an immediate major impact on bilateral trade. The deeper concern here is actually whether other Western economies, especially fellow G7 members, would follow suit and impose something similar. That could actually potentially have a bigger impact, considering, for example, the Chinese EV industry's much bigger footprint in Europe. And, of course, Max, they're not looking at this in a vacuum from Beijing. They have seen a pattern emerge after that Xi-Biden summit last year. The U.S. keep adding more Chinese companies on their entity list because of alleged ties to the Russian defense industrial base and more export controls targeting China and now these tariffs. So the worry is whether this latest announcement could jeopardize this whole relationship that has just recently been stabilized -- Max.",

And their so-called no-limit partnership has really withstood the test of times, which is in a way surprising to a lot of people, considering the challenges.But the one thing that's been proven time and again is their bilateral trade, for example, soaring. They see a lot of benefits in strengthening these bonds. [04:35:00] And the question right now for the Chinese leadership, especially Xi Jinping, is whether this so-called straddle strategy that is forming this very close strategic bond with Russia while trying to maintain massive trade relationship with the West, that can be sustained in the long run, especially considering a lot of European countries are very worried about Putin's policy and strategy undermining the core of European security -- Max.",

The island has seen its worst unrest in decades in response to a bill in Paris which would give more French nationals in New Caledonia the right to vote. Pro- independence groups feel it's an attempt by France to consolidate power over the Pacific island chain. More than 130 people have been arrested in the protests. Dozens of security officers have been injured. Demonstrators have set fire to buildings and cars, and a curfew is in place until Thursday. French President Emmanuel Macron will chair a Defence and National Security Council meeting this morning to discuss the ongoing violence over there.

In the U.S., more than 200 tornadoes have already been reported this month alone, and for the year, the active tornado season thus far is the second busiest on record to date. There's also deadly flooding around the world, claiming hundreds of lives in Afghanistan, Indonesia, Brazil and Argentina. Meanwhile, crews in Canada are battling more than 130 active wildfires, over 40 of which are out of control. Most are burning in the western provinces of Alberta and British Columbia, where tens of thousands of hectares have been scorched.

One quite dramatic video shows two hooded individuals who look like they're carrying long rifles. Now, the Justice Minister has said that everything will be done to find the perpetrators. But what do we know about the prisoner? Well, he's 30 years old and he was in prison because he had been convicted of burglary. He's also being investigated for a kidnapping that resulted in a death, according to the national prosecutor. Now, there are currently several hundred police officers that have been deployed in the manhunt and authorities on the scene have set up roadblocks.
