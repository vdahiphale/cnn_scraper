But we do know that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, known as NHTSA, is now investigating these two really terrifying incidents that you laid out when the steering wheels on these 2023 Model Y SUVs completely detached. They actually came off while the cars was being driven.Now, in those cases, the cars were actually delivered to the owners without a certain bolt that attaches the wheel to the steering column, which is why that steering wheel was able to come off so easily. Now, fortunately, there were no crashes or injuries in those incidents. There were, however, three other Model Ys that were found in dealer inventories that were also missing those bolts. Now, how that happened and how many other cars like that are out there, we just don't know that at this point. That's what investigators are looking at. And to be clear, at this point it is not a recall. This is an investigation. But it could impact 120,000 SUVs if a recall does eventually happen. And, Erica, Jim, Tesla is not the only car maker to be clear that's dealt with a problem like this. Nissan is also recalling more than a thousand SUVs for a missing bolt on its steering wheel. But, obviously, Tesla's safety features have been under the microscope.",

Yesterday he appeared to calm investor concerns a bit by saying the Fed hadn't yet made a decision about more rate hikes.Economist Lara Rhame joining us now with more. So, when we look at all of this, what also stood out was, he hinted, perhaps, at 50 basis points. You say that gives him a little bit of wiggle room. I know you would like to see him stay the course, slow and steady, 25 basis points, but does this also help him in these sort of - I guess the Federal Reserve's equivalent of the under promise over deliver category.

And on that score, the market keeps really testing the Fed's nerve to see if they're really serious about rate hikes.

It has a wage piece in it that, to me, is almost more important now going forward. And part of that is just the fact that we keep adding so many jobs.

I actually cringe when I hear a lot of people say, oh, it'll resolve like it did in 2011. That was bad. We had a pretty big risk off rotation. Equity markets were down. Ironically, treasuries were up. You know, treasury yields fell. But it also hit consumer confidence.This coming year, when we know that the Fed is trying to slow the economy down, that's a tough thing to manage without a recession. We need to be careful around events that could hit consumer confidence more head on. And the debt ceiling, I think is - is a kind of ripe situation for a problem like that to emerge. I don't want to be overly alarmist, but I think we need to really avoid complacency because a negotiated solution is going to be the path forward and neither side right now seems to be very interested in negotiation.",

But the Justice Department has slowly been responding to them in court in recent days saying that this sort of footage, for many, many - most of these defendants, and even Chansley at this point, it's likely immaterial. It is very likely already in the defendant's possession. They already have likely been able to see it among the thousands of hours of video that they have.
