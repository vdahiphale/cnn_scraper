      "sentences": "Carnage and catastrophe in black and white. That's tonight on NEWSNIGHT.Good evening, I'm Abby Phillip in New York. What is it like to watch chaos unfold at your feet, unable to stop it, unable to do anything but watch? Well, tonight, the world knows. This is video from the Israeli Defense Forces and that swarm, that buzzing nucleus, those are people, desperate Gazans surrounding aid trucks who are carrying food and supplies. Now this hour, 112 of those people are now dead. Hundreds more are injured as cameras caught a clear-eyed view of what this war is doing to innocents inside of Gaza. All of what you're about to watch is disturbing and it's shocking and we thought long and hard about whether to show this to you. But the brutality of what happened is inescapable. This was the scene that was surrounding that aid convoy before the disaster intervened. Palestinians huddled. Their chatter, you could hear it there over the din of the fires that they had set to keep warm, as they waited. They just wanted to eat. They wanted to feed their kids and their parents. The World Food Program was last able to deliver aid to North Gaza more than a month ago. Now, after a month without food and months scrambling for just the tiniest morsels, this convoy, 30 trucks in all, offered a rare glimmer of hope in the pitch black darkness that is now life for Palestinians in Gaza. But hope is, of course, the most fragile of things and soon the bullets shattered it. That crackle of IDF gunfire came around 4:00 in the morning. The bursts killed 20 people, and according to local journalists who were on the scene, that triggered a chain reaction, a deadly stampede of people running from danger only to stumble into even more. Some were trampled, some were run over by the trucks themselves. Now, daylight brought clarity on the catastrophe, the painful and unnerving clarity of it all. Men used donkeys to cart away corpses. From the pictures, it's hard to discern who died from Israeli gunfire and who died by stampede. When donkeys weren't an option, bystanders loaded the bodies onto pallets. They dragged them, carrying them. Men were suddenly turned into pallbearers. Inside of Gaza City, near its already hollowed out hospitals, the scale of this slaughter gets even more obvious. The floor is now a triage table. And for others, they arrived simply beyond saving. Any able-bodied person who was nearby is now a makeshift medic, blood soaking through the clothes of those trying to help, even if helping means ferrying bodies draped in white sheets. Others crouched down, heads hung in sorrow, at a row of people who help could not reach in time. This man, whose identity CNN does not know, is already beyond the grasp of that outstretched hand, seeking to give him just one more moment of comfort. CNN cannot fully confirm the Israeli account of this incident, nor can CNN confirm the Palestinian version of events. But without question, what happened here is a stain on humanity. This is how Israel has described what happened in that crowd. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. COL. PETE LERNER, IDF SPOKESPERSON:  The trucks went through. They were surrounded by hundreds of people, thousands of people, perhaps. And as they were trying to loot the goods on the trucks, it appears that the trucks continued to move forward. And this is the unfortunate reality, a mass casualty event that actually has very little or nothing to do with Israel. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The only question tonight is, is this a tipping point or will this get lost in the fog of wars, just another day, another unfortunate series of events that ended with death and without change?Joining me now, Mehdi Hasan, he's the founder of Zeteo News. It launches on Substack next month. And his book, Win Every Argument, is also out now on Paperback. Mehdi, thanks for joining us tonight. It's good to see you. Look, Israel, as we just laid out in the last few hours, have tried to frame this as a tragedy, but just not one that is their fault. The IDF says it fired warning shots to try to disperse the crowd around that convoy. Do you lend any credibility to that explanation? And from the eyes of the world, does it matter what the explanation is for what we saw unfold? MEHDI HASAN, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF AND CEO, ZETEO:  Well, Abby, thanks so much for having me on the show, and thank you for that very important, very powerful intro you did just there. In terms of believing the Israelis, I would say that it took multiple innocent black people to die at the hands of police in this country, whether it's Breonna Taylor, whether it's Freddie Gray, whether it's George Floyd, for people in our industry, Abby, to start saying, well, maybe we shouldn't just blindly believe police statements after shootings happen. And I feel that we still haven't quite reached that point in the Middle East with the Israeli military. The Israeli military tend to say things that turn out not to be true, both before Gaza, when they killed Shireen Abu Akhle, a U.S. citizen, and lied about it, or during this conflict, so many lies the Israeli military has told about, you know, a terrorist guard list under the Rantisi Hospital, a command and control center under the Al-Shifa Hospital, a documentary in Lebanon that they claimed was Palestinians faking their own wounds, so many, you can't even count. And now we are told today, well, actually, it was just a stampede, even though eyewitnesses, Abby, say that the Israelis opened fire, Israeli tanks opened fire, without warning, according to one eyewitness in the Washington Post. Doctors say that the bodies they got at the hospital, you showed the pictures of people on donkeys, were mostly bullet wounds, not stampede wounds. The Israelis opened fire on hungry people trying to get flour, it's being called a flour massacre for that reason. And you asked, is it a tipping point? I mean, in any normal world, it should be. In any other conflict, it would be, Abby. When Putin did stuff like this in Ukraine, we condemned him. When Assad did stuff like this in Syria, we condemned him. When Israel starves hundreds of thousands of people and then shoots people who go to get flour, where's the condemnation from the United States government? The State Department spokesman would not condemn Israel today. So, it's a tragedy. Is it a tipping point? I wish it was. I suspect it isn't.",

But with Trump's immunity claims in the hands of the Supreme Court, it seems that's unlikely. But we are also tonight getting a look at the fight between Trump's lawyers and the special counsel over what questions can actually be asked of people who might be on that jury. The first, do you believe 2020, the presidential election was stolen? Prosecutors want that one. The defense does not. The next question, also facing the objection from the defense, do you have any opinions, feelings or beliefs about the U.S. Department of Justice or the FBI? Prosecutors also want to know where jurors get their news. On the defense side, lawyers want to ask the jury about their personal politics. Are you registered to vote? Are you registered with a particular party affiliation? Did you vote in the 2020 presidential election? Now, Jack Smith doesn't like any of those questions, along with this, do you have any negative views about law enforcement, including the FBI, federal prosecutors, criminal defense attorneys, judges and politicians? Joining me now to discuss this, Tim Parlatore, he's a former attorney for Donald Trump, and Elie Mistal, Justice Correspondent and Columnist for The Nation, as well as host of the new podcast, Contempt of Court.

And, really, the whole point of, you know, jury selection, you want to try and find these things out and have a full picture because the last thing you want to do is to see the jury and then find out later that somebody had some prejudice that prevents them from hearing the case fairly.",

So, like while we're sitting here kind of investigating whether or not we can get a fair jury, I feel like we're slightly missing the ball that the judges and the prosecution itself might be biased, might be tainted and might be unfair based on the history that we've seen from these Republican-appointed justices over the past few months.",

Why? Because it didn't help Trump. Now, with the immunity case in D.C., we see that it's going to take them at least 130 days before they even think about hearing the case. Why? Because in that situation, delay helps Trump. And we can go back throughout history. We can go back to Bush v. Gore. We can go back to lots of different cases. We can go back to the Texas bounty hunting abortion ban thing. When the Supreme Court wants to move quickly, they move. When they don't, they don't. And it is totally fair to ask why.

CASTRO:  I think the politics of fear and resentment, time and again, not only in the United States, but in other places around the world, has shown itself to be effective sometimes. And you can try to instill fear and resentment in people. And what folks will do is take one or a few examples of immigrants who have committed crimes and imply or outright suggest that every single person is like that, that every immigrant is coming to harm Americans, to kill Americans. That is what Donald Trump is doing. And that is what has been done to other groups in this country previously. And so, they're trying to win elections that way. And we've got to be careful. And the media and politicians need to push back on it and tell the truth.",

CUPP, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  Just a few words. So, let's just call them the \"No Solutions Party\". Republicans have gone from pushing limited government to no government at all, it seems. Today's GOP lawmakers seem utterly convinced that among their many expectations as members of Congress, solving problems simply isn't one of them. Division, purity tests, owning the libs, keeping their base angry and afraid, prostrating to former President Donald Trump, unleashing the culture wars and getting re-elected are just some of the things that Republicans have decided are far more important than governing. On immigration, Republicans infamously just passed on a bipartisan deal that would have given them more than they've ever gotten on border security, including things that they've insisted are an urgent matter of national security. After Trump's Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, Republican lawmakers had no plan for addressing the reproductive health concerns of millions of women and families. And now, as that ruling also threatens to throw IVF access into a state of limbo, Republicans still have no answers other than fend for yourselves. On gun violence, Republicans have blamed everything but guns to avoid bringing any real solutions to the table. On climate change, an issue which many younger Republican voters are worried about, GOP lawmakers are more interested in removing the issue from federal oversight completely rather than on any solutions that the public sector might be able to offer. Now, we can blame Trump for a lot of this, but the party is now responding to voters that just want their grievances amplified. Being angry at the problem and explicitly not solving it has become the Republican Party platform. It's a strategy that hasn't resulted in many electoral wins over the past few years. But in running Trump again and digging in their heels, it seems the no solutions GOP is tripling down on its commitment to proudly do nothing.",
