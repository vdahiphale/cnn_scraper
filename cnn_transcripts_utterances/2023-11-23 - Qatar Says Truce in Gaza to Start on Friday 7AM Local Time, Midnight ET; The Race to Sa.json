And only the 13 names of the hostages are going to be released. Now they've been handed over to Israeli intelligence services. That is all they know. The next day will come the next day.

And he really made that point. And, frankly, that's what we've been seeing. What we did understand is that there are going to be deep negotiations that have been occurring until early this morning, and it just gives you a sense that there really had to work on the details. Not only the logistical side of things but also to figure out what both parties will actually commit to. You know, you mentioned the time and the date. So, this is really important, while we have now concrete timelines, 7:00 a.m. when it comes to local time, 4:00 p.m. is when the first hostages will be released. We also know that they gave the 4:00 p.m. hour as well for when the Palestinian prisoners are going to be released. Now, we don't know if this is going to happen concurrently, which is quite interesting because, you know, that's one of the questions we've been posing, but they say it's going to be reciprocal after hostages are released from Gaza. We don't have information on which border they will be using, you know, which crossing point they will be using. But we did get a sense that, because women and children are included and involved in this, that they will probably crossing over into Israel and, in terms of Palestinian prisoners, you, know where will that be occurring? Who will control that? What is interesting is that there is a certain level of trust that needs to come into this, and to come into play. You've got commitment from Hamas as well as Israel to stop the fighting by air and by land, which is important because it has to come together to agree on this. And the Qataris were very clear. While we have the four-day truce, the window, their endgame and they say this, our endgame here is to try to create a long-standing sustainable truce. I mean, they want to see it building momentum to create a scenario where you have more hostages released and you have a stop in the fighting. And then, of course, it's the issue of aid which we've been talking about. All those trucks waiting at Rafah border to get into the Gaza Strip.",

That's Gaza time, midnight Eastern Time, approximately nine hours later, the hostages will be released, 13 women and children, 4:00 p.m. local, 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time. So, that nine hour delay to hopefully see some kind of calm, the pause, the truths beginning, and then nine hours later, the hostage release. Just to ensure that trust. I just want to bring in White House correspondent, MJ Lee, who's been following all these developments, too, for us from Washington. MJ, when I was listening to that press conference, I was thinking about you in terms of the delays, and why we saw this period of time where we were thinking it was going to happen Thursday, it was then pushed back into Friday. And, obviously, the spokesman was questioned on that. He said he was hoping to see not any further delays. It was about nailing down the details. Our colleague Becky Anderson pushed him again and said we're further demands made? And that is what created some of the delays. He suggested that he was not aware of any further demands being made.

But I did ask him, you know, is it going to look similar to all -- or the same as the last two efforts which were, for all intents and purposes, a proof of concept, right, using the ICRC, the ICRC receiving from the hostage-takers the hostages and then taking them into their care, taking them across the border, and then obviously into Israeli hands and onwards they will go to the hospitals, and ultimately, to meet their families.

Did something sort of vaguer (ph) about the parameters of the deal sort of fall apart? But the Qatari spokesperson for his part really seemed to emphasize that this did have to do with logistics of implementing the actual process of getting these hostages out. He was very emphatic, using the word \"safety\" multiple times throughout this lengthy press conference, talking about guaranteeing the safety of the hostages as they move throughout Gaza. And, of course, he made the important and obvious point that we are talking about an area that is an active war zone right now, so implementing this release of the hostages in such a way to guarantee that the hostages will be safe, and in one piece, that that was really critical. And that was the reporting that we had from the U.S. side as well, when we were trying to get clarity on why the release of the hostages was delayed. And we were told that it cheaply came down to logistical details. They were needed to figure out the location of each of the hostages, the logistics surrounding the movements of the hostages. So I think that is where we are right now. But as we were talking about before, Julia, we really just do need to get through the next 24 hours or so. There is nothing guaranteeing that everything will go according to plan because of the many, many, many layers of the complexities that are involved. Obviously that puts the family members of these hostages that are set to come out in a really extra difficult position because all they can do right now is wait and hope that there are not extra hitches, there are not things that breakdown in the last minute. At, least at this moment in time, every indication we are getting is that the deal is still in place. The lists have been exchanged and that the hostages should be coming out within the next 24 hours or so.

But he did circle back on this when asked, he said we are in touch with all the relevant parties to make sure that this does not expand the crisis itself, the fighting doesn't expand. So, even the if they are not a party of the agreement, it seems that Qatar is well aware that there are other parties acting not necessarily on behalf of the fighting in Gaza but in a way that is related.

That remains to be seen. We will keep an eye on it. I did have a chance to speak to an IDF spokesperson about this and ask them, what is your assumption?
