Because it seemed to keep going. You know, one point we thought that perhaps there was a security issue that Secret Service had told him you had to stay inside. But I was told by sources in the Secret Service and the campaign that it had nothing to do with that, that he was quote, unquote, vibing, as you mentioned. It started with two medical episodes that caused the town hall, and afterwards, during the second medical episode, he called for Pavarotti to be played, which was an interesting choice, and then said at the end of it, he would have a couple of songs that he would play, and big boob could just listen. He ended up following through on that and playing, as you said, the YMCA, he was playing James Brown, and the whole time by playing, I mean, they were playing it on the speakers, and he was kind of standing there swaying. Even some of his aides that we were asking what's going on, they seem to not really know. And this went on for quite some time. This was 30 minutes of the crowd standing there while he kind of swayed back and forth. You saw Christy Noem dart back and forth at certain times. I'm not sure she really knew what to do in that situation. She, of course, was moderating that town hall.

Over 50 police officers injured sent to the hospital because of the assault of the protesters. So I think that's completely appropriate. The National Guard was rolled out then. President Trump asked for 10,000 guardsmen to be on standby. The mayor of D.C. whittled that down and only asked for 300.

And I realized how little I understood about cancer and how little I understood about how to support you both, and I felt like it was a teachable moment. And you both are so strong and so capable of communicating what this is like, and that's why this conversation, I think, is so important.If you were to ask Ananda, as I did, about stage four, she'll tell you she doesn't really believe in labels. She just has to do what she's she needs to do for her. She is feeling great. She's doing a lot better, as you can see in our conversation. But when you look at the fact that breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death for women in the United States, according to the American Cancer Society, and the fact that black women at any age have the highest death rate, this is something that we need to talk about and to get women out there and checking themselves. Because we are seeing these rates go down, right, of these incidents of death rates since 1989 and part of that is because it's being detected earlier, and the people are getting checked and they're getting through it. But I have to say, it is emotional to be this close to people who are your ride or dies, the people who are there for you in all the best moments and all the worst moments in your life, and not knowing how to support them. And I think hopefully this conversation will inspire other people to be there for their loved ones and also to just understand what is going on. You both were so incredibly open in this conversation, Sara.",
