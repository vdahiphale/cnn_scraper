      "sentences": "We're learning new details about that would be assassin and what he was doing before he opened fire on former President Donald Trump over the weekend.Law enforcement officials tells CNN that the shooter was spotted at the Trump rally site about three hours before the shooting. Police began keeping an eye on him after he passed through the magnetometers with a rangefinder. That's a device often used by hunters that resembles binoculars. Investigators aren't sure where he went after he left the secure area. But this photo, obtained exclusively by our affiliate, WPXI, was taken of the shooter at least 26 minutes before shots were fired. We want to get to CNN's Danny Freeman, who is outside the shooters home in Bethel Park, Pennsylvania. He has more on the investigation. So, Danny, tell us more about this photo and why an officer felt compelled to take it?",

So we had learned a number of things earlier in the day from law enforcement sources that, for example, Crooks had called off from work, saying that he had something to do. That's what supposedly told his boss.But now we've also learned that his father has told investigators that he thought his son was going to the rifle range. We've been talking about that all week, that he belonged to a rifle range. And that that was why he actually took the gun with him. Well, then once Thomas Crooks, the son, had been missing and his father had not heard for him for many hours, that's when his father called police and reported him missing around 11:00 p.m. about five hours after the shooting took place. And then this is when some of the pieces started to come together. And I'll remind you that we learned earlier in the week that one of the ways that law enforcement agents were able to identify Thomas Crooks to begin with was the connection specifically with the rifle and his father because the rifle used in this shooting was purchased by his father. So, again, Boris, we're getting, bit by bit, a clearer picture of what Thomas Crooks was doing that day. But at this point, we still do not have any sort of idea what motivated him, the shooter himself, to go out there and pull the trigger -- Boris?",

This has caused such an uproar.You know, just so everybody knows, obviously, the party's nominee is usually formally nominated at their party's convention in person. The DNC has had this system in place for a virtual roll call for the president for a while now because of issues related to the president being able to get on the ballot. These issues she's have since been resolved, but they are saying that they are moving forward with this anyway. That has created so much backlash from certain Democrats who basically feel like, why would we nominate President Biden any earlier than we have to when clearly these questions about whether he should continue running have not at all been resolved.",

M.J., live for us from the White House, thank you for that report.And in the meantime, CNN is learning of a contentious weekend phone call between Joe Biden and some House Democrats. And the details show just how dug in the president is and also how resistant he is to entertaining some valid concerns about how his debate performance has eroded some key support. Sources say, at one point during the call, President Biden lashed out in Congressman Jason Crow, who is a moderate Democrat, after Crow said bluntly that voters are concerned about Biden, especially on the world stage. The president reportedly told Crow, who is an Army Ranger who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, that he knows Crow is a Bronze Star recipient, like his son, Beau, but that he, Crow, quote, \"didn't rebuild NATO after that. The call only grew more contentious as Crow pushed back, telling the president the voters aren't seeing him that way. And that's when Biden told Crow, quote, \"I don't want to hear that crap.\" And said the Congressman could walk away if he wanted, to which Crow said he didn't want to walk away. But Biden, angry, replied that Crow should just walk away. Our sources say that Biden also had a tense exchange with Congresswoman Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania. Houlahan reportedly telling the president that she was concerned about his standing in a key county in her battleground state. But Biden pushed back and suggested he didn't believe her. Houlahan then told Biden that she had polling to back it up. And according to our sources, Biden responded by telling Houlahan he'd send her talking points of everything that he's done for Pennsylvania and reminded her that he had married a Philly girl. Joining us now is Democratic Congressman Jared Moskowitz of Florida. Sir, thank you so much for spending a little time with us this afternoon. Were you on that call? REP.

You can't force a president out of his race. He's going to get there. But ultimately, we're trying to defeat Donald Trump, right? And right now, this has become a referendum on Joe Biden for the last several weeks since the disastrous performance. Donald Trump's had an unbelievable streak of luck both in the courts and, thank goodness, you know, ducking an assassination attempt, a heinous attempt, an attack on democracy by a domestic terrorist, in in my opinion. But we need to settle back down and realize the compare and contrast between the Democratic agenda and the Republican agenda, especially with the doubling down of J.D. Vance. With that pick, women's issues are clearly on the ballot in November as they we're on the ballot in the midterms of 2022.",

So that it's et well before the DNC starts August 29th. It's -- you know, it's kind of like getting legally -- August 19th, I should say. It's kind of like legally getting married before the wedding, sort of a comparison there. Originally, they we're going to do this because of that Ohio requirement for him to be on the ballot.

This was set well before the debate that they we're going to do this virtual nominating -- nominating process. So it has nothing to do with what has transpired. But look, I think, you know, again, the data is the data. And look, there are three races going on. Obviously, it's the race to defeat Donald Trump, which is extremely important to reelect Joe Biden. And then there's the race for the House. And the race for the Senate. And there are a lot of folks out there, myself included, saying, look, we want -- we want -- we've got to defeat Donald Trump. That's the number-one goal. But at the same time, if we can't do that and Donald Trump happens to win the election and the country is going to give Donald Trump the wheel, we've got to make sure that there are breaks. And that's why winning the House and the Senate is also equally as important.",

It could have been one of my colleagues. So the politics of who it was doesn't matter to me.There was an assassination attempt on a former president. That's an attack on our country. It's domestic terrorism. And America's enemies are loving what's going on in this country with Americans fighting Americans. And so the hearing on Monday is important to get down to the failures. I'm a mile away from Marjory Stoneman Douglas, my high school in Parkland. And after we -- after the shooting and we investigated the failures, the sheriff of the county was removed from office due to the lack of training and the lack of response by officers. And so there has to be accountability. You can't just have a failure where a president -- a former president almost gets assassinated and there's no accountability. That's what Americans hate sometimes about the federal government is that when they see things that go wrong, almost no, no accountability. And so I'm hearing now that she may not come after agreeing to attend the hearing on Monday. I can tell you, if she doesn't show up on Monday, absolutely, she should either resign or be fired. But if she comes on Monday, we need to do a thorough investigation to find out all the details. And then the chips can fall where there -- where they may. But there has to be accountability for what went on over the weekend.",
