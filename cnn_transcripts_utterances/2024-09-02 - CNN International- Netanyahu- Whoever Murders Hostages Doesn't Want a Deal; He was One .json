Goldberg-Polin's body was recovered in Gaza after being held for almost 200 days. Israel's president is a cut talk. Will be delivering the eulogy. It's 05:00 p.m. here in Abu Dhabi. I'm Becky Anderson, this is \"Connect the World\". And we get right to our top story this evening, as I say, a day filled with grief and outrage in Israel the funeral for the Israeli American Hersh Goldberg-Polin happening this hour. He was one of six hostages murdered by Hamas and found by Israeli forces in a Gaza tunnel over the weekend. His parents among the most outspoken of the hostage families in calling for a deal to get their loved ones' home. Israeli officials tell CNN Goldberg-Polin, who had an arm partially blown off by a grenade during the October 7th massacre, was one of three hostages killed who were expected to be released in the first phase of a ceasefire hostage release deal. Well, their deaths sparking a general strike in Israel and huge protests in the streets with intense anger directed at Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Well, the protesters blame the prime minister for refusing to accept the U.S. proposed deal that has been the subject of intense negotiations for months now. Israel's largest trade union said it would now respect a court order to end what's been this strike early. And while all of this is happening, the mass vaccination program against polio is underway in Gaza. The World Health Organization says vaccines reached 87,000 children on Sunday on what is the first day of temporary pauses in fighting. Salma Abdelaziz, connecting us from London this hour. And Salma as we consider these pictures from Jerusalem happening now, just explain what we are seeing on the ground today?",

You have simultaneous events taking place here, simultaneous movements. You have, of course, the funeral in Jerusalem for Hersh Goldberg-Polin. Those images will absolutely be dramatic and intense as the family mourns the loss of their son. You also have demonstrations taking place across the country in a nationwide strike that was called by its largest labor union. A court has ordered that strike to end. The labor unions have said they will abide by that but regardless, I think the message has come through of that anger, that dissent against Prime Minister Netanyahu, who these protesters believe simply has not done enough to secure a deal that would see hostages come home. And I think it's the details of what took place with these six killed hostages over the weekend that really have fueled the anger. It's the fact that Israeli forces were just a short distance away, just hours away from reaching these six hostages when they were shot at close range according to Israeli officials. It's the detail that Hersh Goldberg-Polin's parents were just standing at the DNC a couple of weeks ago saying, bring them home, that has been very poignant to these protesters. And it is time that is of the essence here, absolutely, because you have over 100 hostages still in Gaza, dozens of them believed to be alive. And for those protesters that you see on those streets, they believe that securing a deal, securing a ceasefire, is the best way forward to bring those hostages home alive. The problem is, Prime Minister Netanyahu's government, the most far right government in Israel's history, does not want this deal. In fact, some of his ministers have even said they would resign if he took a deal, a ceasefire deal of any kind. So, an absolute gridlock here Becky government at loggerheads with the streets. I don't know how it breaks.",

This was a big one, and the question is, would it last long, and how many people will turn out to the streets and demonstrate? The main issue in Israel that people are concerned is, as you mentioned, Becky, does Netanyahu do enough in order to facilitate the deal or not. It seems that many people are kind of in a loophole that the deals are not clear. My assumption is that Netanyahu will stick to his approach. In other words, maintaining the army pressure on the Hamas in Gaza, hoping to reach a better deal. And if one of the sides other Sinwar will bend down, or the American administration, who's helping us in mediating and facilitating a deal, will say, as they say now in the Israeli media, the American will say, enough is enough, take it to leave it. And once, they'll issue some kind of a draft saying, take it to leave it where people in Israel will know what are the terms of the deal. Because at the moment, the notion is that Netanyahu is putting all kinds of artificial obstacles on the deal, especially the issue regarding the Philadelphi Corridor. Is this an artificial element that Netanyahu just added, or there are other elements into it, perhaps Sinwar is not ripened enough, or does not adhere to the deal that is being contemplating. So, I think that the next one or two weeks will know better what's going on, and this will determine Netanyahu's future and our tragic humanitarian crisis that we are suffering almost a year since October 7th.",

Most people in Israel thinks that Netanyahu is manipulating and putting all kinds of tricks. We don't exactly. We don't know exactly what is the Hamas conditions? Do they demand that the Israeli forces to evacuate Gaza as part of the deal? How many hostages will be released, at least in the first phase? And the third question is, will be a ceasefire or stop the war? These questions are kind of hanging in the wars in the air. So, I think that Netanyahu is failing to deliver the message to the Israeli public, and that's why you see this demonstration. Even the extremists blame Netanyahu for the fact that the six hostages were murdered by the Hamas in Gaza, saying it's your fault, Mr. Netanyahu. I think that Netanyahu will stick to his approach, in other words, being tough, and if I may, move a little bit to politics, Netanyahu knows that if he wants to continue and be Prime Minister for 100 more years since the 90s, he needs to show that he is, as he claims, Mr. Security in other words, restore the security. Tell the Israeli people, I'm the one who can guarantee your security, and I'm not risking the life of the Israelis in the future for a deal that will not be a sustainable deal and will not achieve much, because the next scale of violence is knocking on the door. You can see what's going on in Lebanon. You can see what's going on in the -- and even in the West Bank.",

There is a sense on these streets that the government needs to do better, and must do better to bring those hostages' home. Again, a reminder over 100 hostages still believed held in Gaza, dozens of them still alive. And again, for these families, these details of the six people killed, the six hostages killed when those three of those six should have been released if a deal had been agreed by Prime Minister Netanyahu that makes those people on the streets fear that there are more body bags coming if a deal is not secured. So, the pressure is going to continue to come from the streets. The pressure is also going to come from the White House. President Biden Kamala Harris will be sitting down with mediators this hour as well, so that pressure from the White House will continue as well. Will Prime Minister Netanyahu crack? Will he break? Well, he has a coalition government with him behind him that doesn't want this deal, and he will continue to have to balance that. The one voice that came out of Sunday's Cabinet meeting for the deal was Yoav Gallant, the Defense Minister. So, there are -- there is increasing pressure from the military as well with Prime Minister Netanyahu. But still no signs that he's going to break. You played that sound bite from him. He is steadfast, and he continues to lay the blame at Hamas' feet, saying it is them, not me, who are failing at this deal.",

Most people in Israel think that Netanyahu is to be blamed for October 7th, at least it happened under his shift. And most people in Israel think that it's a high time to have an election. But on the other hand, Netanyahu says look, it's an outside world, the ones who killed and murdered the six Israelis that were kidnapped is the Hamas. The world condemned the Hamas, and by the fact that you are conducting those demonstrations in Israel, it fuels the Hamas because they see what the eruptions in Israel due to the fact that they just slaughtered or killed those hostages. I think that Netanyahu point is he says, I want to start a new era, in other words, without the Hamas militant organization, and to restore security. I think that he's walking on a very dangerous floor, because it is under the expense of at least some of the hostages. And the question, I think these things will be clear once we'll know exactly what is the deal on the table, and who says yes, who says no?",

And more on that as we move through the next couple of hours. U.S., President Biden, Vice President Harris, are scheduled to meet this hour, as we've been reporting in the White House Situation Room, along with the U.S. team involved in the hostage negotiations following the killing of the six hostages. CNN's Kylie Atwood joining us now from Washington. And Kylie, Senior U.S. Official telling CNN that the hostage deaths call into question how serious Hamas is about reaching a deal. What more can you tell us about the response from the Biden Administration so far? KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, well, listen, that senior official also said effectively that what happened over the weekend, this awful, devastating killing of these six hostages puts more pressure on Hamas, but also on Israel and specifically named Prime Minister Netanyahu personally to come to a deal here. We have heard time and time again that there is more urgency surrounding these efforts to try and release the remaining hostages held by Hamas, 101 of them, 68 of them believed to be alive. But this moment in time does feel slightly different given what happened over the weekend, given also that when you talk to U.S. officials, they say that there were discussions underway. They feel that they were very close. And one of the complicating factors that they will face this week is the fact that we're told that some of the people that were killed over the weekend, these hostages, were actually part of a final package that the United States was putting together with Qatar and Egypt to propose, of course, to Israel and Hamas to try and come to some sort of deal here. Now the word final is key there, because it demonstrates that the Biden Administration feels like the time must be here and now for a deal that they're sort of running out of, you know, time to continue putting into this. So, we'll have to watch and see how they revise what they were planning to put into that final package. We should note that also over the weekend, President Biden said that Hamas is going to have to pay for the deaths of these hostages. So that is another factor here. Of course, they need to work with Hamas. They need Hamas to agree to a deal. But simultaneously, there are understandably frustrations, a lot of anger, surrounding the fact that all six of these hostages were killed over the weekend.",

You are looking at pictures here of Isaac Herzog, who is the President of Israel, delivering a eulogy at the funerals of Hersh Goldberg-Polin. There have been protests in Tel Aviv where several people were arrested, demonstrations coinciding with several hours of strike action affecting everything from flights to schools and hospitals. Israel's main trade union organization is now calling for people to return to work. Well, Abbey Onn had five family members abducted by Hamas on October the seventh. And she joins me now from Tel Aviv, and we have seen two very resonant images today, that of Hersh Goldberg-Polin's funeral and those who have gathered there to mourn his murder. And hundreds of thousands on the streets of Tel Aviv calling for a ceasefire and hostage deal and putting the Prime Minister of Israel sort of squarely in the crosshairs here.

I really, in my mind, saw that Hersh and Rachel and Jon and his sisters would be reunited. And I think the whole country is heartbroken, more so than we have been up until this point. And what Israel does well is unite in moments of pain and trauma, and that's what you saw here last night. You saw half a million people take to the street in protest. It was majority of peaceful protests. They sang Hatikvah, which is our national anthem. It's for hope, because we still believe that a deal is possible to bring home the 101 hostages that are still being held by Hamas.

It is an embodiment of the vision that Francis has for Catholic-Muslim relations, the importance of coexistence and friendship.
