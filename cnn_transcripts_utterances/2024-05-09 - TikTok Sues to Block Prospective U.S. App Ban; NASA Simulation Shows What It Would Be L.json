      "sentences": "The stakes here for TikTok are huge. This bill could lead to a ban of TikTok in the U.S., which is one of its biggestmarkets, 170 million American users. And TikTok is claiming here that this bill infringes on the First Amendment speech rights of the platform and of those American users. Just as a reminder, this bill would force TikTok to find a new American owner, spin off from its Chinese parent company ByteDance, or face a ban in the United States. But the company is claiming that this bill really is just a ban and that if it`s left to stand, left to stay in place, that it will lead to TikTok being blocked in the United States starting in January of next year. The company claims in this lawsuit that the divestiture required by this law, and I`m quoting here now, \"is simply not possible, not commercially, not technically, not legally,\" and certainly not on the 270-day timeline required by this act. TikTok is citing here, for example, the fact that the Chinese government has said that it wouldn`t allow TikTok to be sold with its recommendation algorithm, which is really the thing that makes this platform so valuable. So TikTok saying it`s not possible for us to be divested from ByteDance. Therefore this is a ban and a ban is unconstitutional. And what`s interesting about this is it`s really going to set up the court to have to weigh the U.S. lawmakers` national security concerns when it comes to TikTok over or sort of against the First Amendment rights of this platform and of its U.S. users. So I expect that we`ll see this legislature, this litigation, I should say, drag on for quite some time. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The Rafah border crossing with Egypt now firmly under Israeli control. For now, that means nothing in or out at this critical crossing point for humanitarian aid, fuel, and medical evacuations. As plumes of smoke rise over the area, the Israeli prime minister touting the operation as a play to bolster Israeli leverage in ceasefire talks with Hamas, which put a new proposal on the table hours before Israeli tanks rolled into Rafah. BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): Military pressure on Hamas is a necessary condition for the return of our hostages. The Hamas proposal yesterday was intended to torpedo the entry of our forces into Rafah. It did not happen.",

The immersive visualizationwas made on a supercomputer and moves viewers close to the speed of light. NASA created two different scenarios for viewers. One shows a first-person perspective of an astronaut just missing the event horizon or point of no return of the black hole and slingshotted back out. And another, where it crosses the boundary and plunges into the event horizon. According to NASA, the black hole is similar to the one at the center of the Milky Way and its event horizon spans 16 million miles. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
