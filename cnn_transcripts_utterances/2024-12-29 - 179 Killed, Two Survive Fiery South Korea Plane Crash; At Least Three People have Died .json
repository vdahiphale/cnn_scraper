It exploded into a ball of fire after reaching the end of the tarmac, witnesses describing the chaotic moments. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) IM YOUNG-HAK, CRASH WITNESS (through translator): I think it was about 9:00 or 8:50 AM. I heard a bang. At first, I thought it was an oil tanker accident as we can see a lot of oil tankers nearby. Then I felt different. So I went outside and I saw a big dark smoke, then I could hear a big explosion sound, not the one from the crash itself. Then I heard more explosions, at least seven times. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The National Transportation Safety Board now says that it is sending its leading team of investigators to assist in the case. CNN's Mike Valerio has more from Seoul. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MIKE VALERIO, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): The cataclysmic scene stunning South Korea, a Jeju Air Boeing 737 800 with 181 people aboard, the planes landing gear, local officials saying, likely failed. The aircraft's belly scraping, the pavement coming down close to the end of the runway before crashing into an embankment and exploding. A breathtaking plume of smoke seen for hours. In its wake, hundreds of mourners, families of the dead crowding into the Arrivals Hall at South Korea's Muan International Airport. The man in the white helmet, tasked with naming those who would never come home. Their bodies identified with loss and unspoken farewells, too much for families to bear. (UNIDENTIFIED MALE speaking in foreign language.) VALERIO (voice over): \"I'm going crazy,\" a man shouts, shattered by the calamity. (UNIDENTIFIED MALE speaking in foreign language.) VALERIO (voice over): According to South Korean officials, on Sunday, 8:57 AM local time, the flight arriving from Bangkok, Thailand was contacted by the Muan Airport control tower, an air traffic controller warning of birds near the runway and a danger of potential bird strikes. Two minutes later, at 8:59 AM, the pilot makes a mayday call, and at 9:03 AM, the plane crashes. Two crew members miraculously survived. They were both sitting in the back of the 737 800 near the tail of the aircraft. Authorities hope the survivors can shed light on what happened. The voice and flight data recorder also recovered. VALERIO (on camera): Now, for a country that has been through so much with martial law declared earlier this month, this catastrophe has certainly cast a pall over South Korea, adding to the urgency to find out just how this could have happened.

This happened on Saturday morning in Delray Beach.Video of the incident shows the fire truck, which was on an emergency call at the time of the collision, waiting for a freight train to pass before driving around the rail crossing arms. It is then struck by the passenger train traveling from the opposite direction. The train, which is operated by Brightline provides passenger rail services between Orlando and Miami. An investigation into the crash, now underway. At least five drone shows across the country are now canceled after several drones struck a crowd at a holiday show in Orlando, including a seven-year-old boy. According to a GoFundMe campaign posted by the family, the boy underwent emergency heart surgery after being struck in the chest by the drone. Footage captured on September 21st shows drones colliding with each other, before then falling from the sky. Universal Orlando, Orlando World Center Marriott, the cities of Dallas and Austin, Texas, and the New Year's Eve event in New York City's Central Park have either canceled drone shows or the drone portions of larger holiday events following the incident. And now to worries that the bird flu could become more dangerous to people. The CDC says that samples from a hospitalized patient indicate that the virus likely mutated inside the person, making it potentially more transmissible to humans. The agency says that the patient had been exposed to the virus from a flock of backyard birds, but that those birds did not have the mutations that showed up in the test. Still, the CDC says that the risk to the general public remains low. I'd like to bring in infectious disease specialist at the University of California, Dr. Peter Chin-Hong. DR. Chin-Hong, great to have you today. I want to start with something you said last week. You said the traffic light is changing from green to amber. What do you mean by that?   DR.

You know, we can only do so much as a state because the virus doesn't care if you're in California or Minnesota.
