In terms of the readiness of the IDF, we've seen some more than 300,000 troops massing on the border. What is the wait for? Is it a political decision to be made? Is there a training component right now going on along the border for some of the troops? LT. COL. PETER LERNER, IDF SPOKESMAN: Anderson, good evening. We are, indeed, at the end of day 10 since the brutal massacre of women, children, and men in the southern communities of Israel. And 199 people that we've confirmed today that have been abducted into Gaza by Hamas. Indeed, we are, over the last 10 days, we have been striking Hamas extensively in widespread strikes against their entire organization, from the leaders at the top through the institutions that they use in order to finance, train, equipment the terrorists. And, indeed, down to the terrorists themselves that perpetrated this brutal act and these brutal atrocities against our people. The way forward, and as you rightly pointed out, over 300,000 reservists, many or the vast majority of them will be positioned on the border with Gaza. But also many of them positioned on the front with Lebanon for a potential uptick in violence there. But, yes, we are training our forces. We need to be prepared for mobilization if the government instructs us to move forward. COOPER: In terms of the humanitarian situation on the ground, which we've been covering, I talked to an official from the U.N. about trying to get supplies across the Rafah border, at the very least, into southern Gaza. Do you have any opposition to having gasoline? What is the opposition to having gasoline, food, shelter, supplies moved into southern Gaza, given that's where hundreds of thousands of residents have moved down to?",

Our job is to fight Hamas and destroy their capabilities.The discussions taking place -- (INAUDIBLE) -- level and, indeed, will leave to diplomacy to the diplomats and the war fighting for the warriors. Currently, I would say that the situation where we have seen and our action to evacuate people from the north of Gaza is a temporary humanitarian measure meant to keep people out of harm's way while we deal with Hamas. And unfortunately, Hamas has shown time and time again that they will constantly put the people of Gaza in harm's way. So indeed, there is, according to the information we have from our interlocutors in the international humanitarian organization community, there is food, there is now running water for the last day, into the south and there are shelters. So, indeed, there are the bare minimum needs in southern Gaza. And indeed, war is a -- is a very complex issue, and it does have ramifications for civilians. We recognize that, and that is exactly the reason why we said to people, you need to head south.",

The modern-day Democrat, on the other hand, is a little bit more compliant, suited to big government situations and even to leadership.
