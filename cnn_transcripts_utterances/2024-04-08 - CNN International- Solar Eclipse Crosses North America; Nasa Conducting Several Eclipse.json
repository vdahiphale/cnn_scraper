The moon started taking over the sun at about the 3 O'clock mark, and right now, there's this amazing crescent, you could probably hear the crowd as well.And then, all of a sudden, you see just a little tad of cloud cover. So, it's almost like in the movies, but other than that, I can tell you that every now and then, there's this cool breeze -- did you see just that, my scarf -- every now and then, there's a cool breeze and then we have the sun. It feels and looks more like that twilight zone than anything else, the colors don't look exactly how we normally see the colors.

And in part, it's because Kerrville, Texas, is the X that marks thespot. And here's why. There has been two eclipses in the past six months. There was one in October and the one that's happening today. And if you look at the paths of totality, they make a cross. And In the center of that cross is Kerrville, Texas, where I am right now. And people believe that there is this sense of -- oh, and there's that cool air again, did you see my hair? I feel a little -- like a cool breeze, it's the oddest thing. And so, people believe that there's this strength and energy here. And that's why they're descending onto Kerrville, Texas, now. But like I mentioned, there was this scare that there was going to be massive thunderstorms. And you can see all around me, there are no thunderstorms. And so, people are actually able to enjoy the eclipse at least for now. I'm keeping my fingers crossed. I don't like that cool wind, and it kind of scares me.

So, that has been kind of something that has changed so very subtly and very slightly, but definitely different from what we've seen in the last hours. I mentioned we're about 23 minutes away from all of this happening here in the Dallas area, and we're going to be keeping tabs on the animal reaction to all of this. And so, there's -- you know, what are they going to do? How are they going to react to this? There's not a lot of research that has been done in the last century over all of this, because there's just simply not that many opportunities to do so. So, they're really, you know, kind of crowd-sourcing reaction throughout the entire path of this solar eclipse to kind of document the animal reaction and what we might see. But here, we've already been able to see the cloud cover, is held off dramatically compared to what many people were worried about. The temperature is starting to go down just a little bit, so, I can really sense that we are approaching, getting closer and closer to this spectacular moment. This area behind me, you see here, this is a Tobago; the giraffe kind of interesting, they're trying to figure out what they might do. Some animals might kind of herd around their young to protect them because they might think that it's a dangerous situation once it goes completely dark, others might put themselves to sleep, others might start mating or others might not care and think we're all just going crazy for nothing. So, we will -- kind of highly anticipating and anxiously anticipating how all of this is going to unfold here in about 20 minutes or so.",

Even the people who maybe have been here and seen other launches before have told us that this is really exciting because, again, you really don't get a day like this. You don't get a day where you can see an eclipse and a rocket launch all in the same day.And they're going to get to see not only one but three different rocket launches, each within about 45 minutes of each other. It really is kind of a historical day in addition to being just a great day for science. And it's also a good visual day. Obviously, you know, the visuals of seeing the eclipse are really cool, even though, again, we are not in the path of totality, but the visuals of seeing that are going to be really cool. And during all that, you get to see three rockets go up. So, hey, why not spend a day out here in pretty good weather and take a look at all that? It's really exciting. Yes, it sure is.

You could see the diamond ring effect. It was a beautiful moment. It was a beautiful moment sharing it with thousands of people. They're starting to walk away, you know, short memory. The event is over. Move on. But the eclipse is still going on. I mean, if we were to look upstairs, up to the skies, you still see a little bit of a crescent moon shape on the eclipse. But it was very interesting for a few reasons. First, we felt that change on temperature. The place just cooled down. This area, this time of year, we could be at around 33 degrees Celsius. It fell to about 23, about 10 degrees. At least that's what we felt here. And then the birds, the birds that live in this park, on the trees of this park, they just came back. They started to go back to their nests, started to do their songs as if they were going to bed. There was a little bit of confusion. And then the light, the light that came down was not like total darkness, but it was like a very clean, white light that just covered everybody as they looked up in the sky and saw this magnificent event. A great opportunity for scientists. On the other side of this ocean of people moving behind me, there are tens of scientists from all over the world. NASA partnered with the local observatory. They have two telescopes, one of them directly looking into the sun. So it was a great experience.",

It happens in other cities.Same thing on the surface of the moon. Instead of buildings, there's canyons and valleys. And so that creates that effect of those beads there.

This is what gives us an opportunity to appreciate the atmosphere around the sun, which is millions of degrees hotter than the plasma of the surface itself. And we're just -- scientists are learning new things about that in just in recent years. And now that we have this probe up there, NASA launched that probe into the sun, the Parker Space Probe, which is just staggering that we have the ability to build machines that can do that.

And so when that intensity of the sun dims, it's visibly or noticeably cooler. The winds can shift as well. The -- it's not complete blackout because of that corona, as Gustavo in Mexico, our man in Mexico, explained earlier. It's like a clean, white atmospheric light while this thing is happening.
