John Berman is live in Lewiston, Maine, where people are now entering their 17th hour sheltering in place as a manhunt for a mass killer intensifies.A short time ago, the governor updated the death toll in last night's shooting rampage to 18. This happened over two locations about four miles apart, a bowling alley and a bar and grill in Lewiston. We understand another 13 people were wounded. And now hundreds of officers are furiously searching for this 40-year- old army reservist named Robert Card. You see him in these images released by the sheriff's office pointing an AR-style rifle. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) COL. WILLIAM ROSS, MAINE STATE POLICE:  He should be considered armed and dangerous. Based on our investigation, we believe this is someone that should not be approached. This is someone that should be -- if you come into any contact with this individual or someone that you think looks like this individual, you are to call 911. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That reflects the number of victims that have been identified so far. Eight have been identified so far. That means 10, as of a short time ago, still needed to be identified. Authorities do say that eight of the 18 were gunned down at the bar, which is right here behind me. And then the other seven died first at the bowling alley, which is about a 10-minute drive from here. There was a local councilperson who said that he can barely think about the scope of this tragedy. It's just beginning to hit him, because his son works as a manager at the local bar. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LEROY WALKER SR., SON MISSING AFTER SHOOTING:  When you get anything that happens like this, you go empty. And there's just nothing, nothing you can do. Your gut goes like a monster inside of you, and -- because it feels like it's going to fall off. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

What we do know, though, John, is that he was released. He has a home on hundreds of acres of land in Maine, and he legally possessed multiple weapons. We know that he was a firearms enthusiast and that he was able to be released and gain access to his firearms, but we're trying to learn more about why he was released, under what terms. Clearly, he would have been evaluated before he was released, and we just don't know what the circumstances are. But that is one of the key questions right now, John.",

Here, where we are, we're in Lisbon. This is where he dumped the car. I'm going to show you here, John, here, this area, this is a boat launch last night after the shootings. This is where police found that white Subaru. What happened after this? Unclear. They have been out here, police, searching through this area all day, all morning. They have been getting 911 calls. Neighbors are frantic. Residents here afraid for their lives are calling 911 if they hear a noise, if they see something suspicious. And so the police are responding, and they are searching. We were with officers this morning during some of those searches, so definitely people here on edge. And part of what's making some of this kind of difficult for law enforcement is, you know, this is a wooded area. We're not seeing them in any of the -- deep into the wooded area. The only searches that they have been doing out here today have been around homes, if people are calling 911, some of the cars, so some basic searches, but they're not going deep into the woods. We have seen helicopters flying. But I think what Pam just reported, John, is really interesting. And I had not thought about that until I heard her report just now, the cell phones. If the family is communicating him or if he's receiving cell phone texts from them, law enforcement would know that. And so they could ping his phone, which would then potentially tell them perhaps where he is. So that could be playing a big part of this and providing big keys to law enforcement, because I will say one thing to you, John, that I have found kind of interesting, is that things here are rather calm. There is this shelter in place, don't leave your home. Businesses are closed, but we're not seeing that surge in law enforcement here. There's a lot of things going on behind the scenes, and there's all sorts of planning, but on the streets here, it's quiet, it's calm, and you're just not seeing that kind of surge that you normally see in a manhunt. So it makes me wonder if they have some things going on behind the scenes, clearly, that we just don't know about.",

Bank closed, what, 39 of its branches here. The Department of Motor Vehicles closed all up and down Maine. L.L. Bean, which is about 15 minutes from here, which is open on Christmas Day, is closed today out of security concerns. So, people are obviously being careful.

We pray for those who were injured, and grieve with so many whose lives are forever changed and impacted by what happened. The Biden/Harris administration will continue to provide full support to local authorities. And, as we gather details, we must continue to speak truth about the moment we are in. In our country today, the leading cause of death of American children is gun violence. Gun violence has terrorized and traumatized so many of our communities in this country. And let us be clear.

But, having said that, they'd be setting up grid searches and very carefully going through this. Now it's daylight, so they're able to conduct a search. Last night, it was just very difficult, if not impossible. It was dark, very, very dark. If you have been out in the woods, it's almost no light at all. And so that just adds to it. The fact that he is a marksman, a very skilled one, we know he has a very high-powered weapon with him. Perhaps he's got other weapons that he had in his car. That makes it incredibly dangerous for the men and women that are out there doing the search. But they will systematically go through the area. And, hopefully, they're able to locate him before he's able to do harm to anyone else.",

So all of this talk about sort of, can they get pings or whatever, he clearly carefully planned this. He picks sites that become progressively more isolated. So, the last is sort of closer to a place where he can hide. He's survived close to 14 hours or however long without not getting caught. We don't know if he had planned an isolated place to hide. So he may have also gotten rid of his phone. But all of those things, whether it's tracking on roads, it's drones, I mean, these areas around Maine are both some of the most beautiful parts of our country, but they -- you can put drones over them and at least look for movement or heat movement or anything else like that. You can do the same over water and the lakes. The other reason why you want to do sort of check his computers and other things is, of course, motive. We don't know now. We were hearing about mental health issues. That's not a reason, right? I mean, there's lots of people with mental health issues that are not doing this. There's, what was the triggering? Was there any hint of a triggering? Is it a loss of job? Was it something personal? Was it something political that he is absorbing? And that's what is important to know, because we don't know much about the victims. We -- and we kind of deserve to relatively soon. I have been surprised how little information we have been getting at this stage. I think it's incumbent on law enforcement to provide that once families are notified, of course.",

I think I have -- I struggle with these lockdowns, because you kind of don't want people living in fear. But at some stage relatively soon, someone's going to have to make a decision that the calculus -- and this was what was done in the Boston Marathon.

This is what Dr. Alexander had to say about how his hospital had staffing in place to deal with all that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. JOHN ALEXANDER, CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER, CENTRAL MAINE HEALTHCARE: We had approximately 100 team members who were off-duty come into the hospital to help ensure that we were able to care for not only the patients that we received from these -- horrible scene, but also take care of the patients that we had there.

They're constantly talking among themselves in the E.R. community about how to deal with deal with these kinds of situations and gunshot wounds. Now, we heard about just the speed with which so many patients came into that hospital, and that is something that all of these folks really reflected on as hero's work. They called it battlefield medicine, seeing 14 patients come in within 45 minutes. And what we know about this medical center is that it's a Level III trauma center. Now, that's the third level down. Level I is the top. And what all of them said is that a Level III trauma center, essentially, their goal there is to stabilize patients, and then, if they can, get them to a higher-level trauma center, Level I, if possible, where they can then get even more comprehensive care. Dr. Sakran was telling us about the golden hour, that 60 minutes when a gunshot wound victim comes into the hospital and needs to be stabilized. They really worry about bleeding and how quickly that can lead to real problems, so trying to stabilize them and then moving them out, but really saying it's chaotic to deal with this kind of thing even in the highest-level trauma centers. They say 20 to 25 people can be needed for just one patient, John. So that gives you a sense of just the amazing work that they did.",
