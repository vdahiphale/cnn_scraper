This is a Live Earth cam shot of Dallas, Texas, where the temperatures are expected to hit 100 degrees later on today. More than 85 million people are under heat alerts from Florida to California. A heat dome is in case in the western U.S. leading to record breaking temperatures in so many areas. Phoenix is in the midst of a likely record streak of days topping a dangerous 110 degrees. Now 15 straight days. CNN's Rafael Romo is in Las Vegas and CNN's Mike Valerio is in Valencia, California. So, Mike, to you first, you're in Southern California.

A nerve center where first aid personnel will be congregating. But Fredricka, we also, you know talk to Six Flags before the broadcast about how they're preparing for a day like this. 20 -- I should say more than 20 lifeguards that will be within the waterpark, just making sure that everybody is OK.

You're talking heat advisories, excessive heat warnings, those -- the differences there just based on how far above average and for how long you're talking especially as Rafael said at night when the temperatures not dropping, you get this, you know, these excessive heat warnings.But these are, you know, just like a tornado warning or a hurricane warning and watch. They are -- they are advising people to take action. And there's danger. And heat is of course, really the deadliest of them all. More people die in the U.S. in a normal year from heat than they do from tornadoes and from hurricanes. And as we've seen, this is anything but a normal year. 34 consecutive days. Actually today, the 35th day in a row that there have been some type of alerts somewhere between Texas and Arizona. So just unrelenting heat. And like we said it's not going to go away anytime soon. As long as this big heat dome is centered right where it is. Right now, it's over the Four Corners region. And that's going to allow warm hot air to come in to the desert southwest. And really into California for one of the first times this year. We heard Mike talking about that, as they are preparing there. And of course, we know people are going to go to Death Valley, because they want to potentially be there. When we set some records. The all-time record that's the hottest it's ever been around Death Valley, the hottest place on earth, Moniker, 134 degrees. But that's over 100 years ago. And it's a hotly debated topic within the weather community pun intended on whether or not that's a truly accurate, you know, record of all time. The 130s measured just a couple of years ago with modern equipment as definitely the modern record. And we could certainly see that tomorrow. 129 is the record there. But it is one of hundreds of records across much of the country, stretching all the way from California, even to Florida. Highest highs, highest lows, because again at night, it's just not cooling off. And these above average temperatures at the hottest time of the year is really the problem. It's already going to be hot. It's July and it's the desert, and it's adding 10 or 15 degrees to it. Fredricka, that's what makes it dangerous.",

GOP presidential hopefuls are flocking to Iowa this weekend hoping to impress a crucial group of voters that kick off the GOP nominating process. But former President Trump is skipping the event. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [13:25:47] WHITFIELD: All right. Welcome back. Florida governor and GOP presidential candidate Ron DeSantis is on the campaign trail in Iowa again today. Today he held a meet and greet event in the city of Winterset as he tries to make up ground on former President Donald Trump. On Friday, DeSantis was one of six top contenders who appeared at the Family Leadership Summit in Des Moines. The event is a major gathering for evangelicals. A crucial voting bloc for Republicans in the state. Several of the candidates use the gathering to criticize Trump, who is the current frontrunner for his decision to skip the event. For more on this, let's bring in CNN Kristen Holmes who is in West Palm Beach. So, Kristen Trump will be making an appearance at a conservative gathering in Florida later on today. But it's his absence in Iowa and his criticism of the state's governor that's actually making some news and causing a little ripple effect there. What more can you tell us?",

I was told he had a scheduling conflict as we know he will be here speaking today. But he wasn't here yesterday. So one thing to keep in mind. The other thing I was told is that Trump doesn't need to go to these \"cattle calls\" these large group gatherings with other candidates because of the fact that he is a frontrunner. But I will say that a lot of the people who are close to him, particularly on the ground in Iowa would like to see him doing some of these events. Now for those other candidates who were there on the ground, they took advantage of the fact that Trump wasn't. Take a listen to what they said.

He was also asked about what that election -- misinformation about the election fraud and the election being stolen, how that impacted his job and those who worked around him. We also learned that the New Mexico Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver was interviewed in recent month by the special counsel. New Mexico, this is important because it is one of those seven states where Trump's team alleged election fraud and tried to put forward fake electors.

We've already seen charges brought by Jack Smith. In this case we have not and the investigation is still ongoing.But this is just one element of many to this case. We have the fake electors and what happened in the states. We also have what happened at the Justice Department and efforts to try to get DOJ officials to help to overturn the election. Then we have the effort to pressure Vice President Mike Pence. And then what happened at the capital on January 6th. There are many, many parts to this investigation. What we're trying to do now is try to pick up on any clues of whether these interviews are, in fact, a sign, or not, that Jack Smith is wrapping up his probe -- Fred?",

As we just heard and saw, ocean temperatures have reached the highest levels on record and now it's threatening, what is it, like 360 linear miles of coral reef along Florida's coast and now it's threatening it. How worried are you about its longevity, if it can survive this kind of heat? DR. LIV WILLIAMSON, ASSISTANT SCIENTIST, CORAL REEF FUTURES LAB, ROSENSTIEL SCHOOL OF MARINE, ATMOSPHERIC AND EARTH SCIENCE, UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI: I really wish I had better news for you, but this dangerous high temperature is extremely alarming and extremely worrying for Florida's coral reefs. We're already seeing temperatures exceeding the threshold that we expect to cause corals to bleach. And it's only July. You know, we really have our peak summer temperatures here in Florida in August and September. So I'm really worried this heatwave will be prolonged and will cause our oceans stress over a really long period of time.",

So healthy corals rely on tiny algae that actually live in their bodies and help them survive and grow by converting energy from the sunlight into food for corals.And extreme temperatures disrupts this partnership. It actually causes the coral to expel their algae in a process called coral bleaching. And the corals will starve and die if they don't get those algae back and if the temperatures don't go back down. If our corals die, we lose all of the ecosystem services that coral reefs provide for us. For instance, they're home to over a quarter of all marine species that we know of, despite coral reefs only making up less than 1 percent of the ocean floor. So they're just really, really biodiverse ecosystems that we can't stand to lose. And our fishing communities, our tourism here in Florida depends on marine species that live on coral reefs. So we really can't avoid to lose them for this reason.",

We have lots and lots of fishing communities here who depend on that for income. And then finally, we have miles and miles of coastal properties of beaches that are very vulnerable to flooding and erosion. If we lose that important three-dimensional structure that the coral reefs for us. Corals are great breakers of wave energy. They actually reduce the amount of wave energy that reaches our coast and so they help us in the face of things like hurricanes and storms.

We also have lot of projects going on to actually increase the heat tolerance of the corals themselves so that the corals we put out on the reefs are not going to succumb to the same fate. We're able to breed those that we identified to be more heat tolerant together to create offspring that are more heat tolerant.
