I'm glad you are able to have that generated power and get by, and kudos to your crew as well.All right, thank you so much, Patrick Oppmann. All right, hello again, everyone. Thank you so much for joining us. I'm Fredricka Whitfield in Atlanta alongside my colleague Kaitlan Collins in Tel Aviv. And we're following the latest developments in the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and the intensifying Israeli military operation in northern Gaza. We'll get to you, Kaitlan, in a moment. But first, we're now entering a critical stretch in the U.S. presidential race, just 17 days now to go, and both Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are still trying to lock down votes in some of the most fiercely contested battleground states. Right now, voters are gathering in Detroit, where Harris is campaigning alongside pop singer Lizzo in a short few minutes, and Harris is actually barnstorming with two superstars today. In fact, later she'll be in Atlanta with Usher. Meantime, Trump is preparing to speak to voters tonight in Pennsylvania. And in these closing weeks of the election, the margins are razor thin, and both campaigns are looking to build winning coalitions. Voters are taking notice, early voting, smashing records in some states. More than 11 million ballots cast nationwide so far. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez and Steve Contorno are hitting the trail with the campaigns. Priscilla, you're with the Harris camp. How are they looking to build support at this very pivotal moment in the race?",

      "sentences": "Well, the focus today is harnessing that support and trying to get people to get out and vote here in Michigan, and especially here in Detroit, where early voting in person is kicking off for the first time. So this is going to be the focus of today for the Vice President, not only here in Michigan, but also in Atlanta.So part of the strategy here is to do well in the cities of Detroit and Atlanta, with majority non-white cities and their surrounding suburbs to repeat what President Biden did in 2020. And yesterday, the Vice President, as you mentioned, was across the state of Michigan, and it provided a glimpse into what the strategy is among her advisers as she went to three different counties. One county that Donald Trump won in 2016, but then President Biden flipped in 2020. And then two other counties where he won, President Biden won by wider margins. That is what her team is trying to emulate and build on and also try to make inroads with those white college educated voters in the suburbs. That is where the officials I've spoken with see real opportunity, especially with issues like reproductive freedoms. But part of the messaging yesterday as well was on labor and making sure that she can lock in union voters. Much of her messaging yesterday again focused on the former president's anti-labor comments and also casting the difference or drawing the stark contrast between her and former President Donald Trump when it comes to manufacturing and union jobs. Now, I will also note because this was a notable moment at her rally here in Detroit yesterday is that she spoke directly to the Arab- American community. Of course, Michigan has one of the largest Arab- American populations in the United States. This has been a difficult moment for the campaign and the party when it comes to trying to harness that support, given the feelings within the Arab-American community about the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. So certainly, what we're seeing here in Michigan is the Vice President trying to lock down her coalition and also capitalize on early voting here and then later today in Georgia.",

This is the second time in a week where we've seen this sort of strange pause in the programming at a Trump rally earlier.Obviously, last week we had that incident where he halted his events because of a medical episode and stood on the stage and just sort of went through his playlist and directed various songs to be played over the loudspeakers while he swayed on the stage yesterday. He sort of similarly stood by idly while they waited for the microphone to be fixed. We'll see what happens today when he speaks in front of this crowd in western Pennsylvania. This is a key part of the state. It's a county Westmoreland that he actually won by a 2 to 1 margin four years ago, and they're hoping for a similar outcome here in this election, Fred.",

I do want to get more insight on these developments and as we're waiting to see what is going to happen next. Joining me now is Avi Mayer, the former editor-in-chief of The Jerusalem Post who has also held roles at the American Jewish Committee and in the Israeli Defense Forces. Avi, great to have you here. You know, Israel has always had this undertone of the way that they protect themselves is through strength, is through going into Rafah when they are being told by U.S. allies don't go into Rafah very explicitly. I mean, clearly, there's a bit of swagger in what you just saw in that video from Netanyahu of his thinking. I wonder what you read into that. AVI MAYER, FORMER EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, THE JERUSALEM POST: Well, Kaitlan, this moment has been likened to the killing of Osama bin Laden by U.S. forces. There's the sense that justice has been done. The Yahya Sinwar, the mastermind of the October 7th massacre, the worst mass murder since the Holocaust has finally been eliminated. But this is not a sense of closure for many Israelis. As you mentioned, there are 101 hostages who are still being held in Gaza. We don't know what their fate is at this time. There are tens of thousands of who have yet to return to their homes in both the north and the south of the country due to ongoing rocket attacks by Hezbollah. And so, there's a sense in Israel that there's still work to be done. And as you said, this could indeed be a pivotal moment. This seems to be an opportunity to, as you said, call it a win, move on and try to figure out how to get those hostages home as quickly as possible.",

      "sentences": "Well, Kaitlan, the president himself said that that Sinwar was an obstacle, the main obstacle to any kind of deal. Now this is an opportunity to actually bring one about.But there's a great deal of uncertainty. There is, as we understand, a great deal of disarray, in Hamas, in its ranks, who the new leadership is. We understand that they may not even reveal who leader is for fear that this individual may, indeed, be killed in the future. And so we don't know who calls the shots at this time. As I said, there are certainly hope that if you apply the pressure on those leaders of Hamas in Doha, Qatar, that, in fact, that could generate some kind of momentum towards a deal at this time. But at this point, it's unclear whether that will be what it actually takes the point at this point. COLLINS: That's really interesting. So you, you've heard that Hamas may not actually name who it is that's going to the Sinwar's successor out of a fear of his safety. I mean, we've seen this is happening in Iran, with the supreme leader there. Obviously, they we're able to kill high-ranking Hezbollah officials. And so they seem to be concerned about actually naming that successor?",

He's a symbol for the Palestinian terrorist organizations.And his loss is a crushing blow to those organizations. We have seen indications in Gaza that there is now open opposition to Hamas in ways that there hadn't been just one week ago. And one can hope that will offer the momentum needed to seal a deal and bring those hostages home.",

But despite the IDF's confirmation of his killing, little has been made clear about what's next. Joining me now is Ruby Chen, the family, the father of an American hostage, Itay, and who is, of course, in Gaza still being held. When you heard this news that Sinwar had been killed, which, we've now learned was an intelligence operation, a sophisticated thing that was kind of happenstance almost.

So Itay is one of the seven U.S. hostages and we had a call yesterday with Mr. Blackman (ph) that gave us an update following his conversation with the president and Jake Sullivan and Secretary of State Blinken and others.And I see the U.S. determined to move forward and find -- understand that this is a window of opportunity. We've been told for many, many weeks that Sinwar is an obstacle. He had no intention to move forward with a negotiation. The last couple of weeks, we saw the series that he had of creating a regional war materializing with Hezbollah, Lebanon, in the north, Iran, the Houthis. And he had no intention of negotiating. And now with Sinwar gone, he's not an obstacle anymore. And the U.S. is committed before the elections with this administration to do whatever it can to bring a deal. But at the end, the prime minister of Israel needs to do deliver the goods. The goods is a ceasefire. The goods is an offer or proposal that could be gracious to a limited period of time with the ceasefire that the prime minister has said multiple times in the past, he has said, to end this war, and release the hostages. So I would now like to ask the Palestinian people in Gaza, the suffering, the suffering that has happened to build sides. It's not a competition of who is suffering more. It needs to end. I urge you, the people that are hold these hostages, the new committee that is formed that is leading Hamas, pressure them. Tell them we've had enough. We want a better future for our children. We want this to end. The way to make it end is a deal and with the hostages coming out.",
