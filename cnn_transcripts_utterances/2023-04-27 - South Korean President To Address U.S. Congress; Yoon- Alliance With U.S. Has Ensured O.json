Russia continues to pound targets in Southern Ukraine a speculation mounts about the timing of unexpected Ukrainian counter offensive. And in a landmark decision, the Pope will allow women to vote in an influential meeting of bishops. Plus right wing demonstrators are rallying outside the Knesset to show support for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's judicial reform legislation. Well, any moment now South Korea's President is expected to address a joint session of U.S. Congress. His speech will mark a 70 year alliance between Washington and Seoul. This comes after Yoon Suk-Yoel and U.S. President Joe Biden announced a key security agreement to deter North Korean aggression. CNN's Arlette Saenz joins us now from Washington. It certainly has been a key state visit. We saw the South Korean President last night surprising guests about White House dinner, singing American Pie marking the 70th anniversary of this alliance leader certainly looked quite close last night. What's the status of U.S. South Korean relations right now?",

      "sentences": "Well, and the President had invited South Korean President Yoon here to the White House to celebratethat 70 year alliance. But you actually have seen these two men kind of develop this relationship over the course of the past year as South Korea's President Yoon came into office. Biden visited Seoul shortly after his election and they've met over the course of the last year at various summits. But yesterday, President Biden insisted that the alliance between the two countries is ironclad. The two leaders also rolled out a pretty significant agreement when it comes to trying to deter North Korea from using any nuclear capabilities. This agreement, which was known as the Washington Doctrine, essentially was trying to place a marker in the U.S.'s and South Korea's actions and responses that they're trying to take to deter North Korea from any nuclear options. Now, one thing that this will include is the U.S. will mobilize some strategic assets to the region that includes sending in a U.S. nuclear ballistic submarine for the first time sending one to South Korea since the 1980s. What officials say is that they want to be able to visibly show that they are prepared to act as a deterrent to North Korea. Now, officials have said that there are not going to station any type of nuclear weapons in the region and the movement of that submarine and other strategic assets is only being done on a temporary basis. But it highlights the concern that both U.S. and South Korea has about North Korea's nuclear capabilities. Yesterday, President Biden issued a very stark warning saying that North Korea should not launch any type of attack against the U.S. South Korea or other allies and warning that if it does, so it would be the end of the regime that makes that decision to do such a take such an option. Now we also know that the U.S. has been trying to strengthen relations in the region as China's influence in the region has grown. And also this visit has played out against the backdrop of those recently leaked classified Pentagon documents which included intelligence relating to South Korea. The South Korean President said that that has not impacted the relationship between the two countries. But in just a short while he will be addressing Congress. This is only the third time foreign leader has addressed Congress during the Biden Administration. Macron did so as well as Ukrainian President Zelenskyy. But certainly the focus of the past two days for this administration has been trying to highlight the ties between the two countries at a time when they're trying to counter both China's influence in the region as well as these provocations from North Korea.",

      "sentences": "Well, I think that just to highlight about that steak dinner, I think that will go down as probably one of the most memorable moments whereyou've seen a foreign leader at a steak dinner. This is only the second one that the Biden Administration was able to hold. They had held one previously in December for French President Macron, but certainly now he will turn to have a little bit more of a serious tone as he sat to address Congress right now. We know that Congress is also very concerned when it comes to the threats and provocations from North Korea. We also know that they are concerned about China's growing influence in the region. So this will give President Yoon an opportunity to put to not only highlight the U.S.'s relationship with South Korea, but also kind of make his case for what more they need to ensure that they are protected from North Korea, as well as offer his thoughts about China's influence in the region.",

They're standing they're clapping he's walking along shaking hands. Clearly this is a strong alliance 70 years in the making of both the U.S. and South Korea have something to gain from this relationship. We do expect his speech to talk about the key values of freedom, democracy and independence. What else do we expect to hear when he speaks to Congress?",

So I think those are all things that he could also be talking about. It's also worth noting that the two men while they were here also talked about just the long standing ties between the two countries, also relating back to the Korean War. I think one moment that the President Biden spoke about, as they hosted on arrival ceremony is that they were actually able to identify the remains of a Medal of Honor recipient who had gone missing during the Korean War. They talked about how finally they were able to identify those remains and return them to his family. So it kind of points to this deep connection that you've seen between the two countries for so long, something that both the U.S. and South Korea have been eager to highlight during this visit.",

He was trying to kind of downplay any possible rifts that might be caused by the leaks of those classified documents. But we do know that the administration has been working the past few weeks trying to talk to allies assure allies in the wake of these leaks, which was quite embarrassing for the United States for to have that information out in the public on the internet for anyone to see. But the South Korean President over the course of his visit has tried to stress that he does not believe that the ties between the two countries have been deeply impacted by these leaks.",

Speaking about the 70-year alliance datingback to the Korean War when sons and daughters of America he said fought for a country they never met and a people they never knew, you can see the standing ovation there from lawmakers in congress. President Yoon said the alliance is stronger than ever right now. And he spoke about the threats to democracy and the rule of law and the need to protect peace, which in turn, he says brings prosperity. Well, I want to bring in Melanie Zanona on Capitol Hill and Paula Hancocks in Seoul. Good to have you both with us listening to that speech. I want to start with you first Melanie.

Now he got a number of cheers and standing ovations when he mentioned a number of those investments that Korean companies have made in the United States pointing out just how many jobs have been created for Americans as well. So really knowing to talk to his audience that he got a standing ovation as well, speaking about hundreds, thousands of jobs that were being created, but it really was a bit of a pitch as well to show just how far Korea has come.",
