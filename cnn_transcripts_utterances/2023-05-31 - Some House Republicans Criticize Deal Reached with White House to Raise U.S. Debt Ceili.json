Sir, good to have you with us this morning. The big question, which I know you are getting, is where things stand. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise saying last night despite all this harsh criticism from the party, the caucus is coming together around the legislation. So this morning, do you agree? Do you have the votes? REP. TOM EMMER, (R-MN):  Oh, yes, it's going to pass today. A lot of this is fun for the media and people who like to watch human beings have disagreements. But at the end of the day, the House Republicans know what's at stake. That's one of the reasons that Kevin McCarthy tried to get this done starting the moment this new Congress began. It's one of the reasons that under his leadership Republicans passed a bill to avoid default more than a month ago. And it took the president, the White House more than 100 days to actually sit down and start getting serious. This is a great deal for Republicans. This is a $2.1 trillion cut.
