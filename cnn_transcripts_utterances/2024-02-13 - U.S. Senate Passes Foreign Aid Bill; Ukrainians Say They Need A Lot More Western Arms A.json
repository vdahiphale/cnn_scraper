As you mentioned, Speaker Mike Johnson put out a statement last night essentially rejecting this foreign aid package because it does not contain border security provisions, even though it was Johnson and his House Republican conference themselves who helped kill that Senate bipartisan border deal that was put together just a few weeks ago. Now, Donald Trump has had a huge impact on the politics here. He had encouraged Republicans to reject the Senate border deal, and just over the weekend, he put out a statement encouraging Republicans to reject the Senate aid package as well, saying all foreign aid from here on out should be provided as a loan. And even Lindsey Graham, a Republican Senator who has long been a staunch supporter of Ukraine aid, is now echoing those comments from Trump. So, just a remarkable shift in the politics here in the GOP over the last few years. Now, Democrats in the House could try to use a discharge petition. That is a tool that would essentially force the aid package to the floor and go around Johnson's head. But that would require some buy-in from Republicans. And it is a tricky, time-consuming process. And it's unclear how exactly that would play out. Another option here is for Johnson to put the package on the floor, but to allow an amendment process. But that could also risk some blowback from Johnson's right flank, since they don't want to see any Ukraine aid on the floor. So, just a huge bitter divide in the GOP right now over this issue, and it's shaping up to be a real showdown between the House and Senate. Bianna.",

But he, right now, really needs to talk to his conference and try to see what the will of the House Republican majority is. He's very wary of making any moves that are going to put him in the cross here, particularly with his right flank. So, that is going to be a topic of conversation in the coming days, but certainly very large questions, as I said, about just the uncertain path here in the House.",

How likely do you think this maneuver that we heard from Melanie described as the discharge petition, how likely do you think we could see that actually unfold? GARCIA-NAVARRO: I mean, it really is quite remarkable that this is where things are at. Ultimately, because you have Mr. Johnson as the Speaker of the House. He has the power to decide what gets put on the floor. And then this would be a kind of end run around that particular power. I mean, again, the problem here is that you have Donald Trump, who is the likely nominee for the Republican side for the presidency, saying that he is against this and all of his allies in the House, including Speaker Johnson, are trying to sort of speak to his will. And so it's unclear at this moment really what is going to happen. This is very high stakes. This is past the Senate, which is a huge hurdle. And it really remains to be seen what will happen in the House. Let's not forget, this isn't only about Ukraine aid, though. This is about aid to Israel.

I just want to get your take, Lulu, on what this really says about his hold over the Republican Party. I mean, you have people like Senator Lindsey Graham, for example, who have traditionally always been a hawk. And now he's done this dramatic about-face, as Donald Trump talks about, you know, sort of packaging these aid plans as loans to allies rather than as sort of aid. Just give us your take on that, just seeing people like Lindsey Graham do a dramatic about-face in that way. GARCIA-NAVARRO: It's not just Lindsey Graham. I mean, it's extraordinary that we've seen the Republican Party almost writ large take a completely different tact on Russia, on its geopolitical importance to the United States, and on President Putin himself. And, you know, and excoriating who were our allies, you know, in Europe. So, I think people are now used to it. They do know that Donald Trump has the Republican Party in its grip. Not fully though, and that's why we saw what happened in the Senate, and that's why that is quite important. But the House is a different question. And ultimately there are two sides to the American system of governance in Congress, and it remains to be seen what happens in the House. But I think it really does speak to this fact that it is not clear at this moment what the Republican Party actually wants. We've seen this back and forth that they wanted aid to the southern border. They couldn't get that through. They want aid to Israel as a stand-alone. They couldn't get that through.

      "sentences": "Well, if the hostage talks were successful, as we understand them at the moment, the way it'sstructured is around three phases. The first phase, which seems to have a broad sense of agreement, not obviously enough to actually push it over the finish line. And the key thing is about is it a temporary pause of six weeks or is it something that can substantially get to a permanent ceasefire? But even a pause of six weeks could make it difficult, you know, for the IDF to be able to pick up again, get the initiative going again, and go into Rafah and chase down Hamas. And obviously for Hamas, it would give them an opportunity to move around. The IDF has been very methodical about what it's doing, moving from the north of the Gaza Strip to the south through the center and Khan Younis where it's been basically bogged down going through Hamas tunnels, trying to, you know, route them from there over a period of more than two months now, which indicates the difficulty they would face in Rafah. But that difficulty would be multiplied if there were a pause because it would give Hamas a chance to scatter out of Rafah because the things that they're demanding are a pullback of IDF forces for the IDF not to be allowed to use drones, which would give them on the ground an advantage. And so, even if the IDF, after six weeks, picked up and restarted its military operations in Rafah, and even if the civilian population have been able to move from Rafah to other areas to be out of the way of the danger, the chances are Hamas would likely have relocated themselves. Now, what the IDF is doing, obviously, is blowing up all their tunnels so that Hamas can't go back to those tunnels. But there are other ways and places, of course, to hide. Now, I talked with the IDF spokesman just yesterday after that hostage rescue operation to try to figure out if the military has a plan to keep civilians safe. Because I think the instructive thing about that hostage rescue yesterday again reaffirmed the widely held understanding that you can't put IDF troops on the ground in an -- in a heavily -- in an environment where there are so many people living so close together without getting a huge number of civilian casualties close to a hundred people killed yesterday in that operation and many of them were women and children.

So, the current guidelines are that if you test positive for COVID-19, you should isolate for at least five days and continue to isolate if you have symptoms. What the update might be this spring is that you no longer have that blanket period of isolation. It's more so based on symptoms. If you do not have a fever for at least 24 hours without medication, and your symptoms are generally mild or they're improving, then you no longer have to isolate. That's what discussions have been. Now, like I said, these are not guidelines right now. This could be an update in the spring.

Some Republicans in the House say, look, the U.S. should be focused on its own problems. Look at what's happening on the southern border. Other Republicans say that they think that, you know, Putin's going to win anyway. What is the point of sending -- this is their argument, not mine. What is the point of sending Ukraine billions of more in terms of U.S. military assistance when it is clear that Putin will never allow himself to lose and that it's going to be very, very difficult for Ukraine to at any point in time, even with more money thrown at the problem, get the upper hand?

Now, I think it's high time to give additional example, to give even more successful example to the rest of the world. I think these events, this Russian aggression against Ukraine has given a serious crush test to each and every nation, including to European nations. They certainly have to check now their capabilities, their defense capabilities, their expenditures, their ability to produce more armor or weapons. This is mutually beneficial for Ukraine and for European nations. And by the way, we are moving in this direction. We are moving in this direction with U.S. companies, as well. You remember, you had a very important conference in D.C. where Ukrainian military industries and U.S. military industries were talking together in how to enrich the capabilities and how to start the joint production. This is certainly beneficial for Ukraine because we need this armor and weapons. But it's also beneficial for the U.S. because this is additional working places, this is additional sign of leadership for your country.

It's something you don't see every day. You know what? This city has been transformed into something that New York residents have experienced in over 740 days -- 744 to be exact. That's the last time we had over 6 centimeters of snow on the ground. And that's significant because unofficially we have gotten that amount of snow here. We haven't gotten an update from the National Weather Service just yet. But this is significant because that's the most snow in over two years. I mean people have almost yearned for it to happen even though it's been an impactful storm, we know that over a thousand flights have been canceled along the East Coast. And of course, the roadways have been impacted as this heavy, wet snow accumulated. It's just really turned into such a beautiful site for some of these larger cities that have been transformed into a winter wonderland, a different site because so many of the East Coast cities have had one of their top five warmest winters to date. And that's saying something now that we're getting into the snowier, colder weather pattern that has transformed things around here. Get to my graphics because I want to show you just how much snow has fallen as of 11 a.m. Eastern Standard Time. Central Park, three centimeters but we did an unofficial weather check here from CNN weather. We have at least six centimeters on the ground so that would be, if that does actually confirm that would be the most snow that they've had in over two years. But look at Pennsylvania -- over 38 centimeters of snow. I talked about how this was going to be a quick-hitting, fast-punching snowstorm and it certainly was. You can see on the radar that things are coming to an end, the back end of that precipitation line, now moving through New York, Philadelphia, Boston, the outer Cape, that area still being pounded by heavy snow and strong winds that, Zain, you encountered on your way to work earlier this morning. You get a little bit closer to that I-95 corridor, a very busy stretch of road that extends from Boston through New York to Philadelphia. That area is generally snow-covered, kind of dangerous to get around, but conditions will be improving because the storm is coming to an end. And we'll say goodbye just as quickly as the storm said hello to us earlier this morning. But definitely winter wonderland at its finest here in Central Park. Zain, back to you.",

ATHENA JONES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Bianna. Well, the weather is definitely impacting turnout. That's what the poll workers tell me behind me. And it's also what we've seen. We were at a middle school early this morning from about six to eight. Only saw a trickle of voters coming in. We've been here since then. And again, not seeing very many people coming to line up and vote. Now, these poll workers tell me that part of this has to do with the fact that this is a special election. The other part is the snow. Schools are closed. A lot of people aren't going to be commuting into work, so they're not coming by the voting place on their way to the train to head into the city. And also the fact that so many people voted early, more than 80,000 people voted early. The majority of those were Democratic votes during the nine days of early voting. And just to really drive the point home in terms of turnout, Bianna, I just spoke to a poll worker who said that in the last six hours or so, their district, one of these three tables, their district has seen about 40 voters, whereas usually they'd see 400 an hour during the weekday of early voting or 1100 on a weekend day of early voting. So, it gives you some sense of how low the turnout is. The voters I've talked to are splitting pretty much down the middle of this very closely watched race that, as you said, could play a big role in -- is going to play a role in determining the margin in the House. There's already a very narrow GOP margin, seven seats. Of course the Democrats are hoping to pick up the seat here. This also could be a good signal for what can be expected in 2024. What party's messaging is going to win the day when it comes to the big election in November for the White House and for Congress? I can say this district is so important because this is exactly the kind of suburban district that political observers expect to decide that election in 2024, and this district has changed quite a bit just in a few years. In 2020, Joe Biden beat Donald Trump by eight points. Santos lost to Swazi by double digits that same year. But just two years later, in 2022, Santos was able to beat his Democratic rival by seven points. So, this district is changing. We know the big issues, immigration and abortion are shaping votes here. And so, we'll have to see how it all plays out. Bianna.",
