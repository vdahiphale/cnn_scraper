You're joining us now from the Hague. Christiane, can you give us what details stood out to you during this interview in an unprecedented move by the ICC. CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR:  Absolutely. In terms of unprecedented, that's because the charges against Israel are for the first time a charge against an actual democracy and a democratic leader. I think one must not deemphasize and ignore the severity of the charges against Hamas. And they issued this seeking approval for arrest warrants according to the timeline. So they've laid out the arrest warrants that they want for Hamas, which included eight counts of crimes against humanity and war crimes, which were mass killings. They call it extermination, torture, rape, and sexual assault, even in captivity of the hostages, all the things that went on against the civilians inside Israel on October 7th. And then they turn to what happened in subsequently in Israel's war against Gaza and against Hamas as where they focus quite heavily on starvation as a weapon of war. Here is what ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan told me. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)",

And unanimously, they did. And there were very distinguished global jurists, including the Theodor, Ted, Theron (ph), Meron, rather, who was the former ICC president and also himself a holocaust survivor. And at one point he was adviser to the Israeli foreign ministry many decades ago. So they have a very distinguished panel of jurists who he ran all this by before even making today's announcement. And what they agree is that the ICC has requested and has presented what the evidence it says could get a conviction, not just that would stand up in a court and go to trial, but that could get a conviction based on all the evidence they have presented, some of which is in the public sphere on both sides, some of which they have received from talking to all the relevant individuals and parties, victims, and others.",

We just was handed a statement coming from Benny Gantz, a member of the Israeli war cabinet, of course, someone who has clashed with Netanyahu on strategy and far beyond of recent. Here's what Benny Gantz just put out in a statement, Beth, \"While Israel fights with one of the strictest moral codes in history, while complying with international law and boasting a robust, independent judiciary, drawing parallels between the leaders of a democratic country determined to defend its itself from despicable terror two leaders of a bloodthirsty terror organization is a deep distortion of justice and blatant moral bankruptcy.\"",

We don't know where it's going to go. We don't know that it will actually get to the point of arrest warrants. But the effects of this are actually going to be quite counter, I think, to what anybody who is rejoicing this kind of balanced with what Khan is trying to do is kind of a balanced approach to this, is we're going to see a circling of the wagons in Israel.I think this will benefit Netanyahu. And I think it also will make it very, very much more difficult to actually get to a ceasefire. And that is an argument the United States has consistently made in terms of the ICC intervention in the whole Palestinian-Israel conflict even before for this. But we have a couple of steps here to go, and I'm not at all certain that it will result in actual arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant at the end of the day. And I'll stop there.",

And as I said before, I think that, you know, let's understand that a majority -- seeing protests in the streets over the hostages and Netanyahu's de-prioritization of hostages over prosecuting this war, most Israelis still support the way that this war has been prosecuted. So I think actually in the end, if these warrants go through, it's going to weaken Biden's hand because it will only force, I think, in some ways the Israelis to double down.I know that's a little counterproductive, but the Israelis say things like we're going to eat grass rather than accept the dictate of foreign voices in how we conduct this war. And that actually has been proven in polling. That's where the Israeli public is. So I think that they would go forward.

Yair Lapid, the member -- the leader of the opposition is also calling this a complete moral failure. We should note that among the charges that are listed here against Israel's leaders are crimes against humanity. There is also this notion of using starvation as a weapon of war and that is something that the ICC really has drilled down on here, and prosecutor, Karim Khan focused on the fact that as this was happening, as there appear to be limits on the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza as there were condemnations of Israel not allowing enough aid in, that he issued multiple warnings saying that Israel needed to turn the spigot of aid back on and warned of consequences should they not. And these consequences appear to now be flowing in as he seeks arrest warrants against both the Israeli prime minister and the defense minister. We also have yet to hear from Hamas directly reacting to this and the charges that they are facing are extermination as a crime against humanity, the taking of hostages as a war crime, rape, and other there acts of sexual violence. A big focus on the crimes that Hamas committed on October 7th, and the crimes that the ICC says they continue to commit by continuing to hold nearly 130 hostages captive, including the allegations of sexual assault against some of those hostages and against the victims of October 7th.  Karim Khan, the prosecutor here actually did visit the site of the massacre that took place on October 7th in Israel and he notes that in his statement today.",

They have said that they don't believe the ICC has jurisdiction over this, and they say that there are two reasons for that.First of all, because Israel is not a party to the ICC; therefore, they haven't consented to them actually having jurisdiction over Israel, and then they point that the Palestinians and of course, Hamas do not actually make a state and therefore, they cannot participate or delegate in the jurisdiction of the ICC. So they just simply don't think that the ICC should be looking into this matter and they've been very clear in their opposition on that front. So now how do they respond? That's the key question here, Kate. We have heard from lawmakers who have said, if the ICC moves forward with these arrest warrants, which we of course saw today that they believe that the Biden administration should put sanctions on ICC officials, those sanctions were in place during the Trump administration. The Biden administration reversed those sanctions. The State Department hasn't said if they would consider that move.
