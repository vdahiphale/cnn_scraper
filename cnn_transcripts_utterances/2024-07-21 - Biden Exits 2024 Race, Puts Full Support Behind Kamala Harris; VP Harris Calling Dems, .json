President Biden's decision comes after weeks of defections by congressional Democrats and donors following what is largely considered one of, if not the worst presidential debate performance in the history of these United States and one that made concerns over his cognitive abilities and fitness for office a seemingly insurmountable hurdle to win a second term.Quoting President Biden's announcement today, quote, \"It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your president, and while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as president for the remainder of my term,\" unquote.",

But what we do know is that the vice president has been busy, furiously making phone calls, reaching out to Democratic leaders all afternoon to try to round up that support and make sure that she comes across as the person that is leading the party. One thing, Jake, just to note quickly is that, you know, we've also just been discussing this idea of the president back in 2020 having run as the bridge and the transition candidate, will now, as of this afternoon, we finally have the 81-year-old president trying to successfully now pass that torch on to his 59-year-old vice president.

You get into the contest and run the race. I remember when I got elected to Congress a lot of people discouraged me from running because I had run for other officers and had lost.And one friend said to me, you've lost three races. Three strikes and you're out. And that's the baseball rule. You don't live your life by baseball rules. And so, you can't not say I can't if you've never tried. So we get in here. You make the best case. I do think she's the best candidate, best prepared candidate at this particular juncture. I think the American people will see that in her, and they will compare her to the alternative. Just as Joe Biden often asked people to do with him and Donald Trump, she gets that opportunity. And I do believe that when the American people see her stacked up against Donald Trump and his 2025 Project, and what he has in store for the American people, she is going to win this race and she is going to win it with massive support, not just from other Democrats across the board and independents. I've already seen it. I don't know if it's true or not. I'm very leery about the stuff I see online. That some PAC associated with Nikki Haley just endorsed her.

I know the people who were working for him in the White House are proud of what they've been able to achieve in these now almost four years and I think it's also -- we should also acknowledge the campaign staff in Wilmington who have been going through an excruciating three weeks here. You know, on every campaign, look, I've worked on campaigns for 20 years. On every campaign you're going to have bad moments. You're going to have moments where you're up and down, where you feel like you have to send your staff out to really, you know, to really fight the fight in a tough moment. I don't know that any moment politically has been harder than the last three weeks the Biden campaign has been through. And so, you know, for the people who kept their heads down and were doing the work in Wilmington, I know this is an incredibly emotional and difficult day, but I do think that President Biden will be remembered fondly for it. I do think it's an incredibly selfless thing that he did.

I assume some young voters will be excited about the vice president. But from the Republican perspective, and I was just messaging with someone on Trump's campaign, a senior adviser, she can't run away from Joe Biden's policies.She can't run away from his four years on the economy and inflation, which is still a top issue for most Americans. She can't run away from the issue of immigration. That's still a top issue for a significant percent of Americans. And there is a very valid question, politically speaking, of how will the vice president will perform with swing voters? How well can the vice president perform with some of those moderate-leaning Republicans? It's one thing to support President Biden. It's a whole another thing to support his vice presidential running mate, and she hasn't been tested yet to see if whether or not she performs well. But I will just say as quickly, Jake, congratulations to the vice president. She will be the nominee, and this will be an incredibly historic moment for her. She's just a step away from the politics. In that regard I'm very proud of her, but to get back into the mix of politics, let's have that exchange of ideas.",

And he also told me that he thinks he can defeat Vice President Harris and I pointed out, you know, she's not the nominee yet. And what does this mean for your campaign? He said he believes he can defeat her very well, maybe her as the nominee based on what we're seeing tonight, we don't know yet, but they have been prepared to run against President Biden. After that debate in Atlanta they felt that was going to be a pretty easy prospect and they were kind of, you know, measuring the drapes already and riding a high, you could feel it at the Republican convention last week.

Remember we also had some Nikki Haley voters in the Pennsylvania suburbs here who don't want to vote for Donald Trump, but weren't sure they could. Some said they never could vote for Joe Biden. We're getting a lot of hook about Kamala Harris when we talked to them so that they don't think she's up to the job. So we'll watch how this shakes out. Democrats do seem to be happy.
