The unemployment rate meantime dropped to 3.5 percent. A new CNN poll found half of Americans say their personal financial situation is worse than it was a year ago. And the President of the nation's largest bank exclusively telling CNN that the threat of a recession still looms following the recent banking crisis. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Fred, White House officials make clear this is a complex moment in the U.S. economy. It has really been since the pandemic and as the country is trying to come out of the pandemic. When they look at this jobs report with the President but also his economic team, look at this jobs report, they actually see the deceleration in jobs growth as a positive. And while that seems a little bit paradoxical, let me explain, they need some cooling.Why do they need some cooling in the U.S. economy? Well, what's been the biggest economic issue for the better part of a year? It has been inflation, which has also started to decelerate, but they need it to decelerate more in order for this - the Federal Reserve to pull back on those rapid rate increases. So the President saying it is a good report, acknowledging that there is certainly more work to do at this point in time, but also trying to draw very clear contrast saying in a statement: \"Extreme MAGA Republicans in Congress, on the other hand,\" comparing to the administration's work, \"are threatening to wreak havoc on our economy with the debt limit brinksmanship. Their extreme agenda would send the unprecedented investments we've made here in America - along with the jobs that come with it - overseas.\" So White House officials and the President making very clear that, yes, there are certainly concerns and potential dark clouds ahead in the U.S. economy, although they believe the recovery has been very robust, particularly when you look at the labor force participation rate. But you compare that to what Republicans are proposing and they think voters are, at least politically, it's on their side.",

And I think it also underscores though, in all seriousness, why White House officials - why the President, why his team have been so consistent on trying to raise the contrast. When you look at the latest CNN polling, only 29 percent of Americans feel good about where the economy is right now.Now, here's the very low bar from last fall. It's actually seven points better than what it was last fall. That is not necessarily a bar that only clearing by seven points put you in a great position on, but it is the reality in this moment. And the reason why that's problematic, politically, is like most elections, like most election cycles, most important issue in our poll by far for Americans was the economy. So seeing some positive growth in terms of how people are feeling, people are generally still feeling not great about where things stand, a lot of uncertainty over the course of the last couple of weeks, Fred, and I think it underscores why you see the President out constantly talking about his legislative wins out in the country, they think that will have an effect and they needed to have an effect, Fred.",

Yes, there were some bad moments in 2011 and 2013 and that was unpleasant and scary, but they've learned their lesson.I think that's the wrong takeaway. In fact, if anything, the Republican Party has gotten nuttier since then. Speaker McCarthy has a much narrower majority this time around, which means that he has to appease every fringe element of his party and I don't know how he's going to do that, so I'm very concerned about the debt limit.

He says he had to go to the doctor and was diagnosed with to stomach ulcers. She eventually was arrested and she is now facing three counts of poisoning, one count of domestic battery. Now she plans to plead not guilty, that's according to her attorney. I spoke to that attorney and he says that this was all orchestrated in order to win in divorce court.   What he says here is that the house had a known ant problem and that they use to try to bait and kill these ants with the lemonade and the Drano so the defense attorney saying that Dr. Chen, essentially would have known if he was drinking that Drano because of how strong that chemical taste is, how it smells. He says the injuries are not consistent. And he says he didn't call 911. Instead, he went to his divorce attorney. So again, it's kind of a he said, she said situation.
