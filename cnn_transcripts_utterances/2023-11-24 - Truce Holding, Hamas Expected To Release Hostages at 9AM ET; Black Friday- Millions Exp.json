It's just about 12:30 in the afternoon there and the four-day truce negotiated between Hamas and Israel appears to be holding. Hamas has agreed to release the first 13 of the agreed-upon 50 hostage this -- hostages this morning around 9:00 a.m. Eastern time, which is 4:00 p.m. local time. In exchange, Israel is set to release 39 Palestinian prisoners housed here at Ofer Prison sometime today. CNN's Oren Liebermann is live in Tel Aviv for us.

This was all a meticulous plan that has to follow a pretty meticulous timeline for everything to work as it's supposed to and that began with the pause in fighting at 7We did hear some Israeli artillery fire shortly after that. But just a few minutes later, some red alerts warning of potential incoming rocket fire. But by about 7:20, the skies above Gaza were clear and we didn't hear any more of the major fighting that has dominated Gaza over the course of the past nearly seven weeks. From there, humanitarian aid began to flow into Gaza -- fuel, cooking oil -- desperately needed supplies that are just a fraction of what the -- of what Gaza needs for the dire humanitarian crisis that has unfolded there and deepened over the course of the past weeks. That leads to the next stages and that's what we're waiting on right now. At 4:00 -- so in about 3 1/2 hours from now there will be the first release of Israeli hostages under this agreement -- 13 women and children -- that will play out by a very specific process. And then once it's confirmed that those 13 have exited Gaza there will be the release, as we understand it from an Israeli official, of 39 Palestinian women and children held in Israeli jails. They will return to their homes in the occupied West Bank and Jerusalem. If this process works out today it will continue into tomorrow. U.S. officials very clearly view these first two days as a testing day to make sure this very sensitive and complicated agreement can work as anticipated to release what will be 50 Israeli women and children over the course of this agreement. And then, Max, is -- there becomes the potential of extending that. But first, you have to make sure this part works.",

There were shortly after the truce formally began. That's not unusual, is it? It has calmed down so it's looking really positive right now. KIM DOZER, CNN GLOBAL ANALYST (via Webex by Cisco):  Yeah. In the past, when they've had ceasefires like this during incursions there have been breaks. There have been minor skirmishes. But the Israeli Defense Forces Moda Operandi is to not respond unless it's a major attack on their troops or a major barrage of rockets heading towards Israel. They expect that there might be the occasional militant that Hamas does not have control of -- maybe a member of Palestinian Islamic Jihad -- who might try something. So right now, their job is to hunker down. They will be moving around for the positioning for future operations but it's to try not to respond. One thing, though, that's a bit of a flashpoint is that they have leafleted to Palestinians that they're not supposed to try to move north on the one route that's open. And already, there have been reports on the ground of Israeli troops having to use tear gas and other non-lethal means to try to keep Palestinians from surging north to revisit their homes or, in some cases, to try to find loved ones who are lost in the rubble in the flight south.",

And there will be pressure from the international community. Why not keep the guns silent until you -- we get more aid in to the Palestinian people after this long drought without regular aid coming over the southern border? There is also going to be criticism of Israel for this process of telling Palestinians that they should move from one area to the other, depending on wherever the fighting is. Aid groups normally want to try to organize one or two safe spaces where they can stockpile things like tents. It's getting cold in Israel and the Palestinian areas.
