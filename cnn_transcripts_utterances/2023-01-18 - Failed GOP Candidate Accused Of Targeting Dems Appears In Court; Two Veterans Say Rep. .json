A year later, Pena ran for office in New Mexico as a Republican candidate for the State House. He lost last November by a landslide but Pena echoing Trump would not accept an election loss. Police say he targeted four Democrats to blame, finding their addresses and confronting them. DEBBIE O'MALLEY, BERNALILLO COUNTY COMMISSION CHAIRWOMAN: So I went to the gate and that's where he was. And he seemed agitated, he seemed a little aggressive, and I did tell someone about it. And they said, you know, this guy's a felon. SAM BREGMAN, DISTRICT ATTORNEY, BERNATILLO COUNTY, N.M.: Mr. Pena, that he orchestrated. He made phone calls. He basically hired people to shoot at people's houses. LAH (voice-over): Pena is a convicted felon who spent years behind bars for grand larceny. One of the men he hired say Albuquerque police may have been in the same prison at the same time.

Thanks so much.Turning to our national lead now, we're learning what police found inside the apartment of the suspect in those horrific University of Idaho student murders. CNN's Veronica Miracle has been following the story since the very beginning. And Veronica, this is the first time we're learning about the evidence collected from Brian Kohberger's apartment in Washington State. VERONICA MIRACLE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: That's exactly right, Jake. And during the search warrant, we could really get a sense of what police were looking for. They cast a very wide net and they found more than a dozen items that appear to be quite significant to this investigation. So I'm just going to list some of them off and then talk about why this could be important to the investigation. They found strands of hair, a sample of reddish brown stain on an uncased pillow, they found a black glove, Walmart, and Marshalls receipts, and they found a Fire TV stick as well as a computer tower. Now, we know, reading the search warrant and also the affidavit, they were looking for trace evidence of hair, whether that was a human or an animal. In that affidavit, we were able to discover that Kaylee Goncalves's dog was home at the time of the murders. And according to this search warrant, in Bryan Kohberger's apartment, they were able to find several hair strands, including a possible animal hair strand. We know they were looking for blood and other bodily fluid, and they collected a dark red spot, two reddish brown stains from a pillow, as well as mattress covers with multiple stains. They were also looking for clothing. That suspect, seen by the surviving roommate in the house, was said to be wearing dark clothing from head to toe, including a mask that covered the nose and the mouth. And police were able to find a Walmart receipt with a dickies tag, two Marshalls receipts, and a nitrite type black glove, basically like a medical glove. And finally, they were looking for any kind of digital images, any images that showed the victims, the house, the neighborhood, anything that showed that he -- that Bryan Kohberger may have looked up murders or violent assaults or even how to avoid detections after committing crimes. They were able to find a Fire TV stick, and a computer tower. But, Jake, what they did not discover was a murder weapon inside that apartment. And that murder weapon still has not been found. Jake?",

It's similar in the way it's constructed, except instead of allowing people to features that are banned, that you're only allowed to have one. So it affects far more firearms.And then as far as enforcement goes, I think it will be fairly difficult, especially without cooperation of local law enforcement, as you alluded to at the top of the segment here, because Illinois knows who has guns because they have a firearm owner identification card system. So if you want to own guns, you have to get one of these cards first. But it doesn't know what guns each person has. So how they would go about arresting people who choose not to register firearms or register these guns after 300 days, it's really unclear. The state police could do it, but I don't know that they have the resources. And if they don't have local cooperation, it can be very, very difficult.",

And Democrats had control there, and we're considering a number of gun control policies, but it's now taking root in a lot of other states.And this is kind of the first real test of it because a lot of it had been somewhat symbolic in the sense that the local counties would pass resolutions that say, we won't enforce what we consider to be unconstitutional gun laws. But a lot of it was forward looking, like if you pass something like an assault gun's ban, we're not going to enforce that, or if you try to confiscate people's guns, we're going to resist that effort. Now, you have a situation where these sheriffs and I believe there's over 80 of them, including one for the second most populous county in the state, are really putting that to the test. And the governor, as comments you play at the beginning of this is sort of pushing back and challenge them on their refusal to enforce these laws. And it's really not clear how that's going to shake out, how much power the governor has over these elected local officials is not, I think, really clear.
