Raising the possibility he may be charged with acting on behalf of a foreign government without registering, essentially a FARA charge. That's kind of where things started to unravel the first time, right?",

      "sentences": "Yes, that's exactly right, Boris. That is where things started to come undone because the judge, you know, trying to get to the issue of what is covered in this plea agreement.She thought it was broadly written and didn't spell out what possible offenses existed. So she was asking prosecutors, is this investigation ongoing? And the prosecutor said that it was. So she was pressing him on exactly what does this cover, what is Hunter Biden pleading to, what are you agreeing to not to prosecute? He said he couldn't say what potential charges were on the table, but he said that what they would not prosecute under this agreement was tax offenses, gun offenses or drug offenses. And then the judge said, well, what was about a FARA offense. And it was at that point that the prosecution said that was not included in this agreement. She then asked Hunter Biden's attorney, there seems to be a meeting of the minds here. He said, no we don't. The judge said, well, what does that mean? And then the prosecution said that means the deal is off the table if they're not agreeing to this. Then Hunter Biden's team said, yes, if that's the case, then it's null and void. But then Hunter Biden's attorney said, Judge, can we have 10 minutes to try to work it out? They took a break, longer than 10 minutes. And when they came back, Hunter Biden's team said, OK, we will agree to what the prosecution is now saying the deal encompasses, which is protection from other tax charges, gun charges or drug charges, but not an open-ended immunity. So it seemed that the plea was then back on track. The judge started to go through the normal motions of asking Hunter Biden the regular questions. Did anyone make any promises to him? And things were moving along. But then they moved onto this gun diversion agreement. That's, again, where the judge had some issues. She said, why did you plop me in the middle of this agreement? You are giving me a role here when you have made very clear today that this is an agreement between you two. This is not necessarily something a judge sees. And this is a purview of the executive branch, the decision of whether to bring criminal charges. So she questioned why, if there was a dispute over whether Hunter Biden had breached this diversion agreement, why would it land back in her court. She said she wasn't sure if that was constitutional. So that is another issue that she said. So ultimately, combining the two, she said I'm not in a position today to accept this plea agreement. She said to Hunter Biden, I'm sorry, I know you wanted to get this resolved. But she was saying she wanted to make sure that he understood what he was pleading guilty to and what he was protected from, other possible charges. And to make sure he had a clear understanding of that. And also to ensure that this gun diversion agreement was constitutionally sound. So that made everything fall apart after about four hours into this hearing, which everyone came in today expecting would be pretty perfunctory. But it certainly did not turn out to be the case.",

      "sentences": "Yes. That still has to play out, Jim. That's going to be a major question in the weeks ahead.Because, typically, when these investigations are ongoing, it's much harder for Congress to investigate, to get records from the Justice Department. There's been an effort by Jim Jordan, the chairman of this committee, to ask for information from the Justice Department from this U.S. attorney investigation about everything that's going on here. But if this investigation is ongoing, as the Justice Department is indicating, that makes it much more difficult. And it only makes things much more contentious. And potentially, Republicans believe that could actually escalate things and lead to an impeachment probe if they believe that they are being obstructed in their investigation, much like Donald Trump was a subject, in part, for obstruction of Congress in his first impeachment. So that is all going to be part of the discussion and the debate on Capitol Hill for Republicans in the weeks and months ahead. Now, David Weiss, the U.S. attorney, has agreed before this today, to come to Capitol Hill. The House Judiciary Republicans have not yet agreed to a date for David Weiss to come and testify, the U.S. attorney who was appointed by Donald Trump and held over in the Biden administration. Jim Jordan told me that he wants to interview a number of witnesses before bringing Weiss forward. But Democrats believe it's all an effort to not allow Weiss to set the record straight. The Justice Department, of course, has said that they had not had any involvement in Weiss's decisions here. And Weiss saying that no, Merrick Garland did not interfere as well. So the Democrats believe that he is being prevented from publicly testifying to Republican allegations. But again, this all will play out, Jim, here in the weeks ahead.",

But that the president and first lady do stand by their son.And this is the stance they have taken throughout these entire proceedings, including when news of this plea deal first came out a few months ago. It's important, because the Bidens really do view this as a family matter. Of course, we have seen Hunter Biden, a very visible presence in his father's life. We saw him at the lavish state dinner in India a few months ago. We saw him on the South Lawn for the Fourth of July celebration. He hasn't necessarily shied away from standing next to his father despite all of this. Despite the Republican backlash that hasn't always sat well with some Democrats, who do privately say this could be a distraction for the president and for the White House, as he tries to accomplish his agenda. But certainly, President Biden is not backing away. And you know, when you talk to people close to the Bidens, they do view these charges as an example of a very dark period in Hunter Biden's life. He was obviously rattled by addiction, which is a problem that so many American families are dealing with. They really did view today's proceedings and today's plea as a way to close the chapter on what had been a very dark period in Hunter's life. So the White House is saying today that they do stand by him, but as they have throughout these proceedings, are resisting commenting too much beyond that.",

The Justice Department has been very careful to make clear how independently they are run.David Weiss is overseeing the Hunter Biden matter, was a Trump appointee, kept on to maintain that continuity from the person who sort of was overseeing the investigation earlier. Jack Smith, who is overseeing the Donald Trump investigation, was put in place as special counsel to remove the question of influence or politics coming from the White House and the attorney general's office. So they are fully independent. And in any other Justice Department, the mere fact there's two high- profile cases happening at the same time would mean -- it wouldn't mean they're handled together in the same way. Now, look, like you said, you used the term P.R. It's still a matter that the Justice Department has to confront, the mere fact that looming out there is the prospect of charges for the president. What if President Trump were charged with a crime today? That would just look bad as a functional matter. And frankly, the grand jury is scheduled, I believe, to come back into session tomorrow. So these probably are factors the Justice Department has to consider. But at its core, Boris, they've been very, very careful in making clear these are two very different investigations run by two people, who the attorney general have said close to full autonomy if not full autonomy to make decisions on how they want to proceed.",

Now the question is, where does it go from there? David Weiss, the U.S. attorney in Delaware, or was, has full -- he will be coming up to talk to Congress in the coming weeks or months. And they can ask questions. Now he is not likely to provide some specifics as to the specific decisions he made along the way, investigative steps and so on, but Congress can still ask.

What do you make of this judge pumping the brakes on this plea deal that Hunter Biden had agreed to? REP. ROBERT GARCIA (D-CA): Look, I think the most important thing to remember is Hunter Biden is a private citizen. And anyone in this space has a right to have their day in court. The judge has a right to make changes to the deal. So we have to let the process play out. A lot of information is still coming out. I think all of us in Congress, on the Democratic side, we have said that Hunter Biden should go through the process and the legal process. I think that what is most important is that Republicans not try to politicize this issue. Hunter Biden should be treated fairly within the criminal justice system. If he's committed wrongdoing, he should be held accountable for that. And I think all of us agree on that point. And a broader important point here is that Hunter Biden is not Joe Biden. He's not the president. So the focus needs to stay on Hunter Biden. And I expect we'll hear more from the judge in the development of the field.",

And we have not really had credible testimony. As far as what David Weiss may have said or not said, I think it's obviously a question that will be answered in the weeks and months ahead. We want to get to the truth. All members of Congress, including Democrats want to make sure that Hunter Biden, who is a private citizen, who does not work for the White House and is not Joe Biden, is held accountable. And I think he's obviously taking steps to try to do that. Some of that is obviously changing as we speak, with the kind of the unravel of this current case that's in front of us.

And they want to ensure that the process runs fairly and that justice is served in the appropriate way.We cannot be judging the president or a father based on action that's a son is doing. A lot of us have family and, oftentimes, our family does things that we may not agree with. Hunter Biden certainly needs to certainly be held accountable for any crimes he may have committed.

And hearing after hearing after hearing, we've had a wide variety of folks to come forward. And the Republicans, of course, are not asking the right questions.

At that point, like you mentioned, the deal seemed to be off. They asked for a recess. They tried to get together, reach an agreement. They did come back and told the judge, basically, that they were all good. Ready to move forward. They had settled their disagreements. And that's when she took the reins. She had concerns still remaining, specifically about the provisions of the deal to resolve the felony gun charge that Hunter Biden would have been charged with, because he was in possession of a firearm while being a drug addict. The questions that the judge had were about important whether or not that deal was even constitutional. She repeatedly asked, is this even constitutional? What happens if it's not constitutional? Is there a separation of powers issue? And at that point, she appeared to basically call the whole thing off.
