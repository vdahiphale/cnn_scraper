Following Brexit, he really believes that there is a better way forward with the European Union. There'll be perhaps some side discussions about that around the table at NATO.But, he'll get a second dip, if you will, working with European politicians in another two weeks' time. The UK is hosting a European Committee meeting. 50 different leaders expected to be there, posted mid-July at Blenheim Palace in the British countryside. So, that will also be a burden on his shoulders because he is going to have to manage that and host all those leaders.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR, HOST, \"AMANPOUR\": As we know, a third of French voters voted for you and for your party, and two thirds did not. And as you know, President Macron is trying to get a coalition to stop you, a firewall, so to speak, to stop you becoming the majority in parliament. What does it feel like to be considered so dangerous? How does it feel? MARINE LE PEN, MEMBER, NATIONAL RALLY, &amp; PRESIDENT, NATIONAL RALLY IN FRENCH NATIONAL ASSEMBLY (Interpreted): We don't represent any danger, apart from making him lose power. In reality, all the energy that he puts into fighting us, it's simply because he knows that we are the alternative movement. We are the ones who can secure an absolute majority. The far left does not have that option. So, the danger of which he is talking is a threat to his own power. But, what's paradoxical is that he called for a dissolution by saying that the people should have their say again. But, by strategizing between the two rounds, by withdrawing his candidates, asking people to vote for the far left, he is actually refusing to let French people express themselves freely.

We've heard from an Israeli source that the Hamas response really allowed them to be able to decide whether or not to go into this next phase of negotiation, which is the more detailed phase of negotiation. So, it feels like we are a little further potentially than we have been certainly for many weeks, as these talks have been stalled. We are expecting the talks to continue or at least resume in Doha, potentially as early as today, as early as Friday.We understand from an Israeli source as well that the Mossad director David Barnea will be in attendance. So, the fact that the lead negotiator on the Israeli side is going to be involved would suggest that there is something significant to talk about as well. Now, what we've heard from the senior administration official is that they've managed to take away some of the stumbling blocks that have stalled this process in the past, notably, within this three-phase deal that will be going ahead between the phase one and the phase two. So, phase one is when there is a six-week ceasefire and some hostages will be released in return for some Palestinian prisoners. That was supposed to then evolve into phase two, where there is a longer lasting cessation of hostilities and the remainder of the hostages would be released in return for more Palestinian prisoners. Now, that appeared to have been a real stumbling block. And we had heard from Hamas that they wanted a more definitive timeline from the Israelis as to when this permanent ceasefire would be in place, something which up until now we have seen the Israeli Prime Minister, at least, Benjamin Netanyahu, resisting, even saying that he is not ready for a ceasefire. But, it does appear as though whatever stumbling block there was has now been resolved, at least according to this senior administration official. We are being cautioned, though, this does not mean that a deal is days away. It could still likely take weeks. That we're hearing from the Israeli side, and of course, also pointing out that it is not finalized. A deal is not assured. And it could not happen in the end. But certainly, we do appear to be a lot further along the line than we have been for some time, and that's being felt in Israel as well. We are seeing more protests on the streets. Some of the hostage families were out in Tel Aviv just today. They say thousands were there, pushing the Israeli Prime Minister to sign on this deal and to bring the hostages back. Max.",

But, it would really help the UK economy because Brexit has damaged trade. It has damaged inward investment. It has damaged GDP growth, fundamentally.So, if Starmer can do that, although, again, analysts skeptical that what he is promising is really going to move the needle on the economic costs of Brexit, sort of saying a lot of his agreements are largely technical and will have minimal impact.

It made landfall Tulum this morning, and we're finding some of these tropical storm force winds up near Cozumel and Cancun this morning, 100 mile per hour winds right now in the center. It is weakening because it's over land, but it could get its act together again, as it gets back into the Gulf of Mexico. We're looking at up to four to six feet of storm surge. That's up to two to three meters of -- two meters of storm surge. Rainfall totals four to six inches. They could be up to 10 inches or 250 millimeters as we go through the day today.Then, after this, it gets back into the Gulf of Mexico where these waters are very warm, up around 30 degrees Celsius, and will continue to find some strengthening because that warm water is fuel. That could get its act together as it heads towards Texas later this weekend, probably Sunday and into Monday. Here is what I was mentioning, the sea surface temperatures, we've been talking about this this entire time from Beryl because it has helped to gain its strength multiple times, and it could do it again as it heads towards northern Mexico and southern Texas. What we're watching for closely is this dome of heat and humidity. It will start to weaken and move to east. That's what's going to open up this door for this turn to the north into Texas as we go into the weekend. It's something that we've been watching very closely. So, that's where that track lies right now. We are still looking at some hurricane conditions in the Yucatan Peninsula, as we go through the day today. Hurricane warnings in effect there. Then it emerges tonight into the open waters of the Gulf of Mexico where it could, again, with a warm 30 degrees Celsius sea surface temperatures, warm up again -- again, straight again, and then could gain its hurricane strength again before it heads up towards northern Mexico, southern Texas, and this would be by maybe late Sunday going into Monday. So, we'll have to watch this closely for impacts. This area right here will likely have some watches issued later on today, maybe tropical storm watches or hurricane watches, as we really kind of hone in on that path. But, regardless of where this goes, we're looking at intense rip currents across these beaches through the holiday weekend. A lot of these beaches will be packed with people that have extended holidays off here in America for the Fourth of July holiday. Rip currents incredibly dangerous, already taken a couple of lives already this season. So, something that we need to really pay attention to, as we go into the weekend. Max.",
