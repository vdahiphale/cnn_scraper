How far will Biden go to bring Whelan home?Plus, new details about Brittney Griner's time in a Russian penal colony, cutting off her hair in an effort to survive, singled out because of her height and size of her hands. The reporter breaking those details is OUTFRONT. And going to extremes. Self-proclaimed lava junkies putting their lives on the line just to catch a close glimpse of Hawaii's erupting volcano. That story tonight. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, Putin's assassin demand. We're learning tonight that Putin refused to release American Paul Whelan along with it being Griner, unless Viktor Bout was returned in addition to a convicted assassin and former Russian spy. This news coming as we are hearing new details about Griner's nearly ten months in prison tonight. She landed in Texas today, and tonight, we are learning her forced labor consisted of helping make uniforms, along with other key details of her imprisonment. But we still don't know tonight what condition Paul Whelan is in, because Putin is refusing to release him, unless he gets this assassin back. You're looking at him. His name is Vadim Krasikov. And he's currently serving a life sentence in Germany for giving someone four years ago, execution style, in broad daylight in a park. Krasikov executed his target using a silencer, approaching him from behind, shooting him twice in the body, and then, shooting him in the back of the head as he lay on the ground. It was a hit the German court found was ordered by the Russian government itself. Now, I'm going to be speaking with Paul Whelan sister in a few moments, because as Whelan is still suffering in a Russian penal colony tonight, there are celebrations and Russia, celebrations for Viktor Bout triumphant return. Bout freed from American prison where he was serving 25 years for his work is the most prolific arms dealer in history, and for plotting to kill Americans. Russian newspapers displaying a big smiling picture of Bout across the front pages. The headline on this paper, for example, reading, Bout is happy. How the Russian businessman, that's what they call him, managed to return from prison in the U.S. Now, Bout also went on Russia Today. It's a Russian state media program. And he did it right away. It took this swipe at the United States, making it clear that he is now focused on Ukraine.

You said that the problems are being solved or they have already been solved. But, nevertheless, the flow of messages from the fighters from the front lines does not stop. Appeals go to the military commissars, to volunteers. They ask not only for uniforms but also for medicine because consumables run out very quickly.

And they simply said, it's not something they can deliver on, it's not something that Germany is willing to do.But the last few months are going to greatly inform what the following months, the months to come looks like because U.S. officials know the types of things they could offer Russia, but they're not going to accept. Some of the names that we know that U.S. officials floated in an effort to get home Paul Whelan with Brittney Griner, include Alexander Vinnik. He's a Russian who's expatriated to the United States, just in August. And he is facing charges of money laundering and extortion, just among a few. And then, there is another Russian. Alex -- excuse me -- Roman Seleznev. He is someone who's been involved in cyber criminals. He's facing a 14 year prison sentence serving that in the United States right now. That's not to say that those names won't come up again, but they're not going to be posed to the Russians in the same form that they have in the past. I spoke with a senior administration official who explained that the Biden administration realizes that they need to put forward some new ideas here, and that's what they are thinking about right now. They're trying to figure out a way forward. They're trying to figure out something that Russia will accept. Now, as you noted, out of the gates there, Erin, President Putin did say today that it's possible, and there could be another prisoner swap. On the face of it, that sounds great. But we heard, just in recent hours, from the deputy national security adviser, John Finer, who expressed some caution, saying you can't take everything that president Putin says for face value. But the U.S. is committed to try and get Paul Whelan home -- Erin.",
