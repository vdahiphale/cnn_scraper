I'm Jim Sciutto, and this is CNN's special live coverage of the extraordinary yet short-lived uprising in Russia that has left much of the world asking exactly how this happened and what could happen next. Is Putin's leadership under threat? Is this an opportunity for Ukraine to repel Russia's ongoing invasion?We do have new developments tonight, including reaction from the Biden administration. But first video has emerged on social media which shows the crash site of a Russian military transport plane reportedly shot down in southern Russia Saturday by the Wagner mercenary group which carried out this rebellion. The Russian Defense Ministry still has not commented on the loss of any aircraft. Also, there is still no sign this evening of Wagner's leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, after he apparently cut a deal with Moscow and called off the insurrection. And there is no sign as well of Putin after the most serious challenge to his rule since he came to power more than two decades ago. Here is what U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said about the threat to his regime earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, SECRETARY OF STATE: It's too soon to tell exactly where this is going to go. And I suspect that this is a moving picture and we haven't seen the last act yet, but we can say this. First of all, what we've seen is extraordinary and I think you've seen cracks emerge that weren't there before. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We do know that he has said that his troops are returning to their camps in return for some kind of an amnesty. Now, the Ministry of Defense in Russia is saying that those that want to will be required to sign up to Ministry of Defense contracts. That was one of the early complaints that Prigozhin had against the Ministry of Defense. But it's really very unclear indeed as to whether or not the Wagner leader has indeed gone to Belarus or perhaps is headed to some of the areas, for example, in the Central African Republic or elsewhere, perhaps Libya, where Wagner also has a footprint -- Jim.",

President Zelenskyy called his conversation with President Biden earlier, quote, \"positive and inspiring.\" At the same time, Ukraine's military is claiming some gains specifically around Bakhmut and eastern Ukraine today. For more, we go to chief international security correspondent Nick Paton Walsh. He is live in Kyiv. There had been some disappointment in recent weeks with the progress of Ukraine's ongoing counteroffensive, at least from the perspective of Western intelligence. There's some who see this as a potential opportunity for Ukrainian forces there to push forward. Do we know substantively if they've made any progress in the last 24, 48 hours?",

      "sentences": "Yes, the dust is still settling in Moscow, but there are certainly signs that Ukrainian officials want to suggest continued progress around Bakhmut, suggesting one to two kilometers' worth of advances around that city, not into it. And also today suggesting that in the Tavriya direction, that's how they refer to Zaporizhzhia, the long southern front through which Ukraine clearly wants to break through Russian lines and cut the Crimean Peninsula occupied by Russia off from the Donbas.They claim that progress had been made in that area as well. Not much detail here at all. Jim, we don't know exactly what this has done, the Wagner movements towards Moscow, to the Russian presence along the frontlines. Wagner was not only present along those frontlines and certainly the units you'd think that made that move toward Moscow would have been long withdrawn from there. So that probably won't have changed Russia's dispositions. We may possibly learn that they had to re-allocate forces because of the Wagner threat, and of course, too, that's going to have been a critical issue about Russian military morale at this point. Imagine wondering if you're going to fight potentially to your own death in the next 24 hours when you don't really even know where your commander-in-chief indeed is. So there is going to be a window to perhaps where Ukraine might want to seize upon higher-level Russian chaos and disarray. Obviously the top brass distracted at the moment by their own internal struggles. Whether that even filters down perhaps to those on the frontlines, we still don't know. But it is a key potential window here of Russian disarray. Unclear, though, exactly whether that's already resulting in Ukrainian progress. But you can bet your life that the American intelligence agencies are doing their best to feed real-time information to Ukraine about what this genuinely is doing. And also remember, too, Jim, that fundamentally for both Prigozhin and Putin, the loss of this war would have been an existential issue frankly for them both. And if indeed this squabble is making that more likely, that's very hazardous for Moscow's elite as well.",

Let's go down to the Rostov region because I want to draw attention to what Prigozhin was able to take over in his brief rebellion. This is a key point for the war in Ukraine. Why is that? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Absolutely. Because, Jim, this is the headquarters of the Southern Military District for the Russians, for the Russian army. And they use this as the main logistics hub, the main command and control hub. Everything that is done in Ukraine by the Russian forces is controlled -- almost everything is controlled out of Rostov.

Well, Vladimir Putin has held power in Russia for almost a quarter century at this point, and no point since he was named acting president on New Year's Eve in 1999 has he faced a challenge as direct and as open as we've seen this weekend. His demand among those who wanted power or money in Russia has always been the same -- loyalty. As recently as May, Yevgeny Prigozhin described his credo as, quote, \"I love the motherland. I listen to Putin.\" [20:15:01] SCIUTTO: I'm joined now by Fareed Zakaria to discuss where this shift leaves the Russian president, what weaknesses may have been exposed in his leadership and his power in these last 24, 48 hours. And I wonder, Fareed, as you look at this, does Putin emerge from this a weakened leader? FAREED ZAKARIA, HOST, CNN'S \"FAREED ZAKARIA GPS\": Of course, he does, Jim. It's not entirely clear how weakened. But, look, one of the things that kept Putin going was what he, himself, described as the power vertical, the vertical of power. What he meant by that was that all authority in Russia flowed through him and that he had created this very tight, absolutist state where power was centralized, consolidated through him. Remember this is very important in Russia. This is the largest country in the world, 5,500 miles. It would take eight hours to fly from one part of Russia to the other. And so the way you maintain authority is by this aura of invincibility. And what has happened here is that the aura of invincibility has been cracked. Here's a guy, Prigozhin, who was sort of his chef, his caterer, who has become powerful enough that he had this band of soldiers, only 25,000, but it clearly scared the daylights out of Putin enough that he compromised. That's cracking the aura of power. That's cracking the vertical of power.",

So he gets the Wagner Group involved in Africa, in the Middle East, in some part because he wants deniability that the Russians are there, in part because there's money to be made here, favors to friendly dictators.Then he gets them involved in Ukraine because he wants plausible deniability to say that the Russian army is not involved. He's also gotten the Chechens involved, and he finds that these groups actually fight harder than the regular Russian army, which has had low morale, particularly in Ukraine. So all of a sudden, he's created a hornet's nest of these competing militias, and now he's trying to rein it back. And now he's realized this is something of a Frankenstein's monster. But it does suggest that there's a fundamental problem here, right, which is he can't use the Russian army solely because they don't have the morale. They don't have the effectiveness. They were losing against the Ukrainians. That's why he got Wagner involved. That's why he got the Chechens involved. So yes, he might have been able to deal with Wagner in the short run, but what about that fundamental problem, which is the reason he was using Wagner is that they were losing to the Ukrainians?",
