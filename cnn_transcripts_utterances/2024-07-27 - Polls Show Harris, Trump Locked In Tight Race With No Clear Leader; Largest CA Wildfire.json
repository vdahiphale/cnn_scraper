And with just over 100 days until the 2024 election the race to raise money and gain support is a sprint. Today, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are both out on the campaign trail. Harris will soon head to Massachusetts for a fundraiser as her campaign looks to add to an already impressive cash haul. The Harris campaign says, it raised $126 million in just the first three days after President Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed her. The campaign also says it has seen an explosion in grassroots support with more than 100,000 people signing up to volunteer in the Harris presidential bid, and more than 2000 applying for campaign jobs. According to a new Fox News poll, the presidential race is now a statistical dead heat in the three swing states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. CNN's Eva McKend is joining us right now. Eva, tell us more about Harris' so-called weekend of action.",

Author and historian Heather Cox Richardson will also be in the mix. And then she's addressing young voters at a virtual event, voters of tomorrow. They're a Gen Z lead organization with young organizers and activists from across the country. And the group says they're feeling energized and resolved to restore reproductive rights, deliver climate action and end gun violence. And they say that the vice president really speaks well to those issues. But she's not the only one out on the campaign trail. Several folks that are rumored to be among the people that she's mulling over as a potential running mate are out on the campaign trail as well. Governor Josh Shapiro, Governor Andy Beshear, and Governor Tim Walz are in Minnesota, Iowa, and Pennsylvania, making the case on her behalf, Fred.",

Namely one of them was she is -- she sought to -- she was concerned about graduation rates.And she said people who -- one of the common denominators of people who are not graduating is that there are truant. So she created this program, pilot program here in San Francisco about truancy. And she said for people who are habitually truant missing 50 days here -- that's like a third of the school year. We would work with the parents and the educators, but if the kids still weren't going to school, she would prosecute the parents. And that's certainly not soft on crime there. Another hand, she has been always against the death penalty. She ran against it from her first time running for office here in San Francisco.
