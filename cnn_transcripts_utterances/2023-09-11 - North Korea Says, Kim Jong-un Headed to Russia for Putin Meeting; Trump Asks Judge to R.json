American officials are warning both men against striking a weapons deal to shore up Putin's floundering war in Ukraine.Also tonight, Donald Trump is now asking the federal judge overseeing the 2020 election subversion case to recuse yourself. We're going to tell you why the former president says her past comments about January 6th defendants would, quote, unavoidably taint the trial. And we're also learning new information right now about the frustrating manhunt for an elusive killer in Pennsylvania. What authorities are revealing about the search as the escapee avoids capture for a 12th straight day. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. First up tonight, the beating U.S. national security officials have been warning against for days. Kim Jong-un and Vladimir Putin now apparently on the verge of coming face to face in Russia. Let's get an update from CNN's Paula Hancocks. She's standing by for us in Seoul, South Korea. Paula, officials, where you are, you believe the North Korean strongman is already en route. What's the latest?",

They have said through state-run media that Kim Jong-un is on his way to North Korea, saying that he is on his private special train and that he's accompanied by leading officials of the party, the government and the armed forces.Now, Russia today had a vision earlier of a train that looked very much like the one that Kim Jong-un could be on on the border between Russia and North Korea. We cannot confirm the authenticity, but it certainly looks very similar. This is a train that Kim Jong-un has used in the past, going to different meetings, including the one with the former president, U.S. President Donald Trump. It is an armored train, meaning that Kim Jong- un wants to travel not only in luxury, but also in safety. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) HANCOCKS (voice over): This was four years ago, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un traveled to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin. Friendship was pledged and closer ties promised, but little changed. Fast forward to today, Russia's war in Ukraine is faltering, and the dynamics between the two leaders are different.",

The White House had been trying to manage expectations that it would be hard, if not impossible, to reach consensus on any language regarding Ukraine, if not only because Russia would not be changing its position on Ukraine, at least for this G-20 meeting. Of course, with Putin and China's President Xi not present at the G- 20, President Biden sought to fill that leadership vacuum, appearing in photos with the leaders of emerging market countries that are partners of both Russia and China, signing global infrastructure deals and more. Certainly, it remains to be seen how that will pan out going forward. But President Biden said the goal of countering China's ambitions in the region, Wolf, are not meant to contain China.",

But she's been outspoken about the Capitol attack.She has overseen several cases related to this, different prosecutions where she oversaw a case against a rioter as well as sentencing. And she has said things that the Trump team believes should disqualify her in this case. For example, they point to a quote from an October 2022 sentencing in which she said, quote, the people who mobbed that Capitol were there in fealty, in loyalty to one man, not to the Constitution. It's a blind loyalty to one person who, by the way, remains free to this day. Now, the Trump lawyers argue in this filing that the fact that she said that means she does not want him to be free and that she has bias. They also point to another quote from December 2021 where she said, quote, the people who exhorted you and encouraged you and rallied you to go and take action and to fight have not been charged. Adding, the issue of who has or has not been charged is not before me. I don't have any influence on that. I have my opinions, but they are not relevant. And the Trump lawyers argue that there would be little doubt in the minds of the public that she has some sort of bias against their client, but, Wolf, they face an uphill battle here, especially because they're filing this before Judge Chutkan. BLITZER: Interesting indeed. All right, stay with us. Don't go too far away. I also want to bring in CNN Legal Analyst Carrie Cordero and Norm Eisen. Norm, Trump attorneys are pointing to Judge Chutkan's comments, as we just heard, made in various cases involving other January 6th rioters. What do you make of that argument?",

Donald Trump would not be in this situation if he would have just complied with the law. Let's take the case of the classified documents. We know he had classified documents. All he had to do was turn them in. So all of these problems he's dealing with are self-inflicted wounds and to me, especially on a day like 9/11 when we're remembering the men and women that died, you know, the 3,000 deaths, the men and women for the last 22 years who have prevented another attack on our homeland from happening, who have collected a national security intelligence, who has put their lives on the line in order to protect this country for someone like Donald Trump to not care and be oblivious of protecting the secrets that those people put their lives on the line to do is just unacceptable to me.",

He was pulled out in that final stretch in the last hour or so.He seems fine, according to Turkish officials. You see him in that video giving a thumbs up and smiling. But we understand that they are going to get him on a chopper and get him to a hospital in southern Turkey as soon as they can for medical checks. Now, as you recall, Mark Dickey was part of this expedition, a research group, an international group that had been in this cave, Turkey's third deepest cave, when he fell ill just about ten days ago or so. He was suffering from gastrointestinal bleeding. He lost a lot of blood. And, so, the past ten days, you've had all these different rescue teams that have been involved in trying to ensure that he gets the medical help. He got a blood transfusion. This is such a deep cave and therefore makes it a complex operation because this is such a deep cave, because of the narrow passageways in there, they really had to move very slowly after they stabilize, and I know it's something that began on Saturday, more than 180 rescuers from different countries, and a mission that has come to an end right now as Mark Dickey is going to soon head to the hospital where he will be getting the medical attention he very much needs right now.",
