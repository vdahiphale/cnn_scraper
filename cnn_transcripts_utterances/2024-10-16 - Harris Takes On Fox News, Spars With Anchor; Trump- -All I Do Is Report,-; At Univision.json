Specifically, on what she's going to do about the border and immigration and the economy and we didn't hear any specifics.To Jonah's point just now, it sounded like she knew what she was talking about if you're not really paying attention, but her inability, this far into the game to say how she would differentiate herself from Joe Biden, which is the ultimate question when you're trying to be a change candidate, I think she ultimately did more harm than good by doing that interview.",

Not really, except for the fact we're talking about such tiny numbers and just to get back to an earlier point, I agree that they're only like four to six percent of undecided Republican types in this election. But the real, the real motherlode of votes for both campaigns is to get people who like Trump or who like Harris to choose between staying home and voting.
