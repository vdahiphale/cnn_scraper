They are not confirming an exact number, and that those patients have been treated and released or transferred to other facilities. We've also spoken with a spokesperson at Lake Martin Community Hospital who say that at least 15 were shot, six treated and released; the remaining nine transferred to other medical facilities, five of those in critical condition. Right now, no public safety concern. That is what we're hearing from law enforcement here in the State who still have not released details on the shooter whether they have been apprehended or what is going on in that situation. We have also heard from a man who identified himself as the DJ hired to do this sweet 16 birthday party, and he told us that he did not hear a fight or disturbance prior to the shooting, which seemed to start inside of this venue. He also tells us that one of the victims was -- deadly victim -- somebody who passed was the brother of the girl who's sweet 16 he was covering, and he has named that person as Phil Dowdell, something that we have confirmed with a local pastor here.

The White House has yet to respond specifically to this brewing proposal from House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, but they have consistently said that the President does not want to see any strings attached to a debt ceiling hike.The President has said it is the constitutional obligation of Congress to raise the debt limit and that it can't come with any spending cuts or other items attached to that. Now, the President has tried to paint Republicans as threatening the US economy. You know, he recently in a statement had said that they are engaging in debt limit brinkmanship, which threatens to wreak havoc over our economy. Now, one thing that the President has said that he is willing to negotiate on is talking about the budget. He has repeatedly pressed Republicans to present a blueprint for their budget and around that, he would be willing to sit down and have those talks. There was a letter that the President had sent over to McCarthy, just before their two week recess asking for that budget before they left. That is not something that Republicans were able to produce or come to agreement on even. But right now, as Alayna said, all eyes are on whether the President and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy will sit down for a talk eventually. They last met back in February, and so it's now been a month-and-a- half where the two men have not sat down to discuss anything related to the debt limit or to the budget, but it does come at a very precarious time as that debt limit deadline is looming in the coming months.",

Were you surprised that that call would come from within the party so publicly? BOXER: Well, you have to look at Ro. He is the Chairman of the Barbara Lee for Senate Committee, and there is some thought that he did it, because he wants the Governor to appoint Barbara Lee. Now, Barbara Lee, to her great credit, Congresswoman Lee said, all I care about is Dianne getting well. So it didn't come without controversy, and look, I think it is reasonable to talk about any senator's prolonged absences and how it is impacting the business of the Senate, of the State, of the country. And I think she has by putting herself forward and saying please replace me on Judiciary for now. Give me the space I need. I think that's the way to go, and let's see what happens. As I say, it will be another test of the Republicans, and I just hope that they step up, at least enough of them, because it's going to take 60 votes or unanimous consent to get this done, so this is really important.",

So, I think it's a different circumstance.

They spoke Russian, they had Russian heritage, and had really no connections to Europe that may have tempted them to seek refuge there. The reality is that going to Russia, even to the far east of the country was simply the path of least resistance. Now that they're there and settled in, the question is, will they ever go back to Ukraine? (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MCLEAN (voice over): In the chaos of battle in Mariupol in Eastern Ukraine, the civilians caught in the crossfire had few good options. They could either escape to Russia or take their chances as the war intensified. Many of those who fled toward Russia were encouraged to live and work in the far east. From Rostov, a 4,000-mile train journey to the edge of Siberia in a town just a stone's throw from North Korea. These are some of the first arrivals stepping off government chartered trains a year ago. MCLEAN (on camera): Why does Russia want those people there?",

The second benefit is that Russia simply needs bodies in many parts of the country. They don't have enough citizens to make those municipalities function. MCLEAN (voice over): This hotel in the coastal town of Wrangel was where new arrivals were put up at first. CNN reached several of them through a Telegram group chat run by local volunteers, keeping a log of resident requests from baby food and toys to medicine. Anyone dissatisfied with their stay is told sarcastically to take their complaints to Moscow, the Kremlin, Putin. The Russian government has long been eager to populate its resource rich far east and the state has tried several experiments to attract settlers, including those from ex-Soviet States. It now promises fleeing Ukrainians, cash, housing assistance, citizenship, and even free land. Though two people told CNN they were struggling to get the rent reimbursement they say the government had promised. Natalia (ph) was struggling to find any housing at all, hardly enthused by her new reality. NATALIA, UKRAINIAN REFUGEE IN WRANGEL (through translator): Nothing's changed except the place, but I no longer have a job that I love and a home that I love. (UNIDENTIFIED MALE speaking in foreign language.) MCLEAN (voice over): New arrivals quickly had their Ukrainian passport swapped for Russian ones. Natalia figures, she can't go back. NATALIA (through translator): Because we are criminals there, because those who left for Russia are immediately considered criminals by the Ukrainian authorities, so I'm forbidden to go there.",

Washington State Ferries said they are working on processing refunds for customers who did not get to complete their trips. And a plant fire in Brunswick, Georgia that triggered evacuations has been extinguished. This was the scene yesterday as the fire sent massive plumes of smoke into the air, prompting the Mayor to issue an Emergency Declaration. No one was hurt during the fire and there is still no word on what caused that. And today, Broadway loses its longest running show ever. The curtain comes down one final time tonight for \"Phantom of the Opera.\" The show has had nearly 14,000 performances over the last 35 years. CNN's Polo Sandoval is live outside the Majestic Theatre on Broadway. So Polo, the production has called this theater home since 1988, and I imagine a lot of people who were in line tonight have probably seen the show before, but because it is the last one, they've got to see it again.",

There's going to be plenty of loyal fans here and look, by the time that the curtain closes, and since 1988, since the opening night, you're talking about close to 20 million audience members that would have been entertained by \"The Phantom of the Opera\" on Broadway in those three and a half decades.So you can't be the longest running Broadway show without picking up a few fans along the way. You're talking millions from around the world. In fact, I still have my Playbill from when I got to see it back in 2018, with my wife. And the thing is, this was before the pandemic. The pandemic was certainly a massive game changer for the industry. And sadly, there were many shows that just couldn't quite fully recover. This is one of the most expensive shows to put on, at about a million bucks a week in full operating expenses and salaries or what have you. And at this point, this is when they had to make that very difficult decision that simply those profits were just not enough to keep it afloat. And this is certainly one of the key factors that was considered when that very difficult decision was made to end this long, long run. And it was just devastating news for so many people around the world, including Lexie, who I want you to hear from. I just met her a little while ago. She was one of those lucky few folks who actually got to see the show last night, but saw it for the first time earlier this year. And for Lexie, as you're about to hear, it really is a story of \"The Phantom of the Opera\" that continues to resonate today and one that has personal meaning for her. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LEXIE LUHRS, \"PHANTOM OF THE OPERA\" FAN: I was introduced to this musical when I was seven. I was in -- I was in line for a carwash with my mother. She's going through the City of Brooklyn, she goes, have I ever showed you \"Phantom\"? I said no. I fell in love with it. I really did. I began singing. I grew up to be a vocalist. I now hold my bachelor's in music with a musical theater concentration and seeing the heartbeat of Manhattan leave, it is quite sad, honestly. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The Aptera looks like no vehicle you've ever seen before. It has three wheels and has a very organic shape. So we have wheels that sit outside the body and one center wheel in the rear so air can flow very nicely and easily around it.
