Donald Trump just held his first campaign rally after officially becoming the Republican presidential nominee. While Joe Biden spent another day in isolation due of course, to his COVID as his reelection bid continues to be complicated. With 108 days until Election Day, more Democrats are coming out against President Biden running for a second time. There are now 35 lawmakers from him its own party, urging him to drop out and more than 50 former national security officials and foreign policy experts wrote him a letter, requesting the same, all of them expressing an urgent message that Donald Trump cannot return to the White House in their view. But Trump is showing major momentum, as you know, exactly one week since surviving an assassination attempt. He wore a smaller bandage over his wounded ear and gave this message just a short time ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT &amp; 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Republicans must win. We have to win, win, win, win, win. We want a landslide that is too big to rig. If you want to save America, get your friends, get your family, get everyone you know, and get -- you got to vote early, vote absentee. I don't care how you vote. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

This is the first on the trail test for the secret service since the attempt on Trump's life at an outdoor venue last weekend.

He spoke for roughly two hours. He engaged with the crowd at one point.He was polling them on various aspects, saying who should he run again? Should it be Joe Biden? Should it be Kamala Harris? And other points he was riffing on various things that happened while he was in office, completely off script, but again, feeding to the crowd, there were thousands of people in this arena cheering for him. He came out with just a small band aid on his ear. He has placed that gauze from that shooting that happened last week. Now, one notable part about him being here in Michigan, obviously critical battleground state. He also appeared for the first time with vice presidential nominee J.D. Vance on the campaign trail, Vance introduced him, left the stage, then Donald Trumps book, the reason why that is notable is a part of Vance's appeal, at least if you talk to people who are close to the former were president said he might be able to help with voters, working class voters, particularly in areas like Michigan, like Pennsylvania, like Wisconsin. All of those being again critical states of Donald Trump won in 2016 and then lost in 2020. Now I do want to point to one specific moment during the speech where he tried to distance himself again from Project 2025. That, of course, being the overall plan transition plan put into place, or at least developed by the Heritage Foundation and a bunch of other conservative groups that would be a plan for whatever the next Republican president is, people who are authors of that plan. Many of them worked for former President Donald Trump's administration or currently allies of his, but it has come under a lot of fire for how conservative some of those policies are. Take a listen to what Donald Trump said.",

Of course, this has been a deeply frustrating and challenging time for President Biden as he continues to face those calls from members of his own party, from allies, from donors who think he is just not up to the task to take on former President Donald Trump.Now, when pressed on this, the Biden campaign maintains that he is going to stay in the race. They've taken to the airwaves over the last 24 hours. They've really statements essentially say that the president is looking for forward to hitting the campaign trail. Again, that there is no plan B and that they are full steam ahead with the Biden- Harris ticket but, of course, the president is having to grapple with all of this behind closed doors because he has tested positive for COVID. He continues to test positive. And so he has to self-isolate and his clothes advisers are here in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. They often do travel with the president, the White House has been notifying reporters of the briefings that he is having with his team virtually, but certainly it is his inner circle that is pivotal in moments like this, these challenging moments where he is facing this pressure from the party, and it remains unclear whether he can survive this. Of course, some officials find this wholly untenable, while loyal aides say that the president is dug in. So the resounding message ultimately from the Biden campaign and from the president himself, is that he is saying in until November with plans they say to win in November, but those around him are many of those around him are really questioning that and concerned about whether he can in fact be the best Democratic nominee for them this election year.",

These are folks who have supported him over the years, but they're looking at the numbers. They're looking at three out of four Americans don't think he has the mental fitness for the office, two-thirds of Democrats want him to step aside. He's down, he's losing ground in 14 states according to the latest polls, he's behind Trump in all seven key swing states and states like Minnesota and Virginia even New Mexico, that shouldn't be in play that he easily want to 2020 are now in play.

It has appealed with some African American voters.And so I think that its a, obviously, if he'd gone in the direction of Marco Rubio, lets say, that would have been a more overt play for a different part of the electorate. But I think J.D. Vance does bring an interesting, much younger, energetic complexion to the ticket. Now, whether in fact that'll be enough to get Trump across the finish line, whether that will be helpful to him down the road, we'll see.

Allan is right, right, that we have time between now and then. But as a student of history, we have never been here before. These are not stupid people. Nancy Pelosi is a very politically savvy person. The fact that we have a dashboard with flashing lights going off, it's not just one poll, its a lot of different metrics. I think the most important being that any he time a president has been an incumbent president in the modern political age has been under 40 percent, they have lost Jimmy Carter, George Herbert Walker Bush, and, of course, Donald Trump in 2020. But at the end of the day, we've never been here before. We have not had a candidate for major political party this close to an election who appears to be physically unfit. And the thing is, Biden had some time to turn this around. He doesn't appear able to turn it around. So again, history is -- obviously data and history are great ways to look at this through that the long context and look at what's happening in the Electoral College and the popular vote right now, but we haven't been here before.

That is just over four weeks from today. Let us continue our discussion now with our panel, Lanhee Chen, Caroline Heldman, and Allan Lichtman. Lanhee, I'm going to start with you. I interviewed Kamala Harris when she was the district attorney in San Francisco many moons ago. And then, of course, she moved on to higher office in California.

Obviously, she's had various points at which she has been maybe a little bit more conservative, been kicked around criminal justice issues. And over time, I think she's gotten probably more progressive as the base of her party's gotten more progressive.But there are still some things from her California history that will haunt her. For example, the decision not to pursue the death penalty for slain police officer in San Francisco in 2004, even amidst opposition from her own party, the likes of Senator Dianne Feinstein, former Senator Dianne Feinstein, for example, who argued at the officers funeral in front of Kamala Harris's face that frankly, the death penalty should have been pursued. So that will haunt her. I think her policies on energy are going to be very challenging. She's been anti fracking, anti an all of the above energy strategy. I think that will be a challenge in states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, which the Democrats have to win. And the last thing I'll just say is this. In California, she had won tough race and that was when she first ran for attorney general back in 2010 against Steve Cooley, a moderate Republican. She has not had to run a tough race since then. So I think a lot of people wonder, does she have what she needs -- does she have it in her to run a tough race against Donald Trump?

And you put a woman on the racing, you see that straight up, you know, misogyny. We saw with Hillary Clinton, talked about her voice. He tried to paint her as frail, a very feminizing frame. He's also done that with male contenders. And I think with Kamala Harris, we know that there's this blanket about a 13 percentage to point bias against women who worked for the presidency. It gets smaller when it's a specific woman. But as a black woman and an Indian American woman, Kamala Harris is going to face a lot of sexism and racism, and we've seen some of this with the Donald Trump trope that comes up where Donald Trump and others talk about her sleeping the way to the top of being a DEIA candidate.

Why did this happen and how could it have happened? The motive behind all of this remains elusive, but there are a few things that we do know. And that is about the deal details and the kind of Internet searches that Thomas Matthew Crooks was doing in the days before the rally. He looked up information both about the former for President Donald Trump and about the current President Joe Biden. He looked up information about the Democratic National Convention as well as information about other high-profile political figures, including Congressman Hakeem Jeffries. We also know that Thomas Matthew Crooks locked up information on the Internet about Ethan Crumbley and his parents. You might remember Ethan Crumbley and his parents were recently prosecuted and convicted in a mass shooting at a high school in Michigan. What we do not know is why he was looking up that information. We do know that the weapon he used on Saturday belong to his father. It was illegally obtained along with about 20 other weapons that will recover but here at this house, a family home, which you see behind me. And, Sara, we have also been able to pinpoint some of the movements that Crooks made bowl on the day before the rally on Friday, he went to a local -- a local shooting practice where he spent some time and then on Saturday morning, he purchased a ladder at a local Home Depot and about 50 rounds of ammunition before returning here to his house grabbing the weapon, and then driving about an hour north of here where that rally was taking place. Now, over the next several days, as we enter for next week and investigators continue to gather information and more clues about how this happened and why it happened, with lawmakers, the public, this community still looking to understand what drove Thomas Matthew Cooks -- Thomas Matthew Crooks, I should say to, this, why he did this, and if there was anything that could have been done to prevent it -- Sara.

What does it tell you about his state of mind? But also what does it tell you about the Secret Service and how they handled this clearly a admitting that they made some very big mistakes?",

I can't speak on what they were thinking at this site, but I can say that I was an agent while the drone craze, if you will, became what it is today and the Secret Service absolutely has policies and procedures in reference to drones and drone activity. So I would imagine there's going to be a lot of questions in regards to how this individual, if in fact, it's true, he did use a drone to do basically surveillance.So that strikes me as a little odd that service did not take greater action against the drone. Now, with regards to his mindset it appears he was doing his homework by using a drone to do surveillance. That's something that's being utilized more both with law enforcement and even with military, where you are able to get a birds-eye view if you will, of an area that you're planning to infiltrate. So, if in fact he did do that? Then, yeah, that's becoming standard operation procedure for bad guys, if you will.",

It doesn't change things in any way, doesn't take away the hurt, but they want to know why, what was the reason exactly? And a week on, we still have no motive. Investigators saying that they're not sure they haven't found the exact motive. Do you think we'll ever know that? There's been this long, they talked to 100 people, including family members and friends, look, to through his social media, looked through his phone and we still don't have a clear answer yes.",

I know that they've sifted through, like you said, hundreds of witnesses all of his -- all of his videos, all of his social media accounts, and they have not found anything distinctive as of yet, but I have faith, every one of these experiences that I've seen in my law enforcement career, and it spans over 35 years. There has been a motive. Sometimes took a while to find it, but there has been I firmly believethey will finds that motive in this individual, and it may not be the motive that be are thinking it might be, but they will be one.
