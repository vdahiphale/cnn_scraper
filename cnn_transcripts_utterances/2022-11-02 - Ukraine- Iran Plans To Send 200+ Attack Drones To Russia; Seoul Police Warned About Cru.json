You can change its routing and target in the air. The ones that the Russians have right now, right, you just set them off and they crash down where you -- where you've sent them to. So this is a bigger threat. So if Russia uses these 200 in the same way that they've been doing before -- and they're also expected to get some ground-to-ground ballistic missiles from Iran as well -- uses them to try to go after the energy grid or other key parts of infrastructure and government buildings, it could really begin to put more pressure on the Ukrainian government. And that's the worry going forward because it's not the number per se, it's the capability. These are more capable, more deadly, smarter. And if used as Russia's been showing how they're willing to use them in the past few weeks, that's the worry. The front line is not far from here. They're hot and active. More Russian recruits coming in there. New areas of front line opening up. It's potentially an additional pressure on the Ukrainian government right now.",

People were calling about this hours ahead of time, telling the police that the crowd was getting too big and things felt very dangerous. People felt like they were getting crushed -- like they were suffocating. That they couldn't breathe. And they were very worried that there could be a loss of life. This was told to police dispatchers who have a station -- a police station about two minutes' walk from the location where all those people died. They did deploy a handful of extra officers to Itaewon. But the number of officers -- just over 130 -- pales in comparison with the thousands of police that they will deploy for political protests here in South Korea with a fraction of the number of people who gathered in Itaewon -- that nightclub district you're talking about -- around 100,000 young people there and no police officers with barricades to control traffic, to stop people from coming in when the crowds got too big. Instead, most of the officers were looking for things like drunk and disorderly conduct, or drug offenses. So, Polo, clearly, there is a growing sense of anger and outrage -- people demanding answers and wanting to know why more was not done to keep those young people out of that terrible and deadly situation on Saturday night.",

That's the worst decline on record which, by the way, was back in 1947. Let's bring in Anita Williams Woolley. She's professor of organization behavioral -- behavior and theory, rather, at Carnegie-Mellon University. Good morning to you. I'm curious -- you know, before the pandemic, or at least as we were leading into the pandemic, it seems that productivity was up. And now, we see this decline. I wonder, Anita, what are the different factors that are coming together here? ANITA WILLIAMS WOOLLEY, PROFESSOR OF ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR AND THEORY, CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY (via Skype):  Well, there really are a variety of converging trends here. Certainly, we've heard about the great resignation and exactly what's going on there. But we know, most recently, there is also -- alongside this productivity dip, there has actually been a decrease in unemployment. So a lot of new people have entered the workforce. And so, we have some of these organizations that have new employees. Other openings have not been filled. But all of this means that the people who remain are really shouldering a lot.",

A lot of people expected Houston to be here but the Phillies have just snuck into the playoffs as the final wild card team and now they are on this incredible ride, two wins shy of a World Series title. They are undefeated at home this postseason.And it was such a scene last night. The Phillies' $300 million man Bryce Harper setting the tone in the first inning with a 2-run jack off Lance McCullers Jr. So when he got back to the dugout he whispered something, which may have helped the other Philly hitters. This is well within the rules to do, by the way. But Alec Bohn, Brandon Marsh, Kyle Schwarber, and Rhys Hoskins seemed to take that advice and go with it. I mean, they all went deep off of McCullers -- the first team to hit five home runs off the same pitcher in a World Series game. Ranger Suarez and the Phillies bullpen shutting out the Astros on a 5- hitter. Philadelphia wins 7-0 and brings the 2-1 series lead into tonight's game four. Four Michigan State football players are now suspended in the wake of Saturday's postgame tunnel brawl at Michigan Stadium, bringing the total number of suspended players from the team to eight. Michigan head coach Jim Harbaugh is calling for criminal charges here. Police from both schools investigating the fight. The players are going to remain suspended until all of those investigations are complete. The Brooklyn Nets and Steve Nash have parted ways. Brooklyn has fallen woefully short of expectations in Nash's 2-plus seasons as head coach. It's been a mess despite having Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving on the roster. General manager Bobby Marks is downplaying reports that suspended Celtics head coach Ime Udoka could be in line to take over in Brooklyn. And after the news, it was another rough night for the now 2-6 Nets. Kyrie Irving finishing with four points on two of 12 shooting. The Nets fall to the Bulls by nine. In the NFL now, a record 10 deals were made on trade deadline day yesterday. Most notably, the Dolphins acquiring Pro Bowl linebacker Bradley Chubb from the Broncos for running back Chase Edmonds and a first-round pick. And star wideout Calvin Ridley, who was suspended for the season for betting on games last year, was traded to Jacksonville for two draft picks. So the Jags now betting on him to fill a glaring need there and potentially become the major receiving threat in 2023 when he's eligible to do so without giving up too much. So it seems like a shrewd move. And lastly for you in sports this morning, the College Football Playoff Committee issued its first rankings of the season last night. Tennessee is number one for the first time in the playoff era. Ohio State, number two. Georgia and Clemson rounding out the top four. Michigan and Alabama are at five and six. And if you love college football, I'm not telling you anything that you don't already know. Georgia hosting Tennessee on Saturday. They have done an incredible job at Tennessee. You have to give head coach Josh Heupel a lot of credit. This is a guy who was a college quarterback and won a national title, so understands the implications of a game like this. The winner could basically write themselves into the playoffs. And has really coached up his team in a way that I think has surprised a lot of people.",
