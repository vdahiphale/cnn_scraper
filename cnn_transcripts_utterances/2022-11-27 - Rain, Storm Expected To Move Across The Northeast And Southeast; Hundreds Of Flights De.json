      "sentences": "There are. In fact, it's probably easier for me to list the spots where we don't really have any inclement weather rather than the other way around.But let's begin in the eastern half of the country. You've got very heavy rain that's making its way across areas from, say, Georgia all the way up to Maine. You do even have some strong to severe thunderstorms that will be embedded within that same system. And then out to the west, a brand-new system pushing in, bringing rain and snow as well. But a lot of big problems are going to be in the eastern half of the country. Look at how widespread this system is. You're talking rain showers in Nebraska all the way over to Maryland, down into Florida as we speak. And this is going to continue to slide to the northern east in the coming hours. One of the other things, and this is not good if you're flying -- by air, wind advisories. You have got a lot of these places you see here in orange. You're talking wind gusts up to 50 miles per hour. So, that could be too quite a bumpy flight today in a lot of these cities, gusting to even as high as 60 once you get into those higher elevations of the Appalachian Mountains. Here's the look at the forecast radar pushing forward. Once we get towards say like midday now you're starting to see some of that heavier rain move into Pittsburgh, Cleveland, eventually into Philadelphia, New York, and Boston once we get into the second half of the day. So, yes, any travel plans in the northeast, the midwest, or the mid-Atlantic today, you are likely going to have at least some delays not just in the air but also on the roadways. You're going to have ponding on the roads, and that's going to make it a little bit slick, causing people to slow down as they should for safety purposes on the roads. Boston, New York, D.C., this is likely where we're going to have the biggest travel delays, but also Detroit, Chicago, Cincinnati, Raleigh, even down towards Orlando, out to the west also looking at some delays as well. This next system coming in is bringing a tremendous amount of snow as well to the higher elevations.",

At the same time, there's not a lot of pressure for him to run compared to other sort of situations that the country could be in. There are no real serious Democratic challengers that have shown a strong interest and movement toward challenging him as a primary candidate.And the Republican field is still taking shape. I expect that there will be a few more, maybe many more candidates in the primary alongside Donald Trump. So for the Biden administration and Biden's political team, there's an incentive to keep the attention on them right now rather than his own re-election campaign. But beyond that -- look, the Biden family, Biden himself have strongly suggested that he's very interested in running. He is one of the older presidents in American history so that will be a factor. And again, the new shape of Congress that Democrats will continue to control the Senate but not the House. This is a situation that is not ideal for every president and you have to remember that this is a president who has enjoyed Democratic control about the House and the Senate in the past few years.",

Because up to that point even the most vehement opponents of the so called zero COVID policy have been dancing around this issue saying how the top leadership had its heart in the right place but instead blaming local enforcement and pointing finger at incompetent or overzealous local officials.But those protesters in downtown Shanghai they were directly challenging the legitimacy of the communist party and its strongman leader really saying the system is the problem. As you mentioned, this is something that's simply not tolerated here. So, there is growing worry and concern about the fate of some of the protesters that got taken away by police. That's why a new crowd again gathered at the same location in Shanghai on Sunday demanding those protesters' release. But we understand now there's a heavy police presence on site with the authorities sealing off a larger area surrounding this location and also clearing everyone from site. So there is obviously a lot of fear on the part of the authorities that this kind of messaging could inspire others across the country. But this latest wave of protests really triggered by a deadly apartment fire in Xinjiang and also how the authorities there handled the aftermath because on one hand officials insisted that their COVID measures had nothing to do with the firefighters' delay reaching the fire to put it out. But on the other hand after insisting for weeks that lockdowns must be maintained because of the outbreak they all of the sudden announced a phase of reopening. So, I think all of that really serving as the latest and loudest wake- up call to a lot of people in terms of how increasingly unscientific, ineffective and potentially dangerous this policy has become, not to mention all of the absurdities surrounding its enforcement. That's why across the country we are seeing people trying to take matters into their own hands by taking to the streets and tearing down metal fences setup by local officials to seal them off in their residences. And also a lot of vigils and protests spearheaded by young people on university campuses because for many of them, Sara and Boris, they have lived their entire college life in the past three years under some form of lockdown.",

We saw a deal negotiated back in September, the Biden administration helped a broker. And we just need to put this issue to rest. The two sides haven't seen a lot of traction in recent weeks.
