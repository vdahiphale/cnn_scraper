We're also told by sources, according to CNN's MJ Lee, that Vice President Harris was not notified about that decision, that final decision from the president until today.We are told that President Biden consulted his family, his top advisers by phone from his Delaware home. That's where he's been recovering from COVID for the last several days. And this is a decision that he kept very private, only notifying his senior White House aides and staff from the campaign moments before he went public with this unprecedented announcement. That announcement, Wolf, read in part, and I'm quoting the president now, \"While it may have been my intention to seek re-election, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as president for the remainder of the term.\" I've got a team of correspondents here with us, Wolf, but let's start with you in Washington.",

It says Vice President Harris is now a candidate for United States president in the 2024 election and will henceforth be conducting campaign activities only in pursuit of that office. This is a statement to essentially let the FEC know this.Wolf, it's hard to imagine that letter existing three weeks ago before that debate in Atlanta. But it is now the reality that is facing the Democratic Party, but also Republicans who are now in a wave of fresh uncertainty of who it is that Donald Trump is going to face on the ticket this November. I've got CNN anchor and senior political correspondent Abby Phillip here with me, as well as CNN's senior political commentator and former Obama administration official Van Jones. Van, I mean, it is -- just to look at that in black and white on the FEC website and to see Harris is now the candidate for the 2024 presidency is something that would have been unthinkable a month ago.",

The only bad thing is in '68, Nixon won. And so we've got to break history now if we want for Trump to be defeated. But we are literally beat for beat. The most historic year in news before was 1968.

And everyone that I've talked to believes that this change at the top is going to lead to an injection of an enormous amount of energy.The energy that, frankly, Kaitlan, has been notably missing for the Democratic ticket. There is a major enthusiasm problem that the party has or had up until this point. They have an opportunity to turn that around. But that being said, I mean, if you are one of the other names that have been floated around as someone who might want to be president someday, the question is, do you really want to take on the sitting vice president of the United States? Do you really want to get into that fight right now? Or do you wait until sometime later? Those people are going to be making those decisions as we speak. And I'm sure we will hear from them in the coming days. But I think people underestimate that that's a very high bar for someone to decide to do that. Everyone knows that's a high bar. Everything is kind of structurally set up well for Vice President Harris to inherit this. But she's got to show overwhelming strength in these next few hours. COLLINS:  Well, and that's an uncertainty for the Trump campaign as well. I spoke to Donald Trump moments after Biden announced this, and he said that he believes he can defeat Harris. I mean, we don't actually know that. There's not really any polling to have a real time scenario here. And also, we don't know that she's going to be the nominee. We're seeing a lot of people line up behind her. But I mean, this is just a moment of uncertainty for Republicans as it is for Dems.",

They think Vice President Harris is fundamentally going to be painted the same way as President Biden. But at the same time -- and the truth is, for the Biden campaign, they really had one main plan, which is to win the blue wall.The question is, does a vice presidential pick on Harris's part and her unique -- that the unique things that she brings to this race, does it close some doors? Does it open others? A lot of people have different views of that. But there is a calculus. It's not just a clear advantage in one direction.

That's important. And two, the very last line, which is we have 107 days until Election Day. It says together we'll fight and together we will win. There's 107 days left. There is urgency right now.

Also, Joe Biden himself, this move very much blindsiding even top Democrats. We're told that he has recently reached out to Hakeem Jeffries, the House Democratic leader. That came after Joe Biden went public with his announcement that he would drop out from this race. Now, Wolf, both sides are now gaming out the impact that a Kamala Harris as a Democratic nominee would have down ticket. Recall, the big concern among Democrats is that if Joe Biden were at the top of the ticket, he essentially would sink their chances at keeping the Senate and taking back the House. Now that if -- Kamala Harris is at the top of the ticket, what does that mean down ticket to these races? A number of Democrats that I have spoken to believe that they believe she could shore up support from some younger voters, from some minority voters, people who have been voters who have actually not been -- been fraying from the Biden coalition. Perhaps he can energize that base. Republicans, on the other hand, believe that they can very much tie Harris to all the policies that they believe will be -- make her toxic to some of those more swing district Republicans, swing states -- swing Democrats and swing state Democrats as well in Senate races. Expect that to be the big debate here in the weeks ahead. And Wolf, just a note of that quickly out of the gate, Tammy Baldwin, who's facing one of the most difficult Senate races in the country, came out to endorse Kamala Harris. Other, though, vulnerable Democrats have kept their powder dry, including Sherrod Brown from Ohio, one of the most vulnerable Democrats in the country, yet to endorse Kamala Harris even though he praised Biden's decision for stepping aside.",

That was actually a statement that was out from the Vance campaign last week, asking who they were going to actually ultimately be facing. That was before President Biden made this decision, obviously, Wolf.But this is something that Trump's campaign is tracking very closely, as CNN's national correspondent Kristen Holmes is following all the developments for all of us.

That was to beat President Joe Biden. This looks completely different with whoever else is on the ticket. That is why you're also going to hear Donald Trump, if it is potentially Vice President Kamala Harris, going after her as saying she is part of the Biden administration. They believe that is one of their biggest assets, painting a broad brush because, again, what they've prepared for is running against Biden, his policies, his administration, him as a person, but also, they are hoping they can loop Kamala Harris into that, which is why, again, they are hoping that she likely is at the top of the ticket, but they are saying to me that they are preparing for all scenarios right now.",

How does she, you know, actually help the Democrats, having not really been on the national stage before?
