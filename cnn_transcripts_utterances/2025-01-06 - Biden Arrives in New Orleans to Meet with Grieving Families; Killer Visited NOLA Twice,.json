He and First Lady Jill Biden are set to take part in a prayer service where the president will deliver remarks and grieve with the community still reeling from the tragic New Year's Day attack.Meantime, new details are emerging about the man who rammed a truck into Bourbon Street Revelers, killing 14 people. The FBI says the U.S. Army veteran visited the city twice in recent months and used META smart glasses to plan out his attack. Investigators also say they're looking into his trips to Egypt and Canada for possible ties to this deadly rampage. CNN's Rafael Romo is live for us in New Orleans. Rafael, what new details are officials revealing about this attacker?",

And based on information provided by the FBI, now it seems like it might've been weeks, perhaps years. And this is because the FBI has revealed that the attacker, Shamsud-Din Jabbar, came to New Orleans at least twice in the months preceding the attack.Once at the end of October, when he rode a bicycle through the streets of the French Quarter, recording video using META glasses. And once again in November. Then he also traveled internationally. In the summer of 2023, he went to Cairo, Egypt. And a few days later, he went to Ontario, Canada. I had an opportunity, Boris, to ask the special agent in charge of the FBI here in New Orleans, whether he believed that a terrorist organization might've financed those trips for Jabbar or who he met with. And this is what he had to say. Let's take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LYONEL MYRTHIL, SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE/FBI NEW ORLEANS: At this time, we're still trying to determine the answers to that. That is exactly what our priority is for those international trips. Essentially, we're looking at who has he encountered during those trips, who has he meeting with, where has he traveled while in those specific countries, and whether or not any visits to those countries may or may not have any indication as to the reasons behind this attack in our city.

They will attend an interfaith service here at the church behind me, the cathedral behind me.And then they will meet face-to-face with families of the victims, as well as local officials. The President previously said that he has already spoken by phone with some of the families of the victims. Now, back to you.",

And that's why when people see this kind of stuff on social media, they need to reach out and contact authorities because it is absolutely impossible to look at every single video posted on social media around the country. You just can't do it. And so we have to rely on the public that if they see something thatdoesn't appear to be quite right, or someone who is saying things of a threatening nature, notify authorities so that we have a chance to dig a little deeper and find out, you know, exactly what it is that's going on with that particular individual.

Now, that's not true with every city and every client that we have, but, you know, it's not unusual for us to go into a location and then they say, well, you know, we had a study done about six years ago.And then we take a look at that study and nothing has changed. And so, you know, why bother to hire someone to come in and take a look at what you're doing if you're not going to follow the recommendations? It makes no sense. And politics plays into everything and it becomes a cost thing. It becomes about money. Well, it's going to cost us too much to do this, that, and the other. Now you've got a tragedy on your hands. And guess what? You've got to spend the money, probably more than you would have had to spend had you taken it and done it initially. And you could have done a little bit over time. Now they've got to do it all at once. And they've got some big events coming up. They got Mardi Gras, they got the Super Bowl coming up.

      "sentences": "Well, the brief is pretty legalistic, so let me translate it. Essentially, they're saying don't grant this delay, but they give some reasons. They're saying, look, you're not going to suffer any prejudice from this sentencing, because the judge has already said you're not going to see any penalties.They're also saying, look, you can do this virtually instead of in person, and also a reminder that you need the sentencing. You need the entry of judgment so that you can pursue the appeals that you've repeatedly said you want to pursue. Of course, since Trump was convicted, he's been trying to get this conviction tossed. Since he was reelected, they've been using his status as President- elect to try to get this case tossed. They've also tried to get this case tossed based on the Supreme Court's immunity ruling, arguing that some of the evidence that came in at trial could be official acts, and therefore, the conviction should be tossed. None of this has worked with the judge, but on Friday, Judge Juan Merchan did concede one thing to the Trump team. He said, look, I get there are physical and mental demands on you as the President-elect, so I'm going to let you attend this sentencing virtually, and he also made it clear he's not going to apply any penalties to the President-elect. Look, it's not clear if this is going to be successful, Boris, it's unlikely this is going to be successful, but if there is any delay, that makes it highly unlikely that Trump would be sentenced before Inauguration Day, which means that this would just kind of be hovering over him for about four years, and Judge Merchan.",

And if he is actually going through that sentencing proceeding, that would be the difference, that label of convicted felon. So it seems that his legal team is trying to punt this out so that that still is up in the air and not something, a label that would be on him as he's inaugurated.",

And his argument is this is his private residence and there's laws in Florida that can help shield your private residence from being something that would be subject to a judgment collection. So that's where this all stems from.This hearing was about all of these documents and information and evidence that he was supposed to turn over to establish whether or not it would qualify under those restrictions as far as collection. And he admitted, Boris, in his contempt hearing that he did fail to turn over evidence and information that he was supposed to and he was ordered to do. He gave excuses, but he said that he didn't do it. And that was really, you know, the nail in the coffin because at that point, it was almost inevitable where you're going to see this contempt finding. This means that additional charges can be added. There's going to be additional financial penalties relating to this. And also now all of that stuff that he needs to turn over has to be done ASAP. So there's a lot of legal repercussions coming down the pike with respect to this contempt hearing that's outside of all of his other legal troubles.",
