At least nine others were hospitalized in what is now the 45th school shooting in America, just this year alone. Chilling accounts are emerging from what happened inside that school today, as we're also learning new details, tonight, about the 14-year- old suspect, who is now in custody, including how he was questioned by law enforcement, about school shooting threats just last year. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. As I noted, we're awaiting a live update, from the authorities. Right there, in Georgia, they are gathering at the microphones on what is now the deadliest school shooting in America this year. The law enforcement officials are expected to brief us at any moment. We're going to bring that to you live, when it happens. But as we wait, tonight, we are getting new details about the weapon that was used, in today's mass shooting, at Apalachee High School, in Winder, Georgia, that's just northeast of Atlanta. A law enforcement official tells CNN, the gunman used an AR-15-style rifle, when he killed two students and two teachers, and injured at least nine others this morning. I want to take a listen to the officials now.",

And I wanted to introduce him to make a few statements. Again, thank you for your patience. And at this time, I'm going to introduce the Governor. And then, Director Hosey will take answers and questions after that. GOV. BRIAN KEMP (R-GA): Well, thank you, Sheriff. Just want to thank you, and your team, for the incredible work that they've done. The response of our first responders today has been unreal. Superintendent LeDuff, Principal Leroy (ph), who just did incredible job with these kids. This hits home for us. Being from Athens, just down the road, Marty and I having a daughter that taught first grade, just a few years ago, this is everybody's worst nightmare. And I just want to offer my sincere condolences, and our thoughts and prayers to the families of -- that have lost loved ones, for those that are injuring and injured and continuing to fight through just a tragic time for, really, this whole community that's been affected by today's actions. And I just cannot thank the first responders enough. I cannot thank Director Hosey, Colonel Hitchens, Director Stallings at GEMA, the whole state response. I want to thank Special Agent Farley, and her team, from the FBI, that are embedded with us, in the school, as we speak, running down every single lead and other things that Director Hosey will mention tonight. I represented Barrow County, when I was in the state senate, 20 years ago. These are our neighbors. These are our friends. And this community is hurting today. And I would just ask all Georgians, and all Americans, to continue to keep these families, these educators, and these students, in your thoughts and prayers. And we will provide every state resource that is needed from here until they're not, to support this community and support this team behind me. And with that, I'll turn it over to Director Hosey.",

We also got an update from officials about the suspect who, as we know, is a 14-year-old student at that school. Still questions, tonight, that remain unanswered about how he got that gun into the school, and where it came from, and how he got access to it. But what we do know is he is going to be booked, tonight, according to the GBI Director there, as an adult, and that will be a transfer, as we're still waiting to hear when his court appearance is going to happen. A lot that we're learning, tonight, including from that press conference. Joining me here tonight. CNN's Chief Law Enforcement and Intelligence Analyst, John Miller. And CNN Contributor, Jennifer Mascia. Thank you both for being here. John, obviously, a lot of questions about the shooter and how he got the gun into the school. What stood out to you from what you heard from officials there?",

But people go hunting with rifles with their parents, they have access to these guns. What's surprising to me is that after an FBI tip, and a Child Protective Services call, that this child still had access to those weapons. Now, Georgia doesn't have any kind of a red flag law. But even if Georgia did, the red flag would be on the parents, not the minor living in the home.

And most recently, he co-founded a PAC called Leaders We Deserve, to help elect young progressives. And David, just to be in this moment, again, as we were saying, the 45th school shooting, just this year alone in the United States. And the Sheriff that we heard from, tonight. Earlier, I was listening to him, and he said he was shocked that this happened in his community. And I get what he's saying. It's jarring to have this happen in your hometown, in your home. But you, of all people, know that it's unfortunately not that surprising. DAVID HOGG, PARKLAND SHOOTING SURVIVOR, CO-FOUNDER, MARCH FOR OUR LIVES: Yes. Unfortunately, it's happening in every community. And, at this point, it's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when, until we come together and do something about this. And I'm just really sick and tired of the hatred and the division and the debate over and over about all this stuff, and us not focusing on what we can agree on. After Uvalde, many people said that it wasn't going to be possible for us to change any gun laws. But for once, Congress actually did something. We expanded background checks for people under the age of 21, attempting to buy a gun. And we put billions of dollars into school safety programs and community safety programs. And obviously, that was nowhere near enough, given that I'm talking to you, right now. But we have made progress on this. Over 800 high-risk individuals have been stopped from buying guns like the AR-15, since Uvalde, because of the passage of that law. We have so, so much more work to do. But the point I really want to come back to is we know this is very divisive issue. We know, as a country, that we have very strong opinions on both sides of this issue. But ultimately, we all agree that nobody wants to see these school shootings continue. Nobody wants to see gun violence continue. And I think it's time that our leaders have a real conversation, about what can we agree on, moving forward, so that these stories, these school shootings, can be left in our history books, and not in our headlines.",

I think what it looks like to politicize this moment is frankly, doing the same thing that we've always done, which is nothing, right? Nobody wants these shootings to continue. And what I would urge those lawmakers to do is do something potentially like a special session, in Georgia, and have some real conversations, not out in public, between the lawmakers, where they're in the public sphere, and then, they need to have their guards up a lot of the time, especially the Republicans, because they don't want to be seen talking to Democrats about this. But have a real conversation, behind closed doors, and figure out what you can agree on to move forward. In Florida, we raised the age to buy a gun to 21, and we passed red flag law. Obviously, there's work that needs to be done as we find out more details about this incident, to make sure that we're passing things like child access prevention laws, to make sure that parents, whose child is able to access a gun, that is owned by that parent, and go and do something like this, that they're held accountable. This is child endangerment for, like, period. There's nothing more than that. And that's what I would encourage those lawmakers to do, is have a real conversation. And more than that, though, I would encourage the voters of Georgia, I would encourage young people, across this country, and people of all ages, to make sure that we aren't just sending our thoughts and prayers, but remembering that, it's about action. We need to do more to address this issue, and come together, as Americans, to address this, and acknowledge the fact that we're always going to have disagreements. Why don't we come together, and focus on what we can agree on, and move forward on that? Because none of us want to see this violence continue.",

And all they were trying to do was trying to find a way to get their votes counted, after this crazy election. The way that they tried to find justice for these people, who were murdered, was to go through the federal judicial system. It went all the way up to the Supreme Court.

CNN has confirmed tonight that the nearly $10 million went to Tenet Media. And among the commentators, there are podcasters you might be familiar with, Benny Johnson and Tim Pool. Both of them have millions of subscribers, on YouTube, and other social media platforms. And in fact, some of the same narratives that the Kremlin was pushing came up, when Pool interviewed Donald Trump, just in May. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Europe, which is much more affected by that war than us, is spending just a tiny fraction of what we're spending. And you say, Does anybody at least get involved in this?

If anything surprising is that they weren't doing it earlier.If you go back just a little bit in history, the 1940s, and the 1950s, the communist Soviet Union realized that Hollywood had a big influence on American opinion. So, taking control of the studios, getting their kinds of actors and scriptwriters in, was a major communist effort to infiltrate Hollywood. And a few people stood up to it, like Ronald Reagan, the union man, head of the Screen Actors Guild, to push that back. So, this idea of influencing influencers from Russia, it's in their playbook. And I'm not at all surprised they're doing it in this election, and probably others that we haven't uncovered yet.",

It's really a twofer for Russians, or others trying this kind of influencing. One, I think they do want Donald Trump to be president. Because unlike Trump's opinion of his relationship with Putin, Putin thinks Trump is an easy mark, so he'd be happy to deal with him. But it has a secondary and perhaps even more significant effect, because this kind of propaganda undercuts Americans' faith in their own institutions, and it turns Americans against each other. People who hate Donald Trump will now say more Russian interference, we knew it was true all along. And die-hard Trump supporters will say, They've politicized the Justice Department again.
