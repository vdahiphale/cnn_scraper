And that's what I think is a basic entry in politics.So it's not go out there and tell us the things we want to hear on policy, but talk about the fact that this country is so much more important than just our disagreements like this unity matters, strong national defense. I mean, this is an area to win over solid Republicans, is talk about the importance of Ukraine being victorious against Russia, one of our chief adversaries.

And, you know, from day one, she has been somebody who has been both deeply committed to the values that have shaped her, but also somebody who is just wonderfully relational and just a -- a, you know, just an authentic, genuine person that I've had the privilege to get to know over 12 years.",

And of course, we meet regularly, and I always sort of joke that we spend half of the time that we have together talking about our families. We happen to have Hope, their daughter, and Thomas, my son, were started college at the same time, and so we had tales to tell about what that was like, especially during the pandemic. And -- and that's really the piece of this. I mean, their family is their, you know, is their foundation, and, you know, they -- they show up at volleyball matches that Gus has, and they've supported Hope in her college career. And so, so that is just -- it is just who they are.",

And it wasn't that she didn't understand the ceremonial aspects that we're going to go along with the role, but they have truly been partners. And I see that really from the time I met her, where her commitment to a particular college in the prisons program, which is how I first got connected to her, was something that was her own thing, and it was something that she wanted to run with.So she has an agenda for the value she has that come alongside Tim. So she supports him. She plays that role, the social role and the like.

And she faced it actually during the first year of his gubernatorial term, when she got involved with the prisons program and -- and was seen as perhaps taking on role that was not what folks thought she should do. And -- and she takes it all in, but she doesn't give up on those commitments that she has. And I think, you know, I -- we've watched the ways that all of these issues have been litigated in the president and the media, and, of course, they've been through many of those things before, so they -- they know what it's like to have those kinds of attacks. And they keep their head up and they keep going. You know, she's somebody who, as I think you've probably read, she makes things happen, and that's who she is.",
