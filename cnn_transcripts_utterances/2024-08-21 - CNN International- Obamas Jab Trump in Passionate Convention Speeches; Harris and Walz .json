And where they were may have carried a more significant message than what they had to say. In a not so subtle jab at Donald Trump, Harris and Walz held a rally in the exact same building where the Republicans had their convention just a month ago.KAMALA HARRIS, (D) VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This is not just about us versus Donald Trump. This is about two very different visions for our nation. One, ours focused on the future. The other focused on the past. And Wisconsin, we fight for the future. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

He must show that if the worst happened, he would be ready to serve his commander-in-chief and he must do nothing to distract from the ticket topper, Kamala Harris.We've seen how Republican Vice Presidential pick J.D. Vance has struggled a little bit following his announcement speech. But this marks a critical new phase of the campaign. The Democratic Party elders have elevated their presidential nominee and their vice presidential nominee. It's now time for Walz and Harris to prove that the feeling of joy and euphoria and momentum they've created in their first month together as the Democratic Party candidates, that they can translate that into votes. This is going to be a very close election, notwithstanding the enthusiasm that we've seen at this convention, and it's going to play out in thousands of votes only in a handful of swing states.

Now, this comes one day after the foreign ministry in Tehran said any deal was unrelated to Iran's plans for responding to Israel for the death of a Hamas leader in Tehran. Now, keep in mind, Israel has neither confirmed nor denied any role in the killing of Hamas' political leader. The Iranian parliament meantime has been vetting cabinet nominees proposed by the new president. And CNN's Frederik Pleitgen is inside the parliament in Tehran, joining us live from there.

They are also not confident in the mediation role that the U.S. has been taking. At the same time, you do hear from the Iranians that they want a ceasefire to happen. And the other key thing that sort of we've heard today is the fact that the Iranians are no longer saying that the issue of a ceasefire and their retaliation are not linked at all. They are now saying that they are linked, but the Iranians still say they're not saying when they're going to strike and how they are going to strike out.",

They're not going to be on the table in Cairo either. They are being informed by the mediators of those talks. In fact, every day that in Doha those negotiations took place, at the end of the day, the Qatari prime minister called the Iranian acting foreign minister and informed him about how those talks were going.So, the Iranians certainly being kept up-to-date, these talks obviously very important to them as well. But they themselves, of course, that Iran is also a big factor at those talks because, of course, the United States does believe that if the ceasefire agreement can be reached, that maybe Iran will not retaliate against Israel. The Iranians are saying that they will retaliate at some point in time, but they are not saying how exactly that is going to happen. The language right now from the Iranians is that there will be an appropriate response, but they've also said it could come from the air, it could come from the ground. At this point in time, it simply isn't clear at all. At the same time, you do notice how those ceasefire negotiations, the possibility of a ceasefire have become very, very important here to the leadership of this country, Amara.",

Meanwhile, in the border Kursk -- Kursk border region, this drone footage shows Ukraine taking out key bridges during Kyiv's two-week old assaults.Now, earlier today, one Ukrainian drone killed a woman in Kursk, that is according to the governor there. Russia in the meantime launched a barrage of drones and missiles aimed at Kyiv and other areas. These attacks happened as China's Premier Li Qiang visits Moscow.

No real political response beyond that, what we see from President Putin is this attempt to portray business as usual in Russia. But interestingly, as we see, Ukrainians are showing off its efforts there in the Kursk region, what we're hearing is that there appears to be a more organized, more coordinated Russian response taking shape thereafter, the sort of chaos of the first couple of weeks.A Ukrainian commander of a battalion that's active in Kursk has told CNN on the phone today that he has seen as sort of shift in behavior that Russian units are starting to storm the Ukrainian units in his words, and that they're no longer surrendering, he said, in their hundreds, although some are still surrendering when attacked he claims. So, it's interesting that perhaps we're entering a new phase where Russia is going to try to put up more of a fight to that Ukrainian ground offensive. As for President Putin, while he, as I say, is meeting with the Chinese premier today, not saying much at all about Kursk. But yesterday, we saw an interesting event. He was meeting and greeting with people in the southern Russian city of Vladikavkaz, very reminiscent of the sort of post-crisis playbook that we saw from him after the Prigozhin Mutiny in June of last year. You can see the split screen, it is startlingly similar, an effort it seems to sort of reassert his popularity, reassert the sense that he is in control of things even though, at this point, it is not clear that he is and Russia trying to show that he is close to the people at the same time, as it's possible that he is still prioritizing, attacking and taking ground in Ukraine over actually protecting his own territory.",

It was long planned, we're told. It's sort of an annual thing that the Chinese and Russian heads of government meet, but it is convenient timing, right now. One, because it helps with that sort of effort to show that it's business as usual despite the Ukrainian incursion into Kursk. And I think it's also useful counter programming because we are expecting to see the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is another key ally as Russia sees it, of Russia going to Ukraine on Friday.So, this will help Russia to sort of reassert that its key allies are not essentially switching sides in this conflict, Amara.",

Conventions, going back decades have featured that.But what is unique, of course, here is that it's coming from a husband, it's coming from a man and in an election in which gender has played such a large role even before Kamala Harris became the Democratic standard where it's such an interesting dynamic to see how he handles that very typical political role. He talks about Kamala Harris as a wife. He talks about her as a prosecutor as well. But in his own description, in his own biography, you hear about a man who has essentially put aside his own ambitions for now to support his very powerful wife. And you heard that in the video introduction from his son, Cole Emhoff, who made a mentioned that Doug Emhoff gave up quite a lucrative and successful career as an entertainment lawyer to act as a trailing political spouse. And that's something of a sacrifice for him, certainly. But it does demonstrate the kind of partnership and dynamic that they have, and that they want to show the country that they have as they -- as voters look to see who they'll vote for in November. And it was -- I thought quite an effective speech. It was funny. You know, people we're very into it here in the crowd. His lines really did land among delegates who sometimes aren't paying attention, and they're chattering, they're walking around. His speech had them a pretty rapt when he was speaking and I think that just goes to show the kind of first gentleman, if he makes it to that role, that he would be. It's a role that doesn't have any definition. It doesn't have a salary. It doesn't come with any set staff in particular, no budget.

So, his task will be to introduce himself to the American people.I think we can bet he'll use some humor, that folksy sensibility that he has brought to the campaign trail. He's a joyful warrior and Democrats very much appreciate that aspect out on the campaign trail. We will also hear from former President Bill Clinton delivering his 12th convention speech. He has delivered these dating back to the 1980s. There have been some good ones; there have been some very bad ones. And I'm thinking back to 1988, when he spoke for twice as long as he was allotted, delegates began walking out and he later described it as 32 minutes of total disaster. In recent years, his role has been something of an explainer-in-chief particularly on economic issues. That's actually something that Democrats could use at the moment. A lot of Americans just don't understand what the Biden-Harris agenda has been on the economy. He is still something of a rockstar in the Democratic Party, but I think it's also fair to say that some views on him have shifted over the last several years. Just in general, the party has moved more to the left on issues like crime or trade that he espoused when he was president.

And you know, in watching them, it's important for people to know, they really haven't done a lot of them. They have had a relatively low public profile since leaving the White House and this was intense compared to their prior appearances.I think a lot of the resentments toward Trump had been building up over the years because, of course, Trump never hesitates to go after them, and this was really revealing and they got to Trump's vulnerabilities. And you can be sure, first of all, Trump was watching. You know, him. He was watching and he was going nuts. So, they got under his skin. It will be interesting to see how he responds.

      "sentences": "Well, this entire week, Amara, is about counterprogramming this. They recognize how much attention that Harris and her campaign are going to be getting this week and they're trying to steal some of the limelight. Now, when I talked to Donald Trump's advisers, they acknowledge that that's going to be difficult to do. But still, they are doing their best to try and draw contrast between their campaign and the campaign of Harris.And today, you're going to see the former president Donald Trump as well as J.D. Vance travel to Asheboro, North Carolina. Now, what I find really interesting about this is, this is actually Donald Trump's third visit to the state since Joe Biden ended his campaign last month. That's three visits in roughly a month. And I think that just emphasizes and underscores how important his campaign sees this state. And remember, this isn't typically North Carolina, a state that has gone for Democratic candidates for president in the past. So last time, we actually saw a Democratic candidate win was 16 years ago when Barack Obama in 2008 was able to secure the state. But, I will say Biden came very close in 2020 and so, the Trump campaign is really investing millions in new advertising, trying to build out their battleground strategy in North Carolina in an effort to prevent Harris from closing in on him even further. Now, the goal today with that speech in North Carolina is to talk about national security and we know from what we've seen this week that every single day, all of his visits to these different battlegrounds are focused on a specific issue. On Monday, Donald Trump was in Pennsylvania talking about the economy. Yesterday, he was in Michigan talking about crime and safety. Today, as I mentioned, it will be a national security focus. And tomorrow, Donald Trump will be talking about the border and immigration when he visits the border in Arizona. And you'll also see him in Las Vegas and Arizona again on Friday. And all of this is designed to keep Donald Trump on message, talking about the issues where they recognize he polls higher or at least polls better than Harris. Now, just to quickly talk about the RFK thing, our colleague Kristen Holmes caught up with Donald Trump yesterday in Michigan and asked him, you know, Nicole Shanahan, RFK Jr.'s running mate had mentioned that he would consider dropping out and endorsing him. Donald Trump told our Kristen Holmes, I would welcome that endorsement. He also said that he would even consider him for a role in his administration. So, very newsy there in his interview to CNN.
