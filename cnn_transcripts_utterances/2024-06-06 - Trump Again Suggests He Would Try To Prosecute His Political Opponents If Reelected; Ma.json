We begin tonight, keeping them honest, with the ongoing question of whether the former president, if reelected, would use the criminal justice system against his political opponents. Ongoing, because he keeps hinting at it. Speaking this evening in Phoenix at an event put on by the conservative activist Charlie Kirk, he confined the bulk of his remarks, immigration and the economy, but also railed against his criminal prosecutions and finished with this.

And he was very forceful about it, and he was very clear. And he said many, many times that democracy is not free. You have to defend it. You have to fight for it. And if we don't do that, then basically the burden falls and blood is spilled from our youngest men and women who defend us. And for anybody that has been over there or seen that or been to Omaha Beach and seen the height that those kids scale to preserve freedom, you just - your heart not only breaks, but you sit in awesome wonder. And one of the things the President has been trying to say to us, this is now his seventh speech on the subject, he'll talk about this tomorrow there, is that you have to preserve it at home and you have to preserve it abroad. Now, we have a person running for president of the United States again, who is a twice impeached president, who is now a convicted felon, who has said that if he's president of the United States, he doesn't believe that he is conscripted by the very constitution that those young men and women died to preserve, and that he could put SEAL Team Six out to kill his political enemies. He's - he has - you had Sean Hannity on before who was trying, begging him almost to say, Mr. President, please say that you're going to follow the law. You remember Sean Hannity actually did the interview not too long ago when he said he'd be a dictator for a day. So this is what we know about Donald Trump and we keep trying to find a somewhat of a bright spot in the soul of this man, and he comes up dark every time. And we know that Donald Trump wakes up every day thinking about himself. Then he thinks about hurting the people that hurt him. Then he thinks about helping his rich friends.

Nobody is above the law in the United States of America, not even Donald Trump, although every day he wants to prove to us that he is. And if the constitution is going to hold, if due process is going to hold, if the rule of law is going to hold, it has to take its course. But let me say this. Notwithstanding the fact that Donald Trump is in fact a convicted felon and has more to come, the only thing that actually works is the people of America making a decision on Election Day. None of these cases are going to stop Donald Trump from becoming president.

CNN's Paula Reid has more.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA REID, CNN CHIEF LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Today, federal prosecutors put their star witness on the stand in the trial of Hunter Biden, the widow of his late brother, Beau, who would become Hunter's girlfriend. Hallie Biden testified as federal prosecutors are close to finishing their case against the president's son in Wilmington, Delaware. She testified how she saw Hunter with crack rocks the size of ping pong balls, witnessed him smoking crack, and even went with him to buy drugs from dealers in Washington, DC. And how she had conversations with him between 2017 and 2018 about his drug use, telling him this can't go on. We can't do this. His responses would vary, sometimes saying, leave me alone, I'm fine. Or, at other times, I'm an addict and I'll figure it out my way. She also testified how Hunter introduced her to crack in 2018. It was a terrible experience that I went through. I'm embarrassed and I'm ashamed and I regret that period of my life. But Hunter's defense argues there's no evidence he was actively using drugs when he bought the gun in October 2018 and allegedly lied on the federal background check form. Hallie testified that she found drugs and drug paraphernalia in Hunter's car days later. I did find some remnants of crack cocaine and drug paraphernalia. She went on to testify about when she found the gun, saying, I was afraid to kind of touch it. I didn't know if it was loaded. The prosecution then produced video evidence of her tossing the gun into a grocery store dumpster. I was so flustered. I realize it was a stupid idea now. The prosecution also introduced text messages between the two, including when Hallie asked where Hunter was the night after he bought the gun. He responded, I'm now off Maryland Ave, behind Blue Rock Stadium, waiting for a dealer named Mookie. But Hallie also testified during cross examination that sometimes Hunter would lie to her about his whereabouts.",
