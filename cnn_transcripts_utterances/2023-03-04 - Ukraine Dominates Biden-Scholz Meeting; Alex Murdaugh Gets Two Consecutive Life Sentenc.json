We have been speaking about Bakhmut, of course, on air for months now, because it has very much been a flashpoint city in this conflict.One where we have seen fighting intensify in the last few weeks and that looks all but about to fall to Russian forces. To really get an understanding of why it matters, I just want to pull up the map to show you where it is first of all. It is along, of course, in Eastern Ukraine in that all-important Donbas region, a region President Putin desperately wants to control, wedged between two cities, Luhansk and Donetsk, that are controlled by Russian-backed separatists. So for President Putin, this would be a victory in the sense that it allows him to expand these regions that he claims are Russian territory; of course, illegally. But to be frank here, beyond that, it has very little strategic importance. Again, this isn't a city that necessarily connects to any larger part of the country or provides any foothold for Ukrainian forces to fight further. Really Bakhmut is important because Russia has made it important, because, for the last several months, Ukrainian forces say Moscow's troops have lobbed absolutely everything at it. Because the Wagner mercenary group that you heard about there in that piece has thrown its most expert fighters on the ground to try to make that win for President Putin. In fact, Western supporters, the partners of President Zelenskyy and the United States, NATO and others, say actually Ukrainian forces-- this is according to U.S. sources, speaking, of course, on the basis of anonymity. U.S. sources say they have been pushing President Zelenskyy to actually pull away from Bakhmut, to pull their focus toward the south of the country, where a spring offensive is expected in the coming weeks and months. But of course, for President Zelenskyy, backing down from any Ukrainian land is a red line. He has repeated over and over again that no blood will be spilled in vain, that every inch of his country will be won back. But even President Zelenskyy has admitted -- his men have -- that they could have to strategically withdraw from the city. Again, looking on what is happening on the ground there, that could very likely happen soon. The one and only supply bridge that connects Bakhmut, largely besieged, of course. Two areas outside where Ukrainian forces could be provided with supplies, where that small group of civilians just around 4,500 civilians inside Bakhmut, that road could give them humanitarian assistance. That road now, of course, blown up, just in the last day by Russian forces. That leaves the city ever more isolated and ever more vulnerable to this ferocious assault from Moscow -- Laila.",

CPAC mired in controversy and some conspicuous absences. Is CPAC still the place to be? RON BROWNSTEIN, CNN SR. POLITICAL ANALYST:  Not really, in the Republican Party. It has its internal problems with the person who runs it being accused of sexual misconduct by another Republican. But it's also seen as, essentially, a Trump subsidiary at this point. And it is reflected in one way of an interesting kind of evolution and narrowing of Trump's appeal in the Republican Party. When he won the first, time there was surprisingly little differentiation in his support from very conservative voters to more moderate voters. That wasn't really the dividing line. This time, if you look at the early polling about 2024, he is much more dependent on the most conservative voices in the party, the most conservative voters in the party. And you see that reflected in the fact that he is dominant at CPAC. Meanwhile, most of the field is in his back yard in south Florida, auditioning for the Club for Growth, which is a conservative group that focuses on economic issues.",

But I think he has calculated, as have many of the others, that CPAC really reflects a Trump constituency. The other event going on, this Club for Growth event, is interesting because it reflects the continuation of what we saw in 2016, which is that a lot of the big institutions in the Republican Party want to stop Donald Trump. They want to find someone else. When they could not do that, when they could not unify behind an alternative in 2016 with Trump at the lead, they all fell in line very quickly, from the elected officials to the big donors. And it will be interesting to see whether the opposition this time, from institutional forces in the GOP, is either more effective or more durable than it was in 2016.",

I mean, certainly in a Republican primary, as one Republican consultant said to me this week, if you look at what they are watching on conservative media, it is not the Reaganite issues of strong national defense, balancing budgets and cutting taxes.They are talking about attacking the Left. And pretty much any agenda that is seen as advancing the causes or advocating for greater racial equity, gender equity, more inclusion of LGBTQ, all of that is being condemned as well. And there is clearly a lot of power in that inside Republican primary electorate. It is largely why Ron DeSantis has rocketed to a position, going toe for toe with Donald Trump in many of these polls. It's an open question to me, though, whether this can sell beyond red America in those white collar swing counties outside of Detroit, Philadelphia and Phoenix and Atlanta and Madison and Milwaukee that Republicans have to win back to gain the presidency again. Is this really an agenda that is going to bring back some of those suburban voters, who thought Trump was too polarizing? DeSantis may be defining himself too much in a Trump-like manner to truly be competitive for those voters, if he gets that far.",

But, yes, I think Trump is still the front-runner, primarily becausehe has such a hold on the blue-collar side of the party. The basic dynamic in 2016 was that Trump won the nomination because he's consolidated the blue-collar half of the party to a much greater degree than anybody consolidated the other half, which is the white- collar half. Which was very dubious of it him even then. If you look at the early polling about 2024, you see something of the same dynamic, where Trump is still very strong among Republican voters without a college degree. He is still facing a lot of resistance among Republican voters with a college degree. But they, at this point, are splintering more among many of the alternatives. DeSantis does have the ability to put together a cross class, cross ideology coalition and pose a bigger threat, I think, to Trump than anyone did in 2016. But that is still on paper. Trump still has a big piece of the party. And someone is going to have to solve the Rubik's Cube of putting together just enough of the blue collar side and the white collar side to get past his really dominant position with those working class Republicans.",
