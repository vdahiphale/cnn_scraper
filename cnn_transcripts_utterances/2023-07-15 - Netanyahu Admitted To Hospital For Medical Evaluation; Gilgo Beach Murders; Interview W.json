Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been admitted to the hospital. His office says he arrived at the hospital a short time ago. CNN's Hadas Gold is joining us live from Jerusalem with more on this. What do we know about his condition and why he was taken to the hospital?",

      "sentences": "Well, this is all coming in just in the past hour or so. Very much developing story that we're trying to confirm all the details.What we know for a fact though, is that the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was taken to the hospital. He was taken to a hospital north of Tel Aviv, and appears not far from where one of his homes is north of Tel Aviv. That is according to the prime minister's office, who says he is in good condition and undergoing medical evaluation. We are seeing from Israeli media that is reporting that he was taken by his convoy, so not in an ambulance or anything like that, and that fully conscious when he walked into the hospital. Now Benjamin Netanyahu has no known major health conditions but he is a 73-year-old man. It has been very hot here in the past. And this is actually not the first time he has been hospitalized in this fashion within the past year. Actually in October of last year, during the Yom Kippur holiday, he was also admitted to the hospital for checks and stayed overnight, after feeling unwell. Yom Kippur is, of course, the holiday, Jewish holiday, where Jews who are observant fast so that could have all, of course, played a factor. But obviously, it has been a very stressful and intensive time here in Israel and in the region with violence, by the violence in the West Bank, and across Israel. Of course, there have been so many protests especially this past week against the judicial overhaul that the Israeli government led by Benjamin Netanyahu is trying to push through. But again, we are still trying to confirm all of the details, but all we know so far is Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been admitted to the hospital north of Tel Aviv. So far his office is saying that he is in good condition and is, as we speak, undergoing medical tests, Fred.",

So currently there are no federal standards specifically to protect workers from heat illness and your organization is asking OSHA Occupational and Safety Health Association to enact emergency heat standards. What would you like to see?DE LOERA-BRUST: Yes, that's right. I mean farm workers are absolutely on the front lines of climate change here. These are men, women and children who are doing incredibly physically demanding labor and truly dangerous temperatures. And they're too often afraid to speak out or just take a break whether it is because of fear of retaliation or just because of the level of poverty that some of these farmers live and they're just trying to work as much as they can to make ends meet. So we absolutely need OSHA to step up here. We want emergency temporary standards and we are talking really basic things here. We're talking access to shade, access to water, a right to take a break when needed. These are basic lifesaving things that any human being doing physically strenuous activity outdoors in these temperatures would require to survive. So that's really what we're pushing for and every day workers are out there in danger without a rule to protect them, is a day too long.",

      "sentences": "Perhaps, you can to try to paint a picture. What would a typical day, if there is such a typical day, for a California farm worker?DE LOERA-BRUST: Yes I mean most farm workers especially in these temperatures they start really early. Most farm workers get up between 3:00 and 4:00 a.m. they're out in the field by 5:00 a.m. And then they work, one of the things that makes farm workers particularly vulnerable to heat illness is actually the fact that many of them work piece rate. That means they're not paid by the hours they work. They're paid by how much they pick. So for example 25 pound bucket of tomatoes gets 83 cents. So the workers are really just out there trying to fill their bucket as fast as possible and get those 25 pounds of tomatoes and then run the bucket back to the truck so that they can get that counted, they can get their 83 cents and then run back to the field to start picking the next bucket as fast as they can. So you know too many workers feel this pressure, this economic pressure to just power through even as they get dehydrated and even if they start to feel nauseous or get dizzy. Those are all early warning signs of a heat stroke. And they have their supervisors rushing them and they're just thinking I need to put food on the table for my family. So it is just tragic that workers who are literally feeding all of us, feeding America putting the food that all of us are buying at the grocery store are putting themselves in danger and in these heat waves they're real the human shield for our nation's food supply. And that is coming at the expense of their health, their safety and sometimes their lives.",

Many probably don't have health insurance right?DE LOERA-BRUST: Yes I mean, the reality is this is a work force that is around 50 percent undocumented, varies a little bit state but this is a work force that is excluded from the social safety net, right? It is excluded from democratic participation. And farm workers regardless of immigration status are excluded from federal labor laws. So agriculture is explicitly banned or barred from the National Labor Relations Act. And this goes back to the 1930s and the Jim Crow era when decisions were made that look these are majority back then a lot of African American sharecroppers in the south, already a lot of Mexican and Asian immigrants in the west. And the decision was made we're not include them in labor laws. And so there's a lot of structural issues that create a really imbalanced power dynamic in the workplace. And then when you add in the temperatures and you add in lack of access to water and lack of access to shade and lack of access to breaks, I mean means that is a tragedy waiting to happen. And we see this all the time we just lost a farm worker in Florida to heat stroke earlier this month. And you know these are real people. That farm worker's name was (INAUDIBLE) Lopez Garcia, who's 30 years old. And again it is Florida, right. So is Ron DeSantis going to step up to protect the lives of Latino immigrant workers? Or what about Greg Abbott in Texas who's actively repealing what little water ordinances exist at the local level for construction workers, right? So we know that some of these states aren't going to do the right thing which is again, why we need OSHA to step up.",

On the recommendation of the doctor, the prime minister continues to undergo additional routine tests at the Sheba Medical Center.And good news for thousands of American student loan borrowers. The Biden administration says it is wiping away $39 billion in debt. It is a move that will affect more than 800,000 borrowers. The move comes just weeks after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down President Biden's previous plan to eliminate billions in debt. CNN White House reporter Jasmine Wright is in Washington for us with more on this. So Jasmine, the Education Secretary says this plan will fix payments made through what he called the broken system.

Well, this program is about fixing what the White House has called historical inaccuracies felt by borrowers who are under the income repayment plan and so what he is going to do is basically those borrowers who have been paying under that program for more than 20 years and who expected to see the balance of their student debt like this action would actually do that automatically fitting in line with President Biden's promise to try to erase debt wherever he can for student borrowers.Now we know as you said in the top there that it is going to have really a big impact. $39 billion of debt will be erased by this new action. And it will affect 804,000 borrowers money that they say is fixing from administrative failures -- past administrative failures. But it is not just the amount here Fred, that is going to be a major impact but it's also about the timing. Like you said it comes just weeks after the Supreme Court struck down President Biden's widespread Student Loan Forgiveness Plan, throwing a wrench in his promise to do widespread student debt relief. Now, this new program that they announced on Friday is separate. It fixes past administrative errors. It does not go through that total widespread program that President Biden advised. But he says that he is still going to go forward and doing that through the Higher Education Act of 1955, still try to get that program on its feet as it's underway in the regulatory process right now. But we know that that could take months or even up to a year to get on its feet. Now this action is separate from that. But it is something that the White House feels that the president has the constitutional ability to do and therefore will do it as they try to get that larger process on its feet. Now one thing I'll just say lastly here is that in addition to announcing this plan yesterday what we heard from President Biden was really attacking Republicans who have criticized his efforts to try to erase the student debt over the last few months. In this specific statement we got yesterday the president said that their disregard for working and middle class families is outrageous, Fred.",

Nobody expected her to be here. The 24-year-old from the Czech Republic upsetting Ons Jabeur in straight sets.Vondrousova was a really heavy underdog but she beat the odds on center court in more ways than one, Fred, because just a year ago she could only watch from the sidelines. She had her wrist in a cast. She had just had surgery. And so her run for the title this year was so unexpected that she actually told her husband to stay at home and look after their cat Frankie. She's like don't even come. It won't even happen. And then once she made the final they found a pet sitter so that he could make the trip to London. See her hoist the trophy as Wimbledon Champion. But just a remarkable run for so many women on the women's side. And the men, of course, taking center court tomorrow for the match up that so many tennis fans wanted. You've got the top player in the world right now, Carlos Alcaraz, against the best ever Novak Djokovic who continues to cement that legacy. He's now just one win away from that record-tying eighth Wimbledon title and his fifth straight. So he beat Jannik Sinner in straight sets. He's on an incredibly dominant run. He has not lost a match on center court in a decade. He's won 34 matches in a row at Wimbledon. In fact, he's only lost once when he's reached the Wimbledon final and that was all the way back ten years ago when he was beaten by Andy Murray. So when he gets to a final, he gets it done. And he is facing top seeded Carlos Alcaraz who took care of business himself with a dominant straight sets win over Daniil Medvedev. That took less than two hours. He's 20 years old. He's looking to become the fourth youngest Wimbledon men's finalist in history and hoping to add to that grand slam haul because he won the U.S. Open last year. So this is going to be the second meeting between the two. They squared off last month at the French Open, Djokovic winning that contest in the semi-finals but everybody had their eyes on that match and I think we'll have our eyes on this one as well.",
