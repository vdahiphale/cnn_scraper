This time in Fulton County, Georgia, booked, fingerprinted and photographed. It's the first ever mugshot of a former U.S. president. Trump is charged with more than a dozen felony counts stemming from his efforts to overturn the state's 2020 election results. He is free on a $200,000 bail bond covered with a 10 percent payment to an Atlanta bonding company, according to sources.The entire booking process took about 20 minutes. Then the former president headed to the airport just outside of Atlanta for his flight back to New Jersey. He railed against the charges in Georgia as well as federal charges of trying to subvert the 2020 election and mishandling classified documents. Here he is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: I really believe this is a very sad day for America. This should never happen. If you challenge an election, you should be able to challenge an election. I thought the election was a rigged election, a stolen election, and I should have every right to do that. What has taken place here is a travesty of justice. We did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. And everybody knows it. I've never had such support. And that goes with the other ones, too. What they're doing is election interference. (END VIDEO CLIP) Former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark has surrendered overnight along with former Coffee County Election Supervisor Misty Hampton, Georgia State Senator Sean Still, and former Trump campaign official Mike Roman. Three co-defendants have yet to turn themselves in. More now on what comes next from CNN's Senior Legal Affairs correspondent Paula Reid. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA REID, CNN SR. LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Now that former President Trump has completed his surrender here at the Fulton County Sheriff's Office, the next time he'll have to return here to Georgia is for his arraignment. The District Attorney Fani Willis has said she would like to do the arraignments for all 19 defendants the week of September 5th. Now in his federal cases, this all happened at once. He was processed and then he went before a judge to enter his plea. But here in Georgia, things happen at a slightly different pace. Now after that initial week or two of arraignments, the defendants actually have a short window of time to file certain challenges to their case. Several defendants, including Mark Meadows and former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark, they've already challenged their cases trying to get these state-level cases moved to federal court. The former president has signaled that he will likely try to do the same. Rudy Giuliani may also try that move. So that process will take quite some time to play out. The next thing that's going to happen though is on Monday, there will be a hearing for Mark Meadows' effort to move this to federal court. We expect that the focus of that hearing is going to be that infamous call between former President Trump and former Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. The District Attorney, Fani Willis, has dismissed any suggestion by Meadows that what he was doing was just part of his job as chief of staff and that this should be not prosecuted. Now, it'll be interesting to see what the judge does here, but if Meadows does not succeed, he will be back with the other defendants in Fulton County as this case proceeds, but for a RICO case of this size and complexity could take years for a final resolution. Paula Reid, Fulton County, Georgia. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

I mean, within the Republican primary, by and large, so far, this has worked out for him. I mean, he has convinced most Republican voters to see this the way he wants them to see it, that this is another way in which American society, the real victims of discrimination in a diversifying America, are white Christian conservatives.And he has made this an extension of his argument, his core political argument from the outset. Now how this plays if he is the nominee in a general election could be a very different proposition. I mean there are multiple polls showing that most Americans out of the Republican coalition believe that he has committed a crime and that most Americans outside of the Republican coalition believe that if he is convicted of a crime he should not be president again. So Republicans, you know, are reacting in one way but they are ignoring some yellow lights on the dashboard about how this might play in a general. election. BRUNHUBER: Yeah, you touched on the first GOP debate. I mean, you know, two days ago, normally the candidates will be able to sort of dine on that and the media coverage for days. I mean, it's pretty much already forgotten. So for the party, I mean, we heard in the debate Ron DeSantis say directly that if the next election is about the insurrection Republicans could lose, but how will that be possible? I mean, is it more likely as one of our reporters put it that the defining moments of or more likely to happen in the courtroom than on the campaign trail?",

Look, if Donald Trump is the nominee of the Republican Party, he is going to be competitive for the White House because we, you know, we are at an intense level of polarization, very few people switch sides from the team that they usually identify with, and we are a closely divided country.Plus there's a lot of hesitation about giving Joe Biden another four years. Americans remain down on the economy, uneasy about inflation, and most people believe that he is too old to do this job for another four years. So all of that argues for a competitive race, no matter who the Republican nominee is. But Donald Trump fell seven million votes short last month. He is the one who has to expand his coalition. And if you look at the way independent voters, as opposed to Republican voters, are responding to all of the legal challenges that are accumulating against him, it clearly raises the question of whether any of this is going to help him broaden the support that he had last time. He can't forget he is the one who needs more votes if there is a rematch. And there's a lot of reason to think that while this would not crater his support, it would lower the ceiling at least somewhat and leave him in a more difficult position than he was last time.",

I mean, Whit Ayres, the veteran Republican pollster, kind of divides the Republican party into three pieces. 35 percent or so always Trump, 15 percent or so never Trump, and the other half, maybe Trump.And I think there were a lot of maybe Trump voters who were watching last night, and they may have thought well of any of the individual candidates, but as we were just talking about a moment ago, he is polling at 50 or 55 percent, which means that some voters who are now saying they want to be with him are going to have to be convinced to make a different decision. And I don't think anybody thought that we saw a sharply defined argument from anyone outside of Chris Christie and Asa Hutchinson who were on the periphery of the race about why they should do that from the stage last night. And that's still is the question: if they actually want to beat Trump, will they provide voters a better, clearer, sharper reason than they have so far to move away from him?",

To make him feel like he, in fact, had been forgiven and to encourage him, Prigozhin is very arrogant to begin with, to continue to maintain contacts with people who supported him. Then Putin could monitor Prigozhin's conversations. He could monitor his communications with other members of the elite and kind of smoke out people who might be still on good terms with Prigozhin. So this, in fact, afforded Putin a lot of intelligence. That was very likely the case and probably one of the reasons why he waited.",

It's the fourth time. It's the first time that a president, former president has had to give a mugshot. And there was this kind of a ballyhoo thing that he was going to be treated just like everyone else. And I think that the district attorney in Fulton County kind of missed the ball on that. I think it would have been smarter if she'd have just had him come in an unusual way. In other words, not having coming by video. They filled out ahead of time this fact sheet. They didn't even actually weigh him. They put down the weight before he showed up. They had the rap sheet that he doesn't have, of course, except he's got the three other accusations against him, two of them federally. But he doesn't have a normal rap sheet like that. So there was really no purpose in having him come there. And I think that just in terms of the optics, Trump won the day. And I think that the D.A. and the people that she's working with have to really think that through, because he showed up in a caravan. He showed up like a visiting head of state. Nothing was normal about it. They kicked the reporters out of there, whereas they normally have a press area. And so he got to play this all his own way. And I think that as they say, they need to think that through. Also, there's going to be a speedy trial, but not for him. Under Georgia law, one of the co-defendants, Cheseboro, asked for a speedy trial. He'll get one. but not the others. I've said it from the beginning when I heard about this case a week and a half ago had been filed. It will not get to trial in my estimation against Trump before the November election. And I think right now it's actually helping him going toward the November election politically. I think the case that really matters is the same one that I thought for a while, the one in DC, the one that's in federal court that's one against him solely. And I think that one could actually get the trial before the November election and the judge there federal judge is going to do everything possible I know this case is important because it can't be pardoned, but if somehow Trump gets back into office it's going to be a war of wills between him and state court Georgia and help hard himself on the federal cases I think they need to get moving with the federal case that really matters the one in Washington D.C., not take any excuses from him that he's not ready for some reason or these other are in the way and push that one in Washington D.C. federal court against just him.",

      "sentences": "The facility where Donald Trump and his co-defendants were summoned to surrender is nothing short of a hulking, sprawling nightmare, the Fulton County Jail. It is also known as Rice Street because of its address. The facilityopened in 1989 and almost from the moment it opened it became obsolete and overcrowded. Just last month the Justice Department announced an investigation into this facility because of allegations of quote \"unsafe, unsanitary living conditions, excessive force and violence.\" As for the overcrowding, the capacity of this facility is 2,688 inmates. As of April, according to the state of Georgia, it housed 3,221 inmates. According to various news reports, seven inmates died at the facility just this year. About 15 inmates died last year. And there was a notorious case of an inmate who passed away in his cell last September. 35-year-old Lashon Thompson. The medical examiners and Lashon Thompson's family's attorneys say that he died of neglect, malnourishment, and other poor treatment. He was in the mental ward at that hospital. Most noteworthy about his case was that his body was found covered in lice, bed bugs, and other insects. Just horrible images released there. Lashon Thompson's family's attorneys also released a photo of the conditions inside his cell that just showed absolutely deplorable conditions. Now all over this jail there is grime, there is dirt, there are overflowing toilets. Another really horrible anecdote regarding this jail is that last year during a public meeting, law enforcement officers rolled into the meeting a wheelbarrow. The wheelbarrow was full of shanks that were made by the inmates by grabbing just chunks of crumbling walls in the facility and fashioning them into shanks to attack other inmates. That's how bad this facility got. The Sheriff of Fulton County, Patrick Labatt, is completely admitting these conditions are horrible. He says he's welcoming the Justice Department's investigation, and Sheriff Labatt is requesting about $2 billion in county funds to build a new jail. Brian Todd, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

It says the released water meets international safety standards.Pakistan is still in need of urgent support one year after catastrophic flooding. Last year's monsoon season killed hundreds of people, destroyed millions of homes, and wiped out entire farms. At one point, nearly one-third of Pakistan was underwater. One year later, UNICEF warns that millions still don't have access to essential services. According to the U.N., some eight million people are still without safe water, and more than 1.5 million children in need of nutrition intervention. The floods damaged and destroyed vital infrastructure including 30,000 schools, 2,000 health facilities and 4,300 water systems. UNICEF is calling on the Pakistani government and others to increase investment in basic services for children and families. Now also in Pakistan the expert zipliners who rushed to help rescue eight people stuck in a dangling cable car earlier this week are being honored. They were presented with awards at a ceremony in Islamabad Thursday. The zipliners were called to carefully swoop in, bringing six children and two adults to safety after a 14-hour ordeal. The gondola was left swaying above a rocky ravine on Tuesday after a cable snapped. One of the rescuers described the challenges he faced. Listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MUHAMMAD ALI SWATI, RESCUER (through translator): The most significant obstacle we encountered was the absence of light. The wind pressure was also quite high. In the valley, you can't feel it. But when you go high, wind pressure is significant. So darkness and the wind pressure were the key challenges for us. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
