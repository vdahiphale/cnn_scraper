We're providing all of that currently to those folks. But it will be a long time. It's so tragic. And these folks -- generations have been in line. And then we've also lost homes in the upcountry area as well. That's tragic as well. You know, Maui is an extremely resilient community. We do take care of each other here. We know we're in one of the remote places on earth, unfortunately, or maybe fortunately, depending on how you look at it. People here realize that, and we are here to take care of each other. The community support has been overwhelming. And then support from, you know, national companies and Feeding America, disaster services. We have a tremendous amount of -- (MUSIC) (CROSSTALK)",

Attorneys for his wife, Asa Ellerup, and her two adult children explained what the family is going through since Heuerman's arrest back in July. Now this photo is from a GoFundMe drive to help their family, who their lawyers say are victims themselves. CNN's Jean Casarez joins us now from Islip, New York. Jean, we're learning all of this from a news conference that just wrapped up with those lawyers. What else did they say?",

First of all, he said there was not a gun vault in the basement, it was not soundproof. That's completely wrong. The way Robert Macedonio explained it to me a minute ago is that it's like a gun case and that it was elevated, there were 2x4s. It was very small in that basement, and it's necessary in order to get homeowners insurance here in New York. Also clearing up what we heard about a doll encased in a glass that was taken out of that home, of plastic. That was a collectible from Asa Ellerup. That was her doll that he had collected for years. A lot today about the home, the disarray of the home, more than we even knew before. The attorney said the drainpipes had been removed in the home and there was running water but the water would go straight down into the basement. The family is living in the home, at least the son is living on a type of foam in the house. Then they said that they are days away from filing a civil action, which they call Notice of Claim to preserve that right, the civil rights, the civil liberties for the family. Take a listen.
