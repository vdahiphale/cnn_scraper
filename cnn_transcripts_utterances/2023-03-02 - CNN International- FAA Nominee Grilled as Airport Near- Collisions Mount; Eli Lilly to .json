If you're just joining us, let me bring you up-to-date with our top stories this hour.Severe weather moving east and at least 40 storms being reported across the U.S. overnight. More than 1 million people in Georgia, North Carolina and Tennessee are under tornado watches right now. And the FBI has arrested a 49-year-old man in Pennsylvania for allegedly trying to bring explosives in a suitcase on to a flight to Florida. Marc Muffley faces two charges and will appear in court today. The NTSB is joining an investigation into the latest close call at U.S. airports. It involves two jets that were reportedly just seconds away from colliding at Boston's Logan International Airport on Monday. It was the fifth time this year that planes came close to a collision on the nation's runways. And the incident led to a sharp questioning in a congressional hearing for the man tapped to lead the FAA. Pete Muntean has the details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PETE MUNTEAN, CNN AVIATION CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It is the latest dangerous close call at a major airport, and now lawmakers want answers. SEN.

And many parents speak about in essence being gas lit by Iranian employees.At one-point last week the health minister said that this is paranoia. That these incidents are being triggered by rumors and allegations. And it's really only in the last day or two when the shear weight of the numbers, almost 1,000 students, finally has the state begun speaking more concretely about what needs to happen. But we have been able to communicate with some of the students who were themselves targeted, some of the parents. And it's really heartbreaking because there is so much confusion. We can actually show some video of the aftermath of a recent attack yesterday in which over 100 students were taken -- you see there a schoolgirl taken out in a stretcher just absolutely distraught. Because there is really no understanding of what this could be and it is against the backdrop of Iranian women, young women, schoolgirls speaking out, fighting for their rights. And there is a concern that this could be some sort of retribution or some sort of way of bringing them back into line. Parents are as you can understand just absolutely beside themselves. And there is a really terrifying parallel which is what happened at the girls' school in Afghanistan when students suddenly were taken ill there. That was a lot more physically traumatic than what we're seeing here so far. But the context is just so incredibly troubling.",

The list of condemnation from observer groups, independent bodies, local and external is growing. We're talking about a group of seven civil organizations called the Nigerian Civil Society Situation Room, that said it was not credible. We've seen a stinging criticism for instance for the EU Observer Mission, from the International Republican Institute and the National Democratic Institute and that well I don't know he saying stands for legitimacy of Bola Tinubu presidency and the election that INEC claim.
