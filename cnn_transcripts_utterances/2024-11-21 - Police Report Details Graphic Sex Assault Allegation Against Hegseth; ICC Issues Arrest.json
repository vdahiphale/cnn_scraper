He is the Fox News host that Donald Trump has selected to be the next defense secretary of the United States. The 22-page report was released by the city attorney's office of Monterey, California in response to a public records request.In it, there are new details and conflicting accounts of what happened in a hotel room seven years ago, a California woman telling police then she was sexually assaulted. Pete Hegseth was never charged with a crime and he denies the allegations. What is said in this report, though, is graphic and troubling. And they are also now, those details, in the hands of all of the senators who are going to have to decide on whether or not Hegseth should get this huge job that he's picked for. He's headed to the Hill today for meetings with V.P.-elect J.D. Vance at his side. Sara Murray has much more from this police report, as you're able to obtain this police report. Sara, what does it say?",

      "sentences": "Well, what we've really seen happen behind the scenes, John, is they have tasked J.D. Vance, the V.P.- elect, with being, as you mentioned, this unofficial Sherpa for some of Donald Trump's most controversial candidates. We saw him do that yesterday while he kind of paraded Matt Gaetz through the Senate to meet with key people who are going to be involved in his confirmation process. And today, he'll do the same with Pete Hegseth.Now, I do want to address as well that what Maggie Habram reported, we have reported as well, I mean, they were definitely caught off guard by some of these allegations. It did not come up in some of the vetting. And remember, he decided on Hegseth, Donald Trump, very quickly. He called him up to Mar-a-Lago, met with him, and then very soon after, quickly announced that he was going to be his pick for the Department of Defense. And so we're kind of seeing all of that fallout play out now, and we're going to see it, I think, in fresh detail and with new eyes today when he's confronted by different Republican senators who have deep concerns and uneasiness about Hegseth like they did about Matt Gaetz. Now, I do also though want to expand on what we're learning about J.D. Vance, because one thing that's been very clear, and I've heard this from several people, several of my sources and other reporters, is, where has J.D. Vance been? Over the last two weeks, we've seen a lot of Elon Musk. We've seen a lot of RFK Jr. We've seen a lot of these kind of unlikely allies become this ensemble around Donald Trump in the public eye. J.D. Vance, really, we saw emerge as the first time on Capitol Hill in public. And, really, we're starting to learn, and we just have fresh reporting on this, on what he has been tasked directly by Donald Trump to do. And that is to be his point person on Capitol Hill. Donald Trump has asked J.D. Vance directly to really ensure that his policy priorities on Capitol Hill, his agenda, is passed and that the Senate as well as the House do not get in his way, particularly given that Republicans now have the majority in both in both chambers. Now, of course, that also relates to these cabinet picks. And then behind the scenes as well, though, I think it's interesting to note that he hasn't been totally absent either. He has been in essentially every single transition meeting, I'm told, along with Donald Trump Jr., Donald Trump's eldest son, as well as Elon Musk. He has been weighing in on key decisions. He was a key voice in Tom Homan being the border czar, as well as Tulsi Gabbard being named the intelligence director. So, there's a lot going on behind the scenes. But it is notable that he hasn't really been out there on television like others. Now, as for what he did yesterday with Matt Gaetz, we heard Matt Gaetz himself address some of the concerns around him. I want you to take a listen to what he told reporters. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Yes, this is a really significant legal escalation of the situation. This is something that Israel has been (INAUDIBLE) since the ICC chief prosecutor, Imran Khan, back in May in an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour, told her, broke the news, that he was going to be searching for arrest warrants for Yoav Gallant, for Benjamin Netanyahu, and also for the three principal Palestinian Hamas figures, Yahya Sinwar, Mohamed Deif, the military commander as well, and Ismail Haniyeh. All those three Palestinian figures we understand now to be dead. So, it is interesting why the ICC is issuing an arrest warrant from Mohammed Deif. That is remarkably unclear at this time. But what is very clear is the language and the pushback that's been given by Israeli officials.Now, going back to May what the ICC said they were going to request arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant for crimes against humanity and war crimes. And specifically there, they were talking about knowingly and intentionally withholding water, food and medicines from the people of Gaza. That was sort of part of what they were laying out. The prime minister's office here, the prime minister himself, have called these allegations absurd and false and a distortion of reality. We've yet to get a reaction from the prime minister today. He's been meeting with the U.S. envoy, Amos Hochstein, talking about a ceasefire with Hezbollah and Lebanon. But, clearly, this is now going to become front and center for him. This is a massive escalation of where things stood. Israel had been to the ICC and had requested them to put aside these potential arrest warrants. The ICC overruled Israel's rejection and has gone ahead and issued them.",

The system is really slamming the region with powerful winds, bringing down trees and power lines, of course. One mayor in Washington State said it's one of the worst wind storms that they've seen in recent memory. As of this morning, more than 300,000 homes are without power there.And now the concern really shifts to California, which is next in the storm's path. Forecasters are warning of life-threatening rainfall in parts of the state. CNN's Derek Van Dam is joining us. He's tracking all of this for us. Derek, what are you seeing?",

      "sentences": "Yes, that's right, Kate. So, when these bomb cyclones form off the Pacific Northwest, they have the ability to draw in the moisture from the Pacific Ocean and transport it thousands of miles to the coastline. And this is what we're experiencing across North Central California. Check this out. Sta. Rosa, California, dealing with flooded roadways. There have already been reports of over a dozen small landslides in the mountainous terrain across this region. And guess what? It's going to continue before things improve into early parts of next week.You can track this tropical moisture all the way back towards the state of Hawaii. We call that the Pineapple Express. And there it is, the moisture train that's going to send that torrent of rain continuing into Northern and Central California. In fact, we've got this rare high risk from the Weather Prediction Center of excessive rain, could lead to flash flooding. I bring this up because if we go back a couple of months ago when Hurricane Helene was on its approach towards Western North Carolina, a rare high risk was in place. Remember, 40 percent of all flood related deaths, 80 percent of flood related damage comes out of these rare high risk situations. So, here it is, very active radar, just rain continuing to slam the same locations. And then there's been concerns about the wind. Remember how much damage we had in and around the Puget Sound yesterday from this bomb cyclone? Well, there's still wind advisory, so not as powerful as what we experienced over the past 48 hours. But, nonetheless, it will be gusty as another storm system approaches and starts to deepen and strengthen. This won't be a bomb cyclone per se, but it will still bring more misery to the West Coast that's already been hit hard with feet of snow in the higher elevations and over a foot of rain in the forecast for those areas that I just mentioned, Eureka into North Central California. So, a tough go for these locations. Check out these snowfall totals, Kate. Winter is back.",
