Bring it, Donald. What do you think of this approach and how things are looking in South Carolina? SUSAN PAGE, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, \"USA TODAY\": You know, no better way to diffuse an attack than to use a little humor. That's something we saw with Nikki Haley. And, you know, the other thing we're seeing with Nikki Haley is, after months, almost a year of her being pretty -- treating Trump kind of gingerly, she is in it now. These next few weeks I think we should expect real rough-and-tumble politics. South Carolina has a rich history of difficult, tough, even dirty politics. So, I would brace yourself to - for the run-up to the South Carolina primary on February 24th, Kate.",

      "sentences": "Yes, we're quickly being reminded of that. I like how you say it, the rich history of the politics in South Carolina.Sarah, you've been talking to swing voters and focus groups for - I mean it's years now. If this ends up -- if Nikki Haley does not pull it off, we do not see -- you know she does -- we do not see a win and better performances, if this ends up being Donald Trump versus Joe Biden, John Berman said something yesterday that kind of reminded me that you're essentially looking at a double incumbent general election race. What does that do to swing voters? SARAH LONGWELL, PUBLISHER, \"THE BULWARK\": Yes, well, the swing voters who are going to decide this election, you could sort of categorize them as either the double doubters or the double haters or the a pox on both their housers. Like they - they don't like either candidate. But right now they're frustrated with Joe Biden because he's the president and, you know, oh, I'm frustrated with the economy, or, you know, international affairs. But they've forgotten what they dislike about Donald Trump. And as Donald Trump becomes more present in people's lives and he's out there doing the kinds of things he's doing now, calling women horrible names, calling Nikki Haley bird brain, voters are going to remember, oh, yes, actually I hate that guy more. And I think that that's what it's going to come down to. It's -- you're not really building a pro-Joe Biden coalition, you're building an anti-Trump coalition. But can I just say one thing on Nikki Haley, which is, you know, it is time for her to go the full Liz Cheney, right? She is - there is no path for her. There is no math for her. This Republican Party has changed to the point where, if Donald Trump owns this party, but Nikki Haley has a chance to go down swinging, and to be a legend, and burn the boats, and I want to see that from her because the party's not going to have her back. They already are done with politicians like her. So, it's time for her to go hard. And I love seeing that she's starting to do it.",

It's really amazing.With that in mind, kind of, Susan, let's talk about lessons learned or what you've seen in -- since we - you know, in the last two contests that we've seen so far. In your latest piece, you write about New Hampshire and how it both displays -- what happened in New Hampshire both displays Donald Trump's strength and also exposes Donald Trump's vulnerabilities going forward.

But, man, does he have some problems as we turn to the general election. The voters who voted for Nikki Haley in New Hampshire, more than 80 percent of them say they would be dissatisfied with Trump as their nominee. He has trouble with independent voters, with moderate voters and with college-educated voters, especially with women. Those are swing groups he'll need to win a general election.And just one more thing, these courthouse - this courthouse campaign has served him well in the Republican primaries. Not so well perhaps if there is a conviction, because even among Republicans in Iowa and New Hampshire, and significant portion say a conviction would make him unfit for the presidency and could give these courtroom drama a political bite that it hasn't shown so far.",

One was to sort of aggregate all of the things that the people who worked in Trump's cabinet have said about him since they left, because many of them have said he is unfit to hold office. And the second reason I did it was as kind of a call to action. You know, these folks are being very quiet now as we're in the middle of a Republican primary. Nikki Haley's right there. Go out and defend her. Say, vote for her, this other guy is unfit. He's a danger to our country. They've said it before. Some of them wrote books about it. Some of them did profiles in \"The Atlantic.\" But they've got to take this directly to voters. And - and, you know, many of them have defended democracy before in uniform. And I think they need to defend democracy again now by telling voters that Donald Trump is unfit.",
