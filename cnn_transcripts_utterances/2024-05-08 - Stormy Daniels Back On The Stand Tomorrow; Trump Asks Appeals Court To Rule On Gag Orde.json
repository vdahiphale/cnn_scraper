What his campaign is telling CNN about this admission from the independent presidential candidate. Plus, a group of us lawmakers demanding to know why video obtained by CNN contradicts Pentagon reports about that chaotic Afghanistan withdrawal and the explosion outside the Kabul airport. Thirteen U.S. Service Members were killed in that blast, hundreds or dozens at least of Afghans. Some of the gold star families are now accusing the Pentagon of telling lies. And leading this hour, as the New York hush money cover up case picks back up tomorrow in New York, a change in tactics from Donald Trump's legal team, we're told, when it comes to adult film actress and director Stormy Daniels being back on the stand. Let's go to CNN's Paula Reid in New York. And Paula, the defense cross examination of Stormy Daniels, we were told it originally was expected to be fairly brief, but sources are telling you that's changed why?",

And there was a ruling at the bench with the judge before that happened that she could talk about the affair, but the judge did not want her to get into the details of it. And a couple of times during her testimony, even the judge had to say to her, slow down or answer the question you're being asked, because she was expanding well beyond the scope of the initial question from the prosecutor. So what the defense really has to do now is sort of repair that.It's almost like reputational damage. And Paula is right, this is not crucial testimony to the case, whether or not they had this affair. The reason why Stormy Daniels is introduced as a witness in this case is to show Donald Trump's alleged motive and intent in hushing that story up, in procuring that story, why there was value to him near the campaign time to hush up the story. So, they're going to keep attacking her credibility. And they began doing that yesterday. And when they get back on the stand tomorrow, I'm not surprised they're going to go much farther by continuing to hammer away at her credibility because she gave so many details.

But at this point, Jake, it really does look like Michael Cohen will be the only direct link between the defendant and this alleged conspiracy to falsify business records. The only other person who could speak to it is Allen Weisselberg. He's currently the former CFO of the Trump Organization. He's in Rikers, as I am told, there's no plan to call him.So Michael Cohen gets on the stand. He's going to give the jury his version of events. Now, he is historically an unreliable narrator. He has given slightly different stories over the years. But he knows here, look, he needs to earn the trust of the jury. And some folks have asked me why Trump's lead lawyer, Todd Blanche, hasn't done more of the cross examinations in this case. That is because he is solely focused on the cross examination of Michael Cohen. This is going to be really the defense's case in many ways. We are going to hear every tweet, every tick tock, every podcast where Trump -- where he has said critical things of Trump, where he's called for him to be jailed. This is likely going to go on for three days total with Michael Cohen. And what we saw was Stormy Daniels, where they got her to admit that she hates Trump, that she'd dance if he goes to jail, caught her in some contradictory statements, talked about her financial incentives related to the case that was the trailer for what we're going to see with Michael Cohen.",

So, I'm not sure they're going to rush this issue. But, you know, there was something interesting that happened yesterday really quickly about the defense team asked for a mistrial during Stormy Daniels testimony because she went so far afield in answering the questions with all these extra details.And the defense was arguing this is going to prejudice Donald Trump. And Judge Merchan decided that what had happened in court was not enough to cause prejudice, at least at the trial level. And there was a limiting instruction that was given to the jury to disregard part of the testimony that wasn't crucial to what she was being asked. That was really more irrelevant and extraneous facts and that were embarrassing to Donald Trump. There was a little bit of TMI yesterday, too much information, coming from her testimony. So that's something that I am certain the Trump team, depending on what happens here, obviously, if there's a conviction, that is something they are going to go to the appellate court with as something they preserve the record on.",

They are denying that any of this happened, that they had any relationship with her. There was that famous video of him being asked on Air Force one of whether he knew her, he denied it. And so, he put her credibility in issues. So the prosecution is allowed to ask details, because the details are what show that it -- that whether or not someone is telling the truth. And she talked about things like the furniture was heavy and the suite was bigger than my first three apartments. I mean, things like that. If she hadn't been there, she wouldn't know those types of details.

And I would go back to, you know, we've tried to be thoughtful about putting legislation forward. Is it everything that we want? No. There are certain things that we would like to see, and we recognize that the border is a big issue. But the strategies that our colleagues, some of our colleagues are taking as we are, you know, going down this path are destructive. They're not helpful, and they don't move us forward. The country is tired of this. I hear it from my constituents every time I go home. Please get back to governing. And that's what we're here to do.",

What I can tell you is that I believe that this isn't the way that he wanted it to go. And I think that Marjorie is going to find herself in a very lonely place. And one of the biggest things that I think we have the biggest problem with is the disinformation that she continues to put out as a member of Congress and actually what she's doing right now on the House floor. Ms. Bice just touched on. We have gotten wins for the border, for the American people that nobody talks about. In the last appropriations package, we added 8,000 detention beds and roughly 22,000 CBP additional officers to the border. When Republicans go out there and say that we haven't done anything and it's not our number one priority, they're lying only to elevate their platform. I think what this is that Marjorie got sick and tired of people like Mr. Gaetz hogging all of the attention as he usually does. And she said enough is enough. And she took the spotlight, saying she was going to do the motion to vacate on Ukraine. She had brought it up before Ukraine had even hit the floor, which should tell you one thing again, for the second time, this failed experiment. Sometimes it's about members of Congress and not about the American people. And hopefully that you all see that, and so do the American people when they see acts like this that Marjorie is doing.",

This Marjorie Taylor Greene resolution, by saying motion to table, that essentially kills it for good. And that's what we expect to succeed. The effort to kill Marjorie Taylor Greene's motion to oust Mike Johnson, meaning that this effort will essentially die because of opposition, not just from most Republicans, but also Democrats as well.Hakeem Jefferies, a Democratic leader, made clear about a week ago or so ago that they would not support Marjorie Taylor Greene's effort to push out Mike Johnson from the speakership, in large part because of some of the deals that he made, including on the $61 billion in aid to Ukraine, the very same deal that got him in hot water with Marjorie Taylor Greene, part of the reason why she is calling for this vote to oust him from the speakership. But this vote to kill, this Marjorie Taylor Greene's resolution, it just requires a simple majority to succeed. So even if there are more than a handful of Republicans who want to keep this issue alive and try to actually force Mike Johnson from the speakership, there are more than enough Democrats who have eventually quashed this altogether, much different than last fall, when Democrats joined Republican led effort by Matt Gaetz to push out Kevin McCarthy from the speakership. At that point, they did not -- weren't able to kill the motion, and they went and actually voted out McCarthy. Of course, that was the first time ever that happened in history that led to a paralyzed house. But there is so much anger in the House right now, and you could hear it on the floor of the House when Marjorie Taylor Greene went to the floor just moments ago and announced her plan to move ahead with this vote.

I do -- I have spoken to some who believe that they'll vote to advance this resolution because they believe it deserves a vote on its merits, an up or down vote about whether to kick Johnson out of the speakership. So some may vote to advance it for that reason. Other ones are just angry at some of Mike Johnson's decision making.One of them, Congressman Chip Roy of Texas, he has not said how he would vote on this, but he has been angry. One of the members of the hard right who is not like what Mike Johnson has done on a number of key issues. How does he vote? Those will be some questions. And then the ultimate reason, one big reason why Johnson has tried to head this off is because he does not want to show weakness among the speakership. I want to show how many Republicans actually would oppose him or want him out of the speakership, because if there are more than a handful, Jake, then perhaps people will start talking about him in the idea of a lame duck, being a lame duck speaker and something that he simply started a discussion he does not want to have at this moment as they try to unify ahead of November. But so many questions here, Jake, about the ultimate, about how many people may vote for it. But there's no question about this.
