I'm Fredricka Whitfield, and this is the CNN Newsroom. Just ahead, where do we go from here? President Biden is back to campaigning after what supporters and critics alike call a dismal debate performance last night. This as Trump's supporters are rallying around their candidates. So, who is going to be the next President of Iran? Voters are casting their ballots as we speak and we will be live in Tehran. And an act of mercy in a time of war. More than 16 sick and injured children from Gaza are evacuated for medical treatment. Prominent Democrats all across America are today waking up with one question on their mind. What do we do now? Political pundits say the party is in what can only be described as panic, after a poor performance by President Joe Biden in the CNN presidential debate against Donald Trump. While Trump released an avalanche of falsehoods, Biden's inability to counter the former President and his halting sometimes confusing answers have Democrats now fearing for his chances in November.

A CNN instant poll of registered voters not only found that Trump won the debate by two to one margin, but 57 percent of debate watchers said they had no confidence in Biden's ability to lead the country.And just a short time ago, CNN spoke to Mitch Landrieu, the National Biden Campaign Co-Chair and the former mayor of New Orleans, who acknowledged Biden's shortcomings. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MITCH LANDRIEU, NATIONAL BIDEN CAMPAIGN CO-CHAIR: The President might have lost the debate on style, but he won it on facts. He won it on decency, and he won it on the ideas that people think are important in the country. I don't think that you can color the debate as a great time for President Biden. I think he had a rough time last night. There is no question about it. But, throughout the debate, trying to listen to Donald Trump talk was painful for me because there was no fact-checking that went on. And literally, he doubled down on everything that made people think that he was a terrible President the first time he was in office. KASIE HUNT, HOST, \"CNN THIS MORNING\": Sir, do you feel at all misled by Democrats very close to President Biden who have insisted that there has been no change in this man over the course of the last two years that would impact his ability to serve another four years?",

And the Joe Biden that I saw, the Joe Biden that I worked with, and the Joe Biden that is still with us today, is a guy that gets up every day, thinking about how to help other people. He is 81-years-old. Donald Trump is 77. So, you had a guy last night that was 81 that had a difficult time, and you had a guy that was 77 that lied, and when he spoke the truth, he was speaking malevolent truth. That's the choice that the country has.And so, you can judge the debate on style, if you want. I think when people get a little bit clearer from this, they're going to see that Donald Trump last night actually was unhinged as he has indicated that he is going to be and he is going to double down on the policies he had when he was President four years ago, which were not good for the country.

She is the Director of the Institute for Democracy, Journalism and Citizenship at Syracuse University, and she is a Senior Contributor for Axios. Great to see you. Good morning, Margaret. I think many of us are operating on very little sleep, after staying up to all of it, even the postgame show. All right. So, Landrieu says no need to worry. This was a style difference between Biden and Trump. Landrieu says that Biden may have been a bit wobbly, but he underscores that Trump was wrong a lot. So, what can Biden and the White House and his surrogates do to recover now?MARGARET TALEV, SENIOR CONTRIBUTOR, AXIOS, &amp; DIRECTOR, INSTITUTE FOR DEMOCRACY, JOURNALISM &amp; CITIZENSHIP AT SYRACUSE UNIV.: Well, Fred, I think it is Mitch Landrieu's job this morning to try to calm down all the voices in his party that are in a real panic after last night's performance, because last night's performance was problematic for President Biden on so many levels. On one, he really had one role, one job last night, and that was to try to alleviate any American's concerns that his age may mean he is not up to the task for another four years. And I think he came out with a deficit on that last night, instead of closing the gap or alleviate anyone's concerns. And the other is that this was -- should have been an opportunity for him to hold former President Trump accountable on elements around January 6 and other aspects of Trump's record, and he just missed a lot of those opportunities like, yes, the moderators do not do fact- checking in real time, but President Biden could have done the fact- checking in real time. That was his opportunity in a debate format where he can respond and the questions can be redirected. [08:10:00] And so, I think right now, there are sort of two camps inside the Democratic Party, from conversations I've had over the last many hours while we all weren't sleeping and reacting and watching, and one of those groups says they're still five or six weeks until the Democratic Convention, maybe the President needs to think about stepping aside. And the other group of Democrats is like that's ridiculous. Why are Democrats in a panic? You can lose the debate and still win an election. And Trump is problematic enough himself that Biden can repair this. I don't think any decisions are going to emerge in like the next few days. But, I do think over the next few weeks, we're going to see voter sentiment settle to some degree, and if Joe Biden were 30 points ahead in this race, it wouldn't matter. But, all the polls tell us that for months, even despite all of the legal charges that Donald Trump is facing, that for months this has been a margin of error rates where Trump is consistently ahead by two or three points within the margin of error, but having the edge in all of these key battleground states. It's hard to see how last night's debate would flip that dynamic, and while there were a lot of folks who were concerned about Donald Trump's responses, kind of revisionist history on January 6, revisionist history on Roe v. Wade, it is not going to be what people remember. They're going to remember, if you remember anything about the debate, they're going to remember President Biden's performance.",

I think they're going to lean on those people more.But, I think if Biden himself -- the top of the ticket for both of these teams really is what voters are voting for. And they think, in Trump's case, a lot of speculation about his running mate, his VP, what that's going to mean, people are going to vote for Donald Trump or they're not going to vote for Donald Trump. It's not really going to matter who his VP is. And I think in this case, President Biden could not, if he wanted to, count on his running mate or any other surrogate to help boost voters' confidence in him. He has to do that himself. He kind of has to own the performance and explain it to people and then show a different President Biden in the weeks to come.

But, even so, given multiple opportunities to drill down on messaging that's central to the campaign on some of the divisions in this country, on democracy, on January 6, President Biden appeared to miss some of those marks, which certainly would have gone a long way to quell some of that frustration.So, we'll see how the President appears today when he comes to Raleigh. He arrived late in the evening last night, attempting to course correct, shaking hands with supporters here for roughly 30 minutes, and proving by actions that he has the stamina, even if the performance on the debate stage gave the appearance otherwise.

He will soon be waking up in this club behind me and then will travel to Chesapeake, Virginia. And part of that is, in recent months, Donald Trump's campaign, both privately and publicly, has been stating that they think Donald Trump can be competitive in this state. They think that it will turn red in November despite Donald Trump having lost the state in the past two presidential elections. And I can tell you from my conversations, Fred, with Trump's advisors last night, they think that he is going into this rally today buoyed by his debate performance. They also think that it's only going to help him in Virginia after seeing what transpired on the stage.Now, as you also mentioned, Fred, Donald Trump's team is very much celebrating what happened at the debate. They argue -- I mean, they -- going into last night, they actually were pretty nervous about what was going to take place on the stage. They weren't sure which version of Joe Biden they would see. They actually anticipated he would be a much stronger debater than what he did last night. But, for Trump's part, he did a very good job of staying on message. His advisors had prepped him extensively and really urged him to move away from personal attacks and try to come off more presidential, not to be as aggressive with his rhetoric, which is often the type of Donald Trump we see at his political rallies and campaign stops. But, he was remarkably reserved, I'd argue, on the debate stage, especially if you compare it, again, to the type of personality we see from Donald Trump, normally when he is out there campaigning. The other part of this as well is that they were really relishing the reaction from many Democrats. You just heard Kayla lay out for you that there was a lot of panic on the Democratic side about Joe Biden's performance, about whether he is up for the job for a second term. And they were sharing those posts on social media. They were privately, I know, texting me and our colleagues, saying that it showed that they think that they won the debate and that others thought they did too. Now, of course, I think it's still early to argue that Donald Trump was -- had a complete victory last night. I think we do need to wait and see how the polls take this, how other voters respond to this over the next week. But, by and large, Donald Trump's team was very happy with how it went down. Fred.",

And actually you can see behind me, if we can take a look at this, there are quite a lot of people right now who are lining up to go out and vote. And one of the reasons, is the one that you mentioned, is that a lot of people that we've been speaking to here on the ground do believe that this could be a pivotal election, where also the choices that are pretty different between the conservative candidates and of course the one moderate candidate who is still in the race as well. Now, as is customary here in Iran, the Supreme Leader of this country, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, he was the first to cast his ballot. We were there, and I want to have a look at a little bit of what we saw there. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So, this is definitely an election with big repercussions, and definitely in the realm of foreign policy. Of course, you do have a lot of institutions here, like the military in Iran that do play a very large role.But, the President and his government can certainly shape things as well. And we have heard some policy differences between the conservatives and the moderate who are left in this race, where the conservatives, both of the frontrunners, are saying that they want to continue the policies of Ebrahim Raisi, which is very combative towards the United States, of course, also very combative towards Israel as well, whereas Masoud Pezeshkian, the moderate who is still in this race, he is calling especially for better relations with countries here in the regions to try and get some sort of detente going. That is one of the things that is actually a pretty key issue here for voters on the ground, for voters here in Iran. The biggest issue, though, I would say for them is, of course, the sanctions that are on Iran and the economic situation of this country as well, Fredricka.",

Thank you so much, Fred Pleitgen, there in Tehran.And then there is France, where voters will be going to the polls on Sunday for a snap parliamentary election. They'll decide whether they want to keep President Emmanuel Macron and his centrist government in power, or choose the far-right National Rally party and its longtime leader Marine Le Pen. If no one gets a majority on Sunday, a second round of voting will be held a week later. Macron called the snap national election after his party came in a distant second to Le Pen's far-right group in the recent European parliamentary elections. More now from CNN's Melissa Bell. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MELISSA BELL, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It was for France's National Rally a historic win. The European elections marked the first time the hard right had won a poll nationally. Now, the party is campaigning for seats in France's parliament and a shot at government. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (Interpreted): The party was long demonized. That's the work that Marine Le Pen and her team have managed to do to show that we are a party capable of governing and a party that is democratic. BELL (voice-over): No mean feat for a woman who inherited the party from her father, the Holocaust denier Jean-Marie Le Pen, who founded the National Rally or National Front, as it was known, with former French members with Hitler's SS, a history steeped in fascism that was credited with long keeping the party from power, even when it got close. France is a country, after all, heavily marked by the horrors of Nazi Germany. BELL: Amongst those atrocities what happened here at Oradour-sur-Glane eight years ago, when an entire village was rounded up by the SS and killed in cold blood. BELL (voice-over): The village frozen in time, left exactly as it was on that fateful day 80 years ago in order for the world to remember. But, in the new village rebuilt after the war, the European elections saw the National Rally come first here too. PHILIPPE LACROIX, MAYOR OF ORADOUR-SUR-GLANE, FRANCE (Interpreted): Here, the National Rally did a big score like in other rural communities. Times have changed. The means of communication are no longer the same. Societal issues have evolved too, and there has been a detoxification of the extremes of the far-right. BELL (voice-over): The key also for the National Rally, the young, who voted massively in favor of the party that few in the past would have admitted voting for, but that has now gained something that longer you did it. UNIDEITIFIED MALE (Interpreted): Legitimacy. That's it. We are no longer ostracized. We've taken seriously. They say that the 30 percent of French voted for us, French people who love the country, who don't want to see change and get eaten by globalization. BELL (voice-over): A message that looks set to resonate in a parliamentary poll that could see the National Rally gain not just legitimacy, but power itself. Melissa Bell, CNN, Oradour-sur-Glane.

      "sentences": "I counted at least 30, 30 false claims. Now, President Biden also made false claims, at least nine false or misleading statements on first count, and I'll give you some of them. He said he is the only President in a while who didn't have any troops dying anywhere in the world. Troops have, of course, died on his watch. He said he is putting in a $15 per shot cap on insulin and Medicare. It's a $35 a month cap. He said it's a $200 cap on overall drug spending and Medicare. It's $2,000 a year.He said the border now has fewer crossings than when Trump was in office. That's generally not true. He said or at least strongly suggested unemployment was at 15 percent when he took office. It was actually 6.4 percent. He said Trump wants to get rid of Social Security. Trump doesn't. He said billionaires pay 8.2 percent in taxes. It's much higher. He said Trump told Americans to inject bleach amid COVID. We know Trump made foolish comments about scientists studying disinfectant injection, but didn't frame it as advice to people. And Biden said the Border Patrol endorsed him. No. Its unions supported the border bill. He had supported. Never endorsed him himself. In fairness, the President did appear to clarify that one. Now, the Trump list, it is way, way longer. So, deep breath, he said some Democratic states allow people to execute babies after birth, an egregious lie that is illegal in every state. He said everybody, even Democrats, wanted Roe v. Wade overturned. Roe was supported by two thirds of Americans, even more Democrats. He said every legal scholar wanted Roe overturned, abortion to return to the states. Legal scholars have told me directly this is not true. He said the U.S. currently has the biggest budget deficit ever. No. That happened under Trump in 2020. He said the U.S. currently has a record trade deficit with China. That also happened under Trump in 2018. He said Biden personally gets a lot of money from China. Zero evidence of this. He said there were no terror attacks during his presidency. In fact, there were multiple attacks. He said Iran didn't fund Hamas, Hezbollah, and other terror groups under his presidency. Iran, in fact, did. He said Biden wants to quadruple people's taxes. That is pure fiction. He said the U.S. has provided way more aid to Ukraine than Europe had. It's actually the opposite. He said the U.S. has provided about $200 billion in Ukraine aid. It's closer to $110 billion. He said 18 or 19 million people have crossed the border under Biden. That is millions too high. He said many of these migrants are from prisons or mental institutions. His own campaign cannot corroborate this. He said Biden has only created jobs for illegal immigrants, total nonsense. He said Nancy Pelosi turned down his offer of 10,000 National Guard troops on January 6. There is no evidence she even got such an offer. It was the President not Pelosi who had the power to deploy the D.C. guard. He said Pelosi now acknowledges she turned down the troops. Her office tells me this claim is still a lie. He said he deployed the National Guard to Minneapolis in 2020. Actually, that was the Democratic governor. He spoke of quote, \"ridiculous fraud in the 2020 election\". Zero evidence of any widespread fraud. He said NATO was going out of business before he took office. Completely, clearly absurd. He said the U.S. was paying 100 percent of NATO before he came along. The U.S. made up about 71 percent of NATO. Defense spending not 100 percent. He said he, not Biden, is the one who lowered insulin prices and Medicare. He did it for some seniors. But, Biden did it for far more. He said Biden indicted him again. No evidence Biden has had a personal role at any of these four prosecutions. He said Europe takes no U.S. cars. Just not true. He spoke of food prices quadrupling under Biden. That's a wild exaggeration, though they are up. He said Biden made up the idea he called dead service members \"suckers and losers\". Note, The Atlantic magazine reported that, and then former Trump Chief of Staff John Kelly corroborated it. He said Biden called Black people quote, \"super predators\" for 10 years. Biden never once deployed that phrase, let alone for 10 years, though he did at least one speak of quote \"predators\" without specifying is about black people. He said his Trump tax cut was the largest in U.S. history. Not true, though, in fairness, Biden also said this. Trump said China and others stopped buying from Iran under him. China never stopped. He revived his pet lie, I don't know how many times I've done it that he signed the Veterans Choice Program into law. Barack Obama did that in 2014. Trump signed an expanded version in 2018. And finally, Trump said Biden got rid of that Veterans Program. Biden has not done that. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Interestingly, the Russian state TV, one of their primary primetime shows, if you will, the anchor there really parodying Biden and talking about the whole debate as being a show for pensioners. And I mentioned there, of course, that President Putin himself is of pensionable age.But, the point being that Russia essentially laughing at Biden and Biden's performance. Now, we heard from the Kremlin spokesman saying that President Putin didn't watch the debate and they wouldn't comment on internal affairs in the United States. But, I think if you stand back and look at who are the winners and who the losers, if you will, at a very simplistic level, Putin is a winner. President Zelenskyy is not. The European Union, NATO, not China, maybe not because of the threat of tariffs. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel, a winner, United States, Saudi allies or other Gulf partners, maybe losers in that because President -- former President Trump refused to answer the question about a Palestinian state, which really is the off ramp for all those Gulf States who are looking for a way out of the Gaza war at the moment. And as far as Donald Trump's comments that the Israelis should be able to continue with what they're doing, will that be read by Prime Minister Netanyahu was a green light from Donald Trump to go into Lebanon? Is he just talking about Gaza, or is he talking about the concerns that the Israelis have about Hezbollah in Lebanon? So, I think, there is a lot there for allies to worry about, because they see a greater likelihood of Trump coming back and they see Trump has not changed. The world has. It's more dangerous.
