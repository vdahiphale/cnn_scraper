Sam Bankman-Fried is expected to be arraigned in a New York court today, this after he was extradited back to the U.S. from the Bahamas overnight.Plus, and this is key, two of Bankman-Fried's former top lieutenants have now pleaded guilty to multiple counts of conspiracy and fraud and are cooperating with investigators. Investigators say their probe into all of this is ongoing. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DAMIAN WILLIAMS, U.S. ATTORNEY, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK: Let me reiterate a call that I made last week. If you participated in misconduct at FTX or Alameda, now is the time to get ahead of it. We are moving quickly and our patience is not eternal. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, their cooperation means that they are going to tell prosecutors everything that happened. They'll be the insiders that can explain this alleged fraud to both prosecutors and potentially to a jury. So that really amps up the pressure that Bankman-Fried is under.He had waived extradition in the Bahamas. And the prosecutors announced the cooperation of those two insiders as he was in the air, flying to the U.S., to face these charges. He landed last night. He is already inside the courthouse behind me. He will appear before a judge this morning. And there the judge will, you know, he'll face the charges, these eight criminal counts of wire fraud and conspiracy, counts that the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, Damion Williams, has called one of the biggest financial frauds in American history. Now, before the judge today, he may ask him to enter a plea, arraign him on those charges. And also they'll discuss bail. Now, sources tell me that prosecutors and Bankman-Fried's attorneys are discussing a package that could allow him to walk out those doors behind me later today. Jim.",

And while the city works to help take them in, the governor of Texas is touting what he's doing to keep them out. That includes new fencing, which the governor says is part of what will be, quote, a blockade in his words. CNN's Ed Lavandera is in El Paso. Ed, so, I mean, first, you've got numbers there. You've got lousy weather. You've got uncertainty about what's going to happen to Title 42 and for how long. What's it like for these migrants there but also for the folks responding to this?",

As you mentioned there, city officials opening up the convention center. Hundreds of cots inside. But still, despite that, we saw just a -- in the last few hours that there were several dozen migrants still sleeping on the grounds around the bus stations here in downtown El Paso.There's several reasons for that and a lot of it has to do with -- a lot of times the migrants have been very weary of leaving the bus areas, especially if they're with family units because they've been separated and people get released from border patrol at different times. So these bus stations have really become kind of a congregating point and a reunification point for a lot of these families. But the city officials here still very concerned about the possibility of Title 42 being lifted and the anticipation of thousands more migrants arriving here in El Paso. City officials say that the humanitarian efforts are ramping up, but that it is really not sustainable for a long period of time. We were at the border wall yesterday. You talk there in the lead in about the governor of Texas describing the National Guard efforts and the razor wire which is about a mile long there along the border as a blockade. I can tell you that it is far from being anything like a blockade. All of the migrants have done now is moved a little bit further down the river and are now lining up at a gate along the border wall, turning themselves in to Border Patrol. And Border Patrol takes them in, about 15 to 20 at a time, and then they begin the process. That does not mean that all of these people coming in are staying. In fact, we know that thousands of migrants have been moved to other parts of the border to be processed. In the last week, just from the El Paso area along, Jim, 3,400 migrants have been expelled from the U.S. under Title 42. So, all of that processing continues in anticipation of Title 42 ending.

And certainly, Jim, 20,000 people plus at the border waiting to come in and coming in is a problem and it's a problem that's got to be solved. But, you know, Title 42, which Ed just reported on, and other fixes like that are band-aids. What we need, Jim, is for Congress to sit down and do the hard work of fixing the immigration system.

So, unfortunately, they're - and I'm just going to call it as I see it, Jim, the Republican Party, for the last decade plus, has blocked creative, intelligence solutions that the American people demand. And I think that's what we've got to get to. You know, all this talk of, you know, we've got serious problems. We've got serious problems at the border.
