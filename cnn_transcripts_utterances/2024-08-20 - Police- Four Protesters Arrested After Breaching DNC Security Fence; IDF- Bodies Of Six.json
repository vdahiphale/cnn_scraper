Clearly, that outer layer was breachable by the demonstrators last night so they're putting up this third layer of fencing here just outside the United Center. But the big question is, is this going to be sufficient. And Sara, this is a -- this is a tough thing for the Secret Service and for the Chicago Police Department considering that was day one and there are more protests scheduled for later this week.

Kate, listen, over the weekend, Israeli officials used this phrase \"cautious optimism.\" But frankly, watching developments closely in the last several days it's hard to see the events, the statements, the progress to justify that description.Hamas released a statement today saying that both Blinken's statements and President Biden's statements last night that you just played included misleading claims and do not reflect the true position of Hamas. We should note that as Sec. Blinken left here in Israel last night to go on to Egypt, he said that OK, Israel has accepted the U.S. bridging proposal. That's fine. That's the U.S. and Israel with their vision of the agreement. But it is not clear -- in fact, it's clear that their vision of the agreement does not line up with Hamas' vision of this agreement to move it forward. And there have been accusations, even in this country, that Israel has added or tightened new conditions on that agreement. For instance, who is going to govern the Philadelphia Corridor? That is the border between Gaza and Egypt, which has been a central sticking point in these negotiations. So Blinken continues his diplomatic effort -- his shuttle diplomacy, but the two sides just do not seem to be speaking the same language of this deal. So hopes that it might get through -- make real progress this week following progress last week in Doha -- it's just hard to see, Kate, the evidence that justifies that hope.",

And though a few months ago, Israel came to believe that one of those six had died. Until yesterday we didn't know for sure that those six were dead. And what that is doing is it is -- it is gradually taking down that number of hostages that would be part of any hostage release-ceasefire agreement. We're down to 109 now. And the fact is that Israeli officials believe that a large portion of those 109 are dead as well. And that's a -- that's a sad fact in this country, right, because you know, Kate, what pain this has caused the family members here.

LOGIS (via Webex by Cisco):  Well, Kate, good morning. Thank you so much for having me. It was -- my life has come a bit full circle. That video aired on the evening in which Sec. Clinton and President Biden both spoke. When I was a MAGA activist and pundit from 2015 to '22 I made some abhorrent comments publicly and privately about Ms. Clinton and President Biden. And I even went on my Twitter account last night and wrote them personal apologies that I hope will get to them. And when I was in the MAGA community I was not just simply a partisan Trump voter. I was a volunteer. I did phone banking. I did -- I wrote, in part -- contributed some of the call script to the Trump campaign. So I was very much into that world. And after the victory in 2016, I got even deeper into it having spoken at Trump groups, sponsored Trump groups. Writing for a number of -- as a freelancer, a number of right-wing articles -- excuse me, right-wing news sites and opinion sites. I professional produced podcasts.

And I was asked to come on the campaign. I didn't hesitate when I was asked because I think that there's a message that perhaps I hope I'm uniquely able to deliver because there were a number of factors that led to my questioning my beliefs. They all happened in the summer of 2021. There was mismanagement of COVID by both Trump and my governor, Ron DeSantis. There was a better understanding of January 6. I started to diversify my news and information sources. I started to get out of that MAGA and right-wing echo chamber and started to realize that there were some beliefs I held that turned out to be wrong. There were other moments, such as when the Republican Party deemed the insurrection legitimate political discourse. And then there was the final straw for me, really, which was the Uvalde, Texas school shootings. So I went through an entire year of personal tumult having to come to this conclusion that I was mistaken about pretty much everything that I believed. And I think it's important that I let viewers know that I take responsibility for everything that I said, all my rhetoric, all of my decisions. And it was on August 30, 2022, when I published a mea culpa in which I stated my remorse for supporting Trump and DeSantis and MAGA. And I wanted to acknowledge that mistake publicly because I was always very public in my support for Trump.",

He's amplified and elevated conspiracies that he almost certainly knows caused avoidable deaths and trauma. And so with those concerns, I've been saying to those who are feeling disenchanted with our political system -- Republicans right now who maybe are not enamored for whatever reason with the Harris-Walz ticket but don't want to vote for Donald Trump -- I think that this is an election that is a referendum on character and trust.

We know that since 2007, the number of births in the U.S. has dropped 17 percent. The general fertility rate has declined to 21 percent. And the reason why this is happening, we know that there has been a shift in our society where women are having babies less often. Some women are waiting until they might be older in age to have children. But also, the teen birth rate has declined significantly. When you look at ages 15 to 19, the teen birth rate has dropped two-thirds since 2007.
