Judge Robert McBurney had a couple lawsuits in front of him, one related to and being brought forward by a Fulton County elections official named Julie Adams, who made news this past spring by refusing to certify the results of the presidential primary.But Judge Robert McBurney sending a clear message that saying that certification under Georgia law is mandatory. And here's what he's saying in part of his ruling saying, quote -- give me one second here to bring that ruling, \"If election officials --\" I'm sorry, \"If election superintendents were, as plaintiff urges, free to play investigator, prosecutor, jury, and judge and so, because of a unilateral determination of error or fraud, refuse to certify election results, Georgia voters would be silenced. Our constitution and our election code do not allow for that to happen.\" This really sends a major blow to conservatives who are trying to broaden their powers. And again, I mentioned that there's another ruling related to certification that is in front of Judge Robert McBurney as it stands right now, related to a reasonable inquiry, which Democrats fear could give powers to a rogue election official to refuse to certify election results. Look, it goes without saying that there is an air of anxiety when it comes to the post-election tabulation process, but that's not really on voters' minds. The ones that we've spoken to today, so far. Polls opened up at 7:00 this morning, and there was already five people in line an hour before the doors open. That line ended up wrapping around this precinct we're in front of. Fulton County was consequential in the 2020 election. We'll see if it has the similar fate here in 2024. John.",

Secretary John Kelly said no. In 2018, he wanted to use the military to shoot migrants, including women and children, crossing the Rio Grande, Secretary Mattis said no. In 2020, he wanted to invoke the Insurrection Act to use federal troops against protesters during the George Floyd demonstration, and Secretary Esper said no. And on January 6th, part of the plan was, again, to invoke the Insurrection Act to use federal troops if protests broke out after Mike Pence refused to certify the election, luckily, Vice President Pence did the right thing. So, it was very close thing last time around, but you won't have people, I think, the quality of John Kelly and General Mattis and Vice President Pence around.",

But look, those of us who lived Donald Trump firsthand, who were in these meetings, when he was suggesting shooting migrants, shooting Americans, I'll tell you, I walked those grounds outside the White House the day that Donald Trump suggested we shoot protesters and Americans. And I had friends there in that square with their families. They were peacefully protesting and using their exercising their right to free speech. And so, I was there for some of the most horrifying conversations.When Donald Trump is talking about these enemies from within internally here and using the military against them, he's really talking about Democrats per se, we can say that he is what he's really talking about is anyone who actually presents an existential threat against him, whether it's the media, whether it's Americans, whether it's protesters, it's really just authoritarian tendencies. And honestly, the reason that so many of us are alarmed by this national security is when a lot of these people are no longer in the room, he will go to his worst instincts should he get elected again and he will incite the type of violence that we've seen, whether it came to January 6th or whether, you know, someone like in 2018. I worked on the case where the person was sending the pipe bombs to media entities, to Democratic leaders. It leads to actual real-world consequences when Donald Trump says these things, and that is what makes him so dangerous.",

You need to stop them talking to the American media and to, I think, the American people.You worked for another general under John Kelly when he was DHS secretary, and he has told his own troubling stories about Donald Trump. Why do you think comments from top people like Milley, Kelly, Defense Secretary Mark Esper, and so on and so forth, that don't seem to have more impact, given where the polling stands, and I just looked at it, that Donald Trump still leads when it comes to the American people when they're asked, who do you trust to handle national security?",

I'm curiously what -- curious what you are hearing from black men on what their feelings are on that.JUSTIN CARTER, HOST/INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER, THE SHADE ROOM AND HOST, THE SHADE ROOM'S \"TSR INVESTIGATES\":  Sara, it's so good to see you and join you. Been watching you for years. Thank you for having me. Yes. You know, this hit close to home to me, Sara, too, because I am an alumni of the University of Pittsburgh. So, my eyes and ears were open when he did say those things. And I'm really challenging black men to think about that and think about a woman being president. And it did not land as well as he thought it was going to. And it kind of stirred the pot and ruffled a few feathers when it came to just, you know, people on the internet saying that, you know, why are you lecturing to black men. You know, black men, they have a seat at the table. You don't have to spoon feed them into leaning one way or another. So, that was just a very interesting perspective. And, you know, a former Ohio senator, she went on on Twitter as well to express those sentiments as well. So, yes, the bottom line is, you know, I go to these barbershops, I have family members, you know, I was raised by black men, and yes, we do have a seat at the table. We do have a strong seat at the table. And really, at the end of the day, there is some truth in that, you know, we do not have to be lectured.
