Good morning to all of you. Thank you so much for being here. Isaac, I want to start with you on President Biden, and you know, let's really kind of drill into the imperative around a ceasefire for him and his administration. Because this, of course, has been something that has rippled across campuses in this country. It has really divided the Democratic Party. And this is something the White House was grappling with all day yesterday as they tried to figure out exactly what was going on among the parties here. What's your understanding of how the White House is viewing where negotiations stand right now and the ways in which they are trying to get a ceasefire here, as frankly, the political imperatives ratchet up on him.",

And that they're also dealing with maybe a situation where they don't have a completely honest relationship coming from Benjamin Netanyahu. And how Biden, who is -- from the beginning has said he is not looking at the politics of this. He is looking at this as how to get to a long-term solution on the immediate thing here. And in his mind, hopes for something bigger. It is how he's approaching this. But look, the politics are there. And it is something that is not showing up as something, so far, that is as big of an issue for voters as some of the coverage of it has been.

Prosecutors have to establish that these payments were fault -- or records were falsified to cover up this to (ph) the campaign. They also yesterday provided all the evidence or some evidence with respect to how the payments were actually made and recorded in the system. So evidence in varying forms is there. The question now is tying it together and to what extent was Donald Trump aware of this entire, quote, unquote, \"scheme,\" at least as alleged by prosecutors. As a matter of common sense, perhaps, we can say, yes, it looks like he probably was aware. The Trump Organization was run like a small family business. One of the witnesses says -- said that. So it defies reason to say that he didn't know that these payments are being made. But defying reason and being able to convict are two very different things.
