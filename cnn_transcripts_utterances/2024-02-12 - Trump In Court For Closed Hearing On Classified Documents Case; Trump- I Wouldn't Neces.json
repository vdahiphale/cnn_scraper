This says the GOP frontrunner faces criticism on both sides of the Atlantic for threatening to throw NATO allies to the wolves.Plus, a Kennedy family feud. RFK Jr. is apologizing to his estranged relatives for a Super Bowl spot that copies a famous 1960 campaign ad from his uncle, John F. Kennedy. Apologizing even though it's still pinned to the top of his social media feed. And George Santos 2.0. That's how the Democrat trying to replace the disgraced former congressman is describing his Republican opponent now and especial election critical to the House GOP is already narrow majority. I spoke to both candidates on the ballot in New York's 3rd District. Those interviews are coming up. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. We start in Florida where Donald Trump is at a closed-door hearing for his classified documents case. The issue, whether Trump's team can get access to highly classified evidence as the clock ticks down to a potential trial date. CNN's Evan Perez is there. Evan, give our viewers a sense of what the significance is of this particular day in court for Donald Trump?",

Right now, that trial is set for May, but it is unclear whether that date holds. Right now, what the Trump -- Mr. -- the former president and his lawyers are doing is meeting with the judge, discussing some of the documents that are at issue. In some cases, the Special Counsel Jack Smith is arguing that they should not be allowed to see the documents themselves. They should be able to see only summaries of some of those documents. Also looking for some of the access to some of those documents is the defendant Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira, the codefendants of the former president.Again, this is a hearing that has been going on for about three hours. We expect that the former president is going to be in there for another hour or so before the special counsel, the government get their turn to meet with the judge and make their arguments for continuing to restrict the access of some of these documents. Again, we're talking about some of the most classified highly sensitive documents. In some cases, they're only able to look at them in a special room that's designed for classified documents here in the courthouse behind me, Dana?",

It was supposed to start in early March. But you know, if the former president files as we expect, he will in the next few hours.

He told this story about a warning he says he gave to an American ally in Europe about NATO nations who don't spend enough on defense.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: One of the presidents of a big country stood up said, well sir, if we don't pay and we're attacked by Russia, will you protect us? I said you didn't pay your delinquent. He said, yes. Let's say that happened. No, I would not protect you. In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want. (END VIDEO CLIP) [12:05:00] BASH: My panel joins me now CNN's David Chalian, Seung Min Kim of the Associated Press and CNN's Jim Sciutto, who is the author of the upcoming book The Return of Great Powers: Russia, China, and the Next World War. I do not know. Do you just not sleep? So, I want to talk about the domestic politics, of course. But let's start with you and the geopolitics. And I want to read something that Peter Baker wrote in the New York Times. The scorn for NATO that Mr. Trump expresses is based on a false premise that he is repeated for years even after being corrected, a sign that he is either incapable of processing information that conflicts with an idea fixed in his head. Or willing to distort facts to suit his preferred dispute, rather his preferred narrative. What are you hearing from sources globally about the impact of this?",

As do his own former senior advisors, the idea that this is just sort of the national security equivalent of locker room talk is not based in reality because he has a record as president. And while he was president, he undermined NATO.In 2018 at the NATO Summit, he nearly took the U.S. out of NATO. He reduced the U.S. force presence in Germany, kind of as a broadside to NATO is one of his last acts as commander in chief. And made other public pronouncements which do undermine confidence of allies and adversaries in U.S. mutual defense agreements and not just as relate to NATO, but even to South Korea, and Japan and Taiwan. So, the idea that offense you heard from someone like a Senator Marco Rubio, that this is just talk belies his actual actions as president. And when you speak to his advisers about what's to come in a potential second Trump term as they believe he would take even more concrete action up to and including formally withdrawing from NATO.",

MARCO RUBIO (R-FL): Donald Trump was president, and he didn't pull us out of NATO. In fact, American troops are stationed throughout Europe. He's not the first American president. In fact, virtually every American president at some point in some way has complained about other countries in NATO not doing enough. You know, Trump's just the first one to express it in these terms.

So that's critical context for him just writing off what Trump said. DAVID CHALIAN, CNN, POLITICAL DIRECTORAnd yet, it can also be perhaps not locker room talk. But it is classic Donald Trump. In fact, I don't know what new we learned in Trump's comments this weekend. His threat to pull out of NATO, he's constantly admonishing some of our closest allies, that they're not doing enough to lift up their end of the bargain. As you noted through his presidency, this was a hallmark of his and it is not the first time he does this on the campaign trail. So, I look at this to sort of say Donald Trump offers a classic kind of like -- bit of his thinking that is designed to express to get outrage expressed by his opponents, by people in the press that then he feeds off of that outrage to court support from his base of support.",

I will never forget what he said about John McCain. I don't think any of us will. And I think that -- it is just a constant fixture of him that again doesn't surprise us anymore. But that isn't any less shocking at this point. And also, her point our NATO. I'm just kind of going back to our discussion with what Senator Rubio said it's just this. There was a time when there was -- it was always kind of small but there was a vocal segment of Republican particularly elected officials, who had been able to speak out forcefully against Trump, whether it's on his actions on his words But -- that particularly on Capitol Hill, particularly in elected office is diminishing.

He said electoral politics was never supposed to be a career, and trust me, Congress has no place to grow old. And he goes on from there.He voted against his party this past week, against impeaching Mayorkas, the homeland security secretary. And so, it's not as if he hasn't been supportive of Donald Trump.

And we should point out he's only on the ballot in the state of Utah so far, that could certainly hurt President Biden's reelection chances.
