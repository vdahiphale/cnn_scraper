This all unfolded on Wednesday in the capital, La Paz, where troops surrounded government buildings and armored vehicles were seen trying to break down the doors of the presidential palace.(VIDEO PLAYING) But military police pulled back just a few hours later, pulled them back after the newly appointed head of the army ordered them to leave. The accused architect of the coup, Juan Jose Zuniga, had lost his job on Tuesday for reportedly threatening to block a presidential bid by former Bolivian President Evo Morales. Before his arrest, Zuniga claimed the people have no future, and it's the army that's looking out for their well-being. President Luis Arce called on Bolivians to organize and mobilize in defense of democracy. (VIDEO PLAYING) Crowds flooded into La Paz's main square in support of the government and to demonstrate against the attempted coup. CNN's Julia Vargas -- Vargas-Jones rather, is covering this for us from Los Angeles. It was a spectacular failure, wasn't it? What do you understand happened here?",

What happens here is that basically the president just shoos him away, and that's remarkable.

Behind it all is his bid for coming back to power. It's not even re-election.He's been out of the government for about five years. He's served the three terms already. According to Bolivian constitution, he shouldn't have served a third one. He was allowed to because of a technicality, basically, that legislation wasn't in place when he served his third term. But now he's asking for another one. He said he wanted to run, but Arce is his hand-picked candidate. In 2020, after Bolivia went through all of that turmoil, Arce was the person that Morales chose to be in power. And this move, saying that he wants to go back into power, is seen as challenging his very own successor, which, of course, he has had his set of challenges. Bolivia has been going through a rough time economically. They've had reduced energy production, inflation prices have skyrocketed, and that has generated some dissatisfaction from the Bolivian people. But you have to remember, he is a towering figure. He's got so much political power. Evo Morales, it's difficult to go against him. He, of course, lifted so many Bolivians out of poverty. But in 2016, Bolivia said very clearly through a referendum that they would not allow him to come back into power, Max.",

It would be a win for the Biden administration if it stands. Two years ago, a draft of the high court's opinion overturning Roe v.

Joe Biden and Donald Trump will face off at CNN's world headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia tonight. The 90-minute debate is the first ever between the current and former president. It's also the first to include a convicted felon. The economy, immigration, abortion and democracy all expected to feature prominently in the debate. Georgia is a key swing state in this election. On Wednesday, Trump made a surprise call to the Black American Business Leaders Roundtable in the state, an event hosted by his campaign. He told attendees that his mugshot taken when he was processed at the Fulton County Jail last summer was helping with his appeal to Black and Latino voters. Take a listen. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The mugshot is the best. Since it happened, the support among the Black community and the Hispanic community has skyrocketed. It's been amazing. (END AUDIO CLIP)",

They are condemning the proceedings as a sham and a performance. The U.S. is also accusing Moscow treating Gershkovich and other detained Americans as bargaining chips, CNN's Matthew Chance reports.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN CHIEF GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This is the first glimpse of Evan Gershkovich for months. Cameras briefly allowed into the courthouse about 1,000 miles from Moscow where his trial for espionage is finally underway. His head shaved, the 32-year-old \"Wall Street Journal\" reporter looked calm. But he faces a sentence of up to 20 years if or likely when he's found guilty. In a statement, the editor-in-chief of the journal wrote, this bogus accusation of espionage will inevitably lead to a bogus conviction for an innocent man. For nearly 15 months, Gershkovich has been held under tight security in Moscow's notorious Lefortovo prison. He, his employer and the U.S. government all vigorously deny the spying allegations against him. But Russia appears determined to press ahead despite official U.S. objections. A new statement from the U.S. embassy in Moscow says Evan did not commit any illegal acts and should not have been arrested at all. This trial isn't about the presentation of evidence, due process or the rule of law. We're talking about the Kremlin using American citizens to achieve its political goals, the statement adds. With the conflict raging in Ukraine, Russia began a crackdown at home on free speech, silencing dissidents or forcing them into exile. It's against this backdrop that Gershkovich was arrested on a reporting assignment in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg. This is video from the website of the tank factory there, where Russian prosecutors allege Gershkovich acted, quote, \"on the instructions of the CIA to collect secret information, although no evidence has been made public.\" The trial will take place in the city, which is about a thousand miles from Moscow, amid an outcry.",
