Now, that's not cheap, but it is a three-year low for this time of the year. Not because of low demand. Look at this. A record of nearly 61 million people are projected to be from the road this holiday weekend according to AAA. Hopefully not all of them in New Jersey, where I'll be driving my little ones around. But some contexts, this is 5 percent more than last summer, 10 percent more than the final summer before Covid. This is a look at the projected gas prices, $3.49 from Gas Buddy, down a penny from a year ago. But look at this, so much cheaper than two years ago. Of course, that was the summer when oil prices went to the moon because Russia had invaded Ukraine. Thankfully, they've come down since then. And some drivers, in some states, are actually seeing even bigger drops from a year ago. We're looking at a drop in Washington state of 71 cents from last Fourth of July, 60 cents in Oregon, 41 cents in Wyoming, 44 cents in Utah. So, this is real savings. And what's interesting, John, is, if you were to adjust for inflation, and I know that people are not filling up adjusting for inflation. But if you were to, gas prices nationally, they're actually right where they were back in July of 2018, which I think is pretty surprising when you think about it. One thing we do need to keep an eye on when it comes to gas prices is hurricane season. Hurricane Beryl has already lifted oil prices a bit. It's raised some concerns about a busier than usual hurricane season. And that, of course, could lift gas prices. But for now, the good news is that gas prices are at a three-year low for this time of year.",

And they're going to bring it back up, because now they know, and they're - they're the ones that started the little saying, we're going to get rid of all the Republican women in the Senate because they started this. They wouldn't let us get what we wanted last year. We're taking them out.So - and they did a really good job. I mean, you know, they took us out and, you know, I hope they're happy because now so many other things won't get done. You know, everybody wants to say that this abortion bill was, you know, we - we took them out. They - we'll get what we want, but they're not going to get so many other things now. And they will bring abortion up. And what they want is not just, you know, abortion with no exceptions, they want zero abortions at conception with no exceptions. There's a bill in the South Carolina House that says with no exceptions. And if you have an abortion, you know, for the life of the mother, you know, if the mother has the abortion, she could face the death penalty. I mean - because she had an abortion to save her life. The doctor can lose his license if he performs an abortion. He could face criminal penalties. It's gone mad. I mean people can't have their own health care. And one of the things that I said while I stood there, you know, last year, before - you know, before we got recognized, which caused another hoopla, but I said that women should make these decisions with their family. You know, if they're religious, they should talk to their god. They should talk to their family. But surely they should talk to their doctor. Their doctor should be the one helping to make these decisions, not 46 members of the South Carolina legislature in which there is no doctor. The closest thing we had to a doctor was a pharmacist.

Triple-digit, these heat domes, that really pray on older folks and older structures. That's why he is more deadly than all the other disastrous combined. If you're in the Atlantic, where there are underwater heatwaves in addition, that's hurricane food fueling Beryl and creating that rapid intensification for places like Jamaica that haven't seen this. This is not their grandfather's storm anymore, right? And the infrastructure in places in the Caribbean especially not up for the task in places like this. And then there's wildfires in dry, arid conditions out west and even in Butte County, which is the site of the Camp Fire, the deadliest in the lower 48. It's just dry. It's tinder dry. And one lightning strike or one errant cigarette butt can start a wildfire there. So, it depends on where you are.
