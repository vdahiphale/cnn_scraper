      "sentences": "Yes, Christine. Well, if you look at the numbers, yes, Netanyahu's bloc has far more seats -- 65 seats -- than, really, the opinion polls were expecting. But Benjamin Netanyahu's own Likud party is still at around 32 seats, which is about where they were before.The big difference this time around is the rise of the far-right parties. There's a far-right group of parties called Religious Zionism/Jewish Power. They are set to have 14 seats in the next Parliament. That would make them the third-largest party in the Israeli Parliament. This is something that would have been seen as astonishing even a year or two ago when these people were considered the far-right fringe of Israeli politics. One of their leaders is named Itamar Ben-Gvir. He's a name we will likely hear a lot more of in the coming days, weeks, and months. He was once convicted of inciting racism. From the Israeli Parliament, he yelled at an Arab Israeli member of Parliament, saying that he didn't belong there. That he should be a member of Parliament in Syria. This is somebody who, just a year ago, Benjamin Netanyahu himself dismissed the idea of this person being a minister in the government. Now, it appears as though it's not a question of whether he will be a minister but which position of power he will have. And he has been gunning for the position of public security. That would put him in charge of police. And this is somebody who once pulled his gun in an east Jerusalem neighborhood, calling on police to shoot at stone throwers. This is obviously -- would be a very -- for some people, would be seen as a dangerous position for him to have. And this is also affecting Israel's positions, potentially, with its allies around the world when you have such a far-right politician. A State Department spokesperson, Ned Price, was asked about this yesterday and he said that while they're still waiting to see the full results, that these all -- that they hope that all Israeli government officials will continue to share the values of an open democratic society, including tolerance and respect for all in civil society, particularly for minority groups, Christine.",

That's how many times the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates this year -- a fourth-straight hike of three-quarters of a percentage point just yesterday. It's part of the Fed's aggressive battle to bring down the white-hot inflation that is plaguing the American economy.Let's take a look at markets around the world this morning. You can see Asian shares have closed down a little bit. Hong Kong down three percent. Europe has opened lower here. European stocks lower as we await the Bank of England's decision on interest rate hikes in the U.K. The forecast is for the central bank to raise rates by 75 basis points -- its largest hike in more than 30 years. On Wall Street, stock index futures also leaning down a little bit. Yesterday, a wild day. Stocks first rallied and then dropped after the Fed raised interest rates. Investors were spooked at the possibility of future hikes and recession fears. Gas prices this morning up a penny, now sitting at $3.78 a gallon. Important data today on weekly jobless claims and mortgage rates later this morning. And the big October jobs report is, of course, Friday. Let's bring in Nela Richardson, chief economist at ADP.

Even by the Fed's alternative measures that it prefers, we have a ways to go, Christine.So, the fact that the Fed has promised to go the distance, I read as good news on inflation.

So even if they moderate the pace of the increases they still have to go the distance. They still have to cover the field. And so, this might be a longer episode of rate hikes, even if it's smaller in duration. The good news is it's easier for the Fed to control the effects of its policy when they go slower than when they go faster.
