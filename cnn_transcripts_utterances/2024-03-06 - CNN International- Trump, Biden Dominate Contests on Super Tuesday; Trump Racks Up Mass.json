Now, these voters in the view of Biden campaign officials are the so- called gettable or turned off by Donald Trump voters. And that second description is so important because Biden campaign officials don't think that Donald Trump has done himself any favors by continuing to use divisive and corrosive rhetoric. And as you know, from our recent reporting, the president himself has very much directed his campaign aides to be even more aggressive in highlighting some of the more unhinged and erratic comments from Donald Trump. Now, I should also note it goes without saying that this is really the beginning of the official start of the general election for the Biden campaign.

Look, it is hard to be optimistic about the state of affairs right now, considering that one of the parties of this conflict is not even in the room for these talks taking place in Cairo right now. The Israelis declined to send a delegation because they said that Hamas had not responded to two of its latest demands. One being providing a list of hostages who are dead and hostages who are currently alive, and also confirmation of an agreement on the hostage-to-prisoner exchange ratio that would happen in any potential deal.Hamas says that Israel hasn't engaged with its core demands, which is that any ceasefire needs to be permanent, that there needs to be a complete withdrawal, and that people displaced from the northern part of Gaza should be able to return. All things that, frankly, fly in the face of recent Israeli statements on this issue. They continue to insist that, look, any pause in the fighting is going to be temporary. The war will continue afterwards until Hamas is completely destroyed. And there are even problems with the American proposal being floated, something that the White House says that the Israelis have basically agreed to, which would involve a six-week ceasefire in exchange for vulnerable hostages being released, women, children -- or sorry, women, elderly people, injured and sick people. But Hamas hasn't been engaging on what the actual definition of a vulnerable person in that kind of a deal might actually be. And obviously, they want to see a permanent ceasefire, not a temporary one. So that's the state of affairs right now.

Henry has not been seen in public since last week when he visited Kenya to sign an agreement on a mission intended to help Haiti's police beat back the gangs.But around the same time that deal was signed, the same gangs launched a wave of coordinated attacks on capital city Port-au-Prince. And according to the leader of one gang coalition, Jimmy Cherizier, who goes by the name Barbecue, the attacks are intended to overthrow Henry's government. The attacks have targeted state institutions, the gangs have burned down police stations and broken into two prisons, releasing thousands of prisoners. And they've also targeted the airport, where it seems they're waiting for Henry's return. Security sources say the level of coordination between previously warring gangs is unprecedented. This time they're using each other's territories to launch attacks, for example. And amid the chaos, Haiti's government has declared a state of emergency. The neighboring Dominican Republic has stopped all flights connecting to Haiti. Meanwhile, the civilian toll is rising. The United Nations says thousands of people have been forced to flee their homes, and that adds to the over 300,000 who had already been displaced by gang violence before this escalation.

I'm aboard this Philippines Coast Guard ship that was part of a convoy of four vessels that were headed towards a place called the Second Thomas Shoal. And before dawn, all of a sudden, these Philippine ships were swarmed by much larger and many more Chinese ships. There are more off to our port bow. These are not marked like the Chinese Coast Guard ships, but they're clearly operating with them and operating in very close proximity to this Philippines Coast Guard ship. In fact, I've seen them in the past cutting this off. And what they've succeeded in doing is not only pretty much stopping our ship in its tracks, but it has separated this ship from the other boats in the Philippines convoy, which included two small resupply vessels that were trying to get to the Second Thomas Shoal. Now, part of what is at play here is a territorial dispute. That shoal, the Philippines claims, is part of its economic exclusion zone. China, though it is much further geographically from this area, claims it for itself and clearly tries to stop Philippine ships from getting to it. We're completely encircled by a fleet of Chinese ships, at least 14 that I've counted. And moments ago, the Chinese Coast Guard ships were blasting a Philippines resupply vessel with water cannons. It is clearly, by swarming this ship, a show of force and a show of intimidation.

It's absolutely fascinating to see how it's all playing out there. Because this is of global importance, Ivan.WATSON (on camera): It sure is. And it illustrates just how China historically has refused to recognize the claims of smaller countries here in the South China Sea, like the Philippines. And has been able to use its vast resources, as the world's second largest economy, to do things like simply build man-made islands on some of these contested shoals. The Philippines, which does not nearly have the kind of resources that China has, has had to respond with a really improvisational strategy. What they did was ground a World War II era ship on this specific contested shoal, the Second Thomas Shoal. And that's where they're keeping a group of Filipino Marines to try to not give up that piece of maritime territory to China. So what we saw here were the Philippine ships trying to run this much larger Chinese gauntlet and only succeeding halfway. Only one of their boats got through. We also saw just the sheer, China boasts the world's largest navy. And it can put them to use to try to stop a smaller power like the Philippines. Beijing has since come out and accused the Philippines of being dishonest, of deliberately stirring up trouble, of maliciously inciting and sensationalizing events. Meanwhile, a top security official here in the Philippines has responded and said defiantly, quote: If it is the hope of China to weaken Philippine resolve, they will be sorely disappointed because we will never be deterred from exercising our legal rights. And I might point out, Max, that within the last 10 years, an international court of arbitration ruled in favor of the Philippines and its claims to these contested shoals. [04:25:00] China has responded to that historic resolution, that decision declaring the court and its decision null and void. And we'll just have to see in the coming weeks and months if this will continue. It is very dangerous, I might say, having been on board one of these ships and seeing these huge ships kind of playing chicken with each other.
