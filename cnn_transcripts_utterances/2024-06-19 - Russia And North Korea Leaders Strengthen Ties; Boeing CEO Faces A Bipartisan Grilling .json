He described it as psychological warfare. And not only that, he said, we have long hours of footage of Haifa, outside Haifa, and beyond Haifa. So, what we're seeing, if one is to take him at his word, is just a very small part of that. And it really indicates its abilities. Now, what we've seen since October is that Hezbollah on the border with Israel has been on an almost daily basis targeting Israel's surveillance and observation positions on the border. So, it's perfectly plausible, given that they've done that, that they can get a drone across the border and have it spend, in the words of Nasrallah, hours collecting this video footage, which it is put out for the public to see.

They would say, look, give us all of your nuclear technology, teach us how to launch rockets better so that we can have a better nuclear ballistic deterrence. Failing that, give us the technology and then failing that on down the line. I mean, North Korea is one of the poorest countries in the world, so they'll take pretty much anything from Russia, food, fuel, the rest of it. So, we do have to keep a very close eye on that. The Kremlin, of course, has said, no, they would never do that. But whenever the Kremlin says, no, we would never do that, like when they say, no, we would never invade Ukraine, it's worth watching very carefully. I think the other thing that's concerning is that it's clear, given the warming of these bilateral ties, that the North Koreans are going to continue to provide weapons to Russia, who will then turn around and use them in Ukraine. So, that's always something that has to be balanced. But you know, somebody who's got to do a lot of the balancing here are the Chinese. The Chinese have much bigger, they have a lot more to lose.

And of course, inaddition, you'll recall that when the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un visited Russia, one of the places that they visited was a space launch facility. So, there's some beginnings of some messaging. It's unclear as to whether or not that's just sort of setting the stage for something that's going to happen or whether or not that's a geopolitical signal that's being sent to Western democracies saying, hey, don't mess with us because we're in the process of working with North Korea on launch technology. That said, the South Koreans, I think, also have something to say about this because the South Koreans have not yet sent weapons to Ukraine, but they have told both Russia and North Korea, if you take actions that are going to be threatening to South Korea, that could change and they could begin using their pretty substantial military technology to get that stuff on the plane to Ukraine.

And NVIDIA has positioned itself as the company that's making the picks and the shovels for this gold rush, right? Now it's all about artificial intelligence. NVIDIA's computer chips, they power chat GPT and all of these other A.I. models. So, they really have become the brains here. They are fueling this boom and it's paying off in spades. I mean, the share price has had this meteoric rise. It's up something like 300 times over the last 10 years. They had to do a 10 for one stock split because the share price had just become too expensive. And now, we have a situation where NVIDIA has gotten past Amazon and Alphabet and even Microsoft and Apple to become not just the biggest company in the United States, but the biggest, most valuable company on the planet. It's worth almost twice as much as the biggest foreign competitor, Saudi Arabia's oil giant, Aramco. And when you put this market cap into context, right, $3.3 trillion, that is more than the entire GDP of some major countries, including France, Brazil, Italy, Russia, and Canada. So, one company is worth more than all of those, any of those economies. It's absolutely amazing. Now, if anything, though, one of the questions now is, has NVIDIA gotten almost too big, right? Because now, it is just accounting for so much of the overall stock market. And the whole stock market is exposed when and if sentiment shifts around A.I., right? Like what if investors suddenly become concerned about profitability in this space? What if there's some thinking that maybe these companies have gotten overvalued? You could have a scenario where an NVIDIA sell-off tanks the whole stock market. But for now, clearly the times are rolling. Investors are really focused on this boom. A veteran tech analyst, Dan Ives, he tweeted that it's just 9 P.M. in the A.I. party, and he says that this party is going to keep going till 4 A.M. So, clearly, there's a lot of euphoric sentiment right now about this company. It's incredible.",
