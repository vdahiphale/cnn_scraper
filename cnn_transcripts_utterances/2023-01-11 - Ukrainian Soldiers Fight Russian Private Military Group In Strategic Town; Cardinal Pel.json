Ukrainian officials though, insist the fight goes on. But one Ukrainian soldier has told CNN it's only a matter of time before the town falls to Russian control. He says the death toll is so high they've now stopped counting the number of dead. Soledar is in the Donetsk region, home to the largest salt mine in Europe, with a vast network of cabinet's underground tunnels. Notably not far from the strategic city of Bakhmut, which has been under siege by Russian forces for weeks. In his nightly address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy praised Ukrainian soldiers who are reportedly fighting house to house in defense of someday. He called on the world to help. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): Thanks to the resilience of our soldiers there in Soledar, we want additional time and additional strength for Ukraine. What did Russia want to win there? Everything is completely destroyed. There is almost no life left and thousands of other people are lost. The whole land near Soledar is covered with the corpses of the invaders and scarred from the blows. This is what madness looks like. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

This small town is now the scene of some of the fiercest fighting in this 11- month war. Video filmed by one soldier on the front line shows the house to house style fighting troops are now locked into. The tank is working. Did you hear? The Ukrainian fighter says. The streets of Soledar littered with debris as Wagner fighters battle for control of this strategic town. This part of the war's front line is dominated by the private military group. Wagner had Yevgeny Prigozhin even praising the bravery of the Ukrainian forces he is trying to defeat, admitting Sunday that his men were exclusively working to capture the town and the mines underneath Soledar and Bakhmut. The town's walls are almost entirely demolished according to Ukrainian officials. Soledar, though small in size, is strategically important to the ultimate capture of Bakhmut, a way of surrounding the city from the north and disrupting Ukrainian communication lines.

      "sentences": "Yes. From the Russian perspective, what you're looking at is a possible path for the Russians to surround Bakhmut. So Soledar is northeast of Bakhmut, and it has those cavernous salt mines that you spoke about.What that will allow the Russians to do is store their weaponry, store troops, war material of various types, and then use that as a way to push forward into an area that would allow for them, if they capture it, to potentially maneuver and encircle the town of Bakhmut. And then you have to, of course, as you asked, why Bakhmut? The key thing there is that this opens up the whole area from the Russian perspective of the Donetsk Oblast to the Donetsk region. And if they capture the part of the Donetsk area, this would give the Russians even more territory that they would control and potentially could open the door from, they believe, to control the rest of that particular region. If they do that, then that gives them a bit of a victory. It may be a Pyrrhic victory, but it would give them at least bragging rights for a few months, perhaps. VAUSE: Britain's Defense Ministry believes the Russians are most likely in control of Soledar already adding this part of the fighting is focused on the entrances to the 200-kilometer long disused salt line tunnels which run underneath the district. Both sides likely concerned that they could be used as for infiltration behind their lines. So, controlling those tunnels was important enough for Russia to commit a large number of mercenaries to this fight alongside regular Russian soldiers. Specifically, what advantages do these tunnels will give the Russians now? What can they do with this?",

This would allow them to come in and move in areas where they haven't been able to do so, where they've been blocked from the entrances to Soledar, and it also would have prevented them from moving forward in that particular way.But John, what you're looking at here is a classic urban type campaign, although it's done in areas very complex, like a mine and other areas like that. So this is what they're dealing with. The Russians are thinking that this is one way that they can ensure their victory in this way.",

But his tenure at the Vatican was cut short in 2018 when he faced trial on charges of sexual abuse of two choir boys during the 1990s.

Cardinal George Pell was a very powerful man. He was Australia's most powerful Catholic. He was also the most senior Catholic official to be convicted of child sex abuse before he was later acquitted in 2020.Inside the Catholic Church, upon news of his death, there have been expressions of shock and sadness, but many others have shared a very different response. For example, this from Claire Leaney. She is the CEO of the In Good Faith Foundation. This is an advocacy group for survivors. In a statement, she says this quote, for many survivors of clerical abuse, particularly here in Australia, George Pell was a symbol of a system that repeatedly put the interests of the Catholic Church above the interest and safety of individuals, unquote. On the coming days, we know a memorial service to remember Cardinal Pell will be held in the Vatican, followed by a service at St. Mary's Cathedral in Sydney, where he will be buried. A man, a powerful man with a tarnished legacy. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LU STOUT (voiceover): Cardinal George Pell, Australia's highest ranking Catholic has died, age 81. He entered the clergy in 1966 and went on to serve as Archbishop of Melbourne and later Sydney. While an archbishop, Pell set up the Melbourne Response, which included payouts for survivors of clerical sex abuse within the archdiocese. It became one of the earliest responses to address sex abuse accusations in the Church, but critics say it was geared to prevent scandal and could have been more generous to victims. In 2003, Pell was ordained as a cardinal by Pope John Paul II and rose to become Vatican treasurer, widely considered the third most powerful spot in the Vatican. Italian newspapers referred to him as a bull in a China shop for his forthright manner when dealing with financial reform. But Pell was credited for his attempts to make the Church's bookkeeping more transparent. In 2014, Pell was called back to Australia to appear before a royal commission into institutional responses to sexual abuse in the country. The Commission found that Pell had known about sex abuse in the church, but not reported it to police. In 2018, Pell himself faced court on five counts of historical child sex abuse.",

There's that atmospheric river, one area of low pressure pushing in that moisture along North American's west coastline. What is an atmospheric river? What's an AR? Well, these areas of low pressure come off of Southeast Asia. The jet stream picks them up and pushes all of that subtropical moisture right up over top of the Pacific Northwest and into California.

El Nino is the opposite. You get slightly warmer upwelling in the southeast Pacific. You get warmer temperatures. And most of the warm, very warm temperatures we see are associated with La Nina. This year, according to the figures just released by Copernicus, shows that it was the fifth warmest year on record even though we had an La Nina.
