As the doctor said, they were expecting up to 12. What does that means in lay person's terms? Depending on their expectation, they would have locked down the hospital. It means you wouldn't have a change of shift. It means E.R. areas or rooms are prepared for, you know, 10, 12, 14 people to come in as you would lock down from visitors in this case. Since it's a smaller number, only four of the families have probably been identified. That's sort of what our protocols now are requiring that these places. Now as the doctor said, it has been released and they are back to standard operating procedures because you simply didn't have the kind of violence they worried about when they got the first call. And that's how it works. I mean, I talk to you seemingly every day so matter of fact about it. It's just this is the nature of a country that had to get response protocols professionalized across every business, hospital, school, university, you name it. We have to do it now.",

This is a bustling city.Buildings with restaurants that certainly our co-workers have gone to for lunch or for dinner. I want to go to State Senator Josh McLaurin. He's joining us on the phone. He's actually sheltering in place in a restaurant. State Senator, if you could just speak to us a little bit about how that unfolded as you were there just having lunch in the area. STATE SEN. JOSH MCLAURIN (D-GEORGIA) (via telephone): Hi, thanks. Good to be with you. We're still here in the restaurant. It's directly next door to the Northside facility on West Peach Tree. What happened for me is I was eating lunch with a friend catching up and, all of a sudden, people were walking around saying we're locked down, hey, there's an active shooter next door. We didn't really get much information on the ground then. But we started checking news outlets and Twitter to find out what was happening and we got more information. But, yes, we have been here for over an hour. There was a big police presence outside. There were more earlier, fire trucks and we saw SWAT teams running by. There are still some walking by this that I can see now. The area is still secure. But, yes, a lot of uncertainty. And I have friends who have spouses that work in the building. I know there's a day care facility nearby. It's amazing to think of the tens of thousands of people affected by this and whose lives have been put on hold unexpectedly.",

You understand it's still happening live.We're told not only do they have the suspect's driver's license. So there's going to be a better picture that might come out pretty soon of his face. So, we're hope fog get that clear and put out to the public so he won't be able to change, probably his beard at this point or what his actual characteristics look like. Even though it's a great picture of him in the elevator, it's not going to be the same as the images they can put out in a short period of time. Since this time, we've seen almost a softening on certain parts of the perimeter on the outside. Almost more of a defensive stance. You guys were just at the Grady Hospital. They're the only number one trauma center in the area. So they're used to dealing with gunshot victims. And the way they stood that up, because they didn't know how many people were coming at first, it shows how prepared people were in terms of dealing with an active-shooter situation. And now we've heard additional update about the victims and how some of the people are still in critical condition. From there, though, there have been a lot of phone calls not only into the police department but to other buildings in this area about folks they saw that were suspicious. Those phone calls seem to be dropping off now. I actually talked to a supervisor who -- and once the police put out the image. And once the police put out the image, they realized the hoodies didn't match. You understand sort of the fear that's involved in this entire area. Because everybody is looking for a man in a hoodie, which is, quite honestly, on a day like this, there are a lot of people wearing hoodies. As you think about it and there are people sheltering, at these hotels and restaurants, as you heard the state Senator, you can understand how people are concerned just about the general area and their safety. When you have a man running around with a camera bag and a gun who has already shot people, there's concern on where he may be. And that's the point we are right now.",

JOHN MILLER, CNN CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp; INTEL ANALYST: So the military background is obviously concerning because it means he has weapons training, he has tactics training, and that makes him, you know, capable and formidable, depending on how his encounter goes when police find him or catch up to him. That's something they're going to have to be thinking about. He's been trained to shoot, he's been trained to shoot accurately, he's been trained to shoot under pressure.",

Sanjay, as we set up your shot to bring you in here, we were just listening to Dr. Robert Jansen, the chief medical officer there at Grady Hospital. You heard what he said, four victims brought to Grady, three of them critical. We're talking about some very serious injuries here. What did you glean from what you heard? DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, I mean, I can tell you that those are the same numbers that we're hearing. As you know, Brianna, the faculty at Emory University, which covers, provides surgical coverage to Grady. So we heard, like everybody else, that there was a possibility of a mass casualty incident. We're a level one trauma center, which means there's always these surgical subspecialists available in house, operating ready to go, blood is available to all that might need it, all those types of things that make for really, really fast triage and care of trauma patients. But, you know, the numbers, even at the hospital, sometimes we're just getting information as it's coming in. So there's all this prep going in and basically see what sort of unfolds. We knew that there were a couple of patients who went straight to the operating room. As it turns out, just to give you a little bit behind the scenes of a neurosurgeon, I will have awareness. But if there's not patients who require neurosurgical procedures, obviously we're not called in, but our operating room may be put on hold. Because we don't know what's happening. There could be more patients that need to take up that operating room space. He was sort of outlining that. But that is the sort of nature, as Ryan Young was saying, of being not only a number one trauma center but the only one. You know those patients are coming to you and you go into full-on preparatory mode. I can tell you, quickly, the number of patients that we've seen is obviously -- this is a really scary and sad situation. But this number of patients is not unusual at all for Grady to suddenly have an influx of a few, four of five patients, with gunshot wounds. That happens on a typical weekend in Atlanta.",

      "sentences": "Critical, yes. In need of emergent care. It doesn't necessarily mean that someone is unstable.We often talk about serious, critical and then unstable, stable. You can be critical and in stable condition. You need urgent care but your blood pressure is not falling, you're not sort of developing problems with your heart that could put you, you know, in a much more unstable sort of situation. So it's what it sounds like. It's critical. The patient needs to have emergent care. Is probably going to need significant care after an operation or procedure. As you mentioned, Jim, and Dr. Jansen mentioned, two people went to the operating room. Another patient getting what is known as endovascular care. What that means is that a blood vessel has been injured. They don't know what blood vessel. But it's been determined that instead of doing an operation to go and repair that blood vessel directly, you could thread catheters into the area of that blood vessel and essentially seal or stop the bleeding using those sorts of techniques. That's what typically happens in an endovascular situation. And it can be really effective. It can be effective in accomplishing what they're trying to accomplish. Trauma care is A, B, C -- air way, breathing and circulation. Circulation means, you know, stopping bleeding, ensuring you have adequate circulation. And that's where endovascular procedures can help.",

And this new information where there's a vehicle, a carjacking, the vehicle was located, you know, some distance away from the hospital, only signals how complicated this is for law enforcement, right?Because they had an initial area that they were focused on. Now very quickly that suspect may have fled quite a distance away. So law enforcement in another jurisdiction now has to really adjudicate whether or not the vehicle was connected to the shooter. Again, it speaks to the necessity of coordination of law enforcement personnel. One thing I want to highlight that I think is really important is the Atlanta police have a very robust public and private partnership. What we're seeing now is the activation of that relationship actually yield some benefits. It allows for communication across law enforcement entities as well as private stakeholder groups. Those private stakeholder groups are corporate partners, organizations, building managers. It allows for information about this suspect, about the danger, about the threat to be disseminated quickly and effectively so that everyone is aware of what the situation is. More importantly, though, also this public-private partnership also has a video integration center. The Atlanta PD also have access to police cameras but also access to private cameras. That allows for incidents like this to be managed very quickly so that law enforcement has a better viewpoint in how to send assets to different locations to identify whether there's a suspect located or identification of a potential suspect. A lot of this stuff is coming together in real time. We have a front- row seat to what's going on. Again, this will - hopefully, we'll have a suspect in custody shortly.",

He's wearing that gray, he has that hoodie, so you can understand why that may have been stopped by officers. Again, to go along with some of the information that we're also learning is now there's that scare that there may have been a carjacking nearby. I was talking to a source that this person may have left this entire area. So that's something they're also working with at this point. So, again, this all comes down to all those phone calls, all those 911 calls in this entire area to sort of put this together. But then you have a man like this who was obviously dressed, he was coming out, he was working, he is an electrician and he was trying to come out of that parking garage. Remember, guys, when I talked to you about an hour ago, I told you what they were concerned about is the multiple levels of parking garages in this area and there's more than seven of them just in this general two-block area. So obviously they could probably see that person moving toward one of those parking garages on that security camera and that's why blocking off some of these roadways to get a nice little pocket around here so people couldn't get out would be so super important to the police department. There was an active -- a smaller team of officers who first arrived here who were manhunting the man from the second they arrived. So you can feel how they were thinking before the SWAT team arrived. When the SWAT team arrived and all the extra personnel, they were able to make that perimeter wider and wider and wider. So that's what we're dealing with right now. But now you have to be concerned about the idea of that carjacking that may have someone far away. Suspect's mother helping and talking, that may help. We're also working on an image of the suspect's face that is a little clearer that hopefully we will be able to bring to you in the next few minutes. Because, obviously, getting that clear picture would help people understand who he looks like so you don't have an Eddie situation where someone sees someone who is dressed similar and pulls the wrong guy over.",
