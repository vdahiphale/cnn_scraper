So, again, fewer jobs, not more.But what's really telling here is the inflation part of this, because Trump has said that his tariffs, his deportations will help the cost of living. But this report finds, again, the opposite, that by 2026 we would see inflation go up to 6 percent, even in the low scenario -",

That would be worse than two years ago, except it would be self-inflicted.A really key line from the authors here. They say that, \"we find, ironically, that despite his make the foreigners pay rhetoric, this package of policies does more damage to the U.S. economy than to any other in the world.\" Which, Kate, I just think it brings us to one of the ironies here, right? The economy is the number one issue. Voters say they trust Trump over Harris on the economy. And yet these experts, when they dig into the policies, they say that he wouldn't just fail to fix inflation, he would actually make things worse.",

      "sentences": "Yes, that's right.So, it is a category two storm currently churning in the Gulf of Mexico. In the last few frames here we've really started to get a more definitive eye develop in this particular storm. That shows that it is continuing to strengthen. And we anticipate that this storm will continue to strengthen as we go through the rest of the day today. We now have not one but two separate tornado watches. One in effect for about two-thirds of Florida, the other for portions of Georgia and South Carolina. And more of these are likely to come as we go through the next 24 to 48 hours. We've had several tornado warnings off and on for both Florida, Georgia, as well as South Carolina. More of those are expected as more of those outer bands begin to creep into these states. The storm is expected to become a major hurricane later on today before making landfall tonight near the big bend region. And at that point the forward speed well pick up quite considerably. And what that really means is, it means it can make it pretty far inland before its able to weaken back down to a tropical storm. So, you're going to have cities that are well away from the ocean that are still looking at hurricane force winds. And then from there it continues up into portions of Tennessee, where it's just going to kind of hover. And that's going to allow a lot of rain to get dropped in some of these areas. Widespread. A lot of these portions of these states are looking at four to eight inches of rain, but some spots not out of the question to pick up ten or even 12 inches before this system finally moves out. We showed you the two tornado watches in effect. More are likely to come because this entire area you see here has the potential for severe weather. We're talking waterspouts, tornadoes and the potential for damaging winds. Now again, the flood threat is really what's going to be widespread. And it exists, obviously, where we have landfall. But even imminently after that, you can see the wide swath. It stretches into Georgia, portions of eastern Alabama, as well as the Carolinas. And we're also going to continue to see more of this, not only today, but the rainfall will continue for many of these states throughout the day on Friday.",

This - Helene will be the sixth. And she certainly has our full attention. We're very focused here. As you - as you might imagine, we've been monitoring the systems since its very early stages, and we've been actively preparing our community to best protect them from what is now a very powerful, as you mentioned, system, which we expect will have significant impacts in our community. But we're hopeful too that our citizens who, again, have a lot of experience with storms have heated all of our - all of our guidance on this and the warnings and they have effectuated their plans. And again, we are about as prepared as we can be with all of the early coordination and communication that has taken place so far. Very soon, though, we will be we are bracing for the impact of this storm. Soon thereafter we will do damage assessments. And then thereafter we will get about the work of rolling up our sleeves and restoring our community.",
