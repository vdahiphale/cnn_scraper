Today, millions in the southeastern part of the state are under flood watches after five straight days of heavy rain. Entire neighborhoods are inundated with water. More than a third of Texas counties have been declared disaster areas. And Texas Governor Greg Abbott could expand it to include more counties. As the flooding spreads, the high water rescues have surged as well, so far in Harris County, which includes Houston, more than 200 people have been rescued from homes and vehicles. And more than 150 pets have been pulled from the flood waters. In North Houston, an officer was able to save a man and three dogs from rising water using a jet ski. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

This street is not passable at the moment. This is part of the mandatory evacuation zone. And you can see that the water levels are still very high. We can't get back there in a car. So what we did is we went on a ride along with the Harris County Sheriff's Office. We have video of this. Take a look. And you'll see we saw floating debris. We literally went over fences because the water is way deeper back there. And also over mailboxes. We saw stop signs at eye level. Now, the team that we were with says that they started rescuing people last Wednesday. And they rescued close to 100 people. They also rescued their pets. We made several stops. They tell me that yesterday they were going door to door, asking people to evacuate. Some people decided to evacuate. Others did not want to. And they said that they also evacuated their pets. And they explained how difficult it is when individuals refuse to be evacuated, refuse to be rescued when the conditions are life-threatening. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DAVID JASPER, HARRIS COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE: We've been evacuating people since last Wednesday and all day yesterday in this area here.

And we've seen, I think in this country, one of the most consistent patterns over the last, you know, 60 years has been that those movements manifest through college campus protests, that at the time of the protests is oftentimes, you know, opposed, ridiculed, kind of set aside or violently even kind of suppressed. But then years later, it's looked back upon with a lot of credit and recognition that they were onto something that's happened with the civil rights movement and the Freedom Riders. That's happened with the Vietnam War movement. That's happened with the anti-apartheid movement. That doesn't address the charges of anti-Semitism with these protests, but I think that is one of the most consistent patterns.

And I think, you know, some of the things that we've seen publicly, like the -- you know, the testimony and congressional testimony of university leaders when -- even the specific question was asked, if somebody explicitly threatens genocide against the Jews, is that bullying or harassment? And there wasn't just a clear an obvious yes.That really is given people pause and concern that universities aren't handling this well. I think to answer your question, one of the difficult things with this conflict, with all conflicts, but we definitely see it here, is that the very same words and slogans mean really very different things to different people. What does the word Zionist mean? What does the word intifada mean? What is from the river to the sea mean? I'm seeing very confident statements by critics across the board of what those things mean when other people say them. But I know, for example, I know self-described Zionists who were among some of the most kind of persistent and courageous defenders of Palestinian rights, but also think that Israel has a right to exist and needs to be safe. I know people who talk longingly about the first intifada, which was a non-violent movement that mobilized young people and women and men in equal measure, and look at that in that way and look differently on the second intifada. So I think when we hear these things, the only way to really get to the bottom of them is through dialogue. When I hear somebody describe themselves or use one of those terms, my first instinct I don't think should be to project onto them my biases of what they mean, but to ask them what they mean.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Fred, with the testimony of Hope Hicks, prosecutors did inch closer to addressing the alleged crimes, the center of this case, which is, of course, the allegation that Donald Trump obscured the way that Michael Cohen was repaid for this $130,000 hush money payment made to stormy Daniels in order to keep that story about their alleged affair from coming out before the 2016 election.And look, Hope Hicks did two important things during her testimony. One was allowing prosecutors to introduce a transcript of the \"Access Hollywood\" tape, the now infamous \"Access Hollywood\" tape, which prosecutors to argue is what fueled Trumps concern about this alleged affair coming out before the election. And it could hurt his election chances. The other important thing that she did is she described for the jury about this chaotic and this crisis that happened inside the Trump campaign as rumblings about the story potentially coming out happened. She talked about the action amongst campaign officials as they tried to stop this or this information from coming out and concerns about how it could impact Trump's potential presidential bid. And the last thing is she described this interaction in 2018 when the story was inevitably going to come out, Michael Cohen gave a statement to \"The New York Times\" and she raised suspicions that she didn't believe that Michael Cohen would have just paid Stormy Daniels this amount of money out of the goodness of his heart. I want to read what Hope Hicks said. She said, I didn't know Michael to be in especially charitable person or selfless person. She goes on to note that Cohen is, quote, the kind of person who seeks credit. So she's addressing this statement, Michael Cohen gave, saying Trump knew nothing about the payment. Of course, now that sets the stage for prosecutors to argue through that Trump not only knew about the payment, but facilitated its -- the reimbursement of Cohen and tried to obscure it by falsifying his business records.",

How did she react during the time, sort of the off-script times when she had a chance that she look over at the defense table. I mean, they're watching their body language is much frankly, as they're listening to her testimony. And so there'll be drawing their inferences from that.

Top of that list being for president Trumps saying a number of times that he supports Mike Johnson. He stood behind beside Mike Johnson at Mar-a-Lago a few weeks ago, and said, I stand with the speaker and the number of other conservative Republicans, including many of whom are in the Conservative House Freedom Caucus, even some who voted to oust former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, are saying that now is not the right time, there's no clear alternative. Really, they just say that they want to bite their tongue. They're not thrilled with Mike Johnsons leadership, but they want to hold off on a rash decisions, right now, let the election in November come and then hold those leadership elections after the November elections. So as I said, at the top, Marjorie Taylor Greene, not much momentum, but nonetheless, she's valley to move ahead with it this week. So we are expecting to finally see that vote on the House floor.

Essentially, MTG and Massie, and are going to say that there is a cohort of Republicans in the conference who voted to vote to support a Republican speaker who's being propped up by Democrats.This is going to be MTG and Massie's way of sort of saying that these are not true Republicans, that they are not hardcore enough of Republicans because they, at the end of the day ended up voting for a man who was being supported by Democrats. Now of course there are a lot of factors that have been leading to this moment right now, and extremely slim majority, the fact that there was already three weeks of paralysis back in October when the House voted to oust Kevin McCarthy, nobody really wants to go through that again and the fact that we are so close to the elections. And finally, Mike Johnson put the foreign aid package on the floor with billions of dollars for Ukraine, that's something that Democrats said needed to happen for him to win their support. So, while Democrats have their reasonings here for supporting Mike Johnson and Republicans do as well, MTG and Massie are sort of playing their own messaging playbook here and saying, hey, I don't care about those other factors.
