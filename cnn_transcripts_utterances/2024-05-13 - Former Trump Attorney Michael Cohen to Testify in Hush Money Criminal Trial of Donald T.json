This is our special coverage as the key witness takes the stand. You could see Michael Cohen as he left for the courthouse just a few minutes ago. Prosecutors will try to use his testimony to make a link between Trump himself and the documents at the center of the case. Trump is charged with falsifying documents to cover up hush money payments to an adult film actress, all to influence the 2016 election.CNN's Brynn Gingras live outside the court where this testimony takes place today. Brynn, in a way it really has all come down to this.",

      "sentences": "It really has, John. Listen, it's important to know these two men had been in the same courtroom before, right? Michael Cohen testified in the civil trial last year and was in front of Donald Trump. There was a lot of drama, but arguably the stakes are higher with a criminal conviction possible on the line here. So it is going to be an eventful few days with Michael Cohen on the stand.And as you just said, for prosecutors, the hope is that Michael Cohen is going to be able to connect the dots, be the narrator for the entire story that they have presented to jurors. They have laid out all the evidence, they have called all the witnesses trying to explain what they believe Donald Trump did to basically pay off these hush money payments. And Michael Cohen is the person that can bring jurors into that room, in the Oval Office in 2017 of February, where prosecutors say the two of them hatched this plan to make the reimbursement payments and disguise them as legal fees on the books. So we'll see if he can do that for jurors. Of course, they've heard his name a lot. A lot of people had been calling them all different kinds of names. They've said he's aggressive. They said he's a jerk. We'll see how he is in front of jurors. And of course, when the defense gets their turn to ask the questions, well, they're going to be hammering at his credibility. They have argued that Donald Trump doesn't know what Michael Cohen does. He's kind of a rogue player in his life, in Donald Trump's life. So certainly, like I said before, there's going to be a lot of fireworks, and it all gets started when court resumes today and 9:30.",

I mean, he needs to say we discussed this. This was an intentional thing to influence the election. We decided we would list things as business records so that we could essentially mislead the public, so that we could mislead anybody who looked at these state records. This is how we did it. This was -- this was our plan are. Our intention was to violate that another law.That's what this case is, really, is that they did this with the intention of violating another law, and that being the federal election law. That means that they would have been a campaign contribution limit expenditures and all those things have to be listed accurately. And so he's going to need to talk about decisions around that, not just the fact that the payment was made. That's sort of given at this point, right? I mean, everybody sort of accepts, yes, he paid. And the question is, why did he do it? How did they calculate it or what was the purpose for why they listed it that way on those business records?",

But then slowly, you can see folks looking toward the back of the room, that back door where that teenager came from. They are worried, they're starting to panic. And then we will see the priest here and the deacon actually duck underneath the altar and later on, altar boys running around through the sanctuary. So clearly, they're in a panic. They see something that is worrying them. And then shortly after these terrifying moments, they hear this PA announcement. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
