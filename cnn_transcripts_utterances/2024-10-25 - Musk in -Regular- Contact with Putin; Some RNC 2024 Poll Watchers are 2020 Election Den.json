Apart from that, he said neither Putin nor Kremlin officials were holding regular conversations with Musk.We can also show this from the Pentagon. A spokesman said, we do not comment on any individual security clearance, review or status, or about personnel security policy matters in the context of reports about any individual's actions. Musk did not respond to requests for comments. But Gordon, I mean, obviously, you guys aren't going to put a story in The Wall Street Journal about this sort of thing. It was just one conversation.",

And he described these payments as a fulfillment of his own promises.I have one of these letters in front of me, it said, a key part of the American rescue plan is direct payments of $1,400 per person for most American households, it went on to say, this fulfills a promise I made to you and will help get millions of Americans through this crisis.

We are expecting to see new records released from the army about just what happened that day, including what ideally and possibly the police report that was filed regarding the incident.Now, just taking you back to that day on August 26, Donald Trump, he visited Arlington National Cemetery at the invitation, he says, of some Gold Star families whose loved ones were killed at the Abbey Gate bombing in Kabul in 2021. But during that visit, according to a report that was filed and according to statements from The Time, there was an altercation with an Arlington National Cemetery employee who tried to prevent him from entering a certain part of the cemetery because of the ban that the U.S. Army and Arlington National Cemetery have on political activities at that cemetery. Now, shortly after that incident, Trump did release a video on TikTok where he started talking about how disastrous the withdrawal from Afghanistan was under the Biden administration. And in the background of that video, you can actually see some gravestones of people other than the Gold Star families loved ones who were buried there. And of course, according to veterans, according to people we have spoken to, that was problematic because, of course, they did not give their permission to be used in a video that appeared to be more of a political ad than anything else. And so, what we're expecting to see today from the Army is a police -- a statement of the police report, the victim statement of this Arlington National Cemetery employee who was allegedly pushed aside forcibly by the Trump campaign. And it could shed a little bit more light on what happened here. That incident, we should note, also prompting a very rare Army statement rebuking the entire incident, saying that an ANC employee who attempted to ensure adherence to these rules was abruptly pushed aside and calling Trump's visit there clearly political.
