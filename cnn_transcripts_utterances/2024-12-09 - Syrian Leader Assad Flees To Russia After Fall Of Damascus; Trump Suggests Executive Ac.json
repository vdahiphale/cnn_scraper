People in Syria were quick to celebrate the fall of Assad, taking to the streets and even ransacking the presidential palace.

And this process will be determined by the Syrian people themselves. And the United States will do whatever we can to support them, including through humanitarian relief to help restore Syria after more than a decade of war and generations of brutality by the Assad family.

Always wonderful to see you.Let's talk about that risk and uncertainty that President Biden mentioned there. What are the strategic imperatives for the United States going forward here? KIM DOZIER, CNN GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST (via Webex by Cisco):  Well, they don't want Syria to turn into a patchwork of different territories run by different armed groups, which is essentially what it is right now. So the HTS, one of the groups that's taken over, has said they will hand over to a transitional government in days to weeks, but what that government and who are the nation states pulling the strings behind the scenes, we don't know any of that yet. So far, we haven't seen any sort of vengeful bloodletting. We haven't seen people from the former regime pursued to their houses and killed in the streets -- the kind of thing we've seen after, for instance, the fall of Kabul. But people in Syria are watching for that. Some people still afraid to come outside. And everyone's waiting to see who will end up on top after this initial joyous celebration.",

Starting very broadly, we're going to deport everyone. Well, what do you actually mean by that? OK -- well, we're going to focus on some of the criminals, actually, first. And then he digs in more. OK, what are reviewing about the families of that? If there are children who were born in the United States of whoever came here illegally. What are you going to do about that? You dig in a little bit more. OK, how are you going to deport Dreamers? Well, we're going to do something about that. So there's just massive amounts of nuance in this. What's fascinating about this -- I think what we need to be watching for after inauguration next year is how this stuff becomes reality. This is grand sweeping Trumpian statements about murderers, and gang members, and millions of people, and billions of dollars in tariffs, OK?

CHARLES RAMSEY, CNN SENIOR LAW ENFORCMENT ANALYST, POLICING REFORM CONSULTANT, FORMER PHILADELPHIA POLICE COMMISSIONER, FORMER WASHINGTON, D.C. POLICE CHIEF (via Skype):  Well, first of all, I think eventually they will find him, but this is more complicated than we thought in the very beginning. They've recovered a lot of evidence but, so far, the evidence hasn't led them directly to a suspect. The fact that they're putting out photographs with no name attached to it tells me that they're still trying to find out who this person is. They've recovered some DNA, for an example, but this person is not in CODIS, or the DNA database. And unless you're in that database then there's not going to be a hit. Apparently, a fingerprint, whether it's a full print or partial print. But again, if you're not in the system then there's not going to be a hit on that. And so they've recovered evidence, but the key is to find the person responsible. You know, being able to identify that individual. And so far, I don't believe they've been able to do it, although like any other case, detectives hold things close to the vest.
