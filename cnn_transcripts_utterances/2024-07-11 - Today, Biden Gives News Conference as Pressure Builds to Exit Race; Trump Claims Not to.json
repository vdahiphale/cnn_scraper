      "sentences": "Good morning. You're live in the CNN Newsroom. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.We begin with President Biden just hours away from what may be one of the most important moments in of his political career. Later today, the president will face the White House Press Corps holding a lengthy news conference for the first time since his shaky debate performance here on CNN. And this afternoon, top campaign officials are set to meet with Senate Democrats as some senators are hitting the panic button, worried that Biden will lose to Donald Trump in November and possibly take the rest of the party with him. Now, another Democrat on the Senate side is speaking out, Senator Peter Welch, saying President Biden should step aside, quote, for the good of the country. The sudden erosion of support comes amid a torrent of bruising headlines, sparking a brutal 24 hours for the president's campaign. One donor telling CNN quote, everything is frozen, top Chicago donors in the meantime halting a fundraising lunch during the Democratic National Convention, and that comes as George Clooney reported this yesterday, who hosted a star studded multimillion dollar fundraiser just weeks ago, is calling on Biden to step aside. New wrinkle to all this, Politico now reporting that Clooney spoke to former President Barack Obama before publishing that op-ed. And the former president did not object to the piece. Obama's team for now declining the comment. Let's begin this hour at the NATO summit in Washington, where President Biden, as we said, will hold that news conference. CNN's Kayla Tausche is there. Kayla, what are the president's aides doing to prepare him for this news conference? Maybe they're not preparing him as much as they did for that debate. Maybe they'll just let him just do his thing. What are you hearing?",

      "sentences": "Well, Jim, there were some worries that perhaps he was overprepared for the debate last month. Aides have said that they have been briefing the president throughout the week on all matters of national security, including the bilaterals that took place, the large group negotiations that happened, the dinners, the pull asides, and of course the press conference that is happening this evening.It's not just the first press conference since the president's disastrous debate just two weeks ago here on CNN. It's the first press conference for the president in more than six months. It's a format he doesn't engage in often. The last time he did was in November, 2023 at the APEC summit in San Francisco after a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. In recent months, the president has leaned on a more comfortable format, and that is having another world leader by his side and taking a very limited number of questions. Just last month, he did this in Italy on the sidelines of the G7 on stage with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, where they were talking about a new and novel plan to funnel frozen Russian assets or the proceeds from those to Ukraine for their defenses. But Biden bristled when reporters at that event tried to ask him about the situation in Gaza. Here's the president's response then. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  I wish you guys would play by the rules a little bit. I'm here to talk about a critical situation in Ukraine. You're asking me another subject. I'll be happy to answer it in detail later. But the bottom line is that we've made an agreement. I've laid out an approach. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "The White House and the Correspondents' Association later said there are no rules for these press conferences. The president was simply just frustrated. But now, given the backdrop of this moment, it is understandable that the entire press corps will have questions about the president's candidacy after a stunning deterioration of support among Democrats in just the last 24 hours that surprised even some members of the president's own party.Just the swiftness of that decline after what just a few days ago seemed like some relative safety for the president, some calm in the storm, especially after the president's confidence after a swing through Wisconsin and Pennsylvania over the weekend and a warm reception from voters there. That is what led to his confidence Monday morning when he sent a letter to House Democrats and when he appeared on cable television saying that he doesn't care what the party elites think. It's really about the voters. But with these elected officials defecting now, Jim, these represent voters. And so he will have to address the concerns of these lawmakers at some point, Jim. [10:05:00] ACOSTA:  That's right. I'm sure he asked lots of questions on that front this evening. Kayla Tausche, thanks very much. Turning now to Project 2025, a conservative policy plan that could radically change the future of America as we know it, the mandate would overhaul parts of the federal government and replace civil servants with Trump loyalists if the former president wins in November. Donald Trump insists, as he's done this time and again, he knows nothing about the nearly 1,000-page playbook crafted by the Heritage Foundation or who's behind it. But a CNN review finds that at least 140 people involved in this Republican blueprint actually worked in the Trump administration. CNN's Steve Contorno joins us now from Florida. Steve, tell us what you found out.",

      "sentences": "Jim, with Donald Trump said that he didn't know who was behind Project 2025, we decided to take a look at who exactly was involved. And we read through the list of authors, contributors, looked at staff pages of all these advisory groups that have been working on the project. And we found more than 200 people have some sort of tie to Donald Trump, his campaign, his past transition teams, people he has endorsed, people he has nominated, including 140 people who contributed directly to that playbook you discussed, who have previous experience working in the Donald Trump White House and his administration.It includes people who reached the highest levels of his government, including six people who rose to cabinet positions, such as Ben Carson, his former head secretary and the OPM director, Russ Vought. He also has several people that he nominated for ambassadorship, many of the key architects behind his early immigration crackdown, one of his deputy chiefs of staff. All of these people had some sort of involvement with writing Project 2025's playbook. Now, we took this information to the Trump campaign and they said, look, these people may have worked for Donald Trump. They don't work for him now. They may never work for him again. What they say does not reflect the views of Donald Trump. He has posted his own agenda on his campaign website. He supports the Republican Party platform, but he has no ties at all to this organization. And we should note that the former president overnight posted on Truth Social, once again, distancing himself from Product 2025. But, Jim, this is going on as Democrats are intensifying their efforts to connect him to many of his more controversial policies.",

He is also very closely aligned with Project 2025 over their proposals for the immigration crackdown. But he has been very deliberate in how he talks about some of these hot button social issues, particularly abortion.And Project 2025 is out on a limb on several suggestions for Trump's second term. They have put out ideas like banning pornography. They want to make it more difficult to get medication for inducing an abortion. They want to make it more difficult to get certain contraceptives. They want to make it more difficult to get care for adults -- transgender adults. All of these things are things that Donald Trump has not specifically talked about, and Democrats have been working overtime to tie them to him, nevertheless.",

He confirmed that with his catastrophic debate performance.So, every single time he sits down, he does interview with George Stephanopoulos. He has a rally in Madison, Wisconsin, which I thought went very well, great NATO speech. But in the back of every voter's mind is, gee, I wonder if he's up to. It's like it's like watching like a good friend of yours who you really like trying to cross an icy street, maybe after having a few cocktails like, whoa.

The only person who decides what policies they're going to pursue is the person on the ballot or the person in the Oval Office. At least that used to be the case. Today with Joe Biden, I'm not so sure, given the reporting about how he's out to lunch or whatever. But in this case, Donald Trump will ultimately decide what his agenda is and that's why the RNC put out a platform.If the Democrats want to play this game, though, I think they should be prepared to own every single policy proposal ever issued by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the rest of the squad, Bernie Sanders, socialist organizations in America that support that group. If you want to play this game, then you're going to have to own everything starting with defund the police. So, what I'm going to assume, Jim, is that Democrats want to own for Joe Biden, defund the police. If they want him to own Project 2025, then they can own defund the police.

I'll vote for him this time. But it's not a pro-Biden majority but there isn't anti-Trump majority.And I think this is what ought to have the Republican so panicked. Joe Biden has had the worst week or two weeks in presidential campaign history and they still are -- and Mr. Trump is still tied with him. And, by the way, let's do the turnabout on this question of who should run. I have been very, very critical of Biden and his campaign since the debate, panicked, right? Where are the Republicans calling for Mr. Trump to get out, like I didn't know that Biden would have such a terrible debate. Every Republican knew that Mr. Trump was found liable for sexual abuse of E. Jean Carroll on 5th Avenue at Bergdorf Cove. Every Republican knows he was guilty of 34 felonies. Everybody knows he was adjudicated in a civil fraud trial, liable for defrauding the taxpayers of the state of New York. They knew all that about Trump, and no one is calling on Mr. Trump to stand down. By the way, 50 -- in the ABC pulled out today, 50 percent of Americans want Trump to get out of the race.

They didn't say the same thing about Donald Trump, despite everything that Paul just mentioned there.But your response to that, I mean, why aren't Republicans having a conversation among the adults in the room about whether or not Donald Trump should stay in this rate, despite all of these things that we've been talking about?",

And now they're on the cusp of that vindication, and that's why the party is so united behind him right now.Regarding this polling, look, it is a close race. It's going to be a close race. But here's the dirty little secret about a national poll showing the race tied. Joe Biden loses that race. It's not a national popular vote, as you both know. This will be decided in the swing states. And I think Paul might agree that if Joe Biden simply ties Donald Trump or loses to him by one point, it likely means he got blown out in the Electoral College. I think Joe Biden actually has to go beyond tying Trump. He's got to win by one, two, maybe three points. And if you look down below the surface of this thing, if you throw open the hood of this car, there are major problems on Joe Biden's only path. He has to win Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Omaha. And I think he's down in three of those four. And the only one he's winning is Omaha. And that's only one electoral vote.

I mean, people have already judged this by what they've seen.And Republicans right now are very unified. They think Biden has been -- Trump's been treated unfairly on the legal stuff that, that Biden campaign keeps bringing up. There's a whole host of reasons. But right now the Republicans are unified.

This country doesn't want to ban pornography, which I don't know if that's like a payback for Stormy Daniels, because I think Mr. Trump had a pretty intense conversation with Stormy Daniels. They don't want this. They want to shutter the Department of Education. They don't want to cut and close NOAA and the National Weather Service, my family in Houston still cleaning up from Beryl.
