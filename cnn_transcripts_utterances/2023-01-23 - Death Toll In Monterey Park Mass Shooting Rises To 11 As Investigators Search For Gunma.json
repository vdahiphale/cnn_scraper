Just minutes later, countless deaths were prevented, at another dance studio, nearby Alhambra.This exclusive security camera video, of the entranceway, to that ballroom, the man in the corner, is 72-year-old Monterey Park killer. He's holding a 9-millimeter MAC-10 semi-automatic, what appears to be a suppressor, or a silencer, on it. Now, authorities said, he'd been making those at home. The other man, you'll see, in a second, it's a slightly slowed-down video, and from the security cameras, 26-year-old Brandon Tsay. He runs the ballroom, with his family. He tells us he heard metal on metal sounds, turned around, and then saw the shooter and, in a matter of seconds, or split seconds, decided to attack him, and confront him, get the gun.

And we know when we look at the public opinion, at this particular point? And the Pew Research Center has a good question on this, and essentially, \"More important to protect the right to own guns than control gun ownership?\" Back in 2000, less than 50 percent of Republicans and Democrats thought it was more important to protect right to own guns than control gun ownership. But look now, Republicans, 81 percent of Republicans say it's more important to protect gun ownership. Democrats really haven't moved. Republicans have moved significantly more towards the right to own guns.

Charles Ramsey, who served as Police Commissioner, in Philadelphia and Washington, D.C.; and former FBI Deputy Director, Andrew McCabe. So, Andrew, I just want to talk about the mass shootings, nationally. But first, as Nick Watt mentioned earlier, a lot has been revealed about the ammunition, the California suspect had, 42 shell casings, a large-capacity magazine, recovered from the scene. There was a hand gun, in the white cargo van, according to law enforcement. A rifle, with hundreds of rounds of ammunition, were found in his home, according to Police, not to mention the weapon used in the shooting, which was a MAC-10 pistol, with an extended large- capacity magazine.

And it comes on the eve of these - of what happened, just obviously yesterday, and then just weeks after natural hazard events, which have really struck this community. So, the one thing I want to say out, to the people, who are out there, who live here, who are watching, is please take advantage of the mental health crisis counseling, that is available, out there. The amount of stress that's been on this community for weeks is really quite high. If there's people out there, who are suffering, from this, who are feeling the effects of it, please reach out and get help, tonight. You are not alone. We have counseling service available at the ALAS (ph) hall, here in Half Moon Bay, if you can reach out to us on the county hotline. But we want to make sure that people know that they are not alone, and that we are here for you this evening. And then, as Supervisor Pine said, in the days and the weeks ahead of us, we really have to come together, and figure out how to go ahead and wrap our arms around, getting to address this problem, of gun violence, which has afflicted our state, here, in recent days, and has afflicted us here, at home. It's something that's unimaginable, to happen, here, in Half Moon Bay and, frankly, here in San Mateo County. So, with that, I'd like to go ahead and introduce you all, to my good friends, Half Moon Bay Vice Mayor Joaquin Jimenez.",
