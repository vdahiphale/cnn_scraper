Right now, he's at his resort in Doral, Florida. That's just miles away from the courthouse where he is expected to surrender this afternoon. Take a look at this video of Trump at his hotel on the eve of the arraignment. He has called on his supporters to come out today to protest. Miami's police chief says the city is prepared for crowds ranging from 5,000 to up to 50,000. The indictment in all of its detail accuses Trump of hoarding classified documents at Mar-a-Lago, stashing them in places like a bathroom, a shower, and his own private residence. Prosecutors say these were some of our nation's most closely-guarded secrets, including highly-sensitive information about America's nuclear program.

One of those key lawyers, who had been the point person for Donald Trump on documents he had taken from the White House, that person, Evan Corcoran, was -- has become a major witness in this case. Clearly, his part of the obstruction of justice part of this set of charges. And so, now we are aware that Donald Trump and his legal team, they're scrambling to try and find people. They're talking out -- they're reaching out to lawyers in Florida. I've heard a couple different names. But it's still not totally clear who all is going to show up in court today to represent the former president. One of those people is a man named Todd Blanche. He was very successful representing Paul Manafort, the former campaign chairman for Donald Trump, in 2016 in a case in New York state.

And so in recent months, there had been discussions among the Justice Department to move this case to Florida, to not have it in a grand jury in D.C. returning that indictment and having it going to trial there. So it will progress here.

I've been talking to sources who say that FBI special agents across the country working domestic terrorism have been working their sources, trying to determine, you know, are there any extremist groups out there who might be plotting, who might be planning? That is certainly a concern for law enforcement. The unknown. We know that a lot of these groups, you know, prior to January 6th, they were online posting publicly about, you know, their vitriol and their plans. A lot of these forums have become closed off.

I think it's a big issue in the case, because it relates both to the return of the grand jury indictment and potentially to the trial.There's actually a relatively recent case, 2021 case from the 11th Circuit, which is the court of appeals that sits over this court in the Southern District of Florida, and that case had to sort of try to flesh out the -- it's called in re (ph) grand jury subpoena. They had to try to flesh out the crime-fraud exception. Because remember, one of the most sacrosanct privileges we have in the law is the attorney/client privilege. However, the law recognizes this crime-fraud exception. There's two prongs to it. One is that the court has to be convinced that there was a conversation related to the furtherance of a crime or possible crime. That's a very low hurdle. But then the second prong is, was the conversation at issue related to the furtherance of the crime? The 11th Circuit sort of punted in that case, saying they didn't really have to decide how strict those parameters are regulated, but that traditionally, the courts have been relatively less restrictive in showing that the conversation was directly related to the crime. The issue here will be Judge Howell apparently had Corcoran's notes, his private notes to himself, notes regarding his interactions with President Trump, turned over in wholesale fashion to the government. There's a question there. With any privilege that's pierced, the law is you only pierce it to the extent it's reasonably necessary. So if the turnover was far too broad or was too broad, it could have tainted the grand jury process. If the grand jury was exposed to attorney/client privileged notes that really weren't -- shouldn't have been turned over based on crime-fraud exception, then the issue can come up again at trial. Assuming the judge doesn't dismiss the indictment based on this taint or alleged taint, then it would come up at trial again, whether they're admissible. And if they are admissible, the flip side of that is, it opens the door for Evan Corcoran to testify. I think his testimony, quite frankly, would be favorable to President Trump in explaining his notes, as damning as they might seem now on the face of them.

I've heard many other people emphasize it.I think the reason it's less -- gets less emphasis than people were guessing before the indictment came out is, again, because this classified element isn't a part of it. People generally were talking about that before because of the president's unilateral right to declassify documents when he's in office. However, I think it's relevant here, based on the willfulness prong -- that is did he know, should he have known that he was doing something prohibited by the law, given the reading of the Presidential Records Act that his advisers have given him. I also think it goes to the first prong: whether he was authorized to have documents in the first place. You know, one thing that's never really pointed out these days is traditionally -- and, again, you may say it's not directly relevant, but I think it's somewhat relevant, is that the tradition has been former presidents get regular intelligence briefings, even well after they're out of office and all that. So one thing we have to remember is there is something special and unique about the position of the presidency.",

Jim Jordan made this repeatedly with Dana Bash on Sunday morning, citing a 1988 Supreme Court decision, the Department of Navy versus Egan, which essentially says the president has the authority to classify and control access to information bearing on national security.

Whether it directly applies or not, I think it's relevant to the willful prong. The question here is, under 793E, one of the questions is, a third prong, whether the person being charged willfully did it. That means did something he knew was prohibited by the law. Now, you're going to say to me, well, you can hear from the tape it seems that he knew, you know, what he was doing; he wasn't allowed to do it and so on. Tapes can be cross-examined. Notwithstanding what many of these commentators say. Tapes can be cross-examined. What were the circumstances? You know, exactly what was the rest of the conversation? And so on. Again, we have to hear from the defense about all of these things.
