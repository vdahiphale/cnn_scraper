I'm Anna Coren in Hong Kong ahead here on CNN Newsroom.More debt ceiling drama in the U.S. Getting a deal on the table was only the first hurdle. Now the race is on to sell the plan to skeptical lawmakers before the government runs out of money to pay its bills. Kyiv under fire. Air raid alarms ringing out in Ukrainian capital for a third day in a row as Russia unleashes another massive wave of drone attacks on the city. Plus, the showdown in Texas, the State's Attorney General in pitched by his fellow Republicans. Will break down the accusations was facing where things go from here. The debt limit deal between the U.S. President and the Republican House Speaker is about to be put to the test. Both leaders have been racing to bolster support for the bipartisan agreement before the U.S. runs out of money next week. But they face harsh criticism from hardline members of their own parties. And they must get Congress to approve the deal before the President can sign it. In the coming day the House Rules Committee will review the bill, but several members of that committee are hardliners and it's not clear what will happen. If all goes well, there could be a House vote on Wednesday. And if the bill passes the House, it will move on to the Senate. The hope and the dream is that it will sail through Congress well before June 5, so the U.S. can avoid a catastrophic first ever national default on its debt. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

You're already hearing backlash from some conservatives like Lindsey Graham, who are arguing that the defense number agreed to in this legislation is just not high enough.

Everything that is happening now is a precursor for a counter attack, a necessary precursor where the intensity of fire increases. And he lays out bold aims for the counter offensive. It will end undoubtedly on the borders of Ukraine as they were in 1991 with the deoccupation of Crimea, and with the beginning of a massive process of transformation of Russia's political system.

President Erdogan has made some pretty lofty (INAUDIBLE) of rebuilding the affected areas in the southeast providing permanent homes for hundreds of thousands of people within the next year. He will now have to deliver on those promise. And of course President Erdogan ahs cemented Turkey's place in the world stage. And over the coming months and years we will continue to see President Erdogan playing a key role as a NATO ally, but also of course an influential regional power broker.

So that is really quite a feat considering this country's first manned mission was only launched 20 years ago in 2003. Now, the latest crew, the three astronauts, they will be conducting a series of experiments and research during their five month stay in space. But also of course, installing, testing, maintaining equipment and conducting spacewalks -- all of that has become increasingly common. And the Tiangong itself, the first module was entered into space only in 2021. By the end of last year, they're already completed the reconstruction of this tea-shaped, three-module structure. And now there's already talk about extending it into a (INAUDIBLE) structure to extend research capabilities. Now, of course, one of the most noteworthy aspects of this latest mission, as you mentioned is they're sending a civilian into space for the first time. And previously, they had all been military personnel with some astronauts holding the rank of a general. So this fact of course, very much pointing to the military driven -- military-run nature of the space program, which is the foundation of a lot of its success, not only on manned missions but also unmanned missions like lunar and Mars probes. But also it's been a source of controversy which is why the U.S. Congress has largely banned space cooperation between the two countries. But the fact that the program here has almost unlimited resources is likely to give it a leg up according to experts in this race to catch up with the Americans. And that's really why this space race is increasingly heated, Anna. And with that well publicized goal of sending a Chinese astronaut to land on the moon by 2030, Anna.",
