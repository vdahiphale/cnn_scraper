      "sentences": "Never again. That is the plea of the people who survived one of the darkest moments in history, the holocaust. During World War II, German Nazis murdered countless people, including six million Jewish men, women, and children. It's easy to think of the holocaust as a relic of the past, but the few remaining survivors of the holocaust still lived with the horrors.The holocaust remains one of the greatest crimes against humanity. In Europe, Nazis set out to kill as many Jews as possible. They murdered all four of my grandparents, and forced my parents into slave labor and extermination camps. Miraculously, my parents survived. Hate ignited the holocaust. Ignorance fueled it. Eight decades later, it's horrifying to see a rise in antisemitism and holocaust denial around the world and here in this country. We want to take you on a tour of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum here in Washington, D.C. More than 45 million people have visited this museum since it opened back in 1993. This institution serves as a reminder of what happens when society doesn't up to hate. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNKNOWN (voice-over):  Now, sir, can we begin? Would you tell me your full name?",

BLITZER (voice-over):  I'm originally from Oswiecim, which is actually the name of the city of Auschwitz before the war. My wife did not believe that she's going to be able to have children after the concentration camp. But 10 months after we were married, she would. W. BLITZER:  Like so many survivors, he knew he had to speak for the millions who couldn't. And now, I'm carrying on his legacy. I'm going to take you through the history of the holocaust in the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum with help from survivors like my father. Their voices will bear witness to future generations.

But if they lived, their destination would be a killing center, where most of them were gassed upon arrival.Some have heard rumors. But again, remember, it was just unbelievable. So, what they understood and what they were told by the Germans was that they were being deported to the east for hard labor.

Every day, thousands of people were burned and gassed in camps only because they had the possibility to bring those train loads of people.
