We should note. We're going to ask Congressman Raskin if he wants to come on to further explain what he meant. If you ever miss an episode of The Lead, you can listen to the show whence you get your podcast. The news continues now on CNN with Wolf Blitzer in The Situation Room. I'll see you tomorrow. RICHARD QUEST, CNN BUSINESS EDITOR-AT-LARGE AND CNN INTERNATIONAL HOST, \"QUEST MEANS BUSINESS\":  It is 1:00 in the morning in Beirut, 6:00 a.m. in Shanghai, it's 6:00 p.m. on Tuesday in New York. I'm Richard Quest, in for Julia Chatterley. So, you can see where the next hour's going to go. Because wherever you are in the world, it's your \"First Move.\" And you're most welcome. This is what you need to know today. Sean Diddy Combs is being held without bail on charges of sex trafficking, racketeering, conspiracy, and transportation for the purpose of prostitution. At least nine people are killed and thousands injured as pages explode in an attack that's targeting Hezbollah in Lebanon. And Instagram is making sweeping changes for teenage users. It affects privacy and age verification. All that and the tuk-tuk transformation. The iconic three-wheelers are going electric and global. We'll talk about that, and there's a great deal more. First, though, I need to start with the accusation against Paul -- Diddy Combs of abusing, threatening, and coercing women for years. Tonight, Sean Diddy Combs will spend the night in a cell, having been denied bail. At a federal courthouse here in New York, he pleaded not guilty to all the charges against him. The prosecutors are alleging that the rapper operated a criminal enterprise that included sex trafficking, forced labor, kidnapping, arson, bribery, and obstruction of justice. His lawyer had this to say outside court after the hearing. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MARC AGNIFILO, ATTORNEY FOR SEAN \"DIDDY\" COMBS:  He's been looking forward to this day. He's been looking forward to clearing his name, and he's going to clear his name. And we're going to stand by his side as he does. We believe in him wholeheartedly. He didn't do these things. This was a 10- year relationship. There's no coercion. There's no crime. There's basically just, you know, someone who brought a civil case and now is finding themselves as a witness in a criminal case. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Combs has repeatedly denied multiple allegations against him, saying that his accusers are looking for money, but he issued an apology for his conduct on the video only after it came to light.

Is he a flight risk, in other words? And so, I think at this point, the judge has decided that the fact that he was doing these acts in secret did not obviously lend much to his statements that he will be open and available. So, I'm not surprised at all.

I just don't think that a judge would take and place him on probation or some type of house arrest, given the allegations that were made, no matter what the plea discussions were. And remember, the prosecution and a defendant can negotiate a plea amongst themselves, but a court has the decision, finally, on whether or not to accept that recommendation and ultimately, has the authority to make a decision about whether or not a prison sentence is appropriate. We operate under the federal sentencing guidelines, those give the judge some parameters to consider. Things like whether or not somebody accepts responsibility, whether or not they have been an adverse impact on victims, whether or not there's been excessive fraud and deceit through the investigation of the case, those things come into play as we talk about what might happen if there is a plea agreement that's ultimately reached.",

Another thing would be the nature of the charges. The allegations that were made, they expand a long period of time. There were efforts to influence witnesses, it sounds like, at least that's been an allegation that has been made. These are all things that get put into that decision. The fact that he just would have turned himself in, that would have been in his favor, but there are so many other factors at play that it wouldn't have surprised me to see a court dig into those a little bit in making a decision whether bail would be appropriate. And at this stage, a judge has determined that bail is not appropriate. He has a right and has done apparently so to appeal that decision and have another hearing on it. At that time, his lawyers would have a chance to make these arguments about, you know, the efforts that he was making to cooperate and to get there.

It's going to be really disastrous for morale. From a practical standpoint, you have several thousand people injured, at least several hundred of those are Hezbollah operatives. And there are some reports that that people pulled out their pagers to look at them right before the explosion went off. So, we've gotten reports of some people losing their eyesight, and that will be a literal disruption for Hezbollah capabilities. On top of that, we also saw reports that Hezbollah was telling all of their fighters to throw away their communications devices. That makes it much more difficult to mobilize fighters. It also makes it hard to coordinate fires. And Hezbollah generally likes to shoot and run, and they can't do that if they can't organize their fighters into certain patterns.",

The next storm system here is going to be very close to Da Nang, that's not that far away from where we had a very large Yagi move on through not that long ago, 250 more millimeters for them. Now, back to Europe where it has been raining now for days. This is what many of the streets are like here in parts of Poland, Austria, Czechia. These are the areas that hit so much rainfall over the weekend. And it's still raining, but it's at least moved a little bit farther to the south, into parts of Italy. Even into parts of Portugal. And this is the area that really needs rain because the areas here, 5,000 firefighters in Portugal trying to get the area put out, over 20 large wildfires, mainly in rural areas, but they're really working hard on this because it has been so very dry for so very long. Now, there will be some wind, but not significant wind here, probably only 10 to 15 kilometers per hour. That will help firefighters at least get a handle on it. What they really need is rain, they're going to get sprinkles, but that's about all we can offer. Richard.",

Kamala Harris says she's fighting to win the support of black voters rather than relying on her own identity to sway them. The Democratic candidate spoke on Tuesday to the National Association of Black Journalists and made it clear she's not taking any voter for granted.

His first campaign event sinceSunday's arrest of a man authorities say wanted to kill him. Kristen Holmes is with me in Flint. Going to be interesting this, Kristen, because we're going to look closely -- I mean, not that Donald Trump has a stump speech per se, but how he plays the event of the weekend into what would probably be a long rally. KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Richard. So, we actually are expecting him to not speak that long tonight. So, they're putting this as a town hall, not as a rally. He's likely to speak for about five to 10 minutes. Well, that's what the campaign says. And knowing Donald Trump, it'll probably be more like 20 to 25 minutes. And then take questions from the crowd. But I am told that he is going to directly address what happened over the weekend on Sunday. Now, if it's any indication of how he's going to handle what happened, it is likely he is going to blame Democratic rhetoric. Even just moments ago, we saw the Trump campaign release a statement on the interview that Kamala Harris did with NABJ. Obviously, Donald Trump himself did a very tense interview with NABJ at least a month ago, and it did not go well. Now, Donald Trump's campaign is essentially saying, not only was she given a softball interview, but saying that she continued with this violent rhetoric, this kind of incendiary anti-Trump rhetoric. We had been wondering whether or not this is something Donald Trump was just going to harp on and continue to repeat, or if this was going to be a larger campaign strategy, and it certainly looks as though it's going to be a larger campaign strategy. Of course, as we know, Donald Trump himself has never shied away from incendiary or violent rhetoric. So -- but this is something that they have turned to. This is something that they're looking at. And clearly, we believe it'll be something he touches on tonight and going into November.",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RANDI KAYE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Next time Donald Trump hits the links, there may be substantially more security around him. That's what Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe told Trump this week, according to three people familiar with the meeting. Rowe told Trump there were concerns about securing his private courses, given the large amounts of space and proximity to public roads, sources said. GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL):  The State of Florida has jurisdiction over the most serious straightforward offense, which is attempted murder. KAYE (voice-over):  This as Florida Governor Ron DeSantis adds his name to the dueling investigations into the apparent attempt on Former President Donald Trump's life.

And one of the world's most iconic vehicles could soon be trundling for the rest of us. If like me, you're of a certain age, remember James Bond making his getaway in the tuk-tuk in the 1983 film, \"Octopussy.\" Tuk-tuk. There you go. Around the corner up the street. Slightly more sedately, I enjoyed my own tuk-tuk in Bangkok when I was there to film World of Wonder some years ago. Now, the new version carries packages, not passengers. It's a two-stroke engine replaced by clean electric motors. And as micro EVs, they're being used for the last mile deliveries. They've already been bought by Ikea and Amazon and the company's gaining a foothold in the United States.
