A stunning move by a critical U.S. ally, the president of South Korea has declared martial law in that country. He made the announcement in a late night T.V. address saying it's needed to protect the country from, quote, communist forces. Let's go to CNN's Mike Valerio in Seoul. Mike, obviously startling news here in the U.S. What more can you tell us?",

      "sentences": "Jim, it is a stunning move, and we have an unpopular president who, in an unplanned televised address, said that he needed to implement martial law across this bastion of democracy here in East Asia in order to preserve the rule of law.So, going back to this speech that happened just about two hours ago, televised to the nation, President Yoon Suk Yeol writing that he is taking these measures to, quote, safeguard a liberal South Korea from the threats posed by North Korea's communist forces and to eliminate anti-state elements. Now, Jim, at this hour, as we now cross over 12:01 A.M., Wednesday local time here in the heart of Seoul, it is unclear what exact measures this president will take here to implement martial law. South Korea hasn't been under this kind of rule, this kind of situation since it was under the rule of military dictatorship in the 1980s. But I can tell you, just living very close to here, our CNN bureau in the center of Seoul, police officers are on their phones, Jim, asking their superiors, what is going on? Family members are getting to loved ones homes as fast as they can, at least in my neighborhood. And we have protesters who are gathering at the National Assembly a couple miles away from here who are trying to bring this to a stop. We have lawmakers in the middle of the night from the opposition party who are saying, in so many words, paraphrasing, Jim, hey this is supremely illegal, was done without any consent and needs to be stopped immediately. So, what we are probably going to see over the next couple hours are members of the Democratic Party, the opposition here, trying to meet in the National Assembly to cancel this stunning move. In terms of what we have been able to figure out, Jim, information just crossing over the Reuters wire before we go, all media apparently will be under control of martial law command starting immediately. We are trying to figure out what, if anything, that means for us here at CNN, what that means for democracy in South Korea, but truly an unsettling situation here as we cross midnight in Seoul, Jim.",

There's still obviously a lot of questions here. You recall this all started a week ago today when this 57-year- old managed to clear a security checkpoint, however, bypassed two identity checkpoints that are meant to basically control who boards a flight, particularly for an international flight. So, there's still so many questions about why that happened. And here we are now, Jim, seven days later, and there is still no resolution with this U.S. resident who has a Russian passport, continues in France.

I remember they held screenings, they held up Dinesh D'Souza in this film as like, aha, we have proof. Here it is.

I mean, this was held up really as the Holy Grail, as the absolute proof of all those bogus election lies in 2020. The movie actually premiered right by here in Mar-a-Lago back in 2022, where Trump himself attended and all the likes of Marjorie Taylor Greene and others. And, look, for those of your audience, Jim, who haven't had the pleasure of watching this so-called documentary, in short, it used mangled data from geolocation, from people's cell phones along with video surveillance footage to try and claim that people who are dropping off ballots at voter drop box locations across the country, that they were some of them were mules, people who were stuffing them with hundreds of ballots or many ballots in a way to steal the election. Nobody's been able to stand up the claims in this movie, multiple investigations across the country, election officials in Georgia, of course, as you mentioned. Nobody's been able to stand it up. It is bogus. But I got to say, I mean, even up to this day, two and a half years later after that movie was released, I still hear it all the time.
