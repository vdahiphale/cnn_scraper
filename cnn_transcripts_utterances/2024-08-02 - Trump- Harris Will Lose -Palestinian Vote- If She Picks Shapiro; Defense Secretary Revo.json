But the potential of that happening, of two men with Kentucky ties, running against each other, to be Vice President of the United States, is certainly the topic of conversation, here in Jackson.

      "sentences": "Straight from THE SOURCE tonight.We've learned that Kamala Harris herself is now interviewing the finalists, to be her running mate. An announcement could come at any time, with the latest reporting on who is at the top of her list. Meanwhile, a stunning turn in that plea deal for the alleged 9/11 mastermind, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. Defense Secretary, Lloyd Austin, suddenly, tonight, revoking the deal. We're live with the breaking news that is sending shockwaves, across Washington. And Donald Trump's legal trouble, back in the hands of that federal judge, who once warned him that he was neither a king nor the president any longer. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Tonight that deadline is fast-approaching, for Vice President Kamala Harris, meaning that we could be hours away, from learning who will be her running mate. Sources tell us tonight that Harris herself is conducting the final interviews with about half a dozen contenders. One of them will soon get that call, the one that she got four years ago this month. And we'll see Harris and her pick, together, this Tuesday, at their first joint rally in Philadelphia. And when it comes to who is under consideration, here's what our sources are telling us, tonight, who's still on the list. Pennsylvania governor, Josh Shapiro. Arizona senator, Mark Kelly. The Minnesota governor, Tim Walz. Illinois governor, J.B. Pritzker. Kentucky governor, Andy Beshear. And Transportation Secretary, Pete Buttigieg. Safe to say she has the map covered. But of those we are told that Shapiro, Kelly and Walz are said to be the leading contenders. But I say, with a caveat, because of course these interviews that are happening could be key to the final decision that Harris makes here. And with her biggest staffing decisions still to come, and which running mate she is going to ultimately decide on here, she has added some other big names to the campaign, tonight. And they are all political veterans from the Obama era. That includes his former campaign manager, David Plouffe, his deputy campaign manager, Stephanie Cutter, and a few others. And all of this is happening with 94 days to go to the election. Or as one senior Harris campaign official put it to us tonight, it's all hands on deck. My political sources tonight are: CNN's Senior Data Reporter, Harry Enten. The former New York City mayor, Bill de Blasio. CNN Senior Political Commentator, and former senior adviser to Mitch McConnell, Scott Jennings. And also, CNN Political Commentator, and the former National Coalitions Director for the Biden-Harris campaign, Ashley Allison. It's great to have you all here. And Mayor, let me start with you. Because obviously, this is a historic decision that she's, you know, with her clinching the delegates today, and making this historic place, the top of the ticket, that historic decision is also influencing, who she is going to put on the ticket with her, who she wants to balance out, what this ticket that they're going to present to voters is going to look like. BILL DE BLASIO, (D) FORMER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR: It is, Kaitlan. But look, big question, of course, is what does a vice president mean, politically, in this day and age? And I think it's fair to say we shouldn't overrate it. But what does matter in reality of a very, very tight campaign, is what does that vice president bring to the political equation? I'm not so sure that anyone guarantees a state. I think once upon a time, perhaps that was true, when there were big political machines and all. But not now. Would you rather have a Shapiro to help you get Pennsylvania? Sure. Or Kelly for Arizona? But does it guarantee it? Absolutely not. I think the big question is, how do they play out there, as campaigners, as another voice, in so many key swing states and swing markets, media markets, where people need that reinforcement, and that reminder of the message, who is the most emphatic, and passionate, and effective messenger. Good choices. I'm not sure one totally stands out from the others. But I actually think that has to be the number one qualification here.",

Jen O'Malley Dillon, who was the campaign manager, that day, called me, because of my role, but also because of what it represented as a Black woman in this country.Here's the thing about the Vice President, as I've worked for her on the campaign. She is meticulous. And so, she is not taking this decision lightly. And she will think about this. And something we might not always say, in conversations in politics, I bet you she's prayerful about this, because this is a big, big decision. I am not sure who she will pick. I think they all have pros and cons. But what I do know -- and I want to make this one point, a lot of folks have said the Vice President, not Kamala Harris, but her person that she selects won't matter. I think we're in a new day of politics. Kamala Harris is now one of the most popular people in the world, because of memes. Memes didn't exist during Barack Obama's first election. Memes becoming a movement were not something substantial. And we can toss that aside. But those things are real. Those are how -- that's really how people interact. The polls numbers have been wrong so many times. So, I think at the end of the day, the one thing that is consistent, in politics, is people, and how people feel. And so, at the end of the day, I think the Vice President will pick someone to be her nominated VP that she feels comfortable with, but also that the American people can resonate with.",

Everybody has their liabilities.

I don't think it's about whether the vice presidential candidate is of a certain faith. I think it's about what are we going to do, with that situation, in the Middle East. What I've seen from Kamala Harris, and I really appreciated is, she's reaffirmed her support for Israel. But she's also said, very overtly, we have to end the suffering of the Palestinian people. And I think she's drawn a clear line, about the fact that the United States is going to really say, to Israel, come on, we've got to do better than this. This is not the way for this war to go. Let's find a way to wrap this up, and get the hostages home. Obviously, Hamas has to be a part of that, too. But I think she's sending a message to folks who have genuine concern--",

And then, in an announcement that was quietly posted, on the Pentagon's website, about an hour ago, without any sort of a public announcement, just simply posted there, Defense Secretary, Lloyd Austin, said he was not only relieving the authority of the overseer of these cases, but also withdrawing the plea agreements. You saw the announcement right there. It was only three sentences, in which Austin wrote that it is his -- now his authority, and his authority alone, to enter into a plea agreement, like this, and that he was withdrawing the agreements reached. The question, of course, what happens now? This had been delayed for so long. And it was seen as a sort of difficult compromise, to get to this point.

Russia refused to allow him to be part of this plea deal. And you heard President Biden there. But I think the question is, how much harder is it to get people like him out, when the biggest bargaining chips, these Russian assassins that we saw traded as part of this deal yesterday, were already a part of a swap.",

There are Americans such as Andre Khachaturian, and Robert Gilman, and Ksenia Karelina, and -- and sorry, and a few others that we're working on. David Barnes. Sorry. To get them back.
