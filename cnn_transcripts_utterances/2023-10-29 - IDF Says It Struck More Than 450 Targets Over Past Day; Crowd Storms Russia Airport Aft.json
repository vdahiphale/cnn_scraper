My colleague Wolf Blitzer is live for us in Tel Aviv, Israel.We begin this hour with a reminder of the international tension stoked by what's happening in Israel and Gaza. We're now seeing this remarkable video from the southern Russian Republic of Dagestan. Russian authorities say a crowd some waving Palestinian flags forced their way into an airport after a flight from Tel Aviv landed earlier today. Russian state media says the crowd was protesting the Israel- Hamas war. In Gaza City right now, an aid organization says nearby Israeli airstrikes have caused extensive damage to the second largest hospital there. The Palestinian Red Crescent Society says that's endangering the lives of patients. 12,000 displaced citizens are also sheltering there. Gunfire and explosions echo across much of Gaza as Israel's ground offensive advances. Israeli troops appear to have advanced over two miles into Gaza, according to a CNN analysis and video published by an Israeli media outlet. Meanwhile rockets continue to be fired from Gaza into Israel.",

Their phone conversation comes amid a stark warning from the U.S. National Security adviser Jake Sullivan.He says there is an elevated risk, his words, elevated risk of this conflict expanding across the region and, quote, \"The risk is real.\" I want to bring in CNN's Nic Robertson right now. He's joining us once again from Sderot in Israel not far from Gaza. Nic, this time last night you were surrounded by the sound of explosions. It was so worrying. What are you seeing tonight?",

We didn't hear any impacts. That was the second such siren in about three hours. So there are still rockets being fired out of Gaza today on this location and other parts of Israel as well.Fighter jets in the sky above me. We're still hearing detonations coming from inside of Gaza this evening in the past few hours. It's not as heavy as last night. Not the tank fire, not the artillery fire. We are still hearing some Apache gunships and we've seen those through the day, but the tempo is down. We also know that the IDF has managed to get two miles into the northern end of Gaza, and for the location, we believe where they planted a flag, raised a flag over a building, it was right on the coast there in the northern end of the Gaza Strip. So it appears as if they've avoided areas of dense civilian population, and of course, this is a very important message from President Biden to Prime Minister Netanyahu today to avoid civilian casualties and we are hearing calls from more and more U.N. agencies, one that looks after humanitarian relief and refugees inside Gaza, saying that a fabric of society is breaking down. Their warehouse overrun yesterday. And food looted from it. The agency for children, Save the Children, is saying that they want an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. So the military operation slightly reduced in scale, it seems, but still under way and growing international pressure on Israel to allow a humanitarian pause, to allow some sort of ceasefire, Wolf, but no indication at all that that is about to happen.",

We can look at capitals in Europe where attacks on the Jewish community have gone up and the communities forced them to take steps to protect their own security at levels that are just -- would be unfathomable for the rest of the community.

General Hertling, what do you make of what Oren Liebermann was just talking about, this rapid response force getting closer to this situation? I mean, obviously, it could happen. I mean, where they may need to intervene and evacuate Americans. What do you think? LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes, exactly, Jim, and what I tell you as commander of U.S. Army Europe back in 2013, we worked with the Marine Expeditionary Units in the area at the time. It was a different MEU, but this one, the 26th MEU, Marine Expeditionary Unit, special operations capable. It is not a special operations unit but it can work with special operations forces, are trained to conduct NEO operations. And in fact back in my day about 10 years ago, we actually planned a NEO operation in Beirut out of Lebanon. It didn't happen, but certainly it could today, given the increase of tensions in the area. What I'd suggest is that rapid response force, that Marine MEU, is capable of doing all sorts of things. Contributing to the execution of a NEO is one of the most important things they do, but what I'd say, Jim, is when I was there, and this was a long time ago, there were 100,000 and more American citizens inside of Lebanon, and we were planning for the noncombatant evacuation of all of them at the time. Luckily we didn't have to do it. This is a very tough mission. The MEU will contribute to that. It has about 2200 Marines on board, the Baton, that amphibious ship that would contribute to this.

JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Well, Jim, former President Donald Trump did not talk about Chris Christie, but he did talk about those indictments and of course not in the same way that Chris Christie referenced them. This has become a central theme of the Trump campaign trying to use those indictments as a rallying cry. And in fact to his base, to his supporters in the Orpheum Theater here, they rallied to his cause. The question is, will others outside of his base? But the former president also made no mention of Mike Pence, of course who got out of the race yesterday. There was no mention of the former president's former vice president, but what he did say, Jim, perhaps coining a new phrase, taking a play off the old drain the swamp, he said it's time to build the swamp. He also wrapped in some election denialism in there as well. Let's listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: You know they cheat, you know that, right? And you know how you beat cheaters? You have to swamp them. You have to swamp them. Not drain the swamp. In this case, you have to build a swamp, OK, we'll build one.

That is very much an open question, of course all polling nearly a year out before election day is, in fact, very close should Trump become the nominee. But, Jim, interestingly, one thing was clear, even though yesterday the former president called on Mike Pence to endorse him, again making no mention of him here today. But, Jim, you just get the sense as the temperature starts to drop and the winner is taking hold here, the field is consolidating again 78 days before those Iowa caucuses -- Jim.",

As Republicans head into 2024, divisions within the GOP are alienating some of its longtime members. Case in point, one of those is Senator Mitt Romney. The 2012 Republican presidential candidate turned pariah who has been lambasted by many within his party for his anti-Trump stance, but now he's firing back. \"Romney: A Reckoning\" is a new biography based on dozens of interviews. The 76-year-old senator offering the closest and rawest look yet at his views on the GOP and its author, \"Atlantic\" staff writer McKay Coppins who spent a lot of time with Mitt Romney, joins me now. McKay, great to see you as always. I guess I want to talk about the book and Mitt Romney and so on, but what Chris Christie is saying about the field narrowing down, that's wishful thinking, obviously, on his part after Mike Pence dropped out this weekend. It's still very much Trump's race at this point. MCKAY COPPINS, AUTHOR, \"ROMNEY: A RECKONING\": We haven't seen any evidence yet that even as people are dropping out that, you know, the rest of the primary voters are consolidating behind a single candidate and that's the real problem. You would have to see significant consolidation for Trump to have a serious challenger. And that hasn't happened.",
