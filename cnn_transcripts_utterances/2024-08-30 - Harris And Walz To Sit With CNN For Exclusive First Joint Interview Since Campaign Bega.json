She was very specific on those policies, and also the issues of expanding our rights and freedoms, which, as you know, John, that's going to be a huge issue this election, the way that it has been ever since Donald Trump appointed the three extremist Supreme Court judges that took away Roe v Wade, that continues to be an incredibly energizing, mobilizing issue for men and women in this country.

She didn't take the bait. She said, same old, tired playbook, next question, and that's exactly what she needs to do, because the American people understand what a putrid person, what horrific character Donald Trump has.And frankly, what these polls are showing, the energy and the optimism and the mobilization behind Kamala Harris, is showing that Americans are sick of it, and they are responding to her. They are responding to her because she is the one who is showing that she's connected to the struggles and what American families and middle class families want and need. And you know, Republicans are going to be trying to attack her on this policy and that policy, but the fact of the matter is that she is threading that needle. She is not running away from the policies that are majorly popular, like the $35 insulin cap, the $2,000 prescription drug cap, the expanding rights and freedoms, protecting LGBTQ communities, making sure that students can actually get away from crushing student debt. Those are incredibly popular policies, and at the same time, she's saying, but we have to do more. That is not confusing. That is something that voters who are struggling can absolutely understand, and they're happy to hear, for example, if you're trying to buy a house that she wants to give a $25,000 tax credit for first time homeowners, that is very simple to understand.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): For the second day in a row, bursts of gunfire cut through the city of Jenin in the occupied West Bank. Israeli soldiers and border police are raiding the northern West Bank in one of the largest operations in years, triggering clashes with Palestinian militants who are deeply embedded here. Israeli forces have killed at least 16 people in 48 hours, according to health officials. Israel says 16 were militants. Palestinian militant groups said just eight of their fighters had been killed. In Jenin, Israeli forces have surrounded several hospitals. Ambulances must stop and be inspected before taking patients in for treatment.

From the resistance, we stand with the resistance, and hopefully we will stay standing and steadfast. Israel says it is targeting militant groups who have mounted dozens of attacks against its soldiers and civilians. In the Palestinian city of Tulkarm, Israel killed one man it says was behind some of those attacks. Mohammed Jaber, an Islamic Jihad commander. But at Al-Razi Hospital in Jenin, the victims of Israel's raids are also children like 15-year old Usama who to leave his home to buy bread.

It's a shorter distance naturally, and the people who are willing to take that risk, they do it because there's an opportunity.So depending on how this plays out, I think there could be some reactions from the larger shipping community to try to limit the potential of more hazards like this popping up in the coming months, and there are a few avenues to go, in that sense, through the banking system and the lending system, where you can have requirements to the ships that you finance that they do not transit this area, all the way to sort of a blockade, if the risks are continuing to be as large as they are right now, you could physically try to limit the flow of ships through that area as well. So there are ways this could, this could go and also then escalate in terms of the situation that we see in shipping, where you have much longer sailing routes for many of the ships today already, that could get even worse by having to push even more ships around Africa, for instance.

So they're, of course, very aware of the situation and able to use that geographical location that you have in Yemen for the Houthis to make a meaningful impact. And therefore, you know, get their attention that they are seeking as well, and as long as the hostilities continue against the Hamas. But also, I think it's important to highlight the deescalating situation further north against Hezbollah is also sort of a similar event that I think could sort of fuel a continuation of the current situation, which is very severe when you look at it in context of global trade. And I would have thought earlier on that it wouldn't last this long, but it continues. And I think the situation today is that people have adapted, and we're more sort of in we have the measures in place and the trade routes in place now, and we've adapted to a new situation.

Six are there. One is now out of action. Crashed, it seems, according to Ukraine defense officials, whilst repelling what they refer to as the one of the biggest Russian onslaughts against Ukraine of the war so far, over 200 missiles and drones fired on Monday night, part of over 400 we've seen over the past days.A Ukraine defense official saying that the pilot, named as Oleksiy Mes, callsign Moonfish, seems to have taken out three missiles and a drone in the hours before his plane went down, and what they referred to as a crash. Scan (ph) details as to how this happened, and international experts, Ukraine says will be invited to probe the details here, but it forms part, I think, of questions that may start growing around the compressed nature of the training regime for F-16 pilots. Oleksiy Mes one of Ukraine's most celebrated and skilled sent to the U.S. to advocate for the delivery of F-16 and, of course, to the very complex nightmare of maintaining these western aircraft in a war zone where they are target number one, frankly, for Russia. But the loss of this aircraft comes at a time when Ukraine is desperately trying to turn the narrative in its favor, launching that surprise incursion into Russia's border areas, Kursk Region for three weeks now, taking over 100 settlements with pressure now put on the Belgorod region to Kursk south. Local officials in Russia saying they're actually starting to evacuate people from those border areas to suggesting Russian may be trying to maybe receiving Ukrainian pressure from there as well. The same time, long range strikes by Ukraine against oil depots, ammunition site, airfields deep inside Russia, even up as far as the Arctic Circle, aviation warnings last week near Murmansk. And so this forms part, I think, of a bid by Kyiv to project strength deep inside Russia, while at the same time too, asking its western backers, namely the White House, to provide specific authorization to hit targets inside of Russia. A list of those targets given to the White House, they want to use U.S. supplied longer range weapons to hit certain parts of Russia's infrastructure, not yet disclosed, but that list also given to Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, a bid, I think, to turn what red lines are around Russia and being a Russia hawk into part of the conversation of the U.S. election campaign. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy throwing everything he can, it seems, into the battlefield, into the political arena here, trying to seize on the months ahead, ahead of the U.S. election and likely grueling winter, which may alter Ukraine's fate, if indeed someone new comes into the White House or old, who may have a different thought as to how much support Ukraine could be giving. But bear in mind, too, Ukraine seeing setbacks on the eastern front as well, near Pokrovsk, with Russia continuing to push forward towards that vital Ukrainian military hub. So, a mixed picture for Ukraine, but one where it's desperately trying to restore control of the narrative. Nick Paton Walsh, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Ideally, what we do is to do house to house vaccination all across the geography, that will be all across Gaza over a short period of time, five to seven days.

Polio remains a public health emergency of international concern under international health regulation. You recall two years ago, a similar polio virus was detected in the sewage samples in London, sewage samples in New York, and in New York (ph), there was also a paralytic case of polio caused by a similar virus.
