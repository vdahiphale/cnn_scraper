Some of his co- defendants have already surrendered today as others unveil new legal strategies in the face of charges tied to efforts to overturn the 2020 election in the Peach State. One defendant, pinning it all on Trump, while another is trying to avoid being booked altogether. And two others completing the booking process.Here, you see John Eastman leaving the jail. Remember, he's the lawyer that devises that six-point plan for Mike Pence to reject the Electoral College certification and try to block Joe Biden's win. Let's get you live outside the Fulton County Jail now with CNN's Zachary Cohen. Zach, we're learning more about the specifics of John Eastman's booking. Fill us in on those details. ZACHARY COHEN, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY &amp; JUSTICE REPORTER: Yes. John Eastman's attorney spoke to reporters alongside John Eastman after he was booked, processed, and released from the jail behind me. And he described John Eastman's experience in the jail as just like anybody else's. He was fingerprinted. He took a mug shot. And so, really we're getting our first look into how these defendants, these 18 co-defendants in addition to Donald Trump are being treated once they're booked inside the Fulton County Jail. Now, John Eastman answered some questions from reporters as his attorney seemed to be trying to persuade him not to do so but he was -- he was very -- he -- you know was adamant. He said that he had every right to file the lawsuits that he filed in an effort to overturn the 2020 election and that he was acting as an attorney for the former president. Take a listen to a little bit of what he told reporters this afternoon. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN EASTMAN, TRUMP CO-DEFENDANT: It represents a crossing of the Rubicon for our country, implicating the fundamental First Amendment right to petition the government for redress of grievances. As troubling, it targets attorneys for their zealous advocacy on behalf of their clients, something attorneys are ethically bound to provide. And which was attempted here, like formally challenging the results of the election through lawful and appropriate means. An opportunity never afforded them or their clients in the Fulton County Superior Court. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He said he's not spoken to the former president either in recent days, and he's paying for his own legal bills.

      "sentences": "Well, Boris, former President Trump is of course a habitual norm breaker, he's a rule bender and he's a persistent attacker of his enemies both real and perceived. But now, he faces serious legal consequences if he keeps that up. According to his bond agreement in Georgia, what is known as a bond consent order, Trump is prohibited from intimidating any witnesses, any of his 18 co-defendants, any of the 30 unindicted co-conspirators, and this includes posting or even reposting anything on social media that could be seen as threatening.So, that could prove very difficult for the former president of course, when you consider his rich history of attacking witnesses, accusers, prosecutors, and even judges. And there are of course many examples. He frequently attacked Special Counsel Robert Mueller in his investigation into Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 elections -- election. He called him and his team angry Democrats even though Mueller of course was a Republican who was appointed by a Republican. You may recall that Trump also repeatedly blasted his former attorney general, Jeff Sessions. He said that if he'd known Sessions was going to recuse himself from that probe, he \"would have picked somebody else\". And Trump of course has repeatedly attacked his former vice president, Mike Pence. He claimed on January six that Pence \"didn't have the courage to overturn Biden's win.\" Well, now, Trump is attacking Special Counsel Jack Smith, the man who has overseen his federal election interference case. He has called him deranged. He's called him a lunatic, a thug, a psycho, and he has said that he looks like a crackhead. Well, also, we have seen Trump attack the judge who is overseeing that case. That is U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan. He has called her very biased and unfair. And then when you look at the Georgia election interference case, Trump has launched brutal and totally baseless attacks against Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis. He's called her racist. He has alleged that she had an affair with a gang member. And Trump also, by the way, attack the key witness. He called former Georgia Lieutenant Governor Geoff Duncan, who is now a CNN political commentator. We just had him on the program last hour. He called him a loser. Trump also said Duncan should not testify before the Georgia grand jury. Duncan of course, did. He's going to be joining us later -- he is going to be joining us, of course on the program later. And of course, there are many other targets of Trump's attack. We've seen E. Jean Carroll, Stormy Daniels, prosecutors in Manhattan, to name a few as well. It remains to be seen if Trump can go more than a full day without violating the terms of his new consent order in Georgia, Jim.",

And the great thing about that thing -- that line you just had with Chris Christie, he was there. I mean, we all remember, we all can think back to 2016 when you know I was guilty of it, I assumed that there was no way Donald Trump could win. And even up until frankly, he was elected president, I thought like there'd be some miracle that would happen. And Chris Christie knows that. And he knows that this is just a repeat of 2016. So, he's speaking now. Others need to join too because by the way, if you think sitting back and not criticizing the former president is going to work, it's not working for any of these people. Nobody is really in the -- in the double digits. Although Christie's in second place in New Hampshire. SANCHEZ: Gloria, the approach here is difficult because if you go after the former president, you won't get his base.
