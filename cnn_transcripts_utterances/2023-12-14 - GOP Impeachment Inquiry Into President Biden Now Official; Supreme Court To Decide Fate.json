      "sentences": "Good Thursday morning. Thanks for being up early with us. I'm Kasie Hunt.Republicans and Democrats in Washington are reacting this morning to yesterday's vote in the House officially authorizing an impeachment inquiry against President Biden. The probe, so far, has focused on claims the president was involved in his son Hunter's allegedly corrupt foreign business dealings. The probe came hours after Hunter Biden defied a congressional subpoena demanding closed-door testimony to investigators. He told reporters yesterday that he'd be willing to testify in public where he says Republicans couldn't cherry-pick his words, and he said his father had nothing to do with his business dealings. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HUNTER BIDEN, PRESIDENT BIDEN'S SON:  And in the depths of my addiction I was extremely irresponsible with my finances, but to suggest that is grounds for an impeachment inquiry is beyond the absurd. It's shameless. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They say they need more legal weight behind the inquiry. And I'll note it comes after the White House responded to subpoenas essentially saying that -- arguing that the impeachment inquiry was not legitimate because it hadn't been backed up by a formal House vote. We remember back in September then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy opened the impeachment inquiry on his own accord, directing House GOP chairmen to continue their investigations. So yesterday, we saw that vote ultimately come to the House floor and pass in a party-line vote. All Republicans lining up behind this inquiry. And I'll note a lot of these Republicans are saying this was just a vote to expand the investigative powers. This by no means is a vote on impeaching the president.",

This is something we've been asking those moderate Republicans and, quite frankly, all Republicans, Kasie, is the idea that authorizing this impeachment -- taking this politically difficult vote for a number of these moderate Republicans doesn't make them nervous that this will inevitably end with voting on impeachment articles. Because look, if the House Republicans don't end up voting on impeachment articles it's kind of acquitting the president of any wrongdoing. Saying hey, we did this investigation. We didn't find anything. He's off the hook. Let's move on.And Republicans have been insistent that there is some wrongdoing. They're just looking to find it. Essentially, these moderate Republicans had said look, this is not a vote on impeaching the president. They have really been trying to differentiate between voting to authorize the inquiry, which would be bolstering the legal weight behind the impeachment probe. It would be expanding their investigative powers, saying that this is by no means a vote on impeaching the president. This is a step that is far -- that comes far before voting on impeachment articles. They are really trying to draw a line in the sand between voting on the inquiry and voting on articles. But you see Democrats are saying look, if you take this first vote it's probably likely that we're going to see votes on articles later on. HUNT:  Yeah. So, Mychael, I want to put up a handy little graphic that we made of all the times that there have been impeachment inquiries throughout American history. As you can see, many of them are in black and white, minus the portrait of Thomas Jefferson -- those photographs from later on. But it shows you how rare this has been, really until recently -- obviously, Watergate, in 1972. But I think one of the things we're seeing here is something of a normalization of the use of impeachment as a political tactic or tool. Is there anyone on the Hill that you talk to on a regular basis who is kind of warning about that?",

I really appreciate it. All right. The stage is set for another dramatic ruling from the Supreme Court on abortion. This time justices will decide on access to the abortion pill and the decision will come down from the court this summer, just months before Election Day. Let's bring in CNN legal analyst, acting professor at NYU Law School, and former federal prosecutor Jennifer Rodgers. Jennifer, good morning to you. This is a very significant development because the Supreme Court is going to consider whether to restrict access to this drug -- it's called Mifepristone -- even in states where abortion is still legal. And one thing that I think is important to note, too, as someone who is -- I have -- I'm right in the -- my daughter is nine months old. I know -- I have a lot of friends who are in their childbearing years. This is also a drug that is used in miscarriage care. And this decision could have far-reaching ramifications for women. And it's going to come right ahead of the presidential election. JENNIFER RODGERS, CNN LEGAL ANALYST, ACTING PROFESSOR AT NYU LAW SCHOOL, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR (via Webex by Cisco):  Yeah, it's a -- it's a huge potential ruling, Kasie. The Supreme Court is poised to say whether or not they meant what they said in Dobbs that this should be an issue for the states. There are at least half the states that want to continue having this drug be accessible to women for a variety of purposes. It's been proven safe and effective for over 20 years. And one judge in Texas decided that it shouldn't be available anymore. And so, they're now up on appeal saying whether the Supreme Court agrees with that premise. But it's really important to women all over that now accounts for more than half of abortions -- these medication abortions. So we're all waiting to see what the court is willing to do and how far they're willing to go to say that, in fact, it's not up to the states to use the safe and effective drug. That really, it's up to legislatures -- is what they would be saying in my view -- if they decided that it wouldn't be available I think more so. We'll see what they do.",

So we had previously expected this to start March 4, the day before Super Tuesday, but they've now temporarily hit pause. She says that she doesn't have jurisdiction over what's going on now because of the Court of Appeals. It's going to consider whether or not Trump has immunity. And, of course, the special counsel has asked the Supreme Court to step in and speed up the process. How does this potentially benefit the former president?",

I mean, if courts were allowed to go ahead and do their business and try the case before an issue on appeal were decided that would kind of undermine the reason for letting appeals happen before everything is finalized. So, she doesn't have jurisdiction to continue for the moment, at least with much of the run-up to the trial. And the problem is as we move along there are things that need to bedone, right? There needs to be rulings on what evidence can come in, for example, and other rulings that need to happen before the trial. And if you lose too much time in the run-up to March 4 you're not going to have time to fit that all in. So you may end up with a delay, which ends up benefitting the former president who, of course, wants nothing more than to have this pushed back beyond the election if at all possible. So that's what the judge and the special counsel are up against is this notion of just a delay that ends up pushing it beyond the election. So we'll see what happens. I think the special counsel is doing what he can to move things along. And the Supreme Court looks like they're going to take it up, at least in some degree -- so hopefully, they'll be able to resolve this efficiently.",

That, of course, would mean it's out of play for Trump and would be problematic for all of those who have been convicted on it. It would overturn those convictions as well.I don't think that's likely to happen. At most, I think what the court is likely to do is question whether corrupt intent must be proved and perhaps, narrow the definition of corrupt. So it could still be problematic for some of those defendants who have been convicted of it. It could require new trials. Any time a statute is taken up by the high court and things are changed with it you have potential problems for those who have been convicted of it. But this happens all the time with criminal statutes. So we'll just have to see exactly what they do and then that will dictate to prosecutors what they have to do next with respect to those cases that have been charged with this offense.",
