Meantime, new polling out of Iowa has delivered a gut punch to those inside Trump's orbit. And according to campaign insiders, this has the former president fuming. These numbers show Harris up three points in the reliably red state, but there's still no clear leader. That same poll correctly predicted Trump's victories in Iowa in the last two elections. We should note, it is one poll. Our correspondents are live for us now on the trail this election eve.

And I will tell you, looking around this arena here, and we actually have some footage of what it looks like just an hour before Trump is scheduled to speak, and it is maybe 30 percent full here. Now, granted, it is a Monday. This is a well-traveled area in this campaign, and crowd sizes don't mean anything -- everything. But Donald Trump, who has put such a premium on his crowd size and the brand he has built around the enthusiasm amongst his supporters, that it is quite notable how absent this audience is in such a key battleground state. Now, you mentioned that Iowa poll earlier. And, yes, that certainly has Republicans rattle, particularly because of how it showed women voters are flocking to Donald Trump. Now, I have heard from that campaign, and they are saying that the polling in this gender gap doesn't match the data that they are seeing in who is voting so far. They also feel good about the rural turnout so far. They see a lower urban turnout, and they are encouraged by their early voting turnout overall. However, those are the warning signs that we have been hearing for weeks from Republicans, that the gender gap is going to be a problem for Donald Trump, and the Iowa poll is just one more canary in the coal mine. Of course, it all -- what really matters is what happens tomorrow, and we will wait and see if those polls turn out into the results -- Boris and Brianna. KEILAR:  All right, Steve Contorno, thank you so much for that report from Reading, Pennsylvania. We are joined now by Oklahoma Republican Senator Markwayne Mullin on this final day of the campaign. And, Senator, I think we have some suspicions about how Oklahoma overall is going to vote. I don't think we are going out on too much of a limb to have those. I did, though, want to ask you about something that could impact Election Day for many in your state, and that is this tornado threat that has closed schools in some areas today and tomorrow. What are you prepared for in your state, and how might this impact voting? SEN. MARKWAYNE MULLIN (R-OK):  Well, it won't impact voting at all. Listen, Oklahoma's used to tornadoes, unfortunately. It's kind of like Florida had to be getting used to hurricanes. We just understand it. We had record number early, voting and especially in rural areas. A lot of rural areas, because they only have one polling place, like where I live in, Westville, Adair County, there's only one place. It's the county seat. And there was lines way out the door. Now, we didn't have three-hour wait lines that some county does -- or some counties were having, but we were -- we're prepared for it. I don't think it's going to affect the turnout at all. Trump's going to win all 77 counties anyway. So it's really not a big issue. And I'm not trying to say this any type of way, but, Brianna, I will be surprised if Kamala Harris wins five precincts. I mean, it's that -- we're or Trump country. We bleed Trump.",

And he always talks about our bringing America back to making America great again. And he also talks about fixing it. He makes points all the time that Harris and the Biden administration broke it and he will fix it. That's honest statement. But at the same time he throws out and he panders to the crowd a little bit by like talking about what Michelle Obama said about him. And he didn't talk anything bad about her. He's just like, should I go back at her? Because he has a tendency to go back at people. He's just talking to the crowd and engaging them. And his crowd loves it. That's why you see record numbers everywhere. I mean, the last stop I was with him was in was in Wisconsin and Milwaukee, and there was 25,000 people there late at night cheering him on because they love the guy. And that -- we saw that over and over again for -- I don't care if I was in Albuquerque, New Mexico, or Las Vegas or in Phoenix, Arizona, or in Detroit, Michigan, or Milwaukee or all the other places I have had the privilege of going with him. And guess what? The same crowds have turned out for J.D. Vance too, because they understand what the people are wanting to talk about. And they hit those points.
