The temperatures were below 30 overnight. There's frost on the ground. So this is a severe situation here. This investigation continuing to unfold in earnest. Law enforcement saying that this is an all-hands-on-deck situation. The FBI is involved as well as the state bureau of investigations. Right now, the big questions that we don't have answers to are what type of firearm was used, how many rounds were fired, if the two attacks are connected by ballistic evidence Those are the major questions investigation-wise we just don't have answers for right now. Here is the weird thing, though. When you look at what happened, at one of the substations there's a gate that was taken off the hinges. So presumably someone was able to take that gate off and then get close to the substation. A lot more questions about how they actually pulled off this crime. Back to you.",

You have to see this tweet. We're going to go through it for you.Noting that voting was much harder in Atlanta than when he lived in Chicago. He tweeted that he had to drive downtown because all the closest polling places had 90-minute wait times. He also had to pay $10 for parking. When he got to the polling place, he still had to wait 80 minutes. Once he got inside, he had to have his I.D. ready and fill out forms and wait in a room for 15 to 20 minutes. And once he finally voted, he noted about half the machines were not working. And the last tweet he posts a picture with his wife writing \"If you are poor or disabled or whatever, good luck. That should have been easier.\" Jason Coupet joins us now. He is an associate professor at Georgia University. I'm so happy that you're here. Thank you very much for this, because I thought what you tweeted just epitomized the difficulty of what people had to go through. Talk to us about how surprised you were, how long it took.
