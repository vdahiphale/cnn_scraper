And the concern for the authorities here, and they have evacuated most of the tourists from this area, is that if there are any more tremors then more of this will occur.The buildings themselves many of them are very, very badly damaged and they have got some catastrophic cracks. You can see up there particularly in the left of the shot you can see how with a minor tremor all of this could come tumbling down. Now, there have been tremors elsewhere in the country and it is the tremors, the aftershocks that are continuing to pose very severe problems for the authorities, partly because the roads are being closed. If they weren't closed originally by the earthquake, they are being closed by subsequent tremors. And, of course, those buildings that are remaining standing are likely to come down. Now, tens of thousands of people are believed to have been made homeless by this earthquake. People are having to sleep out in the open. There have been some miraculous rescues. Yesterday afternoon a woman was pulled out from under the rubble, having been trapped there for 12 hours. And there's a similar rescue here in Marrakech. But the authorities are having to use helicopters, aircraft to get to some of these remote villages in the Atlas Mountains. The foothills of the Atlas Mountains of Berber area traditionally has been extremely badly hit with whole villages being reduced to rubble. It is in those areas where the death toll, which is now just over 2,000 people, at least 13 here in Marrakech, but 2,000 people in the rest of the country, and likely to rise as the authorities pick through this rubble and discover whether or not the people who are missing are now actually dead.",

It wants to be self-sufficient. And it knows that there are huge economic opportunities by upgrading its partnership with the U.S. The U.S. have been trying for many years now to upgrade its partnership. It's an exclusive club, something that China and Russia are a part of. Well, now the U.S. is going to be a part of it as well. But we have also heard from officials saying aboard Air Force One on the trip over saying that the U.S. is going to upgrade the Vietnamese relationship to top level, and that there will be a security component in that. And we've heard that they are talking about perhaps, you know, helping Vietnam diversify away from Russian weaponry. That is something that Vietnam has used now for decades and decades dating back to the Viet Cong, the armed Viet Cong. Vietnam's top brass would go to Soviet Union and then to Russia for training.

And right now, the House Freedom Caucus, which is more than 30 members, is adamantly opposed to doing that unless they get some of the concessions you just named. They want this border bill included. They want funding cut even lower than what's been agreed to with the White House already. It stands in stark contrast to what's going on in the Senate where the Senate has advanced bipartisan funding bills out of its committees with Republicans working hand in hand with the Democrats.

Here is the quote. \"My focus is the House and presidency. You're in a stronger position as a candidate. You may not know this, but if you're not a candidate, you really can't raise money for yourself. And raising money for myself enables me to spend that on other people.\" And she added this, \"For the House Democrats, though, I needed to be able to still raise significant money for them as a candidate.\" So, maybe that's why she is running for reelection.

She has been enjoying taking a step back and working more with her constituents in California rather than running the House. And I think she really likes what she is doing.

It's going to continue that track and strengthen over the next 24 to 36 hours, likely getting back up to a Category 4 by late Monday or very early into the day Tuesday. Then it will start to begin that slight turn towards the north, but exactly when it makes that turn is kind of up in the air right now. Not all the models agree on exactly when it makes that turn, how much farther west it ends up going. They all fall within this red box here, but even as they go north, you have got everything from a possible landfall to New York all the way over into Nova Scotia, Canada. So, again, a lot is at play here. Right now, what's mainly steering the particular storm is this Bermuda high pressure system that's right here. That's going to be the focus of all that west northwestward movement in at least 24 to 36 hours. But as we get into the next week you have got a couple of more factors at play. This high-pressure system here in south Florida and also this trough. Both of these are going to work together to steer the rest of Lee over the next couple of days. But even then, the track will vary a little bit and giving us multiple different possible paths. So certainly, something we will have to keep a close eye on in the next couple days.",
