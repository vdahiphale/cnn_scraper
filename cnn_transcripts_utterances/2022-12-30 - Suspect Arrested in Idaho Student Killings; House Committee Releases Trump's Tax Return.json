They say all of that information is still part of this investigation. And even further, authorities are actually continuing to ask for tips. They say they've received about 20,000 tips. And all of that information helped them get strong leads that were able to help them pursue this suspect. And they want more information.

The biggest city is Stroudsburg. From our understanding, according to a CNN source, the FBI out of Philadelphia had been surveilling him here in Pennsylvania. And officials did say today this is his home and they were surveilling him. At the very same time, authorities in Idaho, the police department, the Idaho state police, the FBI were putting together the probable cause for that arrest warrant for a judge to sign off on it. And our CNN reporting is that a source is telling us what they found was that his DNA was at the scene. But in addition to that, that white car that has become front and center in all of this, that it was his car. And they did confirm today at the press conference that they do have the car. We don't know what jurisdiction, however. But once they got that arrest warrant, once the criminal complaint was filed -- and it was filed yesterday, we understand -- they moved in at 1:30 this morning and arrested him in Albrightsville. He did have a court appearance earlier today; no bond, no bail. He's housed here until an extradition hearing next week. But one more link to Northeast Pennsylvania here. CNN has learned that he graduated in May from DeSales University with a master's degree in criminal justice. So went on for more doctorate work in the state of Washington, it appears.",

It's powerful evidence. What it tells us is he was pretty much beyond a reasonable doubt there. You've got his car registered to him and you've got genetic matching of him being there. What it doesn't tell us is, did he do it? Proof that he was there doesn't mean he did it and it certainly doesn't tell us how or why. And that's where they're going to be expanding their investigation now. And that's what his lawyer ultimately and the prosecutor will be really interested in, is what are other people saying about him, his fellow students, his family, what his writings show, what kind of social media is there because establishing that motive will be so important. And you don't always establish motive by someone writing a manifesto, laying out exactly what their beliefs are. It has to be inferred. So that's the important step now going on.",

But I don't think it's critical at all to convict on this one.And from the beginning, we all knew that this was going to be solved not by people necessarily saying, well, this person saw this person in a video. This was going to be solved by crime scene forensic evidence. And the DNA, I think, is, if true, is just the tip of the iceberg. I think what you're going to find here is that, if somebody resisted, if they came in physical contact, there's going to be transfer. There could be his skin cells underneath the fingernails of the victims. That is more than presence in the room. And so I think we've got pretty much -- or I suspect they've got enough to take him down on this. The big issue right now is always going to be the motive. And when the police ask the public for something, it's because they're still searching. They don't have the motive nailed down here. And that's not surprising to me because what we're looking for in a motive, usually, is, oh, he knew that person or he was angry with that person or he was a stalker or whatever. No, I think you're going to find something deeper and darker about this than any kind of logical motive. And it kind of squeaked out a little bit in the press conference, when -- I believe it was Chief Fry, who has done an excellent job, by the way. Chief Fry said, we're going to get more information on his personality, on his habits and give it to professionals. Well, all the law enforcement people in that room and on this case are professionals. He had to mean somebody more like a profiler.",

And the difference is, if he had a reason to have been in that house, his DNA could have been there. He visited somebody, he knew somebody; we don't know that yet. If he had no reason to be in that house, then it becomes extraordinarily important. And as one of our other panelists pointed out, if that DNA is skin cells under someone's fingernails from the struggle that occurred, that resulted in defensive wounds during the murder, that is very suggestive of how it got there. So we have a lot to learn. The police are also very candid that they have a lot to learn. The idea, that they put it out there today, which is anybody who knows anything about this guy or his travels here or his friends here or his habits here, we want to hear from them.

As we've previously reported, she was texting Meadows, urging him to try to overturn the results of the election. She was texting things like, \"The majority knows Biden and the Left is attempting the greatest heist of our history.\" Now what's interesting is, in this transcript, which he's pressed about these text messages by investigators, she displayed something we haven't seen a lot of in this investigation, which is remorse. She says, quote, \"I regret the tone and content of these texts. I really find my language imprudent and my choices of sending context of these emails unfortunate.\" Now while she says she regrets the content of her text messages, she doubles down on claims of election fraud. The committee vice chairwoman, Representative Liz Cheney, she really pressed Thomas, saying the Trump legal team lost nearly every legal challenge they filed. She said the president's top advisers were telling him there was no election fraud. Does that change your opinion? Thomas doubled down, she said, quote, \"I just think there are a lot of things that are still being uncovered, so I believe there was fraud and irregularity, contrary to what you, the committee, believe.\" She also admitted before the committee that she has no specific evidence of election fraud, even when this interview was conducted a few months ago.",

It is strategic accounting. But when you see the zero number in 2020, they say this requires more looking into and that it actually signifies that there could have been serious failures, serious losses at that time. Now the other big takeaway here was his relationships with foreign countries. The first thing that we saw was that he held bank accounts in foreign countries, the entirety of his presidency. As you see here, in 2016 it was the U.K., Ireland, China and St. Martin; 2017, U.K., Ireland and China. In 2018 to 2020, only the U.K. Now of those places, clearly there is one that is the most interesting, which is the fact that he held a bank account in China. I talked to a lot of financial experts, who say they need more information on this. They want to know when this was opened, what Trump's business interests were in China. And is there any potential that that actually influenced Trump's policy or politics toward China because of the fact that he had a business interest there? Now when we talk about that, it also is interesting to see how much he paid in foreign taxes, particularly in 2017. Remember, I just said that he paid only $750 in U.S. income tax that year. He paid nearly $1 million in foreign taxes. And it is not surprising that a businessman with global interests would pay this kind of money. But what it does do is sheds light on where his interests were at a time where he was serving the United States, at a time he was in the White House. And some of the countries that he had these notable business dealings in include India, China, Turkiye. So he had these notable business interests in these countries while he was in the White House. And then the last thing that I do want to note here is that there were some claims that were raising a lot of questions about Trump's businesses, in which he essentially said that they made the same amount of money that they lost, meaning he didn't pay taxes on them. People were raising a lot of flags about that.",

Seven fell in the capital Kyiv where air raid sirens rang out shortly after 2:00 a.m. Child's corner says Maksym, our child used to read here.

The fighting distance goes from 15 meters to one kilometer. The distance between armies is very small.

In fact, a lot of these areas, 15 to 20 degrees above normal.The concern here is this system right here, that's currently over the Midwest of the Gulf Coast, that's going to be sliding into the eastern portion of the country, bringing rain showers to places like D.C., New York, and Boston. We also have a secondary system just now starting to enter into the West Coast that's also going to bring some rain and snow. Right now, the heaviest rain is pushing in across portions of the southeast. So areas of the Panhandle of Florida. You've also got areas of Alabama and just kind of winding down across portions of Louisiana. Out to the West, also some pretty heavy rain showers sliding in across northern California. This system is going to shift South. So other areas from San Francisco all the way down to L.A. can anticipate some rain showers tomorrow, unfortunately, for New Year's Eve. But the ones that most people just really want to know about is New York itself. Now, one thing to notice, there's a lot of heavy rain in the hours leading up to the ball dropping, but the good news is it should be relatively light at the time the ball drops. Focus on the fact that it's not going to be freezing. Temperatures will actually be in the low 50s at the time the ball drops. But, yes, you may have to have that puncher with you or risk getting some wet confetti stuck to you. Elsewhere, we're also looking at some rain showers in the Midwest, as well as definitely out across the western portion of the U.S. including Los Angeles.",
