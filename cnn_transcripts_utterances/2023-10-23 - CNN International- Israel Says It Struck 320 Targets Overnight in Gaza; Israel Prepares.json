I'm Max Foster joining you live from London with our continuing coverage of Israel at war. 9These air strikes come ahead of what Israel calls the next stage in their war on Hamas. Sources say the Biden administration is pressing Israel to delay any incursion into Gaza to allow for the release of more hostages and permit the flow of aid into the enclave. A warning some of the images we're about to show you may be disturbing. Patients are overwhelming the hospital system in Gaza, which is having to scale back on treatments at some locations. Fuel is still scarce and doctors say infants on ventilators remain at risk without a dependable source of electricity. Journalist Elliot Gotkine joins me here in London. Just bring us up to date earlier on what's been happening over the weekend because we haven't had the incursion yet. But the strikes are still very intense.",

      "sentences": "Perhaps the most intense that they've been, and Israel said that it was going to ramp up its air strikes on the Gaza Strip, on Hamas targets, and to that extent, it's been true to its words. So, as you say, more than 320 targets hit in the last day. We're waiting for confirmation as to whether this is the most number of targets hit in any one-day period. But certainly, our very own Nic Robertson, who's down there in Sderot just outside the Gaza Strip, saying that he for -- to his mind, this was the heaviest bombardment he'd heard going on in Gaza since Israel started those air strikes against Hamas in the wake of its terrorist attack on October the 7th.So as you say, hitting, you know, tunnels, operational, command centers, military compounds, observation post and anti-tank missile cells and also saying that it's been targeting a positions that it says pose a threat to its forces who are preparing for a ground invasion. So just more evidence that this is what is being prepared for if we didn't already have enough evidence with all of those troops massing and all of those tanks and armored, you know, personnel carriers and the like on the outskirts of the Gaza Strip. Of course, we still don't know when that's going to happen, and I suppose it's understandable that the IDF doesn't to give us any specifics. We do still expect it to happen. We had the chief of the General Staff, Herzi Halevi, telling troops we are going to go into Gaza. But one other thing that we saw over the weekend, this was yesterday, the first clash inside the Gaza Strip on the ground between IDF troops and militants from Hamas. They fired an anti-tank missile at the troops. One IDF soldier was killed, three were injured. Hamas claiming to have destroyed two military bulldozers and also a tank as well. And I suppose that also shows that, you know, that wasn't necessarily the starting gun to a ground invasion. But this kind of buildup seems to be building up further and we do now seem closer to the cusp of this ground invasion that we have been up until now.",

And the Israelis don't want anything like that to happen.And one of the reasons for all these delays is that Israel is ensuring or they are trying to ensure that nothing gets into the Gaza Strip that could perhaps have a dual use and help Hamas or other militant groups that are there not only to be there to preparing for a fight with Israel, but of course still holding more than 200 hostages. And this was the other thing that happened just before the weekend. Of course, two Israeli Americans released and that's one of the reasons why we understand the U.S. is leaning on Israel to delay this ground invasion --- this much expected ground invasion -- to help allow for more negotiations jointly, perhaps with the Qataris to try to get more of those 200 plus hostages released by Hamas and other militant groups.",

At least 14 humanitarian relief trucks sponsored by the Egyptian Red Crescent and the UN entered Gaza from the Rafah crossing on Sunday, carrying food and medicine.

CNN's Scott McLean has more now on the situation in Gaza and a warning this report contains graphic images.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): Those who arrived at the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in central Gaza alive are the lucky ones. There were five airstrikes this morning near the hospital. This video shows the smoke from one rising nearby. Some 110 bodies were brought here overnight and this morning. One medical source tells CNN the morgue is now full. The rest of the bodies wrapped in white sheets now lay outside in the heat of the day. Relatives try to identify their loved ones, finding them confirms their worst fears. Inside the hospital children, including a toddler are among the dead. Several of these victims were found with their names written in Arabic on their legs, an increasingly common marking as parents try to make identification easier if they or their kids are killed. This hospital is located outside of the area of northern Gaza that Israel has been trying to get civilians to evacuate. On Saturday, the IDF dropped leaflets telling people that everyone who chose to not evacuate from the north of the strip to the south of Wadi Gaza might be considered as a partner for the terrorist organization. In a statement the IDF confirmed it dropped the leaflets but said it has no intention to consider those who have not evacuated from the affected area of fighting as a member of the terrorist group. Even those who have managed to avoid the bombs are not out of danger. A trickle of aid 20 trucks were allowed to cross the Rafah Border Crossing from Egypt on Saturday.

It just happened to even to kids sometimes.We have a lot of kids, unfortunately, that are among the wounded.

Actually, many of the services are closed because the fuel is redirected to the essential and life saving surgery and services. But some people -- the health status of a large part of the population is deteriorating because they do not have access to the normal healthcare and it's become it's becoming worse.So fuel is essential for hospitals, but I we have to say also fuel is essential for water because all the water needs fuel for desalinization for the water plants in order to desalinate the water of Gaza, which is not drinkable. And then for the borehole to take the water from the ground and same if you don't have fuel, you don't have water and you don't have quality water. And currently what we see and what our team on the ground tell us is that people drink non-drinkable water. We had like 40 cases of diarrheas just information in a school in middle area.

So it's heartbreaking.I mean, what the people are living through now, it's unacceptable. And we are outraged by the indiscriminate type of bombings that is happening now. I don't -- we don't understand why it's so indiscriminate. Even war has rules and it cannot just bomb civilian like this. We have too many children, too many women arriving at the hospitals is not acceptable. The hospital by themselves, you know, the chief of hospital in where we have an MSF team working, I was talking with director of the hospital yesterday. And he told me it's like around 14,000 people IDPs taking refuge inside the hospitals. And he tells me -- he tells me it's very difficult to work because IDP are everywhere. They are in the corridors. They are outside. They are, they are blocking the entrance. Because people have nowhere safe to go. So they take refuge in the hospitals, which makes it more difficult for the -- for the patient to manage.
