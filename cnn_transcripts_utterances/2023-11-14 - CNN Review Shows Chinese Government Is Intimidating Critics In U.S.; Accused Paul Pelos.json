Driving here, it's just a weird thing in California to see an empty freeway.So they're asking people to telecommute, to not come in. What we can also tell you, too, is that they want you to use public transportation. But what else we heard from officials today was that they do believe that this was arson and that they do have some leads, but they're asking for the public to give any more information that they can.
