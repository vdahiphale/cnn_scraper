We are following political developments here in the U.S. as President Biden and former President Trump have agreed today to debate each other twice with the first presidential debate of this season on CNN next month. We do begin, however, with breaking news out of Slovakia, where the Prime Minister Robert Fico seen here is still fighting for his life following what authorities there say was a politically motivated assassination attempt. That video you saw there showed the moment security personnel help the prime minister to a car, later taking him to the hospital. The assailant, we are told, shot him multiple times following a government meeting in Handlova, two hours east to the capital, Bratislava. President Biden and many European politicians have now condemned the attack. Slovakia's president called it, quote, at attack on democracy. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ZUZANA CAPUTOVA, PRESIDENT OF SLOVAKIA (through translator): I am shocked. We are all shocked by the terrible and malicious attack on Prime Minister Robert Fico. Something serious has happened we can't even realize yet, a physical attack on the prime minister is primarily an attack on a person, but it also an attack on democracy. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

From the moment we learned about it, it does sound like based on official statements, he's still on the operating table and still fighting for his life. NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: It's a very dire situation and outlook for the prime minister at the moment, there were five shots, so we've looked at the video where you can see the prime minister coming out of that meeting in a building, walking up to a small metal security barrier, his known for going out and meeting his supporters. He's loved by many of the electorate, hated by others, is quite a divisive politician, but there he was walking up to the security barrier about to shake hands with a group of ladies who were waiting to talk to him there. And you see the gunman pull out a handgun and government officials are saying he was shot five times. He literally reels over backwards. Before his security team could pick him up. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ROBERTSON (voice-over): Pulled from the ground, unable to walk, manhandled by bodyguards into a car, the Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico moments after he was shot multiple times in an assassination attempt on Wednesday. Meters away, the alleged shooter immediately pounced on by the police, pinned down and arrested. Fico was initially rushed to a local hospital where a spokesperson said he was conscious his life functions stabilize before being rushed by helicopter to another hospital about 30 kilometers away for higher level care. Fico's office says he is now in a life-threatening condition, warning that the hours after the attack would be decisive. The shooting occurred after a government meeting in Handlova, two hours drive from the capital. This eyewitness says she was there to meet the prime minister, detailing there were no police checks for those waiting to shake his hand. But first, she thought someone had set off firecrackers. LUBICA VOLKOVA, EYEWITNESS (through translator): I heard three shots. It was quick, one by one. Like if you throw a firecracker on the ground, I saw scratch on his head and then he fell next to the barrier.",

To Ukraine now, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has announced an additional $2 billion in military funding for Ukraine that support could not becoming a more crucial point in the war. Russian forces have effectively redrawn the front lines from Kharkiv in the northeast to Donetsk in the east, as they exploit a window of opportunity while Ukraine waits for America's long-delayed weapons and ammunition. Kharkiv is under heavy fire as Russia pushes forward with a massive air and ground offensive there. On Tuesday, a Russian glide bomb attack injured almost two dozen civilians, according to Ukrainian officials. In a telling tale of two wartime presidents, Zelenskyy under significant pressure as Russia makes gains in Ukraine, has canceled all upcoming international trips while Putin perhaps emboldened by those advancements on the front line is traveling to China later this week to meet with the Chinese President Xi Jinping. CNN's chief international security correspondent, Nick Paton Walsh, is in Kharkiv. Nick, I wonder what the level of concern is there as Russian forces move closer to Kharkiv, and really how Ukrainian forces are responding given that Russia seems to be testing the lines up and down the front.",

That includes attacking Russian energy infrastructure, because ultimately, our leverage over Russia comes down to one word, energy.We need to strike their energy infrastructure within the Russian mainland.

The first one is you said is going to be hosted by CNN on June 27th.And what we saw happen this morning was basically both campaigns saying that they are going to not agree to the presidential debate calendar that was set forth by the commission on presidential debates. And the idea there from both campaigns again, was that we are not okay with the first general election debate taking in place in September when there's so much early voting. And we are eager to reach voters a lot earlier in the cycle. And our reporting actually is that there was some informal back channel contact between the two campaigns that had largely to do with agreeing that they were not big fans of the commission on presidential debates. Now what is going to be unusual about the CNN debate is that the Atlanta studio where it will take place is not going to have a live audience. And what the Biden campaign had made clear is that they saw these previous debates as having become big spectacles and that they didn't think the audience members presence was actually conducive to an effective debate. And one person, this is just one detail as we're trying to figure out, what is the debate prep going to look like now that it's only just six weeks away. One person that is going to be joining the Biden campaigns debate sessions is Ron Klain. This is, of course, the president's former chief of staff, one of his closest and most trusted advisors. He says, he's going to be taking some vacation to participate in debate prep, not really the most relaxing way I think to have some downtime, but nonetheless, he is going to be involved. We don't know the answer to the question of who is going to be filling in in the role of Donald Trump. I should remind everyone in previous cycles and back in 2020, that role was played by Bob Baer, the president's personal lawyer. So all of these details like going to come together as the debate prep really gets underway in earnest. But again, the two campaigns now agreeing that they are going to have two presidential debates, one in June, one in early September.",

I think he actually won the second debate. But by then, it was too late. He did a lot of damage to himself in the first debate.And the risk for Biden here is that this doesn't work. This is a gambit to reclaim the narrative. And the narrative that Trump is running on his strength versus weakness. If Biden doesn't have a great debate, if he looks like he's out of it, if the vibe is wrong for him, he may never forever dig out of his whole that he's just not up to a second term. So, both of them have some risks. I would just point out incumbent presidents, the first debates almost always go poorly. It happened to Obama, happened to Bush back in my day, and so it does happen. And incumbent presidents sometime they'll come out as prepared because obviously they're distracted by their day job.

Yesterday, we got a clearer picture of the contest in two key races. In Maryland, Democrat Angela Alsobrooks, a county executive, will take on former Republican governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, whose popular record in the state is shaken up what was expected to be a relatively safe Democratic race. And in West Virginia, retiring Democrat Joe Manchin has opened up a prime pickup chance for Republicans who got their choice candidate last night with Governor Jim Justice. He'll face, Wheeling Mayor Glenn Elliott in November. For more on these primaries, setting up and undoubtedly bitter and extremely expensive fight to control what's been dubbed the most deliberative body in the world, sometimes doesn't quite live up to that, CNN's Evan McKend joins me now. Let's begin if we can in Maryland because this is reliably a blue state, not just in presidential races, but for the senate, but now you've got a popular Republican governor in Larry Hogan, going to match up against Angela Alsobrooks. What is the current race shaping up to right now, who's got the -- who's got the advantage?",

For the next several months, what we're going to hear from Democrats is them making the case that Governor Hogan would not be the same as a Senator Hogan, that this is not the time for a kumbaya bipartisan moment that a Senator Hogan could be in a position, for instance, to elevate a national abortion ban or elevate another conservative to the Supreme Court. And in Angela Alsobrooks, they have someone who potentially could make history. You know, she would be the first black woman that Marylanders could elevate to the Senate. So that is why the dynamics are so different this time around. But Hogan has proved to be persistently popular in the state.",

And then you have Senator Jon Tester, for instance, in Montana, a dirt farmer who routinely Republicans have tried to pick off and been unsuccessful because of his deep ties to the state.On the Republican side, you see a lot of wealthy challengers trying to take on these incumbents. But many of them don't have local ties. And so that is what Democrats are going to try to lean on to hold onto the upper chamber, but it will be very, very difficult to do. If some of the polling, granted, it's early. You do see some split ticket cases here, like you look in Arizona, Trump's got the lead there, but Gallego has the lead on the Senate, in somewhat closer races then the presidential horse race, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, where the senators are out the Democratic candidates were senator out running Biden there.
