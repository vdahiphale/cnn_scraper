Just ahead, Democrats descend on Chicago as President Biden gets ready to pass the torch to Kamala Harris.Plus, can U.S. Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, help to get a Gaza ceasefire deal across the finish line? We are live in Tel Aviv and Tehran. And Ukrainian forces blow up another bridge, as they continue to push into Russia. We are going to weigh the significance of the latest developments. Almost exactly one month ago, Democrats in the U.S. were despondent, as the Republican Convention wrapped up. And to many, a second Trump presidency felt inevitable. Well, what a difference just a few weeks makes. Tonight, Democrats begin their convention on a high, with Kamala Harris surging in the polls and a star-studded lineup, planning to spend the week discussing why she is the right person to lead America into the future. Harris' boss, President Joe Biden, headlines the first night. Later in the week, we will also hear from former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton. Finally, Harris will take center stage, when she gives her acceptance speech on Thursday night. Our coverage begins with CNN Politics Senior Reporter, Stephen Collinson. Stephen, great to see you. Obviously, this convention is going to look and feel much more different than it would have had Biden stayed in the race. What do you expect? What do you hope? What are we going to see tonight?",

We know that the President is going to make the case for a Vice President Kamala Harris' presidency. He's going to call out President Donald Trump by name, according to senior officials. And he's going to warn that democracy is at stake in November's election, very much the theme of the campaign that he was forced to shelve. It will be quite an emotional moment, I think, for the President. He will be effectively ending a 50-year career in politics, although he will still be President until January, whatever happens in the election. And having spoken to a lot of Democrats, especially on the sidelines of Harris events, it's clear that he's going to get a wave of adulation. He's seen as a hero now in his party, because he sacrificed his own career in the greater cause of trying to beat Trump.",

We've got two former presidents speaking at the Democratic event this week, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. Obama will play an extraordinary, important role on Tuesday night. He will be trying to cement the pivot from the current President to make the case for Kamala Harris, and the need for Americans, in his view, to vote her in November, to continue this long-term democratic project that really stretches back to his own presidency after the 2008 elections. A lot of Democrats are drawing comparisons between the hope and the euphoria and the enthusiasm that greeted his campaign in 2008. And he'll be trying to, I think, sort of pass some of that aura onto Kamala Harris when he speaks on Tuesday.",

Almost every Democratic campaign event, including those of the former -- of the current President, Joe Biden, and events, even with the new nominee, Kamala Harris, have been interrupted by protests, campaigners calling for the U.S. to do more to mitigate the Israeli offensive in Gaza, following the terror attacks last year.Even last night, in the city of Chicago, there were sporadic protests all around the city, small protests, but still very vocal. You had squadrons of police officers on bicycles who would follow around these protests and cordon them off to make sure they didn't cause too much disruption. I think the overarching question is whether the Palestinian protests and the pro-Gaza movement in the Democratic Party, which did threaten President Joe Biden's prospects in a crucial swing state of Michigan, will that translate to the new nominee? It's possible that if she is able to create a wave of enthusiasm in that key state, which could decide the destiny of the White House, the impact of Democrats, Arab-American voters, and progressives who are not voting for the Democratic ticket could be lessened by comparison, but it's certainly a worry for Democrats.

And as you mentioned, the goal here is to try to use the DNC spotlight to shine a light on these pro-Palestinian protests. Amara, for the last several months, we have seen several protests. And we've been out at many of them. They have been, you know, at least weekly since October, and so far, we haven't seen any large scale challenges, although the Chicago Police Department is prepared for any problems that will erupt at this protest. However, Amara, I think what's important to note is that they say they have gone through hours, and hours, and hours of training to make sure that they can protect First Amendment rights, while also making sure that these protests don't blow up into something that verges on criminal activity. So, these are the balancing -- balancing act that the Chicago Police Department is working on.

So, there are multiple layers of security here. The Secret Service and Chicago Police Department, again, have gamed out every scenario. And they've been planning for this, Amara, for more than a year, and a lot of that includes what they call tabletop exercises.

A meeting of that length, you would imagine in what would have involved a back and forth in the conversation.And in essence, that is what Secretary Blinken mission here is to do to persuade Prime Minister Netanyahu towards making some concessions that he is opposed to making at the moment. The Prime Minister's office said that Israel supports the United States bridging proposal. That's the proposal to get around some of the tough issues around the Gaza negotiations. But Secretary Blinken's track record with Prime Minister Netanyahu in the past about getting him to sort of change his position. It hasn't released since October 7 publicly, at least, hasn't been hugely successful, but I think a two-and-a-half-hour meeting is indicative that that there's some substance that's getting discussed. Hamas had been very clear so far. And of course, they won't be meeting with Secretary Blinken here. They have been very clear that they think that the bridging proposal goes entirely in Israel's favor. They say that it's Israel and Prime Minister Netanyahu who's creating the roadblocks, and they want pressure put on Israel. Prime Minister Netanyahu, over the weekend, said, look, we can be flexible on some things, but there's some things we can't be flexible on, and other issues that we will absolutely insist upon. Now, some of the key sticking points. And as far as we know, they remain sticking points are control of Gaza's border with Egypt. Israel has control of it at the moment, the Philadelphia corridor. Hamas wants it back. The Rafah crossing, the principal border crossing to Egypt from Gaza. Israel has control of it. Hamas wants it back. Israel doesn't want to let either of those things happen, because they think that's the way that Hamas resupplies and continues the war, controls on the movement of people after the war is over back to the north. That's something Israel wants to keep a level of control over. Hamas says no. So, there's a lot of very contentious issues. How much they're being bridged so far today, I don't think we'll know about for a number of days before we can get a better read, simply because part of the conversation has to then go to Hamas, and what they're willing or not willing to do.

And the shrapnel from that detonation was enough to cause injury to one passerby. The terror -- the suicide bomber was killed in the attack. But it didn't create a massive, massive blast radius, if you will, which perhaps indicates -- and this is what Israeli authorities are investigating, perhaps homemade explosives, rather than military-grade explosives, but that will be the center of investigation. So, too, at the center of the investigation was he acting alone. Precisely, where did he come from? But all of the information available so far is enough for the authorities here in Tel Aviv to raise the threat level. And of course, it's sowed a lot of concern in the city here. Quite simply, this is the first of this type of suicide bombing in almost a couple of decades here in Tel Aviv. So, this is out of the ordinary. It's an escalation.

It comes as Ukraine attacks strategic bridges in the Russian border region. CNN's Clare Sebastian joining me now live in London with more.

It has redeployed some forces, we know, based on various reports from places like Crimea, perhaps even Kaliningrad, up in Kharkiv. But it is not -- it is much less willing to redeploy forces away from Donetsk to defend Kursk. And that is because they continue, as you say, to inch forward. We know that there's fierce fighting in several villages to the east of Toretsk, which is a small town, but still strategic. And in the bigger military stronghold of Pokrovsk, which is still, of course, held by Ukraine. They are now evacuating civilians with some degree of urgency, forcibly evacuating families with children, essentially saying that the Russians are far too close for comfort. So, Pokrovsk, a very important not only military hub, but sort of transport intersection, leading to other military strongholds. So, that would be a major loss for Ukraine.

And it can sort of distort people's perceptions of sight and sound, and can make them feel detached from their environment and also from their pain. A version of ketamine called esketamine, or the brand name is Spravato, is approved for treatment-resistant depression as a nasal spray. But we have seen, because ketamine itself is FDA approved, a lot of use of ketamine off-label has been increasing over the last five years, often through these clinics, many of which are cash pay, and kind of outside of the system. You can see prescription rates, and this is within the formal healthcare setting, have gone up more than five-fold since 2017, according to Epic Research.

Now, he's kicking off the conference, as you know, the President who's passing the torch to Vice President Kamala Harris now, as the party's standard bearer.

He will continue to talk about framing the election in a way of saying it's going to say -- that voters need to save and preserve democracy, that former President Trump is a threat. But again, he's going to say, trust the Biden-Harris administration. Trust Vice President Harris as an extension of him, as a continuation of him. But I also think there will be speakers that, especially from Biden, but leading up to Biden, a way of giving him his flowers, celebrating him, celebrating his legacy, because he is essentially retiring in a few months at the end of his presidential administration.

So, you know, when the polling was closer, and of course, especially when Trump was leading in these national polls, it really worried Democrats that Biden couldn't be competitive in these swing states. So, that's why they're paying so much attention to the national polling, because they know that Democrats do well with the popular vote, so the Democratic candidate really needs to do much better than the Republican candidate nationally to really be competitive when it comes to the electoral college. But, both, the pressure is on Harris to deliver even more so because Biden has stepped aside. And all these standard bearers said, you know, Biden cannot beat Trump. We need a new candidate. They got what they asked for and what they don't want is, in November, it to be well, were they wrong, and were they wrong in putting their trust in Harris? Now, anything can happen, and no matter what happens in November, it won't just be one thing to blame or to credit, but I think, because there was this last minute change on the Democratic ticket, you know, if it's not successful for years, we'll be talking about whether it was the right decision.

I do think you know that's why the Biden Administration is working so hard on this cease fire agreement with other nations. Quite frankly, I think there are a lot of nations, not just the U.S., that are invested in seeing an end to the war in Gaza, but unfortunately, it's not up to them. But, the longer it continues, the concern is these protests will ramp back up, particularly at colleges, as they start to convene for the fall semesters, and we know that the Israel's conflict with Hamas is something that concerns young voters, and just as Harris is doing much better with young voters, and crucial block for her if she wants to win in November, what she doesn't need is them losing steam or turning on her, quite frankly, because of the war in Gaza. So, it behooves her for that to come to an end. But again, it's tough, because she can cajole, and she has been critical and talked about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, that the end of the day, she cannot make a decision for Israel to come to an agreement.

They had their week with the RNC, but now we have moved on. So, Donald Trump is doing a series of events every single day for five days in battleground states.And here's the kicker, he's doing them at 3 PM, which shows you how he thinks he can kind of weave his way into some of the media narrative. He knows he's not going to get on TV later in the evening, when we have our headline keynote speakers, like Hillary Clinton, like Bill Clinton, like Joe Biden. So, instead, he's having these earlier events trying to seize at least a tiny bit of the spotlight. So, here's where he's headed. He's going to be in New York, Pennsylvania today. Tomorrow, he's going to be in a place called Howell, Michigan, which is a suburb of Detroit. He's going to be in Asheboro, North Carolina. Then, he's going to be at the border, obviously, talking about immigration. And Friday, he's going to be in both Las Vegas and Arizona. Now, the key thing to note about all of these events, except for that last event on Friday in Arizona, is that these are being called internally messaging events. That means they are smaller crowds, they are smaller venues, and they are meant to focus on just one topic. Now, whether or not Donald Trump can focus on just one topic, that obviously remains to be seen. Here he is this weekend. Remember, this is after allies have essentially begged him to stop personally attacking Kamala Harris and instead focus on the issues immigration, inflation, crime. This is what he said in Pennsylvania. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, Ernesto could be downgraded to a tropical storm as it moves over cooler Canadian waters. Forecasters expect the eye to pass near southeastern Newfoundland late Monday. And take a look at these pictures in Connecticut, separate from Ernesto, torrential rainfall along the New England coast caused major flash flooding on Sunday. Crews conducted water rescues in Oxford, Connecticut, when flood waters washed out roads. About 100 people had to be evacuated, and then, at least one person remains missing. A lot going on.

But everything across Central and Western Connecticut, where we saw some of the heaviest rain extending into Long Island, has moved on, at least for now. So, the ground, extremely saturated. We've seen a lot of rain in a short period of time. In fact, rainfall estimated totals really nearing the top of the scale here. We're talking about six to 10 inches with that shading of white across northern Long Island and Western, and southwestern Connecticut. That's why the National Weather Service still has these flash flood or flood warnings, I should say, where you see that shading of green. And guess what? These rainfall totals paint a really big picture. You saw the video just a moment ago, some of the search and rescue operations that are underway, and took place yesterday with this band. But now, with additional rainfall in this weather forecast, this means that we could see the threat of flash flooding reintroduced into the storyline once again, because the ground is so saturated, it won't take much, and if we get one of those storms that moves over the same location that was hit hardest by yesterday's rainfall, we could see localized flash flooding. Weather Prediction Center has a slight risk of flash flooding for Connecticut, Western and Central Massachusetts, extending northward into New Hampshire and Vermont, and we have been talking about flooding for several instances across the Northeast. This is very consistent with a warming world. We have noticed, in the satellite era, the modern era of record keeping a 60 percent increase in the frequency and intensity of heavy rain events. And that is simply because as the warm air, as our planet gets warmer, it has the ability to hold more water vapor in our atmosphere, alluding to additional heavier rainfall events. Amara, this is really interesting. 1 degree Fahrenheit temperature increase of our planet allows for 4 percent more water vapor to be held within the atmosphere.
