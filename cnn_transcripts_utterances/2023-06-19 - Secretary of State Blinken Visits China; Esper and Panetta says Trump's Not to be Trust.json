Just ahead on \"CNN Newsroom,\" U.S. Secretary of State Blinken on his final day of a high stakes trip to China. We are live in Hong Kong with a look at what's on the table as the two countries try to improve relations.Fatal gun violence is once again overshadowing a holiday weekend here in the United States. One attack claiming the life of a state trooper. And the humanitarian crisis unfolding amid a civil war in Sudan. We will take you to a refugee camp where many have fled the violence. Good to have you with us. With the second and final day of talks is now underway in Beijing where America's top diplomat is hoping to help steer the U.S.-China relationship back on course. Earlier, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken held closed door discussions with China's top diplomat Wang Yi. And on Sunday, Blinken held talks with China's foreign minister who accepted an invitation to Washington. Blinken's visit is the first by a U.S. Secretary of State to China in five years. Both sides have come into these meetings with a goal of improving their deeply strained relationship, but are playing down expectations with a major breakthrough. And CNN's Kristie Lu Stout joins us now live from Hong Kong with the latest. Good to see you, Kristie. So, what's next for Antony Blinken in Beijing and what have the U.S. and China discussed so far?",

And today, he met -- the meeting just wrapped up with China's top diplomat, Wang Yi. It was a closed-door meeting that lasted some three hours and Blinken may have a meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping later this day. So, we are awaiting confirmation on that.Now, Blinken is the first U.S. Secretary of State to visit China in some five years. And according to state media, we learned some key details that came out of today's meeting between Blinken and Wang Yi. Wang Yi said that the two sides must reverse the downward spiral of U.S.-China relations. And he also asked the United States to lift unilateral sanctions against China and to stop speculating on the, quote, \"China thread theory.\" Now, on Sunday, Blinken met with the Chinese foreign minister Qin Gang. They had candid talks which lasted some seven and a half hours and they agreed to maintain high-level ties. Qin accepted invitation to visit the U.S. He also called for stable relations. But China made it clear in both meetings with qin Gang, with Wang Yi, that Taiwan is the core issue. I want to share with you this minister of foreign affairs readout that came out on the back of the meeting with Qin Gang and it said this, quote, \"Qin pointed out that the Taiwan question is the core of China's core interest, the most consequential issue and the most pronounced risk in the China-U.S. relationship.\" Now, expectations were low going into this visit, these high stakes visit to Beijing. And before the talks, U.S. officials said that they saw a little chance of a breakthrough given so many points of contention between the U.S. and China, including Taiwan, including access to technology, including the flow of precursors -- they call it precursor fentanyl chemicals from China. Senior U.S. Officials, they say that Blinken's main goal during this two-day visit is to do one thing, to reestablish channels of communication between the U.S. and China, especially direct military to military communications. Now, also on the table were global issues where the two countries have shared interests and to cooperate with another. Issues like public health, like climate change, and global economic stability. Going into these talks, we heard from the U.S. president over the weekend, Joe Biden, and he was optimistic. He said that he believes Blinken's trip to China could ease tensions. Not only that, he added that he hopes to meet with a President Xi Jinping in the next few months. Back to you, Rosemary.",

The man who made that appointment is Boris Johnson. The video's release also comes just days after a parliamentary committee report found Johnson deliberately misled Parliament about his own separate lockdown parties. The report found that Johnson gave an unsustainable interpretation of the rules that he helped to write. For example, he insisted and continues to insist, in some cases, that the parties were essential for work purposes. Now, Parliament was scheduled to vote M0onday on whether to accept the findings of the report, which could have landed him a 90-day suspension.

It's fentanyl that is being brought in illicitly and contaminating the heroin supply that people may be using.

You know, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a website in which they list information about this, helping people understand how they can use fentanyl test strips to help keep themselves safe.And there are some places in the United States, some states in particular where there are some drug paraphernalia laws that sort of keep people from being able to have access to fentanyl test strips. But that's mainly a bureaucratic challenge that many people are working around has changed (AUDIO GAP). In the vast majority of U.S. states, you can now get access to fentanyl test strips, they're often being distributed by states. And they can be very effective tools. I use them in my own practice as a way to help young people who might not be ready or willing in that moment to stop using drugs for them to keep themselves safe. And for us to have a conversation about what it looks like to navigate a world in which drugs are increasingly dangerous, so that they trust me and come back to me when they are ready to get treatment.",
