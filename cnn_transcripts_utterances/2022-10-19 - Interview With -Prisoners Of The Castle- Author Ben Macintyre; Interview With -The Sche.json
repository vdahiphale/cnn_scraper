What is a different perspective? Actually, first, put Colditz into cultural context for our viewers. BEN MACINTYRE, AUTHOR, \"PRISONERS OF THE CASTLE\":  OK. Even the word Colditz itself summons up this grim, gothic castle in East Germany. It had 700 rooms. And it perches on a cliff overlooking the town of Colditz. And it was intended to be the most-high security prison in the third Reich. And it was used to contain all of the prisoners who had tried to escape from somewhere else. British, French, American, and the latter part of the war, Polish, Dutch, Belgian. But they were all distinguished by the fact that they had tried to escape from somewhere else.

I grew up playing the Colditz board game, which was this extraordinary board game that came out in the 1960s, and it was a very simple game of escape. The real story, I knew there was something else. And there is a lot more information on Colditz. The British government has now routinely started releasing its declassified files. And British intelligence played a very key role in Colditz.

It was really black Americans who were the backbone of that supply and logistic effort. It wasn't possible to move all these materials without black Americans loading and unloading trucks, driving those trucks, loading and unloading ships, clearing jungles, building runways. The scale of the logistics was massive. After D-Day, for example, this Red Ball Express truck drivers move more than 400,000 tons of supplies, ammunition, food, rations all across Europe. One of the things I write in the book is that we think about the supplies that were transferred across Europe after D-Day, almost all of them past through the hand of at least one black American.

Only the fourth black man to ever graduate from West Point. The army really had no idea what to do with him, because he wanted to be a pilot but at that point, they were not allowing any black pilots. And so, they sent him to teach at a black military school in Tuskegee. It takes several years and significant campaigning by black activists and black press for the army air corps to finally open its doors to black pilots. Benjamin O. Davis Jr. becomes the first leader of this first quadrant of Tuskegee Airmen. But even still, once they established that airbase, they still aren't given an opportunity to participate in combat. They are just flying training missions over and over again in Alabama. It takes nearly two years for them to get off the ground and get deployed. While they're still in Alabama, at Tuskegee, and it is easy to glorify that time there. But it was a Jim Crow base in a Jim Crow town in a Jim Crow state. And so, the descriptions of Benjamin O. Davis Jr. and others is that Tuskegee and its surrounding community was hellish in many ways. That the kind of treatment they received from white officers, white enlisted men, and from white townspeople was not fitting of black soldiers, not fitting of black airmen.

      "sentences": "So, the Double Victory Campaign was African-Americans call to have victory over fascism abroad and victory over racism at home. I mean,actually, if you stop to think about it, it was really profound that they were essentially fighting two wars at the same time. They absolutely wanted to defeat the axis and Nazi Germany. And they did their part to do that. And they understood, I think, earlier than white Americans did what a significant threat Adolf Hitler and fascism posed to the world. They looked at the black newspapers from the 1930s. There's already articles saying the second world war has started in Europe. And drawing comparisons between the kind of treatment Jews in Europe were receiving at the hands of Hitler and the Nazis and the kind of treatment black Americans received in the Jim Crow south. So, black Americans clearly understood the dangers of fascism posed and they wanted to do everything they could to win the military battle. But for that whole generation of black veterans, they come home and start fighting for civil rights. As one veteran put it, they went from fighting in the European field (ph) of operations to the southern field (ph) operations. I think that's important when we think back at that period of World War II that 1945, 1946, the war really kept going for black Americans just because the military battle was over, there is still a whole another front to the battle taking place in the United States. And black legends (ph) really helped fuel the civil rights movement in the decades after the war.",

      "sentences": "Absolutely. And the comparison is out. In part because Hitler and the Nazis explicitly pointed to U.S. racial policies to justify their owntreatment of Jewish people in Europe. I mean, what was important for me in this story and to start the story not with Pearl Harbor but to start it in the 1930s. As early as 1933, black newspapers are already pointing to the rise of Hitler and Nazi Germany. And point out what a dire threat this poses not just to Europe but really to the world. They point out these really explicit connections between desegregation of Jews on train cars in Europe, the kind of violence due to part (ph) experiencing, the theft of property, and how that very closely parallels the treatment of black Americans in the Jim Crow South. And so, you see these editorials repeatedly in 1934 and 1935. And then there is a host of black Americans who go and volunteer to fight in the Spanish Civil War, it started in 1936. Because they understand the coup by General Franco and his fascist forces against the Democratic -- re- elected republic government in Spain to be a significant danger as well. The headlines in black newspapers are just saying World War II has already started by 1936. And so, for black Americans, they've seen dozens and dozens of these stories through the course of 1930s. And so, well before Pearl Harbor ever happens, black Americas are ready to fight against fascism in Europe.",

      "sentences": "So, Medgar Evers is a name hopefully most Americans know. As you noted, he was an extremely important civil rights activists who wastragically assassinated in 1963. But as a 19-year-old, he's part of a group called Red Ball Express who were black truck drivers who transported supplies all across Europe after the invasion of Normandy in D-Day. And Evers was part of that invasion. Evers described his experience in World War II as being eye-opening. While he's in France, he has a chance to meet a French family. And he's there for about a week. And he said that it was really the first time in his life that a white person had ever treated him as an equal. Had ever treated him as a full human being. That changes his perspective on what's possible. When he goes back to Mississippi, he decides to dedicate his life to fighting for civil rights. On his 21st birthday in 1946, he goes to register to vote with a group of other black veterans in Decatur, Mississippi. Only to be turned away by a white man with guns. And what he said later was, you know, we black veterans have been on the beach at Normandy. We were trying to fight for America including Mississippi. But now after what looks like the Germans hadn't killed us. He feared that white Mississippians would. Evers takes on increasingly important roles in the NAACP. In Mississippi in 1950's, including investigating the killing of Emmett Till. Until he's tragically assassinated himself in 1963. And so, for me, like Evers story really clearly articulates that Double Victory Campaign that I referenced earlier. That Evers was absolutely fighting fascism in Europe. And as part of this group of Red Ball Express truck drivers, he was really key to the supply effort that helped win the war. But then he dedicated his life and ultimately gave his life to help secure freedom and democracy at home. Because he, like that whole generation of black veterans, understood that it wasn't enough to just secure human (ph) democracy abroad. It actually had to be true to America as well.",

That the way it's implemented and the kind of discrimination by veteran's face was a national story. That the ability to get mortgages in New Jersey and New York was almost impossible for black veterans. There are stories of black veterans in Chicago trying to get college tuition benefits of being funneled into vocational schools rather than to colleges. That has an extremely dire impact over the long term on the ability of black veterans and their families to generate wealth. There is a group of Brandeis (ph) who's been tracking this and they say that over the course of the programs run, the benefits that black veterans received from the G.I. Bill were only about 40 percent of what white veterans received. That ended up being about $100,000 over the course of veterans' lives. And you can appreciate what that means in terms of the vast racial wealth gaps we have in our country. The G.I. Bill and the discrimination that went along with it was one of the main causes of this kind of racial wealth gap that we have.",

The bill would try to address this racial discrimination in terms of how the G.I. Bill was implemented. It would provide ongoing benefits to the families of World War II veterans. Enable them to be able to use some of these benefits that their fathers and grandfathers were denied. The descendants of World War II veterans could use benefits for mortgages or for college education. It's a really important piece of legislation. I mean, because tri-state knowledge is really kind of fundamental wrong in our nation's history. The G.I. Bill should have enabled this whole generation of black veterans to enter the middle class but unfortunately, it didn't. This -- the restoration act would acknowledge that and then try to take a step towards repairing it through financial compensation. The reason it is having trouble getting passed is that, honestly, a lot of things in Washington D.C. are fractured right now. And I think for too many -- on the Republican side of the isle, they don't see this is something that is important to their own constituents. I think what I would say to that is that this is something that's good for the country. That black veterans served not a single party. They had served the nation. And so, this G.I. Bill Restoration Act is meant to write that wrong. And it's something that is beneficial for the entirety of the country.",
