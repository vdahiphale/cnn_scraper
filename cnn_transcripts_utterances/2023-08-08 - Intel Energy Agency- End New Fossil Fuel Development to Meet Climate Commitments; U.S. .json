      "sentences": "Well, the world is just beginning to get a reality check on what planet Earth will look like beyond 1.5 degrees ofwarming. This hour I'll speak to our Chief Climate Correspondent about what is the very latest report. First up though, back to back Russian strikes in Ukraine's Donetsk region killed seven people and Ukraine says the second attack appeared to be targeting those responding to the initial strike on a residential building. Meanwhile, Western officials tell CNN they are receiving worrying updates about Ukraine's counter offensive. One senior diplomat says he believes making significant progress is \"Extremely unlikely\". Plus, United States sending thousands of troops to the Middle East to counter Iran, their arrival comes out as an Iranian official threatens to seize U.S. vessels if instigated. Welcome back. You're watching the second hour of \"Connect the World\". July was the hottest month on record based on the global average. Temperatures went beyond that key 1.5 threshold considered by scientists as tipping points. Beyond that threshold, the chances of extreme weather events and water shortages increased to a level unfavorable to life, as we know it now. And we are literally watching it happen. These are scenes overnight in Portugal, for example, where more than thousand firefighters are being deployed to try to tame these wildfires. Now look this report does not mean that we have surpassed 1.5 degrees in the long term. But it does mean that we are getting dangerously close. The reality is our actions are not meeting the challenge. Fossil fuels are still being burned at a rate that is incompatible with limited warming. So tonight, we ask should we still be talking about 1.5 degrees. Well, for more than this let's bring in CNN Climate Correspondent Chief Climate Correspondent Bill Weir, who is in New York. I just want to caveat this conversation for those who may still be climate deniers out there we are not catastrophizing here. And we are not doom mongers or certainly not wanting to be so but Bill, we are talking about reality here. The International Energy Agency said in 2021 that no new fossil fuel projects could go ahead from 2022 if we are to meet that 1.5 degree threshold. That isn't happening, this graphic shows how some of the plans of some of the biggest companies are blowing past what is compatible. So what's your take is 11.5 degrees warming as a threshold as something to stay below realistic at this point?",

The world is burning more coal, for example than ever before. We haven't hit peak coal yet even which is the dirtiest of the fuels. And as you can see there, Exxon Mobil's business plans, these are just the short term extraction plans is 51 percent above what 1.5 limits would call for right now. Conoco Phillips, much higher than the Petro China is in the 80s. And that doesn't count for the billions that are spent every year finding new gas and oil fields finding new coal deposits, as well. So right now, if you look at the pledges for 2030, the best estimates for those targets take us about 2.4 degrees Celsius. The high emission scenario like the worst case is now just shy of 3 degrees 2.9. Now there's good news. You know, five years ago, we were talking about four and five degrees Celsius warming which is makes much of Earth unlivable as we know it right now. The fact that that's been halved, should give us some hope. But we don't know where the tipping points are. Say for example, for the glacier in Antarctic to break loose or for methane to be released from permafrost once it gets to a certain point. We don't know does that happen at 2.1? Does it happen at 2.3? And once it does happen what happens after that? You hear more and more from experts in this field who have spent decades studying this saying, I don't know. We don't know what comes next, because we're really in uncharted territory.",

Christiana Figueres, who ran the negotiation for the Paris Accords at the UN, and she was really the voice of the climate movement there. For years, she said big oil producers need to have a seat at the table, because without their cooperation, we don't get there. She just wrote an Op-Ed a few weeks ago. So she doesn't believe that anymore. When she looks at the business plans of just endless extraction for quarters well into the future, at the same time, we're seeing the temperatures jump up in ways that are putting jaws on the floor, she doesn't believe they have a table, and now they have to be forced into changing their business models. You know, we still live in a world where people do not pick it or protest gas stations, they may go after pipelines. But the consumption of fossil fuels is so ingrained in every part of our lives, it's the biggest challenge will ever face as a species right now. But, if you just do the math on where we're headed for the temperatures, how much carbon fuel has been found is already on the books of these oil companies are in big trouble.

And I want to keeptalking about solutions when we can and at every opportunity because, look, it may seem like the only climate news we get is bad news. And there's no doubt that the planet is under dire threat. But there are policies being put in place to try to push the needle in the other direction. One of those, for example, involves a concerted effort to protect the Amazon described as the heart and lungs of our planet. Environmentalists warn deforestation is pushing the Amazon's eco system to the point of irreversible damage. Rafael Romo tells us a summit starting today looks to head off a looming environmental disaster. Have a look at this. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RAFAEL ROMO, CNN SENIOR LATIN AMERICAN AFFAIRS EDITOR (voice over): They move slowly through the jungle. Their weapons are cocked and loaded. These environmental agents are searching for signs of illegal logging. It doesn't take long before they find what they're looking for. Illegal logging has been a challenge in Brazil for decades. But experts say it grew worse over the last four years, when Former President Jair Bolsonaro was in power. The commander in charge of the unit conducting this rate says the previous government only cared about solving emergency situations but lacks strategic planning to really combat the first station. He steamed later makes an arrest. In his first speech after taking office on January 1st, current President Inacio Lula da Silva, said one of his government's goals is to reach zero deforestation in the Amazon, adding that Brazil doesn't need to get rid of its trees to remain an agricultural powerhouse. ROMO (on camera): And now Lula is about to spearhead what he hopes will be an international effort to save the Amazon with the cooperation of all the countries that host the world's largest rainforest, although almost 60 percent of the Amazon is in Brazil. It also extends through Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru, Suriname and Venezuela. ROMO (voice over): Last month, President Lula met with Gustavo Petro, his Colombian counterpart -- a city in southern Colombia on the Amazon River and just across the Brazilian border. Last week, the Brazilian government said preliminary data from the country's Space Research Agency show deforestation in the Amazon has fallen by 66 percent since July of last year to its lowest point in six years. And this week, the Brazilian President is hosting heads of state of Amazon countries at a summit to be held in the Brazilian City of Berlin at the mouth of the Amazon River. Lula said he's going to try to convince the other heads of state to work together in a cohesive way to fight organized crime to take care of the Amazon and the people who live in it. According to the Brazilian government the meeting intends to start a new stage in cooperation among the countries that host the biome through the adoption of a shared policy for the sustainable development of the region. Efforts to save the Amazon are nothing new. The Brazilian government has raided illegal mining and logging operations over the decades, but the results have been disappointing. A study by Purdue University showed that deforestation drove the massive Amazon rainforest fires of 2019, which destroyed thousands of square miles of Amazon rainforest, roughly the size of New Jersey And according to an analysis by the Council on Foreign Relations published last year, it's estimated that between 17 and 20 percent of the Amazon has been destroyed over the past 50 years. And some scientists believe that the tipping point for the buyback is between 20 and 25 percent deforestation, Rafael Romo CNN, Atlanta. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

One senior U.S. official says that the counter offensive is proving harder and moving slower than they had hoped. Well, Chief U.S. Security Correspondent Jim Sciutto has been across that reporting for CNN and he joins us now. And this is worrying, frankly, Jim, what are your officials telling you? JIM SCIUTTO, CNN CHIEF U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: It's a marked change, certainly from the optimism at the early stages of the counter offensive, or even the held out hope, if you want to call it that a few weeks ago, as the offensive started slowly. I spoke to officials here in the U.S. but also in Europe, in multiple agencies. And the assessments are fairly consistent, and that is that the counter offensive is largely stalled, certainly not moving at the pace that even the Ukrainians wanted. And the concern being the time is running out to change that essential dynamic with the approach, for instance, of foul weather, when the fighting will become more difficult. And this is for a few reasons. One and we've spoken about this before. Russian defensive lines are proving extremely difficult to breach. And that's a product of the tens of thousands of mines that have been laid their complex networks of trenches and other defenses against tanks and armored personnel carriers. But in addition to that, there's a longer term issue here that I've heard consistently. And that is that the amount of training Ukrainian units were able to get in advance of this was simply not long enough, perhaps eight weeks on some systems such as the German lay apart tanks. And the intent, the goal of trying to create, in effect, experienced mechanized units to do this assault in the east was too tall in order to then expect success. So you have short term problems, you have the problems of Russian defenses, but you also have a problem of Ukrainian capabilities here. And while officials do hold out hope that it could change in the coming weeks. What I've noticed in these assessments is that that hope is growing, growing much dimmer, Becky.",

To concede territory to accept what it has now and make peace or find a path to peace with Russia, which by the way, as we've discussed as well. But it's not clear that Russia is interested in that at all, regardless, that this will lead to pressure like that, but also to some divisions, which we haven't seen yet within the alliance about OK, we tried with the counter offensive. What do we do now, in effect? Another point I hear consistently is that there is no single weapon system. That is a magic bullet here that if you were to send, say those Abrams tanks tomorrow, or even F-16s, both of which require lead time that one of those is going to significantly change things. It's a combination of things. And it's a hard effort regardless. That said, when you speak to Ukrainians, they have certainly been frustrated by the pace of some of that support and the time it took to get there. So you have something of an emerging blame game as well. It's natural as one U.S. lawmaker described it to me; this is the most difficult period of the war.",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Iran's brave women are fighting for their freedom with everyday acts of defiance like this out on the streets without the mandatory hijab.

Nearly a year after the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Jina Amini in the custody of the so-called morality police, the uprising sparked by her death may have been crushed by a bloody crackdown, but not the will of those standing up for their most basic of rights.

There are no signs yet of a military intervention, regional military intervention. But there has been a flurry of diplomatic activity in the Capitol Niamey. The acting U.S. Deputy Secretary of State, Victoria Nuland has met with members of the military junta on Monday, that was to push for a resolution.

BILAN: Not displeased and sure how splitted ECOWAS has become. And this translates also the unfairness of treatment. Because there were, you know a coup d'etat in -- Guinea, coup d'etat in Mali, in Burkina Faso. And the way they proceed was completely different when they come to Niger. Instead of trying to, you know, to negotiate the threatened to intervene military, I think that's a problem. So that has contributed to, you know, to bring together Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger.",

And I just want our viewers to get a sense here of what's going on 12 and a half million or more people do not have access to clean water, that's almost half the population. Only one in seven have access to electricity, and over 50 percent of kids aged seven to 16 are not in school.

And what so many people have a concern about here. If the coup succeeds, Niger will be the last domino to fall in a list of neighboring countries, as we've been discussing, ruled by military junta. What would that mean for the wider Sahel region, sir? DR. BILAN: If you look at what's going on right now, there, it's important to find a solution negotiated solution. Why, because of the geographical position of Niger. You know, who has access to Niger can easily you know, get in touch with North Africa, East Africa, -- Algeria and also West Africa. So it's essential that a solution negotiated solution, you know, can be worked out, otherwise, the whole region, the wholesale will be inflamed, and it will affect also the west because through the desert, so many immigrants can easily come to Europe.

Because I think any candidate will have to promise the Nigerian population that they will negotiate withdrawal of French troops. So that's a huge shift in the region.
