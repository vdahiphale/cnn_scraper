      "sentences": "Tonight, straight from THE SOURCE, Donald Trump expecting another indictment, quote, \"Any day now.\" And as his legal peril grows, so does his political power, the staggering new numbers, and 40 million ways that his base may help keep him out of prison.Plus, Trump's newest co-defendant, and Mar-a-Lago manager, emerges from obscurity, to the center of the storm, swarmed, today, by cameras, at his first court appearance, but not his last. Could his indictment end up helping his boss delay that trial, until after the election? And as President Biden reverses a Trump decision, to move U.S. Space Command, to Alabama, some politicians are blasting that politics is behind the no-go. We'll speak to one of them, next. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Tonight, Trump is predicting that his next indictment is imminent. \"Any day now\" is the way he worded it, in a new post, on social media. And of course, as with other target letters, and other indictments, he has been the one, to tell us about them. Though his legal problems seem to be growing, and mounting exponentially, his political fortunes are growing and growing as well. It's coming into a clearer view, today, just how much he is dominating the nomination fight. A brand-new poll shows that he has a 37-point lead, over his next closest Republican rival. That is 37 points ahead of Governor Ron DeSantis, in the New York Times/Siena survey of likely Republican primary voters. And more than 50 points ahead of the rest of the pack. So this, of course, is going on, two impeachments, two criminal indictments, as we are seeing here, as this is continuing, weighing what Republican voters here are going to decide. I'm joined tonight by one of those Republican candidates, in the race, former Arkansas governor, Asa Hutchinson. Governor, thank you so much, for being here, tonight. The Republican front-runner says that he believes he's going to be indicted any day now. Why aren't these indictments hurting him with your party's voters? ASA HUTCHINSON, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, they are. I think, even though he has a grip, right now, on the campaign, on his candidacy, it's a loosening grip. There's a growing resurgent effort, against the Trump GOP establishment. And that resurgent effort is growing. It's because he has misled his supporters. He told them that we -- \"I'm fighting for you.\" And yet, he's really asked of them, to fight for him, by paying his legal fees, in which he's used $60 million of campaign funds that he solicited from small donors, across America, to pay legal fees. And so, these facts, as they come out, are going to slow his campaign down. The last place, you see, it will probably be in the poll numbers. But you're seeing that resurgency grow. And I expect it to continue to do so.",

This notion that you're somehow going to just beat him, by kind of defining yourself, and maybe rolling out a great policy proposal? That doesn't work, in Donald Trump's America.

And remember, it takes a horse to beat a horse. And, right now, nobody really knows anything about the rest of these candidates. So, once they see them on stage, they see how they perform?

But President Trump, before he left office, made the announcement that they were going to be moving it to Alabama, a decision, I should note, that was backed by the Secretary of the Air Force that Trump had picked, at that time. There was later an evaluation into why this was picked. That evaluation did find that Huntsville was ranked first, Colorado Springs was fifth. This is a list of six contenders that they looked into, as what was the best home, for U.S. Space Command. Colorado officials said the decision was politically-motivated, at the time. There was a report that was done, by the Government Accountability Office, and the Inspector General, at the Pentagon, that found there were shortfalls, in the decision-making process, but still ultimately backed it. The Air Force Secretary picked by -- that is in place now, Frank Kendall, continue to recommend, having the headquarters, moved to Alabama, in line with that initial recommendation. U.S. officials now say that Biden's decision is based on the advice, of the Head of Space Command, that's General James Dickinson, who argued that if they moved it now, it would jeopardize Military readiness, given the time it would take, to move. GOP senator, in Alabama, Tommy Tuberville, is now saying this is a disastrous and policy-based -- politically-based decision that he says of course, this comes as he is single-handedly holding up the nominations, of more than 300 Military officers, over the Pentagon's abortion policy. That is the context and the background here. Joining me now, to talk about this, is Republican congressman, Robert Aderholt, of Alabama. Congressman, thank you for joining us. I mean, we are told that the Pentagon informed the Congressional delegation, in Alabama, of this decision, before it was announced publicly. Were you one of those? And what did you say to those officials? REP. ROBERT ADERHOLT (R-AL): Well, the last decision or the last conversation that we had, with the folks, at the Pentagon, and with General Dickinson, was that there was no reason that it had to be in Colorado. So, this came as a complete surprise, to us, today. We had no knowledge of it, before this afternoon. We got word, actually, from a reporter. So now, we were completely shocked, because, of course, obviously, we knew that Colorado was wanting to get Space Command. But they ranked number five, as you mentioned, in your opening remarks. And Huntsville, North Alabama was number one. And so therefore, it only made sense that you're not using politics, to make the decision? Then, it would come to Alabama.",

The girls, you saw it in the video, they all have their hair, and these beautiful bows and ribbons. And I thought, they mean -- it means so much to them, to be able to go to school, and to their parents, to get an education. And that's what we want is some future for the country. But right now, you can't even get to that because the violence is so pervasive. So, I think the first thing is that somehow we need to quell the violence. And that's not going to be easy, because Haiti doesn't really have the capacity itself to do that. It doesn't have a Military. It has a Police force that's really decimated.

CNN's sources, also reiterating that Archer did not provide any evidence, connecting President Biden, to his son's business dealings, as Republicans have alleged. That has not changed. And Archer's appearance comes as he is set to serve, a year-long prison sentence, in an unrelated fraud case, but something that still played a factor, in this testimony. CNN's Kara Scannell joins me now. I mean, that was the most notable thing, was him saying that Hunter Biden would call then-Vice President Biden, and put him on speakerphone. But I don't think it's any surprise, something happens behind closed doors. We got wildly different versions of it, from Democrats, and from Republicans.",
