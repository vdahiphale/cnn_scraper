JIM SCIUTTO, HOST, \"CNN NEWSROOM\": And I'm Jim Sciutto in Washington, D.C. Let's go to our breaking news this hour. It is consequential, a monumental decision from the U.S. Supreme Court, one that's not only likely to impact Donald Trump's legal and political future perhaps and this fall's election but affect the power. The very definition outlines the power of U.S. presidents going forward. Justices ruled that Trump and all former presidents are entitled to some immunity for official acts, sending the question of his current indictment by the Special Counsel down to the lower court as to what of that indictment survives this. It all but assures that the January 6 federal case against the former President will not go to trial before the election. In his written opinion for the conservative majority of this case, like so many others, decided six-three with the six conservative justices ruling one way, the three liberals ruling the other, Roberts rejected Trump's claim of absolute immunity, saying that not everything the President does is official and that presidents enjoy no immunity for unofficial acts. CNN has a team of lawyers, reporters, and analysts covering all the latest with the Supreme Court decision. I should note that the dissent from the court's liberal wing was, you could say with confidence, blistering, describing this case as, well, the majority invents an atextual, ahistorical, and unjustifiable immunity that puts the President above the law. Those are words of Justice Sotomayor writing in dissent, along with the two other liberal justices. Our CNN Senior Crime and Justice Reporter Katelyn Polantz joins me now from Washington. The split in this court bare -- laid bare for the world to see in Roberts writing for the majority and these dissents. I mean, it's stark.",

I just want to jump in really quickly to ask, because obviously, it goes back down in theory for the courts, for the lower courts, to figure out what constitutes an official act and unofficial act. And a big concern is, would this get worked out before the election? It seems less likely now. But, is there a scenario where we could see some sort of decision at the lower court level before the election, whether it's out of an evidentiary hearing or otherwise over what constitutes an official act or otherwise?",

This opinion does say, and Justice Roberts even writes, as for these dissenters, saying that they fear for the democracy. They strike a tone of chilling doom that is wholly disproportionate to what the court actually does today, that there is a conclusion that there is immunity on discussions between the President and the Attorney General, but we remand to the lower court to determine in the first instance, this is Justice John Roberts' words, whether and to what extent Trump's remaining alleged conduct is entitled to immunity.So, those are the proceedings we're going to see next. It goes back to Judge Chutkan, and she is very likely, in the coming days, as this opinion gets handed back down, sort of like a hot potato, right, the opinions of the Supreme Court, it gets handed back down. When it's with her, she then can set hearings. She can ask for legal briefings to interpret what the Supreme Court said today. She can start discussing with the parties how they want to proceed, how much time they need for a trial. There are so many possibilities here. And Justice Roberts does say it's not as much doom and gloom even if the other justices, his colleagues on the bench say it is for the American presidency.",

One line is this. Tt says that a court may not inquire into a President's motives nor deem an action unofficial because it allegedly violates a generally applicable law. It also says that testimony or private records of a President or as his advisors may not be admitted at trial.

They always have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt. This is a defense. They now have to rebut that presumption.

And it was one of the things that Justice Barrett wrote here, essentially saying that there was no reason to depart from the familiar and time-tested procedure that would allow for such evidence to be included, essentially ruling from mindset in the presidential phase of things.So, I'm just curious, can you sort of explain the difference between maybe when a motivation is created for the carrying out of a crime versus when a crime is actually committed, and how the relationship between those two makes a difference on how they are prosecuted?

That's something prosecutors always have to prove. There is another issue as regards to motive. Why they committed the crime? I think the best example would be in some sort of a murder case where the issue becomes, well, what was their motive for doing it? Was it to collect money? Was it to make sure they got insurance proceeds? What motivated them to do it? So, that becomes an issue when facts exist, and a defendant says, well, that was not something that showed my motive or my intent, but rather, that was just something I did, and then prosecutors use prior bad acts that are committed. So, that's where it gets a little bit murky there.But, you always have to prove intent. What was the intent behind it? I think they're focusing here on motive, because a lot of the government's argument and certainly will continue to be, he was trying to overturn the election and he was doing that because he was motivated to do that as a candidate. A candidate is not entitled to immunity. Only a President is. And so, that's why they will try to use motive. Well, the majority here has cut that out, and it's going to make it more difficult for the government to rebut this presumption of immunity.",

And if he meets with objections, he meets with objections. But, he is going to have to move forward. At that point, the case doesn't stop if there is error on the side of the judge in favor of the prosecution, then that's a subject of a direct appeal if there is a conviction.

And then also, as we became more involved in world affairs and were involved in two World Wars and many other military battles, and this is part of the 9/11 story, many people think again, the President needs more power to act decisively.This is yet another layer. This is about making the President immune from wrongdoing, rather than empowering the President to take action when the nation needs it.

Of course, that would clearly be without -- outside the bounds of presidential power. And I'm not saying this court wrote in so many words a President can assassinate his opponent, his or her opponent, by ordering SEAL Team Six to do so.But, it seems to have set up a quite high threshold for prosecution and a quite broad definition of how a President might justify such actions and set limits on even questioning the President's motives for certain actions in office.

And then, it happened. And the defense is exactly what we're hearing. The defense says he was actually, President Trump, trying to stop fraud, trying to look for fraud, trying to maintain the integrity of the election by trying to overturn it.So, this is an argument I think that can be used quite easily. And we've seen in the history of national security, by the way, that presidents are kind of very broad in how they conceive of what the government can do in the name of defending the nation.

She is a senior contributor for Axios, and Director of the Institute for Democracy, Journalism and Citizenship at Syracuse University, and rejoining us is former Miami-Dade County Court judge Jeff Swartz. Margaret, I want to start with you outside of the legal scope of things for a minute, because we're already seeing the Trump campaign, Trump himself, declaring this a victory. And of course, we're in the middle of a campaign year and this was a major, I don't know if litmus test is the word, but to see how this would affect all of the trial proceedings against them, and in the next respect, how voters interpreted who they may be voting for. But, I'm curious within that space, the way you see it, how does this ruling affect Donald Trump's standing politically, and among the American people, especially if this is in a position where it doesn't go to trial before the election? MARGARET TALEV, SENIOR CONTRIBUTOR, AXIOS, &amp; INSTITUTE FOR DEMOCRACY, JOURNALISM &amp; CITIZENSHIP INSTITUTE/ SYRACUSE UNIV.: Yeah. Well, Omar, clearly, if it does not go to trial before the election, and it certainly looks like that's a -- the trajectory at this point, that will help Donald Trump, obviously. But, will the Biden campaign attempt to take this verdict and use it to say, these are the stakes and to try to change the narrative that has emerged from his debate performance a few days ago? Yes, certainly, they will try to do that. But, if you're Donald Trump, the last week has been definitively good for you. He emerged stronger from that debate. He is emerging stronger from this ruling. And while this ruling does look like sort of a mixed verdict, like if you would have asked conventional wisdom, most people probably would have said, yes, the court is probably going to say there is different immunity protection from the President doing official acts versus unofficial acts. The reality is that it's very unclear how this will actually shake out now. It could impact not just the Jack Smith case, but literally every prosecution that Trump faces right now, including the conviction that just happened in New York. And it is just one more sort of chaos factor in a race in an election year that is already very confusing for voters. The Biden campaign, meanwhile, has its own major problems to deal with and now the implications of this as well. So, when you look at Sotomayor's ruling, you might say, is it overblown, or does she go too far?

The thought process that Haldeman and Ehrlichman, for those who don't -- didn't weren't around at the time, were the main advisors to Richard Nixon, when they were charged with crimes, they went in and claimed that they were immune from prosecution because of presidential immunity, because of, what was it, the fact that because of working executive immunity, that type of thing, they clearly made that argument and it was rejected.So, what we're seeing here is almost a reversal of those convictions that in fact Haldeman and Ehrlichman could not have been held liable because they were involved and engaged in conversations with the President of the United States. And since, the President is supposedly involved in doing his job, they're involved in doing their job or assisting or advising the President, and therefore they cannot be charged either. We're going to see those motions in Atlanta. We're going to see those motions in Washington. I think the effect on the documents case is minuscule because all of the acts for which Donald Trump is charged, all occurred after he left office. He is not charged with taking the documents. He is charged with keeping them when he was ordered to return them. So, that case, which is now being protected by Judge Cannon on, another judicial rulings that are protecting him from prosecution is there.

He attended this private school, and at 16, he joined the National Rally.VANDOORNE (voice-over): Around here, people know his name, but they remain divided. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (Interpreted): I'm rather proud of the fact that he is aware of our problems here, that he knows our reality. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (Interpreted): If you're not white, if you don't have a typical French name, we're not considered French. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (Interpreted): I know the struggles that students face here, and I don't feel that he is representing young people. VANDOORNE (voice-over): Bardella was handpicked by Marine Le Pen to be her successor, in an effort to detoxify and normalize the party that was founded by former French members of Hitler's SS. Though he lacks experience, he and Le Pen form a powerful duo. BARDELLA (Interpreted): She is the political leader and I'm the army general. We work together in harmony. VANDOORNE (voice-over): First, a strong standing in the European elections, now a real shot at the parliament, and finally, another go at the presidency by Le Pen, all with one man firmly in their sights. BARDELLA (Interpreted): The first person who erased France has a name. It's Emmanuel Macron. VANDOORNE (voice-over): Saskya Vandoorne, CNN, Paris. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
