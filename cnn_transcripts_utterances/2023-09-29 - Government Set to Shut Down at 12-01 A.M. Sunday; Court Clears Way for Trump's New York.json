We know at least eight hard-line Republicans who said there's no circumstance, no way in which they would vote for a short-term stopgap measure to keep the government funded while they negotiate a fuller spending package for one fiscal year.Right now, that means that Kevin McCarthy is going to go to the floor around 11:30 this morning, try to get a procedural vote passed on this bill, and likely it will fail. In the past, procedural votes were no big deal. House Republicans or the majority would vote for them even if members had concerns about the underlying bill. But as House Speaker Kevin McCarthy's future is uncertain, hardliners used those procedural votes as a way to show McCarthy that they are serious and frustrated with his leadership. Meanwhile, question, looming whether McCarthy is going to be able to keep his job for very long. We know that Matt Gaetz, a hard-line conservative, has been warning for weeks now that at any moment he could bring a motion to vacate, a vote to oust the speaker from his position. Obviously, one of the key concerns, one of the key problems for hardliners who want to move forward with that is who would they have replacing McCarthy. No one, it seems, really wants that job.

Let me just give you one quick example. Mar-a-Lago, the actual buildings, the plant there, was assessed by the Palm Beach County Assessor, not some partisan interest, at being worth about $20 million. But Donald Trump and his paperwork claimed that Mar-a-Lago was worth $500 million. I did the math on that, that's a lot. Now, why would they do this? Because they would go then to banks, including Deutsche Bank and others, and they would use those inflated values to get higher loans than they might otherwise get at better interest rates. Now, important to know, the A.G. has already won an important piece of this case. Donald Trump has lost that piece of the case. The judge on this case, Judge Arthur Engoron, issued a ruling a couple days ago giving a judgment for the attorney general on one of the counts in the case for repetitive, persistent fraud.

First of all, Donald Trump has argued and will continue to argue, these assessments of real estate value, there is some subjectivity, reasonable minds can differ. But the judge has said, yes, but not by 25 times.They're also going to argue, Trump's team, that they had these waivers, that what they call the worthless clause, saying our numbers here, they're worthless, don't pay attention to them. But the judge has said, that worthless clause itself is worthless. And then, finally, Trump's team is going to argue, there's no victim here, there's no loss, the banks hold it.",

Jeffrey Clark is in the process of making that argument. He could lose at any moment. I think he will lose. But Donald Trump's team said, no, we're actually going to stay in state court.I think there're two strategic reasons that could be driving this. One, the state judge has been right down the middle. He's given some rulings that I think Trump likes. I think they want to stay with him. Second of all, that state trial is very far off. They're going to get to see the early trial first. I think they like the timing, the procedural posture they're in. I think they're worried that if they got moved to federal court, they could be put on a fast track.",
