The Gaza Health Ministry, which is controlled by Hamas, says Israeli airstrikes left 50 people dead in various parts of the enclave.A hospital director says more than 20 of them were killed when an apparent Israeli airstrike hit a residential building in Rafah. Among the dead, 12 children and four women, according to a medical source. An Israeli medical spokesperson told CNN Rafah is supposed to be a designated humanitarian area but claims Hamas is using that to its advantage. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAJ. DORON SPIELMAN, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES SPOKESMAN: The issue is, is that Hamas are firing constant rockets from that area towards Israel. We have numerous rockets that have been fired. We have thousands of rockets that have been fired since October 7th. And many of them, especially today, come directly from that area. And I think, like any army in the world, if there is rocket fire coming from a location, before those rockets hit your people, you try to disable them and eliminate them. The problem is Hamas are firing them from civilian areas. That is constantly the problem, again, and again, and again in Gaza. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Months now into its war, senior leadership is still alive, Hamas rockets are being fired, fighters are still fighting, 100 hostages are still being held. How successful, then, has Israel been in its core aims? KHALED ELGINDY, SENIOR FELLOW, MIDDLE EAST INSTITUTE: Well, as far as the stated aims of destroying Hamas, it's been not successful. We still see almost three months here. Hamas still has the ability to launch many rockets. Its command and control is still intact. There's nothing that the Israeli military, or political leadership, can point to as a victory. But I think we also need to consider that there are some unstated aims in this war, as well. We know, for example, that Israel is using starvation as a tool, as a weapon of war, we know that it is repeatedly bombing civilian areas. We know that they systematically also attacked hospitals and healthcare facilities. So I think we have to consider the possibility that Israel isn't merely targeting Hamas, but also, targeting the entire population of Gaza as a whole.

Clashes broke out in several locations in the occupied West Bank. The Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah says one man was killed in the city following an Israeli incursion there. Four people were wounded, including a journalist. The IDF says it responded with live fire after, quote, \"assailants opened fire\" and threw explosive devices and Molotov cocktails. Meanwhile, UNICEF released a report on Thursday that found 2023 was the deadliest year for children in the West Bank amid the escalating violence. The U.N. agency says 124 Palestinian children and six Israeli children were killed since the beginning of the year. More than 80 of them in the past 12 weeks alone. A U.S. Navy destroyer in the Red Sea shot down a drone, and a ballistic missile launched from Yemen on Thursday. The U.S. Central Command says the launches were carried out by the Houthis, an Iranian proxy in Yemen. It's the latest incident in a spate of attacks in recent weeks in the Red Sea, one of the most important maritime shipping routes in the world. On Tuesday, the U.S. military shot down a barrage of drones and missiles over a ten-hour period. It comes as the U.S. Treasury Department on Thursday imposed sanctions on one individual, and three businesses, for facilitating the flow of Iranian money to Houthi forces. Western nations are jointly condemning Iran for increasing production of highly-enriched uranium. The U.S. and the E3 -- that is Germany, France, and the U.K. -- issued the statement after the release of the report from the United Nations nuclear watchdog. It found that Iran is now producing more uranium enriched up to 60 percent at the Netanz and Fordow facilities. Iran insists its program is for nuclear power, but that only requires uranium to be enriched to 3 to 5 percent. The E3 nations remain party to the 2015 deal that kept Iran's enrichment activities at less than 4 percent. But the U.S., of course, withdrew under the presidency of Donald Trump in 2018, claiming Iran wasn't living up to its end, something that its partners in the deal rejected. Maine is now the second state in the United States to remove former President Trump from the ballot from next year's Republican primary based on the 14th Amendment's insurrectionist ban.

They reveal the last-minute scramble on the eve of January 6th to get those fake certificates to Washington D.C. Take a listen to Chesebro describing what happened when Trump campaign officials realized that the ballots from Michigan and Wisconsin were stuck in the mail. KENNETH CHESEBRO, PRO-TRUMP ATTORNEY: The general counsel of the Trump campaign is freaked out that Roman reported that the Michigan votes are still in the service of Michigan, which doesn't look like they're going to get to Pence in time. So, the general counsel of the campaign was alarmed, and -- and was chartering -- they didn't have to charter a jet, but they did commercial. This is like, yes,  so this is a high-level decision to get the Michigan and Wisconsin votes there. And they -- they had to enlist a -- you know, a U.S. senator to -- to try to expedite it, to get it to Pence in time. COHEN (voice-over): Now, remember, they needed to get those ballots to the House floor, because they wanted to have Mike Pence throw out Joe Biden's real electors, and replace them with Donald Trump's fake electors. In the end, the campaign didn't charter a jet. Staffers booked last- minute tickets on commercial flights. And they ferried the ballots to D.C. on January 5th. Once they got to D.C., it was a series of handoffs and careers that even included some help from Senator Ron Johnson's office. The ballots eventually reached the capital in time, but Pence's team said they didn't want them. He refused to go along with the plan.",

It comes as the country implements an increasingly conservative social agenda.CNN's Bianca Nobilo with the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BIANCA NOBILO, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Dress code optional, quite literally. An almost-naked-themed party hosted by a popular blogger in the lead-up to the holidays in Moscow has gone viral in Russia. Blogger Anastasia Ivleeva organized the party in the heart of Moscow's nightclub district on December 21st. Party goers showed up half- clothed or with barely anything on, with outfits made of mesh, lingerie, and other creative materials to strategically cover limited parts of their body. But photos of the almost naked party goers have sparked outrage across some parts of Russian society. Internal criticism has mounted about how a party of this nature could go ahead as Russians continue fighting on the frontlines in Ukraine. Orthodox church officials, pro-war activists, and pro-Kremlin lawmakers have all denounced the scantily-clad party goers. Attendees are now facing legal action. A court verdict against the party said the event was aimed at propagating nontraditional sexual relationships. Rapper Vacio, who showed up wearing a sock covering his intimate areas and not much else, has been found guilty of \"petty hooliganism\" by the Russian courts. He has been sentenced to 15 days in jail and fined 200,000 rubles or roughly $2,200. Planned new year's parties organized by celebrities who attended the party have been replaced with other stars. Ivleeva apologized via her Instagram page, posting a 21-minute video asking for forgiveness and a second chance. Other celebrity party goers have followed suit. In a previous video, Ivleeva claimed the event was an opportunity to showcase photos created during her tenure as the chief editor of the now-defunct Russian edition of \"Playboy.\" Ivleeva also faces legal action and hefty fines. A collective lawsuit filed against Ivleeva on Tuesday by 22 people and initiated by a Russian actor, six compensations of one billion rubles -- That's $11 million -- for moral damages. Backlash against the party comes as authorities in the country are pushing an increasingly conservative and homophobic agenda.

According to an annual wine production report, global wine production in 2023 was the lowest in 60 years. Now, France is targeting food manufacturers, retailers, and other industries to help curb plastic pollution. Its anti-waste law calls for 100 percent recycling of plastic by 2025. That's not far off. And it aims to phase out all single-use plastic packaging by 2040. To that end, starting on January the 1st, plastic packaging for fresh fruits and vegetables will be banned. Restaurants will have to provide reusable food service where retailers will have to supply reusable containers, and public institutions must install water fountains. Joining me now, Richard Steiner, a marine biologist and conservation scientist, to talk plastic. I want to start with a quote from \"The Washington Post\" last month. And I'll quote right here. Between 1950 and 2021, humanity produced about 11 billion metric tons of virgin plastic. That's the weight of 110,000 U.S. aircraft carriers. Only about two billion tons of this is still in use. The rest, 8.7 billion tons, is waste. Just how damaging is plastic to our environment?",

They don't break down very quickly. Some of them last for over 500 years, which is a projection because most of this has not been around for more than 100 years. But it's projected to be in the environment for hundreds and hundreds of years. Most of it ends up in the oceans, the river discharge and such. And there we know it kills -- plastic debris kills one hundreds of thousands of marine mammals, seabirds, fish, and it's even found in the tiniest plankton. One of the base components of the food chain for the entire ocean ecosystem. The other thing is that plastics absorb toxic substances like persistent and organic pollutants and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, and PCBs, and things like that. So not only is the plastic itself toxic, but they absorbs toxics from the water, and then that is eaten by fish and marine mammals and things like that. So it's a serious problem.",

But the three R's, which we talked about back in the 1970s, Michael -- I don't know how old you are -- but we talked about this in the 1970s. Reduce, reuse, recycle.The first two components of that, reduce and reuse, are really the solution here. Recycling has not been a very large component of reducing plastic debris into the environment. But we need to reduce the production and use of plastics. We know how to do this. There are many, many different plant-based, sustainable, biodegradable alternatives for all sorts of the materials that we're now using plastics for. So if we can reduce the production and use of plastics. And also, we can design components to where they can be re-used in a circular economy, rather than just a linear, produce them and use them once, throw them in the landfill or the river, out to the ocean. So we know how to do this. We've known about it for decades. We just need government to get on board and help us make it happen.",
