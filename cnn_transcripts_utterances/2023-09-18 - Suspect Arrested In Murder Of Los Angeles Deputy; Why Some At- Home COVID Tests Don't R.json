A suspect has now been arrested in connection with the weekend killing of a Los Angeles County deputy.And 30-year-old Ryan Clinkunbroomer was shot and killed as he sat inside his patrol car on Saturday. Earlier today, a 29-year-old man was taken into police custody following a standoff after detectives had served a search warrant at a house where they found the suspect located. CNN's Camila Bernal joins us from Palmdale. Camila, what more do we know about the suspect and the conditions of his arrest?",

And they say that motive is unknown at the time.They did not want to answer a lot of questions on whether or not the two knew each other or had any interactions before the shooting. They say all of this will likely be revealed in court. But, of course, this is a community in grieving. This was a deputy only 30 years old and had just gotten engaged. It's a family of service, father and grandfather served in this department in the community. So everybody here is thankful that they caught the right person -- Jim?",

Police say the baby died after being exposed to fentanyl at the facility. And they say that three other children showed signs of fentanyl exposure. The prosecutor said a kilo of the drug was found in a hallway closet. The day care's operator and her tenant were arraigned on Sunday night. Illinois becomes the first state in the nation to eliminate cash bail. A new law going into effect today, after being held up by the courts. Critics of the cash bail system say it unfairly targets low-income minorities. Decisions about whether or not to release someone will be focused on the seriousness of the charges and whether or not they're considered a danger to the public or a flight risk. And in Florida, an injured alligator has found a new home at Gatorland in Orlando. The as yet unnamed reptile was missing the top part of his jaw when it was rescued by a trapper in central Florida. It's an injury the trapper believes may have been caused by a boat propeller. If you want to offer up a name for the rescued gator, head on over to Gatorland's Facebook page.

It has some people wondering, are the tests still effective, particularly with new variants? CNN medical correspondent, Meg Tirrell, is here. Meg, we've had vaccines updated, of course, for the many new variants of Covid. Are the tests updated? Do they need to be?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Jim, experts say they don't need to be updated specifically because the proteins targeted by that home test, typically antigen tests, so actually a different protein than the ones targeted by the vaccine.We know the spike protein of the coronavirus, that's what the vaccines tend to recognize. Whereas the antigen tests actually go after something called the nucleocapsid proteins. So those are different. So typically, don't tend to change as much as the spike proteins. Although our reporter, Brenda Goodwin, talked to the folks who are studying all the potential changes that they're aware and could potentially update the tests if needed. But experts do say it's possible to test too early or that the tests may not work as well if you don't have symptoms. So the CDC recommends, if you have symptoms, test right away, but if you're negative, test again 48 hours later. Because that will give you a more confident result, essentially, that you really are negative. They say if you've been exposed, you should wait five days to test. If you're negative then, wait another 48 hours. If you're still negative, wait another 48 hours and test a third time. And that's because they have data showing that you really do get best results and more detection if you test repeatedly over a few days. They looked at a study both with people with symptoms and without. With symptoms, testing on day one, you get about 60 percent detection. If you test a few days later, that goes up to 90 percent. If you look at people without symptoms, it's 9 percent on day one. And on the third day, up to 75 percent. That's why you keep testing.",

Ultimately, his desire for freedom and free expression led him to a sentence of 20 years in prison. His story inspired me as a kid to do what I'm doing right now, to work in a free press. Just like my family, people all over the world are fleeing repressive regimes, seeking asylum in the United States for the same reason.
