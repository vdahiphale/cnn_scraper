Similar chaotic scenes playing out in places like Marseille and Lille. Earlier an estimated 6,000 people joined a peaceful march to honor Nael, a march led by his mother. Many people wearing shirts emblazoned with Justice for Nael. The teens killing which was caught on video has sparked anger across France, particularly among young men and women of color who feel they have long been discriminated against by police. CNN's Melissa Bell has the latest from Paris. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MELISSA BELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A night of flames. Cars, town halls schools set on fire across France as rage over the police shooting of 17-year-old Nael continued enough to force the French president to call an emergency ministerial meeting. EMMANUEL MACRON, FRENCH PRESIDENT (through translator): The last hours have been marked by violence scenes against police stations, but also schools and town halls and basically against institutions and the Republic. It's absolutely unjustifiable. BELL (voice-over): The deployment of some 2,000 police officers on Wednesday to the Paris suburbs did little to quell the anger with 150 people detained. \"It's not the Republic that was in custody. It was not the Republic that killed this young man,\" pleaded the government spokesman Olivier Veran. Another appeal in vain to calm the violence as Veran described some of the attacks on government institutions as organized, almost coordinated. In response, a massive deployment of police forces on Thursday, some 40,000 across France, including 5,000 in Paris. But even before nightfall, a protest led by Nael's mother turned violent, emotions still raw even as the police officer accused of shooting the teen was placed under formal investigation for voluntary homicide.

And so, that model in and of itself, as opposed to say, the inner city model that was adopted in the U.K. or the United States has kind of fostered this idea of feeling peripheralized and marginalized. And this is an age old problem, because each time these demonstrations come along and flare up throughout the last 30 or 40 years, most notably in 2005, there are government commitments to revitalize these areas, but ultimately, the energy runs out and they end up getting forgotten about.

Racialized groups in France, ethnic minorities, communities of color, we'll talk about the fact that it is precisely their visibility as ethnic minorities, as communities of color that leads to them being targeted by the police and racially profiled.So as much as Liberty, Equality and Fraternity are the cornerstones of this French Republic, observers will point out and individuals through their experiences, that there is a deficit with the equality pillar in those ideals, and that these communities feel that they are permanently characterized as being somehow second class citizens, whose adherence and -- to Frenchness is somehow always under suspicion.

There were significant police repressions with the pension reform.And his greatest fear is not so much that urban violence continues to escalate, but that the urban violence around this particular issue ends up kind of galvanizing the very significant opposition in France around just about anything that he goes about proposing to Parliament. So it makes it undermines his presidency or rather further undermines it. And I think also makes it increasingly difficult for his government to be able to legislate and push his agenda forward.

Well it comes, Michael, following the government announcement this week that economic growth for the world's second largest economy was projected to reach a modest annual target of 5 percent. Now addressing the World Economic Forum Summit in Tianjin (ph) earlier this week, Premier Li Qiang talked up China's growth, saying the second quarter of the year will be higher than the first. But not everyone is convinced. A long list of major banks and a credit rating agencies have cut forecasts for China's economic growth including S&amp;P Global, Goldman Sachs, UBS, and JPMorgan among others. The property sector remains a drag on the economy as developers struggle to complete presold projects and the local government debt burden comes into focus. Industrial output and retail sales remain sluggish while youth unemployment, a huge problem in China is at a record 20.8 percent. Many young people, anxious about China's economic uncertainty, they are flooding Buddhist and Taoist temples to pray for divine intervention in securing jobs. It's just so tough there at the moment. It is feared that youth unemployment could further rise as a record 11.5 million college students graduate this summer. Analysts, Michael, they believe the government will be forced to stimulate the economy. And Premier Li he actually addressed the matter just yesterday during a cabinet meeting saying the government plans to take measures to promote household consumption. Let me read to you what he reportedly said. \"Taking targeted measures to boost household consumption is conducive to driving growth in consumer spending, and economic recovery.\" Michael, the government is under enormous pressure to reverse the slump.",
