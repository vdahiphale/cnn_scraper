Well, those defamation kinds of cases can also be filed by someone like the president-elect. So Trump filed a defamation suit. It was working its way through the courts. ABC was unable to get it thrown out initially.And actually in the next few days, Trump was set to be deposed in the case. But ABC is avoiding going any further by settling. They're paying out $15 million plus a million in attorney's fees. They say this is going to go to a nonprofit, basically to Trump's future library. That's the idea. But maybe most importantly, ABC is also apologizing, issuing a statement of regret. But ABC is going to say -- basically attach an editor's note to the Web site saying it regrets and George regrets the statements. Meanwhile, an ABC spokesperson tells me they are pleased to have reached this settlement. But it is very notable they are both paying out money to the president-elect and apologizing for the misstatements on the air.",

We start with dramatic new details about those mysterious drones seen hovering across the Eastern Seaboard. Boston Police now say they have arrested two people for flying aircraft dangerously close to Logan International Airport. And it comes as state and local officials become increasingly frustrated by the lack of transparency about where these drones are coming from and how dangerous they could be. There are reports of sightings in at least six states, including incidents of drones flying near military facilities and one even causing a New York airport to temporarily suspend flights. The sightings are putting intense pressure on federal agencies to provide more information to the public, and the lack of answers among many is drawing bipartisan criticism. CNN's Julia Benbrook and Gloria Pazmino are tracking all of these developments. Julia, you first at the White House. What more is the Biden administration saying about all of this?",

He says that they are working in close coordination with state and local authorities. Now, in his most recent public statements about these drone sightings, during an interview earlier today with ABC News, he said that the government has deployed additional resources, personnel and technology to assist New Jersey State Police in addressing these drone sightings. He also says that there's no doubt that people are seeing drones, but he also says that some of their technology has confirmed that at least some of the sightings are actually of small manned aircraft. Now, Mayorkas is calling for some changes to address future situations, asking Congress to extend and expand their authorities when it comes to drones. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

If it's a rotating light, it is a manned aircraft because you don't find those lights on drones. And it's also human perception is very -- we're all blind at night.And so lights can give you the appearance that something is much bigger, even mostly because it may be further away. So I don't think that while it's possible, and certainly Picatinny is near there, I think that like -- you know, it's not going to be, people don't want to hear this, but probably a significant number are manned aircraft, although I do think that they are legitimately seeing drones.",

And they're almost always about a mile away from the aircraft. And it's also possible, I think people forget, look, Donald Trump loves robots.He had those spot robots down in Florida. And it's very possible that his security people are also trying to use drones that maybe coordinate with Spot the robot dog or trying to figure out a perimeter access. It's very possible that these unsophisticated actors are also trying to figure out what stress test, what's happening at the golf course there. So, you know, I -- there could be military operations. There could be people trying to use this at the golf course there. There could be people trying to stress test.

They are feeding off of these newscasts. I have been not wanting to do these interviews because I don't want to keep making the problem worse.

Dr. Bowe, so good to see you. We can all relax now. All right, so let's go over some of your five recommended tips to manage stress, kind of avert it as well. How do you set up a realistic goal? Let's begin with that. DR. MIRANDA BOE, FOUNDER, THE BREATHING ROOM: Yes. Well, we want to start with setting a goal or an intention for yourself. So if your goal is to just get through dinner conflict free, then when you find yourself triggered, you're going to be more likely to thoughtfully respond in ways that align with your goal versus reacting emotionally. And we want to be prepared for those triggers, too. So if we know there is a certain somebody or certain situation that consistently is stressful or triggering, preparing for coping responses can be helpful. And those can be simple things like just taking a moment for yourself, a bit of fresh air or a few deep breaths can do wonders for helping you maintain your composure and more likely to achieve your goal.",

So finding ways to set personal boundaries politely can be a really good approach and also be thinking ahead or planning ahead on how you might diffuse difficult conversations.So, for instance, you might want to just think about changing the conversation using humor or thinking about memories or stories that tend to unite people and finding a way to bring those into the conversation. For a lot of us, it can be really difficult to set boundaries. It can feel challenging. And so it's kind of boundary settings like working a muscle. It's something that sometimes we want to practice for. So doing something like preparing scripts can really be helpful. If you go, for instance, like somebody might bring up a heavy political subject or conversation to be prepared and maybe say things like, gosh, I would love to not have a heavy political discussion tonight. I am really looking forward to laughs or let's save that conversation for another time. And let's focus on spending time together.",
