I'm Paula Newton.Ahead on CNN right here newsroom, President Biden visits storm-damaged parts of Florida. That state's governor, though, was not by the president's side. Bearing down on Taiwan, a powerful typhoon could be the first to make landfall there in four years. And war isn't keeping these kids from going back to school. Students in Ukraine face another year of books and bomb shelters. And we begin this hour with extreme weather and those enduring the effects of what is more and more becoming inescapable events. In the wake of Hurricane Idalia, U.S President Biden visited storm-ravaged Florida Saturday. He viewed damage by air and on the ground and met with many of those impacted by the storm. The same time, a massive typhoon, equivalent of the Category 3 hurricane, is barreling toward Taiwan at this hour. And it's set to be the first typhoon to make landfall there in four years. Well, at the same time, in the state of Nevada, extreme weather has stranded participants at the popular annual event called the Burning Man Festival and left it looking like a mud-covered dystopian nightmare. We begin, though, with the U.S. president's visit to Florida recently hammered by Hurricane Idalia. Governor Ron DeSantis did not join Mr. Biden's tour but another key Florida Republican did.

He was surrounded by First Lady Jill Biden and also the FEMA administrator, Deanne Criswell.And we heard from the president giving remarks, showing his commitment to supporting the people in Florida, those in need. He said whatever they need, the federal government will supply. He also spoke about the federal resources that have been helping out residents, those who have lost or have had damage to their homes or businesses, also talking about the National Guard on the ground, helping folks out with millions of meals and federal search and rescue teams that were on the ground right after the storm hit. He surveyed the aftermath of this most powerful hurricane to hit the big Bend Area of Florida in over 100 years. He saw that from an aerial tour. He saw thousands of homes that were damaged here in the Big Bend area. And he also did a tour on the ground. He spoke with survivors and also met personnel and first responders who have been helping out with that recovery process, including in areas like this, like this point of distribution, where we see the Florida State Guard, a newly activated force by Governor Ron DeSantis, we're seeing them loading up these cars of people who need a little bit of help right now with food, with water, with ice, with tarps to help out in that recovery process. And the president also thanking Republican Senator Rick Scott for keeping his office informed as to what happened. Here's what else the president had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  These crises are affecting more than -- more and more Americans. And every American rightly expects FEMA to show up when they are needed to help in a disaster. So, I'm calling out on the United States Congress, Democrats and Republicans, to ensure the funding is there to deal with the immediate crises, as well as our long-term commitments to the safety and security of the American people.

According to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center, Haikui is lashing the island with sustained winds of 120 miles per hour, and that is equivalent to a Category 3 hurricane.Now, it's also dumping heavy rain on the east coast, which could trigger flash floods and landslides. Authorities have canceled flights, evacuated residents, mobilized troops, suspended work and school in vulnerable areas. At least two injured so far and some 9,300 households have already lost power. We want to get the latest from Journalist Andy Lee, who joins us now live in Taipei. Andy, still looking relatively okay where you are right now, but what kind of preparations have they made, given the grave threat this storm poses?",

Previously we spoke and then it picks up speed. And bow its eye is making landfall, as we speak right now from the eastern part of the island in Taido (ph). Now, the authorities here in Taiwan are asking people to stay away from mountainsides and from beach sides. And they are evacuating people from the low-lying areas in case of flashfloods and from mountain villages in case of landslides or mudslides. Now, as far as transportation is concerned, the airports are closed, and, therefore, 226 domestic flights are canceled, 41 international flights are canceled. So, if our CNN viewers are going to Asia, transiting in Taipei or destination Taipei, you must check with your travel agency, because this flight is definitely affected.

So, this is actually the strongest typhoon ever to hit Hong Kong, Typhoon Saola, since the year 1962.Now, as we know, Typhoon Saola is down to a tropical storm. Before, it was down to a tropical storm. It made landfall twice, a very eerie path of Typhoon Saola. It is all due to this typhoon season and the existence of three typhoons at the same time in the Pacific, Typhoon Haikui right now in Taiwan, Typhoon Saola, which just hit Hong Kong, and Typhoon Kirogi still in the Pacific, three typhoons affecting each other. And, Paula, now that Typhoon Saola is down to a tropical storm, we have only two remaining typhoons. That is Typhoon Haikui in Taiwan, and up north, more close to Japan, Typhoon Kirogi.

So, in many ways, everybody here just kind of made friends with neighbors, it's a community event, it's an event about art and you just kind of went back to the roots. I think almost everybody really enjoyed having it be extremely harsh.And we don't know what's going to happen tonight, though, and that's the big concern, because we might have just as much rain tonight.

If it doesn't rain, we're going to have our usual burning of the man, probably tomorrow night, which was supposed to be right now. The man was supposed to burn actually in an hour.

But we come as a collective to this really barren wasteland, one of the harshest places in the world. And we create community and art together.So, we have things like the man that burns on Saturday night, generally tonight. And that is a collection of 70,000 people and a lot of music and all these art cars and things people have created and sound, sound, sound. And then Sunday night is generally the -- where we burn the temple or the space that's created to kind of process and grieve and talk about the things that we lost this last year. So, usually, we have this big night Saturday night, and then Sunday night, we have this solemn night. So, we don't know if we're going to do both burns tomorrow night, if we're going to burn anything.

Richardson served as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations during the Clinton administration and was elected governor of New Mexico for two terms.After a failed run for president, he started the Richardson Center for Global Engagement. That organization offered aid to families of American hostages and detainees abroad. Richardson personally negotiated the release of many Americans from hostile nations from Iraq to North Korea, most recently traveling to Russia working to free Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan. Richardson died in his sleep at his summer home. Joining me now, David Sanger, he's a CNN political and national security analyst. He's also a White House and national security correspondent for The New York Times. Such sad news to digest for so many. This man's resume was long, and yet it really doesn't begin to reflect, I think, the profound depth of his career and, more importantly, the character of the man. How and why was Bill Richardson such a singular politician and such a diplomat? DAVID SANGER, CNN POLITICAL AND NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST:  Paula, I think what was remarkable about Bill Richardson is two things. First, he held a variety -- a remarkable variety of positions in government. Of course, he was governor of New Mexico. He was ambassador to the United Nations. He was energy secretary. He was briefly and somewhat disastrously a candidate for president of the United States and dropped out. But he's really remembered for something that he did outside of all of those appointments, and that was his brilliance at hostage negotiating. And he did it with this real sense of humor, of a willingness to go anywhere and do anything. Journalists loved him, not only for his storytelling, but because one group of people he got released from a lot of awful situations around the world were arrested journalists.",

The second was, he was clearly somebody willing to go out and find a way to make a deal. And it's interesting you mentioned President Clinton, because I think one of my favorite Bill Richardson stories, I think one of many people's favorite Bill Richardson stories, had to do with the time he went to Sudan during the Clinton presidency and helped negotiate the release of some Americans.Initially, there had been a big monetary ransom, and he ended up bringing this down to some rice, some jeeps, a few other things. He came back, he described everybody, including to President Clinton, how he had been surrounded during these negotiations by teenage boys who had rifles, who were standing around barefoot. He was a little bit worried about whether or not they would get trigger happy, how there was a goat being roasted by the side as he was conducting the negotiations. And Clinton looked at him and said, did you eat the goat? And he said, well, yes, Mr. President, I ate the goat. Clinton looked at him said, great, how would you like to be ambassador to the United Nations? So, these are not the usual qualifications one would think that you would have for ambassador to the United Nations, and yet that was actually a job he enjoyed more than almost any of the others. [03:20:01] NEWTON:  Yes. And, certainly, when you talk about people taken too soon, his own memoir, the banner was Between Worlds. He proved he could find common ground, something so many countries, including the United States, could use a lot more of. Why do you think he was respected also in the United States?",

He went to a private school in Concord, Massachusetts. He had graduated from the Tufts School of Law and Diplomacy and then moves to New Mexico and makes his way up to becoming governor with sort of overwhelming re-election numbers. What is interesting is it didn't really translate when he was running for president. And, somehow, he wasn't able to turn that into a national political moment, which I found interesting and somewhat curious, because I thought he probably would have a very good chance of doing that. He was a great storyteller frequently about himself. But he was really willing to go and do anything. And I think people sense that.

Kind of interesting because we're sort of used to seeing protests and sort of violent clashes taking place in this region. But this story actually has very little to do with Israel or the Palestinian territories or the Israeli government. It has to do with Eritrea.Now, there are thousands of Eritrean immigrants who live in Israel. Many of them are asylum seekers. And what happened, many of the asylum seekers say that they are fearful of the regime in Eritrea. They say that it's run for a dictator, and Eritrea does rank quite low when it comes to many of the human rights rankings and indexes. So, what happened Saturday was that the Eritrean government was sponsoring a celebration of its independence day at its embassy in Tel Aviv. Now, anti-government community members had told the Israeli police, had called on the Israeli government to cancel the event, saying that it could lead to violence because they knew that protesters were going to come and try to break up the celebration, and that's what happened. We saw hundreds of Eritreans, both pro and anti-government, clashing in the streets of Southern Tel Aviv. There were quite extensive amounts of property damage. We know of at least 100 people who were injured, including dozens of police officers. And as of this morning, this is according to Israeli media, there are at least 15 people, Paula, who remained hospitalized, in serious condition, including two police officers. Now, there was extensive property damage. When I was actually in Tel Aviv yesterday, I could see helicopters hovering over Southern Tel Aviv, watching as this took place, as this unfolded. And it does appear as though the Israeli police were potentially not expecting such a violent outcome as to what happened. Now, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu already yesterday announcing that he was arranging for today to have a special ministerial meeting to look at the options, potentially even he said deporting some of these migrants who he said were documented participating in the violence yesterday. Because, remember, a lot of these are asylum seekers, Eritreans asylum seekers seeking to stay in Israel for protection.

That's one of the things to understand about the current situation in Ukraine, that it's a huge country, and the situation in different regions is very different, including with access to education. So, it is a bit calmer in the west and in the central Ukraine. It's, I would say, only missiles that reach those territories, not artillery, for instance.However, eastern territories, north, south, they are shelled frequently, including from artillery that is being fired from the occupied territories. So, there is much more danger. However, there are still kids and there are families and there are also those who return to their liberated towns. So, in territories like that, it is crucial to help them with temporary solution, like temporary schools in repurposed buildings that have remained or modular schools that could be assembled quite quickly. Or, for instance, what we do at foundation, we do basically underground schools, turning the bomb shelters into completely fully fledged learning centers where kids can not only sit during the air raid sirens and get suffocated because there is no air, but where they can have access to normal air, where it's safe, and where they have connection to internet, where they have good furniture, where they have learning materials, and their teachers working with them. So, this is our reality, and, unfortunately, it will remain with us for a very long time. And thus, for us, it's crucial to be, I would say, creative with regard to how we return to access to education even in these conditions.",
