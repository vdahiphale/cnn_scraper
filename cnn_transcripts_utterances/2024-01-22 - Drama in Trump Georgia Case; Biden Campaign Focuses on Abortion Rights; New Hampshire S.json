I'm Boris Sanchez with Brianna Keilar in the nation's capital. And on the eve of the New Hampshire primary, it is officially a two- person race. Nikki Haley now has that one-on-one matchup that she's wanted with Republican front-runner Donald Trump, since Florida Governor Ron DeSantis dropped out of the race over the weekend. This morning, Haley was asked if she has enough time to capitalize. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIKKI HALEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Absolutely. Look, we started with 13 people. I had 2 percent in the polls. We finished Iowa with 20 percent. We want to be stronger in New Hampshire. We want to be even stronger than that in South Carolina. I mean, keep in mind, I know the political class wants to say that this race is over. And I know the political class is saying everybody needs to get behind Trump. This is not a coronation. You had 56,000 people out of three million in Iowa vote for Donald Trump, less than 1.5 percent of that state. We haven't even started with this election yet. (END VIDEO CLIP) KEILAR:  So she sounds pretty confident there, but actually the latest polls show the former president returning to his double-digit lead in New Hampshire. We're going to break down how those numbers could shift with DeSantis out and endorsing Trump, but first to our reporters on the trail. Kristen Holmes, Trump is expected to hold a final event before the primary tonight. What are you hearing on that event?",

They will be on stage, Donald Trump, with Senator Tim Scott, as well as Vivek Ramaswamy, as well as Doug Burgum, all people who are former opponents who have now gotten in line and are following Donald Trump. This is an observation. This is a way for them to try and show that the Republican Party is uniting behind the former president. Now, obviously, that list is missing somebody big, which is Ron DeSantis. I am told that former President Trump and the Florida governor have not spoken since he dropped out of the race and endorsed Trump. However, Trump's team did reach out to Ron DeSantis' team and offered somewhat of an open invitation to campaign with the former president at any time. They did not get into specifics on tonight's event, but that's really the name of the game right now. That's their messaging. They're trying to put out that the Republican Party is getting behind Donald Trump, it is time for Nikki Haley to drop out and make Trump the nominee.",

That's what her team wanted. Well, now she has gotten it. But the stakes here are incredibly high for her, because New Hampshire presents uniquely fertile ground for her. There are independents who can vote tomorrow in the primary. They make up 40 percent of the electorate here in New Hampshire. And that's a group that she does well with. With DeSantis dropping out, her team feels that they might get a little bit of support from her -- his supporters, though we should note, of course, he has already endorsed Trump. So, there are questions about where that support will actually go and if it'll make any difference, given how low DeSantis was polling here. [13:05:20] Now, when it comes to Nikki Haley's message, we have heard it time and time again focus in on the fact that there needs to be a new generational leader. She is positioning herself, she is casting herself as that leader. And she's also really drawing in former President Trump with President Biden more closely, casting them as leaders of the past. Listen to what she told some supporters here in New Hampshire earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Earlier today on FOX News, she was asked about that, and she doubled down on her strategy, saying that there were so many other candidates in the race. She had to get it down to a one-on-one race. Her job wasn't to go after Trump from the beginning. She said, this is a marathon, not a sprint. And when you talk to her supporters here in New Hampshire, they say that she needs to do well here. They don't think she needs to win to keep her campaign alive, but, listen, she's got to come within really a competitive -- because the future of her campaign could depend on it.",

Again, this is polling that has happened with a select group of voters in this final week. But when you look at that support that accounts for Ron DeSantis not being on the race, meaning -- not being in the race, meaning people that backed him, but then also these numbers reflect support going to their second choices, Donald Trump 54 percent, Nikki Haley 41 percent. But what's interesting -- and we saw this dynamic play out in Iowa, but also in previous polling -- is their difference in support between Nikki Haley and Donald Trump. With Donald Trump, 71 percent of conservatives polled or self-identified conservatives polled backed Donald Trump, while 71 percent of self-identified moderates backed Nikki Haley. And then, when you look at the first choice for primary nominee among undeclareds or independents here, Nikki Haley carries that, close to 60 percent, while Donald Trump takes 67 percent of people who are within the GOP. So that's really the split here. It's also why some may worry that this -- because of this unique dynamic in New Hampshire, where independents can vote in the primary, will that translate to later states on down the line? Former President Trump is trying to make sure it doesn't, stacking up endorsements from key figures in South Carolina, which is the next major primary contest after this, and, of course, Nikki Haley's home state, trying to stack that deck against her. For her part, she has said she is not letting that intimidate her. She's raised $500,000 in the last 24 hours, her campaign says, since DeSantis got out. She is ready for that fight, but, of course, a major task once this primary gets under way tomorrow.",

      "sentences": "Well, Brianna, as your last reporter said, it cuts both ways.I would not overread the DeSantis departure. I think the timing was all that is surprising. I have sat here before on the eve of primary days. The secretary of state here is calling for a record turnout, 322,000 votes tomorrow in the Republican primary. That's a lot of non- Trump voters, as well as Republican primary voters. [13:10:15] I remember John McCain, independent kind of firebrand candidate, with George W. Bush sitting in a Manchester hotel room the eve of the primary, expecting a 20-point, 30-point win. McCain clocked him. Last time around, I think Biden thought he was going to do better here in a big Democrat showing. Bernie Sanders and the team beat him. I'm not saying there's a surprise, Brianna, but what I'm saying, is New Hampshire likes to send a surprise, a lot of independents voting. The surprise would not be a big Trump win. Your own poll has it at about 18 to 19 points. My suspicion, that's a little aggressive. If I had to say, I think Trump goes into tomorrow with about a 10-, 11-, maybe a 12-point edge. But if Nikki Haley can get it to single digits, that would be a big showing. And Governor Sununu here has changed his tune going to tomorrow from, she doesn't need to win, she needs to do well to get momentum. Last week, he told me she could win. I think it's Trump's to lose, but New Hampshire likes to send a surprise.",

He hasn't moved much here. He's had a solid Republican primary base. But we have never seen a time recently where the Democrat National Committee has -- doesn't want New Hampshire to count. They're not encouraging Democrats to vote. In fact, they're telling them not to. So, you got about 88,000 Democrats may vote. Phillips may do better than people think. But that leaves a whole swathe of independents and undeclared who can vote. And they're not really doing a happy dance to vote for Biden. So, if they come over and vote for Nikki Haley, one of your folks had it about right. I think Haley needs about 65 percent of all of those to go with Trump's hold in that Republican base, primary base -- his voters are like concrete -- to make this tighter. I suspect it's going to get a little tighter than 18 or 19 points, still Trump's to lose, but different dynamics at work this time.",

We're a very independent state.A lot of people moved into this state and brought their politics with them. But we have a Republican governor, but he appeals more in a general election than our primaries here. Donald Trump doesn't lose any votes. You know that. It's like concrete. He's like a goal post on the football field. So, the question is, New Hampshire is more like a general election this time around. A lot of independents can vote. That's Nikki Haley's only chance to make this thing really be questioned going further. If Trump wins big tomorrow -- and I would equate big to 15 points or more, 50 percent or more -- then this thing is probably over, even though it goes into South Carolina. So I think the only real test of Trump going forward, ironically, is not South Carolina. It's New Hampshire tomorrow with a lot of independents and undeclared who can vote. If he wins big here, I think he's off and running. Conversely, anything less than 10 points, you folks in the national media are going to look at that and say, wow, maybe Nikki Haley's got a chance here, long shot, but maybe she has a chance.",

Meanwhile, the attorney for Ms. Willis in an attempt to try to get her out of this deposition argued that the allegation of adultery is irrelevant and that, as a high-ranking public official in Fulton County, she should be protected from having to be deposed. Ultimately, the judge in this case that's overseeing these divorce proceedings ruled that he did not have sufficient evidence to make a ruling one way or another and that Mr. Wade needed to be deposed first before he made a decision whether or not Willis had to testify in this case. Another significant development and something that could be a major development is that the records for these divorce proceedings in Nathan Wade and his former wife, or his estranged wife, I should say, have now been vacated to be sealed. So now they're unsealed. And this is important because these allegations of an improper relationship, they first surfaced in a motion by Ashleigh Merchant. Merchant is the attorney for former Trump campaign official Mike Roman, and she alleged that this case should be dismissed because of this improper relationship, and in that motion signaled that if she could get these divorce proceeding records unsealed, she would further be able to prove that claim. So those records should be posted sometime later today. What's in them and how relevant they will be, will there be a bombshell or how significant they will be, that's anyone's guess at this point, but we will be watching that docket closely. We should mention that DA Willis has yet to directly address the claims of this improper relationship, but about two Sundays ago, speaking from the pulpit, she did defend the decision to select Nathan Wade as a lead prosecutor in this case -- Boris, Brianna.",
