      "sentences": "Welcome to THE WHOLE STORY. I'm Anderson Cooper.November will mark the 60th anniversary of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Over the years a number of well-known conspiracy theories have flourished. Who really pulled the trigger? Were the Russians behind it? Was the CIA involved? But there's one conspiracy theory you may not know about, the belief that President Kennedy and his son John F. Kennedy, Jr., who died in a plane crash in 1999, are actually alive and in hiding. It may sound preposterous to you but there are those who absolutely believe this. They formed a group which some are calling a cult and are led by a QAnon believer. This group holds so much influence over their members some have even abandoned their spouses, their parents, their grandchildren. For the past year, CNN's Donie O'Sullivan has been investigating what's behind this conspiracy. Over the next hour he takes us across the country to meet the believers, confront their leader, and spend time with the confused, frustrated, helpless families who just want their loved ones to come home.
