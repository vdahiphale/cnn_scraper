If they do believe their own rhetoric, you're talking about the least democratic process possible. We had an open primary. He could have been challenged. The health problems were not new. He was not challenged seriously. There's the Dean Phillips person who got one percent of the vote. Yes, yes, precisely. And now we want to have a panic convention three weeks into it? Also, the regulations, I believe, they decided to do it over Zoom in July. So we're talking about doing an open convention over Zoom. I can't imagine anything less democratic than what's being proposed there. I wholeheartedly agree, this is fantasy stuff. This is good for TV. But Biden's not going anywhere.

He is the representative from New York, part of the Squad, very left- leaning, and certainly very pro-Palestinian. He made a lot of mistakes in his district. He was very unpopular. He was defeated by a moderate. But the thing that really struck me and I don't think got a lot of attention is that this was the most expensive race in history.

So this will feel like kind of a weird story in a week.And additionally, the Olympics are going to be a big deal combined with the Tour de France next month.
