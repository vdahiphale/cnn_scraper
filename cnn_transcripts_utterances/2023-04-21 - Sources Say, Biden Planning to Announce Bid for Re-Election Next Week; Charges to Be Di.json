Now, this would put to end months of speculation about whether the 80-year-old president would seek a second term in office. Sources have told us that he settled on Wilmington, Delaware, as his campaign headquarters. But we're still waiting for some of the other campaign apparatus, details to shake out. But one thing his advisers are eager to get the ball rolling on is fundraising. Sources have told us that top Democrats from the president's last campaign in 2020, they have been invited to Washington, D.C., for a meeting with the president on Friday, and the advisers are hoping that they can really ramp up fundraising when it comes to both grassroots supporters and those big dollar donors.",

Now, energizing and mobilizing these Democratic voters will be key for President Biden as he heads into this re-election race, but he will also need to win over those moderate Republicans and independent voters, especially at a moment where he could face a possible rematch with former President Donald Trump.",

You're telling me now that you have information with respect to the gun? Would that not be critical to know before you charge someone? Would it not be critical to know before you proceed and really say that someone is responsible criminally? And the significance of this is really twofold as it relates to the law. Number one, if you're charging someone with being reckless, right, or negligent even, now we have the issue of the gun, which suggests, hey, maybe he wasn't. Now, you have the second issue with respect to causation, causing of the death. If the gun were modified and he did not pull the trigger, then you have an issue with causation. But he was charged and he was charged in January of this past year, 14 months later. You didn't know that? And so I'm very troubled.",

So, they're not similarly situated to the extent that the actor, Alec Baldwin, reasonably relies upon a team right?So, while it's different, the result could be the same in terms of the dismissal.

But yesterday evening, on Thursday, he turned himself into authorities nearly 600 miles away in Hillsborough, Florida.Now, he does have a hearing later today regarding potential extradition here back to Gaston County. Neighbors told me that, look, there were issues since about a couple of weeks that he had moved in to stay with his girlfriend in a room she was renting in a house there. He had been yelling at children. He did not seem to like the children of the neighborhood, and they said it's a very kid-friendly neighborhood. Dozens of them were outside on Tuesday evening when a basketball rolled into Singletary's yard. According to neighbors, they say that a parent came to confront him about cursing out his child, and then Singletary went inside, got the gun and began shooting. Of course, six-year-old Kinsley White, her father and mother were all shot, Don. I talked to that mother after the arrest, and she told me that she was glad and she felt relieved.

And it got me thinking about the -- how you weigh the interests of transparency, right? Because there's a real press interest and a public interest in transparency, and seeing a lot of what you do what we pay you guys to do on camera, but at the same time, you're saying a lot of what's on camera is fake.

I thought team outrage was going to be about a third of the people who were there. It's not. It's less than 10 percent. And that's the good news.

This is a lot of very steep cuts and a lot of different areas, Veterans Affairs, air traffic control, nutrition plans for seniors and to ask a lot of his vulnerable members.He has 18 Republicans who are in districts that Biden won to ask them to vote for all of these cuts for something that we know is dead on arrival in the Senate.

Smartmatic's lawyer tells CNN that the company wants a full retraction and it won't accept anything smaller than the historic $787 million settlement that Dominion got. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ERIK CONNOLLY, LEAD ATTORNEY, SMARTMATIC V. FOX LAWSUIT:  Clearly, Fox knew that the election wasn't rigged and they clearly knew the election machines weren't involved in rigging something. All that evidence is out there and we get to layer on top of that. Smartmatic is in this case for the long haul. They are looking to take this case through trial. They are looking through the vindication of a jury verdict in their favor. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
