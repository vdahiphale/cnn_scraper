Another huge explosion rocking Beirut just a little while ago in the last hour or so as Israel continues its punishing airstrikes on Hezbollah forces in the Lebanese capital.This as we learn the leader of one of the most powerful paramilitary forces in the Middle East was killed in one of those strikes. Iran- backed militant group Hezbollah, confirming its Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli bombing in Beirut on Friday. Iran state media says a senior Iranian commander was also among those killed in that blast. Nasrallah was one of Hezbollah's founders, playing a key role in its formation and the targeting of Israel for over four decades. His death igniting fears of a wider conflict in the region. Those fears are very, very serious right now. Iran's supreme leader saying today that all regional resistant forces, those words, all regional resistant forces are standing with Hezbollah. Meantime, the Israeli military says they just intercepted a missile launched from Yemen, where the Iran-backed Houthi rebels are based. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is vowing U.S. protection and support for Israel as these tensions heat up dramatically. CNN Correspondent Jomana Karadsheh is joining us live from Beirut right now. Jomana, I know that there was another huge explosion where you are just a little while ago. Jomana, what are you seeing on the ground right now?",

      "sentences": "Well, officially, Wolf, we're hearing nothing, and I think that is fairly telling. It gives you a sense of just how fraught this moment is for President Biden, how precarious the White House views the situation right now in the Middle East.That's not to say that the White House isn't welcoming Nasrallah's death, at least, unofficially. Behind the scenes, officials do say no one in the Biden administration is mourning him. They acknowledge he has American blood on his hands. He was the leader of a terrorist organization after all. But this does come as President Biden within -- trying to get Israel to deescalate the situation in the Middle East. So you do have these dueling dynamics that I think the administration is trying to figure out how exactly to respond at this moment. Because, remember, President Biden had spent the early part of this week trying to negotiate a 21-day ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah along the northern border. The White House was furious when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu essentially rejected that effort on Thursday morning, and now you see the situation certainly deteriorating much further. Now we did hear from President Biden yesterday who said that the U.S. was not involved in this strike in Beirut. He said that the U.S. had no heads up. And what we heard from American officials was essentially that their Israeli counterparts notified them as this operation was getting underway, essentially, when the planes were in the air was the first time that they heard that this was happening. Now, the fears inside the White House and inside the Biden administration is that a wider war would be devastating and you heard that directly from Lloyd Austin yesterday in your interview when he said that casualties in a war between Israel and Lebanon would exceed those of the war in Gaza. And so I think the Biden administration finds itself now at a very fraught moment. We do know that Lloyd Austin spoke twice yesterday to his counterpart in Israel, Yoav Gallant. American officials have been on the phone with their counterparts in Israel as well, trying to get more information about what exactly is happening. Two men who have not spoken are President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu. They, in fact, haven't spoken at least according to White House readouts since August. And I think it gives you a sense of just how much influence President Biden thinks he has right now on Netanyahu, which is not very much.",

      "sentences": "Yes, I think the Israelis are hoping that as a result of the strikes that they've achieved over the course of the last number of days will prevent the necessity for a ground invasion. If we go back to 2006, I mean, the Israelis as well as Hezbollah were significantly bloodied during that invasion.So a ground incursion into Lebanon would be immensely difficult. The Israelis clearly want to push Hezbollah north of the Litani River that gives them a little more space. The Israelis also want to relocate those displaced civilians that they have back to northern Israel, but that's going to take some time. So I think a ground campaign, I think Israel is assuming that their efforts right now will be sufficient to avoid a ground campaign. And I guarantee you that Hezbollah doesn't have the capacity to conduct that right now. And I would hope also that the strikes that the Israelis have been taking on over the course of the last few days have really attrited and depleted the inventory of Hezbollah missile capabilities. But, look, an all-out war is not what anybody wants, but we have to look at, you know, what's the cost, what's the root cause of this. And the Israelis clearly have demonstrated that they are not going to be in a position to have to live with another October 7th, whether it's from a Gaza -- Hamas type of an attack in the Gaza region or from Hezbollah.",

Around 100,000 believed to have been forced to flee their homes already prior to this escalation that we are seeing now.But as you mentioned, this has -- the situation has worsened. We're seeing these strikes and bombings deepening around the capital in Beirut. And it's important to underscore that these areas that we are seeing being struck by the Israeli military are densely populated areas. They are filled with civilians. We saw a series of strikes targeting the southern Beirut suburb of Dahiya. This is an area crammed with tall apartment buildings filled with civilians, with families and children. So you can imagine the catastrophic impact this has had on the civilians living in this area, living in the city, but also, of course, for a country that has already been through so much. Not only its history, of course, of wars brought on Lebanon, but also, of course, just in the last few years, we've seen a severe economic crisis, which has really pushed many to the brink of desperation in Lebanon. Then, of course, in August 2020, we saw the Beirut port blast. Again, a huge amount of trauma surrounding that for the Lebanese capital and those living there. And now, of course, we are seeing a full-fledged war taking place in Lebanon, forcing so many to flee their homes for their own safety and protection. Our teams on the ground, our correspondent, Jomana Karadsheh, was in Beirut last night, saw firsthand the huge number of civilians, families and children, essentially sleeping on the streets in central parts of Beirut for their safety and protection, fearing that their apartment buildings could be struck. As you mentioned, the health ministry now saying they believe around 500,000 people have been internally displaced. So this is a hugely desperate situation for a city that has already been through, or a country that has already been through so much.",

We'll have a lot on that, but there's other major news right here in the United States.Cleanup is underway, as you know, after Hurricane Helene unleashed life-threatening flooding across major parts of the southeast this week. A flash flood emergency has been issued for parts of eastern Tennessee right now, after officials feared a critical, very, very critical part of the state was in trouble. They now say the structure remains intact. One structure they were watching very closely. And the water, they say, is receding after reaching 8 feet of record levels. The storm made landfall in Florida, as you know. We're watching all of that as well, the impact of what's going on in Florida. And it came across as a Category 4 hurricane with winds more than 130 miles an hour. At least 50 storm related deaths are reported across five states.

A couple of blocks away was the -- is the river reaching deep into here, sending rushing water into this area where so many businesses are and leaving all sorts of crazy debris from furniture, doors. And then right over here in front, you see that, that metal thing, that is a power pole, extremely heavy, just showing you how powerful, how strong these raging floodwaters were to be able to carry that all the way over here. Now, we've clearly seen the floodwaters recede, which is great news for this community, but there's more rain on the way up to an additional inch of rainfall expected into areas of Western North Carolina, including Asheville here this weekend after already experiencing record rainfall three days in a row. a big problem here for the community is they're attempting to dig out. Honestly, it's not just the cleanup effort, trying to get homes and businesses back together, trying to clear out all of this extremely thick mud all over the place, but also issues of communication. There's no cell service here. We have a satellite truck. That's how I'm able to go to you live right now. But people are stranded, tourists who don't know how to get around, unable to access maps, folks unable to call loved ones, check in on them. No cell service, no internet. People also in the dark, Wolf. Over 722,000 people without power here in the state. Also water, a significant water line break. So we're seeing folks here outside of the hotels, essentially stranded, unable to access the roadways, over 400 of them shut down across the state and having no means of communication, no means of getting power, no means of getting water. So clearly, this is going to take a long time for Asheville, for other parts of western North Carolina to turn the page here, Wolf. And that's not even the worst of it. There's others who live higher up in elevation across the Blue Ridge Mountains, who are honestly trapped. They have no bridge access, roadways where -- there have been mudslides, landslides or heavy trees falling down and they are cut off in need of help. Wolf?",

And this is the first official word from the Biden administration following the death of the Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and President Biden in the statement, it's a carefully worded one. It's a balanced statement. And he says that Hassan Nasrallah and the terrorist group he led, Hezbollah, were responsible for killing hundreds of Americans over a four decade reign of terror. His death from an Israeli airstrike is a measure of justice for his many victims, including thousands of Americans, Israelis and Lebanese civilians.The President goes on to acknowledge that this took place in the broader context of the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah that began on October 7th. He says that the U.S. does fully support Israel's right to defend itself against Hezbollah, but other Iranian backed groups in the region. And the President concludes by saying, ultimately, our aim is to de-escalate the ongoing conflicts in both Gaza and Lebanon through diplomatic means. He says, in Gaza, we have been pursuing a deal backed by the U.N. Security Council for a cease fire and the release of hostages. In Lebanon, we have been negotiating a deal that would return people safely to their homes in Israel and southern Lebanon. And the President says, it is time for those deals to close, for the threats to Israel to be removed and for the broader Middle East region to gain greater stability. And so you hear the president there welcoming the death of Hassan Nasrallah, certainly because he was a terrorist and because he had the blood of Americans on his hands, but also calling very explicitly for the situation in the Middle East to deescalate. And he says that he's been working on the ceasefire deal. That is the deal that American officials thought that they had Israeli backing for when they announced it on Wednesday evening. The next day, Prime Minister Netanyahu essentially rejected the deal, to the fury of American officials. President Biden, in this statement, is saying that now the parties should resume talks about that ceasefire across the border. Of course, American officials today have been watching very closely to see how Hezbollah will respond, to see how Iran will respond to the killing of -- of Nasrallah, and certainly President Biden, very much, hoping that the temperatures can be lowered.",
