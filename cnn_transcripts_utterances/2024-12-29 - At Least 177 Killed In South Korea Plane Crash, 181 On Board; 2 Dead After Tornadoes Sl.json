      "sentences": "Good morning and welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world. I'm Amara Walker in Atlanta. Victor Blackwell has the morning off.We begin with breaking news. At least 177 people have been killed when a South Korean plane crashed at an airport. 181 people were on board. Two crew members were pulled alive from the wreckage, from the tail of the plane, and rescuers say the rest of the passengers and crew are presumed dead. Now, video into CNN shows the plane dragging on the runway, careening on the runway, on its belly, with no landing gear before bursting into flames. Local fire officials and aviation experts say some sort of landing gear malfunction was likely. The pilot also made a mayday call shortly after the control tower warned about birds in the area. According to FlightAware, the Jeju airliner was listed as a Boeing 737-800 traveling from Bangkok, Thailand, before it crash-landed at the Muan airport in the southwest of South Korea. It is the country's worst air disaster in decades. CNN's Mike Valerio is joining us now from Seoul with the latest. Mike, from the live pictures that we have been seeing, emergency personnel are still on the scene. What's happening there? What's the latest?",

That is the hope that they can recover those remains for the family members who are gathered and are wailing in the main arrival halls of this airport that's about three and a half hours south of where we're standing in Seoul, South Korea. So you can see from the live pictures there, the floodlit setting as emergency crews are now working more than 12 hours on the scene trying to do this for the sake of the families who just want answers and want to know if their loved ones can be recovered.Also breaking within the past couple minutes, Amara, we now have a national period of mourning throughout South Korea that's going to be lasting from this moment through Saturday. So that takes us through New Year's Day, New Year's Eve, celebrations in question perhaps being put on hold or even canceled as South Korea, you know, finds itself with a new pall that has been thrown over the country after December 3rd and December 4th when the country was put through a few hours of martial law, the political crisis that has unfolded, and now this. So if you're just waking up and joining us, we're going to take you through what exactly we understand has happened. And the central question, as you alluded to, Amara, is simply what happened with the landing gear of this aircraft, those heart-stopping, certainly breathtaking scenes of the aircraft careening down the runway with its belly scraping the tarmac without its landing gear deployed is certainly the central element that investigators are looking at right now. But in terms of what was going on, we have a plane that was headed to South Korea from Bangkok, Thailand, left just after 2l00 a.m. local time, was bound for here in South Korea the 9:00 a.m. hour. Just before 9:00 a.m., the control tower of this airport sends a message to the plane and says, paraphrasing here, Amara, hey, there are birds in the area. There's a danger of bird strikes. Two minutes later, that's when the mayday message goes out. And just roughly four minutes or so later, that's when the plane crashes. Now, there have been several members of the emergency response teams that have been working on this crash mentioning the possibility of a bird strike leading to a chain reaction that caused this cataclysmic crash. Potentially, potentially, it has been certainly unusual that we have people from certain ministries or even the fire department handling this case and this disaster mentioning that a bird strike so early on in the investigation could have possibly created this chain reaction. But we do remarkably have two survivors, a man and a woman who were part of the flight crew, sitting as far back in the airplane as you possibly can in the wing section. They're both being treated at hospitals, one of whom is already here in Seoul. Video that's coming into CNN, we're going to put it on the air shortly, shows the man on a stretcher. The woman crew member is on her way here to a level one trauma center in Seoul. So simply remarkable that they survived. And hopefully with the voice and data recorder that comprise the black box, those two survivors can shed light on just what happened here, Amara.",

We have a stretch of tornado watches from Charlotte down through Savannah, including Charleston, Columbia, South Carolina, all of this until 1The tornado watch has stretched down to the panhandle this morning, where we still have some severe thunderstorms. This line, again, has just been intense with damaging winds. Looks like we have a tornado warning right there in upstate South Carolina, just to the west there of Greenville. We've got this line of severe thunderstorm warnings stretching from Greenville, South Carolina, all the way down to Augusta. This entire line has a push of 60-mile-per-hour damaging winds. That's what we're most concerned about, and we can find embedded tornadoes along this line. Another push of damaging winds from Panama City. When you have this line of storms kind of bending like that, that's when you really could see some wind damage out of this, something that we'll need to continue to watch. Now, this is coming after we've got more than 160 reports of severe damage yesterday, including more than -- about 35 tornado reports across. You can see much of the south here. That threat, again, shifting east as we go through the day today. Now, it's not quite as intense as it was yesterday. We're looking at a level 2 out of 5. But as we're seeing this morning, we're looking at that line packing damaging winds and embedded isolated tornadoes as we go through the afternoon. So it continues to charge eastward through the Carolinas through midday and into the afternoon, making it towards Raleigh later on this afternoon. Finally exits offshore. The parent storm to the north will start to swirl, bringing some rain, possibly even some snow showers to the Great Lakes. That will get you about an inch or two of rain as we go up and down the east coast, making things pretty soggy, also have some fog that has been keeping visibility pretty low. So as far as your travel goes, obviously some problems in the south. Atlanta, Raleigh could have some of these delays. We are also looking at the possibility of delays because of rain and some fog up in, you know, New York, Boston, Kansas City has had some of that fog this morning. And we still have problems in the Pacific Northwest. Rain, snow, gusty winds has been nonstop at that atmospheric river. So travel problems there today, travel problems up and down the east coast as we go through the afternoon as well. Then that storm that's currently in the Pacific Northwest tries to work its way across the country as we go through the rest of the week.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translation):  The army are surrounding us from every side, our situation is very difficult. Dr. Hussam was directly threatened with arrest. They might arrest him at any time. GOTKINE (VOICE-OVER):  Words from a nurse at Kamal Adwan Hospital in the midst of an evacuation order from the Israeli military. Doctor Hussam Abu Safiya, the hospitals director, is one of the last doctors in Northern Gaza. He had been documenting the horror inside his hospital in the wake of an Israeli offensive that began in early October. DR. HUSSAM ABU SAFIYA, DIRECTOR, KAMEL ADWAN HOSPITAL (through translation):  We had spoken and appealed to the world to protect and neutralize the medical system. But unfortunately, this is the grim reality we are witnessing. GOTKINE (VOICE-OVER):  On Friday, he was assaulted and detained by Israeli forces, witnesses tell CNN.

SHUROUQ SALAH, NURSE AT KAMAL ADWAN HOSPITAL (through translation): They separated the men from the women and took the women in groups. Those who refused to remove their clothing were beaten and they took our phones. I didn't have a phone, but those who were refusing to hand over their phones were beaten. And those who refused to take off their clothes were also beaten. GOTKINE (VOICE-OVER):  The IDF says that it had carried out targeted operations around the hospital based on intelligence regarding the presence of terrorist infrastructure and operatives there. CNN cannot confirm these claims. On Friday, the World Health Organization said the raid took the last major health facility in north Gaza out of service. Adding that, the systematic dismantling of the health system in Gaza is a death sentence for tens of thousands of Palestinians in need of health care. Many patients now evacuated to Gaza's other hospitals, which medical staff say are not fit for purpose.
