Air-raid sirens in fact could be heard in Kyiv as he arrived. Mr. Biden walked alongside Mr. Zelenskyy outside St. Michael's Cathedral and some winter sunshine there greeted them. And it was a reminder though the dangers amid the ongoing war. And a risk that White House officials say the president wanted to take. Mr. Biden said he wanted to leave no doubt of the unwavering U.S. support for Ukraine after a year of war that has devastated the country. Now, during his visit, Mr. Biden announced a half billion dollars in new assistance for Ukraine that will include of course, more military equipment. Now, we are tracking all developments with CNN correspondents. Kevin Liptak is standing by for us in Moscow. And Clare Sebastian is live for us in London. Kevin, I want to go to you first. A bold and very historic moment there for Biden, Kyiv, and so much more to come in Poland. What more are you learning about how all of this went down and the fact that it really was truly unprecedented?",

      "sentences": "Yes. Well, I think that Putin speech long postponed, by the way, this is the State of the Nation essentially addressed, the first one in almost two years that President Putin will be giving designed efficiently for a domestic audience, but I think it's clear that they will also have the eyes of the world on this and they know that very well.In terms of how it was received so far, the Kremlin seems to be holding fire for this speech. We did get a response from the former President Dmitry Medvedev. Now deputy head of the Security Council in Russia. He made a lot of the idea that this was sort of prearranged that that Moscow had some warning that this was happening. He said Biden, having received security guarantees in advance finally went to Kyiv. He goes on to essentially accused the west of profiting from this war. I think economists will mostly tell you that the opposite is true. He is known for his very sort of strident, nationalist comments around this. But in terms of other reaction, we also heard from various influential military bloggers, their responses ranging from sort of defiance to despair around this one noting that it was a demonstrative humiliation of Russia and another pointing out somewhat ironically that Biden made it to Kyiv before Putin. I think a couple of things are clear that we should watch for in Putin speech. One is that this really will bolster the Russian argument that they are at war, not just with Ukraine, but with the collective West, the U.S. and NATO. That is an argument that's used not only to diminish the sense of their own battlefield defeat, but also to deny Ukraine sovereignty, which is something that they have now been doing for this entire year. But also, it's clear that the goals that President Putin expressed in speeches exactly a year ago, to essentially swallow up Ukraine to make it part of Russia. If you look at the optics of President Zelenskyy standing next to Biden, also President Zelenskyy's recent trips to various European countries and the U.S. that those goals as of now are failing.",

But the U.S. of course, skeptical and warning Beijing not to provide lethal weapons to the Russian military. CNN's Kristie Lu Stout is following developments from Hong Kong.

With the winter storm warning, that's backup now for Minneapolis where we can expect over two feet of snow within the next three days. There it is, the system. This is going to come in two waves here. Round one pushing in and then once the system moves in, the winds really pick up. So, then we wind up with whiteout conditions. We're talking like 35 to 50 mile per hour wind gusts. We do have high wind warnings in place for parts of the Rockies, that's going to shift eastward as this first low moves eastward. There's round one coming in on Tuesday where Minneapolis could pick up four to six inches. Then the second wave moving in Wednesday and Thursday. That's where we expect some of the heaviest snowfall across the upper Midwest and across the Great Lakes. Ice expected. So, there's the dark pink that you're seeing anywhere between 18 to 24 inches of snow across the northern plains and upper Midwest stretching into the Great Lakes. This is where we'll have to focus on the ice where we pick up roughly about a quarter of an inch to a half an inch regardless travel is going to be a mess.

Now, this was the moment, you'll see it there when Monday's earthquake struck in southern Turkey's Hatay Province. At least three people were killed and almost 300 were injured in Turkey.

So, you can imagine the sense of fear and urgency around Southeast Turkey. Now we've seen search and rescue teams working overnight. Some of those buildings that were already damaged in the earthquake two weeks ago have since collapsed and there are concerns that there may be further fatalities at this stage. Turkey's disaster and emergency agency has identified at least 294 people who have been injured in this latest aftershock. And among them, 18 are considered to be in a serious condition. But of course, we are still getting updates from the authorities on that. And there is a real sense of urgency. We've seen that outpouring of support over the last two weeks and that is only going to increase following this latest aftershock. The authorities say they've already sent about 6000 tents to the affected areas. They're expecting that to continue as they assess the need in those affected provinces. We've already heard of field hospitals operating overnight. They already were. But of course, you can imagine the shock for those already -- who've already been through the earthquake two weeks ago.

I want to know, though, do you accept that perhaps this visit, you know, gave Putin perhaps a propaganda win of his own? Because he has said to Russians, or he will say to Russians, certainly his allies have said to Russia -- to Russians look. We're not just battling Ukraine here, we are battling the United States and all its European allies.PROCHWICZ-JAZOWSKA: Of course, you could -- when you look at it from the Russian propaganda perspective, and the way that they've spun this story, they didn't even need this particular visit, in order to portray this war in the way that they're showing it to their intern through their internal propaganda to Russians. Basically, they're portraying it as a proxy war of Russia against the United States, which is completely false. And this visit is analyzed in this light, of course, and very keen to see this is, of course, a developing story. And I'd like to see what President Putin will today say in his address, as you mentioned before. But at the end of the day, what we saw is the leader of the free world, going into a country that one year ago, was on the way to being invaded by Ukraine. But managed to withhold that invasion to not let the Russians take over their territory. And that is what really should be taken out from the story that now Biden is showing that Ukraine has withheld this invasion, and that he is capable of going to Ukraine and standing there while Putin is not able to leave his country and his hiding away.",

I mean, arguably, it's been very impressive so far. And those are the keywords, you know, especially in places like Poland, is there a worry that some other European allies may waver?PROCHWICZ-JAZOWSKA: No doubt, experience a sense of a bit of fear of this wavering perhaps happening. However, this is a feeling that has been ongoing since the start of the war. And what we've seen so far, thanks to the push, also, thanks to Poland's push, to the push of the entire eastern flank. But with Poland playing a very special role here is to make sure that other European countries, that do not perceive this threat from Russia and aggressive Russian foreign policy are in such an existential way, in order for them to understand that it is an existential threat. And so, we've managed throughout this year to really move the needle on many things that we thought were unthinkable arms deliveries from Germany and European Union, pulling together procurement in defense, which was unthinkable until now. And the United States coming back as a superpower, a leader in Europe, which in the previous era, under the Trump administration was very much doubted. So, since we've already seen so much move in this direction, I do believe that there's a very strong case to make that a lot can still be achieved in the -- in the upcoming future. And this is a war that is transforming the mentalities, not just the defense budgets, but the mentalities of Western Europeans towards this military threat and away from what they thought was time of peace, the end of history, the peace. And have to worry about our defense spending. So, so much has happened. And I can see this going forward in the right direction.",
