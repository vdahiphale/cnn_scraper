She had her plan, what she wanted to do for her son, for herself, for their future. And so when she discovered that she was pregnant, she decided she wanted to have an abortion. But because of the Trump abortion ban here in Georgia, she was forced to travel out of state to receive the healthcare that she needed. But when she returned to Georgia, she needed additional care. So she went to a hospital. But you see, under the Trump abortion ban, her doctors could have faced up to a decade in prison for providing Amber the care she needed. Understand what a law like this means. Doctors have to wait until the patient is at death's door before they take action. You know, on the other side of my, you know, the other folks, Trump and his running mate, and they'll talk about, oh, yes, but I, you know, I do believe in the exception to save the mother's life. OK. All right. Let's break that down, shall we? (APPLAUSE)",

There she was recounting the story of Amber Thurman, this Georgia woman who passed away, as ProPublica reported, as a result of what Harris describes as Trump's abortion ban, his effort to overturn Roe v. Wade by appointing Supreme Court justices. There, Harris calling Republicans hypocrites, saying that they have not provided care for women and children in the United States, but yet have argued that these changes to abortion laws are in the interests of women. One especially notable moment there, she described her upbringing and her desire to become a prosecutor as being rooted in an effort to help a friend when she was a young woman. A friend of hers was apparently being routinely molested by her father, and she approached her mother asking if her family could take her in. And she says that that desire to advocate for those who are vulnerable was born in those moments. And that is what has led her now to the vice presidency and, of course, running for the White House. But going back to that moment about Amber Thurman, she described in detail her interactions with her mother. And it is a captivating story.",

You can imagine the stress and strain that that puts on a family to have to start over in new schools, maybe even a new country every few years.Well, Blue Star Families, the leading nonprofit servicing military and veteran families -- which full disclosure, I'm on the board of -- tries to make that a little easier. And tomorrow, they're doing just that. They're kicking off Blue Star Welcome Week. And we have Kathy Roth-Douquet, the founder and CEO and president of Blue Star Families. And Kathy, you've been doing this, Blue Star Welcome Week, now for a few years. It's really America's newest tradition. KATHY ROTH-DOUQUET, FOUNDER AND CEO, BLUE STAR FAMILIES: It is. And we love this tradition. You know, 600,000 military families move every year from duty station to duty station. They're at risk of being isolated. And if folks are lonely, they can't find their friends, their solutions, their doctors, and all those activities. Things spiral downhill. They're living in communities. They're not on installations. So we need to find a way to welcome them. And when we do, everything's awesome.",

And most of them actually don't. They're living in our communities. They're in our neighborhoods. They're in our kids' schools. They're in our workplaces.So what do we do to welcome them during Welcome Week and year round? ROTH-DOUQUET: So Welcome Week is super fun because people hold block parties to welcome military families. We've got a school here in Springfield, Virginia, who all week they're having every kid wear blue to welcome the military kids. They're interviewing them. And at the end of the week, they're having a lunch for all the military families to come in and get welcome. All over the country, there's different ways -- people are taking outings, rolling out their red carpet. And it makes a difference in people's lives.",

I think that doesn't occur to people who don't move all the time.But talk about ways you can reach out to maybe a new neighbor who might be military about giving them recommendations in your community for the best thing, just to make best things, to make their lives a little bit easier. ROTH-DOUQUET: You know, Brianna, and you know this. We moved a lot in my family, nine times in 16 years. And you really don't know. You know, I want my kids to keep taking the piano or the guitar. Where do I go for that? I got a pet, and I want to take care of that pet. I don't have a person to put down as my emergency contact at the school when I go into the school. So just asking, hey, at my school, in this class, are there any military families? I want to make sure I include them when there's a party or an outing. At this sports club, are there any military families? Let's ask if these kids, you know, need any extra attention and support. Maybe there's a dad deployed. Ask the question. Be welcoming. Include them. It will mean the world to people.",

We'll help you get to know your neighbors. We want the civilians to sign up, too. And then 365 days a year, we have things for people. Our military are living in their community. They're taking care of us so we can be safe and secure. But we actually have to take care of them, too, so they can keep doing this tough job. And everyone wins when we do that.",

But you're also discovering a lot of other needs that they may have through your research.What are you seeing? ROTH-DOUQUET: Sure. Unfortunately, food insecurity is becoming a bigger and bigger problem for folks in the military. Twenty-six percent of our enlisted families are having a hard time making ends meet. It's expensive -- housing is expensive now, and sometimes you have to choose between the two. But often, people find help through the people they know. They find jobs through people they know. They find these kinds of solutions. So we do direct service, like putting together food pantries and doing giveaways for coupons for groceries. But also, this fellowship makes a difference. It helps people solve their problems locally. And that's the solution, too.",
