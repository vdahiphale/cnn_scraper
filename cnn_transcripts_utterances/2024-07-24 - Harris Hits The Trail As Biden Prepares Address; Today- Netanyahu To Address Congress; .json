Will that translate an actual movement in the race?

It shows Kamala Harris at 44, Donald Trump at 42. Our official characterization of this here at CNN is that there's no clear leader. But let's throw up what this looks like compared to July 16, which, of course, came right after the assassination attempt. That's what the Reuters/Ipsos poll. That's the difference, right? So on July 16, it was Trump plus two. Now, it's Harris plus two. That's a swing of four points.

Let's listen to a little bit of what the former president said on this call. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT &amp; 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  As a result of her dangerously extreme immigration policies, the largest invasion in history is now taking place at our southern border and it's getting worse, not better. They gave it a band-aid a few weeks ago, but the best today it has not been working at all. In her entire time as vice president and borders czar Kamala has reportedly never spoken to the chief of the Border Patrol. She visited the border only a single time, far away from the epicenter of the invasion. (END AUDIO CLIP)",

That's all working in her favor. You know, we saw these clips prior to her becoming, you know, the likely nominee, and oftentimes Republicans would use them to attack her as, being sort of putting out this world salad, not making sense, et cetera.

Big picture, I mean, I am fascinated by the fact that these talks took place in China, and very interested in what that says about the region and the various push and pull. But this is a significant agreement because these factions have not been able to get on the same page in the past, what happened here and what does it mean for the future of Gaza? MAX FOSTER, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR &amp; CORRESPONDENT:  Well, the Palestinian authority is being control of Gaza and the West Bank get lost control of Gaza when there was a vote and Hamas got voted in. It's also become much less popular in the West Bank since the war began. And Hamas has become more popular in the west bank because of the way they resisted Israeli attacks in Gaza. So that's the sort of domestic view, very briefly. They're in a position now where, you know, Fatah and the Palestine Authority are weakening. They've got to find a way forward. There's lot of pressure, obviously, from local Arab countries, but also European countries in the U.S. to try to come up with some sort of authority that would oversee Gaza and the West Bank going forward when this war is finally finished. So they're trying to find some sort of solution to that. On the China angle, I mean, it is interesting because Chinas asserting itself on the world stage, getting involved in this conflict. But this still wouldn't have happened in America because America wouldn't agree to Hamas being part of this future, and that's where we're getting the resistance now.",
