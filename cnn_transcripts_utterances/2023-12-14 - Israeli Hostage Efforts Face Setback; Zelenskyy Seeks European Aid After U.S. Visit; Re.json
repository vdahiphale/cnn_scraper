Hours after the latest pleas from families to bring their loved ones home. After leaving the United States almost empty-handed, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy persuaded some of his European allies to open their wallets. And U.S. Republican lawmakers opened an impeachment inquiry against President Joe Biden despite the fact they have yet to come up with any evidence of impeachable offenses.And we do begin this hour in Gaza, where a dire humanitarian crisis is deepening as Israel's war against Hamas intensifies and Israeli officials vow to fight until the end. New video shows what overwhelmed hospitals are now facing. And we do want to warn you, viewers may find the images disturbing. The video was shot at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in central Gaza on Wednesday and shows those injured being treated on the floor amid chaotic scenes. Many casualties were brought in on Wednesday after a reported strike. Several other hospitals in Gaza also reported receiving a high number of civilian casualties that very same day. And it's not just the expanding war, but also the weather. I mean, look at this. That's bringing more misery to Gaza's displaced population. Heavy rain has flooded makeshift tents, and some have had to dig trenches to try and keep that water out. Meantime, in Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke of the great pain felt there after nine Israeli soldiers were killed in battle in northern Gaza. Today's casualties are among the largest loss of life in a single incident for Israeli forces since the ground offensive began. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

You'll recall during the seven-day truce in the Israel-Hamas war, each day of that truce, a small number of hostages was successfully getting out. But that truce, of course, ultimately fell apart.The war has resumed, and no hostages have gotten out since then. And so these family members are all pressing both the Israeli government as well as the Biden administration to basically get creative, to do really anything, take any action to try to get additional hostages out. But the tough reality right now, according to CNN's reporting, is that there is no movement at the moment. There isn't even a formal negotiation to try to get Hamas back to the negotiating table as it relates to these hostages, our reporting is that in recent days, Hamas has actually been entirely unresponsive to various overtures that have been made to once again discuss some kind of deal, some kind of negotiation to get more of these hostages out. So that certainly is not good news for these families. But they did say after this meeting at the White House and seeing the president in person that those meetings -- that meeting helped to refuel their hope that the White House is in fact trying to do everything that they can to get more of these hostages out of Gaza.

You know, the stories from those families of the hostages have just been so powerful, right? They've been, in fact, a potent political force. Maybe some of their family members wouldn't be free right now if it hadn't been for that potent political force. Now, I have spoken with some of those families. I know there is so much ambivalence. They want Israel to defend itself, and yet they've been put in this impossible situation. You know, at this hour, their loved ones could not just be captives, but could be under threat from the Israeli army that's supposed to be trying to free them.STEVEN COOK, SR. FELLOW MIDDLE EASTERN STUDIES, COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS: Yeah, this is perhaps one of the most difficult situations facing the Israelis, as well. As the United States in this operation. It's very unclear at this point how many of those hostages remain alive. There's a reason why Hamas has been so recalcitrant about restart negotiations for a hostage release. There is some speculation that some good number of those people are not alive. And it's clear also that the Israel Defense Forces, as well as the government, although they have been speaking, quite openly about the rescue or return of hostages, are not willing any longer to subordinate their overall operation and their overall goals of destroying Hamas for the benefit of those families who are waiting to hear about their loved ones. In a conflict of impossible situations, this is high among the most impossible of them.",

In addition to that European Council summit, we were just talking about, we are also just hours away from Vladimir Putin's annual press conference. You know, you and I have seen these before. They're long, freewheeling events. And in the past, Putin has actually tolerated pointed questions from foreign journalists. You know, I think it's a good thing. Even Zelenskyy right now predicts Putin is likely to be in high spirits. Is that warranted?[00:14:59] DANIEL TREISMAN, POLITICAL SCIENCE PROF. UNIV. OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES: I think he will be in high spirits. And I think he'll be really trying to project a certain image because this is, in effect, the start of his re-election campaign next March. Big surprise, of course. Nobody expected him not to. But he'll want to come out now, and in this joint press conference and call-in show, he'll want to demonstrate to ordinary Russians that he cares about them, that he's focused on their problems, as well as international affairs. And so he's going to try and look responsive. He'll be taking calls from Russians around the country, offering the promising to solve all their problems. And we'll probably see a little bit of the old Santa Claus strategy of offering different benefits to different groups. So that'll be the big emphasis, I think. And then, of course, we may see some gloating over the divisions in the West. He's delighted at the failure of Congress to pass the additional aid for Ukraine. He's going he's also going to be delighted if the Europeans in the summit you just mentioned fail to themselves decide on new aid for Ukraine with Hungarian President Viktor Orban, Prime Minister Viktor Orban strongly against that. So, he feels pretty good about his situation internationally at the moment and right at the moment at the front lines, too. He probably feels quite confident.

First of all, we're going to see atrocities in the other areas of Ukraine that they haven't yet occupied. And then the mood in Moscow will be very buoyant. And the temptation will be great for them to take aim at some other places where there are ethnic Russians living such as the Baltic states, which are, of course, NATO members.So, I think it's very short sighted to think that we can actually save money by refusing to help Ukraine as it fights to defend itself and instead just wait until we have to be more involved in a potential military conflict involving NATO states.",

So flooding seems to be the new best option to really probe the extent of the invisible subterranean network. Both destroying Hamas, hiding there, and denying it their use. Of course, a key caveat in success here is, if you can't find the tunnel, and it's not connected to a system you're already flooding, how affected can you be about flooding it and knowing that you're hitting, destroying the whole of the tunnel network?
