MOHELA is the Missouri Higher Education Loan Authority for most people watching who've never heard of it. Ariane, let's start with you, the key takeaways of today's arguments. ARIANE DE VOGUE, CNN U.S. SUPREME COURT REPORTER: Right. Coming out of oral arguments that ended after more than three hours, it was clear to me that this is an uphill battle for Biden, because I counted at least five conservative justices who really seemed skeptical of whether or not this plan is legal. Most of their arguments were around whether or not something like this needed congressional authorization. As Chief Justice John Roberts said, it has to do with a half trillion dollars, millions of Americans. He really suggested that. They also had concerns with, look, maybe in a time of emergency this was executive overreach. But also they had another point and they just really talked about basic fairness: What about people who paid their loans? What about people who didn't get loans, because they knew they couldn't pay for them? Listen to conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch on that particular point. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And the big question is whether or not the states in the first place can bring this challenge whether or not they can show that they have the injury.The reason that's important is because if they can't show such an injury, then the case would get dismissed, and the plan would go into effect. That's why you saw Jackson pushing on some of their theories of standing. But one thing she also really talked about is, look, we can't allow states every time they object to the policy of a president from a different party to be able to come in and bring a policy to a standstill. That was her concern. She thought here that the states didn't have the right to be in court. But there did not seem like there were five justices behind her and the Liberals on this. We'll see, you never know after oral arguments, but that's where things stand. And keep in mind, meanwhile, you've got millions of student borrowers who are just waiting here wondering if they're going to be able to get this kind of relief.",

Of course, we have had senior U.S. officials warned repeatedly in recent weeks that China is considering providing legal aid to Russia for the war in Ukraine. Just this week, President Biden issued a memorandum to federal agencies ordering them to ban the Chinese app Tiktok from federal devices within 30 days. And, of course, now just this week, as well, we learned that there are new questions about the origins of COVID-19 and where it actually began and how. So of course, these are all things that are going to come up tonight in this hearing. But really the big picture is that this committee, this House Select Committee on China wants to take a bipartisan look at managing competition with China at focusing on its military rise and at trying to figure out how to decouple the United States' economy from the Chinese economy. The top two members on that panel say that it has been a mistake essentially to bring China into the global economy the way that the United States and the West have done. And so this is going to be one of a series of hearings that this committee is going to hold over the next few years taking a serious look at what they say is the serious national security risk that China's rise poses to the United States, guys.",
