      "sentences": "That's right. And that was a key focus here because we're told by election officials here in Maricopa County that they received an unprecedented number of mail-in ballots that were physically delivered to polling locations on the date of the election. Now, that's fine. Voters can do that. We've heard a number of reasons why they may have wanted to do that. Perhaps voters didn't decide until the last minute which candidate they actually wanted to support. Perhaps they thought that it was more secure to actually give that ballot to the election worker. But that means that there's a backlog here. Some 290,000 votes still left to be counted from that tranche A total of 340,000 votes just for Maricopa County alone. And, of course, the reason why this is so important is, we look atthese vote totals in these key races. You can see in the U.S. Senate race between Senator Mark Kelly and venture capitalist Blake Masters that the split there is just about 115,000 votes between the two. Again, hundreds of thousands of votes left to be casted and counted. And, of course, as we look at the governor's race, Secretary of State Katie Hobbs leads Kari Lake by even tighter of a margin, which is why there's been so much focus on this race. Now, it's important to point out that this race has also been plagued recently by conspiracy theories, particularly the Republican gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake casting doubt on the work of election workers. She's alleging that they are slow rolling and slow walking this process for political reasons. The Republican head of elections here came out blasting those accusations, defending his own people. There's one other conspiracy theory we saw yesterday, and this started on far right media. There was a claim that Katie Hobbs, the secretary of state, was actually inside the voting counting center. This far right website posted an image of a woman in glasses. That resulted in the elections department here tweeting out a response. I'll read you part of that. They say that not every woman with glasses is Katie Hobbs. We can confirm this was a party observer. Please refrain from making assumptions about workers who happen to wear glasses. A cheeky response there, but, obviously, very serious when we talk about conspiracy theories. This building, guys, behind us, is surrounded by sheriff's deputies. That's the world we live in now. People doing their civic duty to count votes are now surrounded by armed guards.",

      "sentences": "Good morning to both of you.Let me just follow up on what Rosa was just talking about there. In Nevada, you can see the Republican Adam Laxalt ahead by about 9,000 votes. Yesterday, for most of the day, he had a lead of about 15,000 votes. But, overnight, there were new vote counts reported and that lead shrunk. Where did it shrink? Washoe County. Right there. There were some 18,000 votes - 18,000 new votes counted there, or reported there. And Catherine Cortez Masto, the Democrat, won about 60 percent. So, you can see how that margin shrunk right there. And in Clark County, down here in the south, there were roughly 12,000 new votes -- counts reported. Twelve thousand of which Catherine Cortez Masto, the Democrat, won 61 percent. So, you can see again how that lead was shrinking. And 57,000 more votes from Clark County, 22,000 more from Washoe. You can see, there might be enough runway there for Catherine Masto to retake the lead. I just want to give you one historical reference point of races in Nevada. They can be very close. The 1998 race, which the late Harry Reid won over John Ensign, he won by 401 votes. So, it can be tight, very tight. This one might be like that. Let's quickly look at Arizona now. You can see Mark Kelly with a lead of 115,000 votes. He expanded that lead from about 85,000 yesterday. Some 540,000 votes left to count. A lot of vote left to count, including a huge batch from Maricopa County, including -- now, stick with me here -- 290,000 mail ballots that were delivered on Election Day, hand-delivered on Election Day. And the big question for control of the Senate right now is, will those ballots behave more like in- person Election Day votes, which can skew Republicans, or the votes we've seen so far being released from Maricopa County, which have skewed Democratic. And even if they skew toward the Republican, will it be enough to make up this 115,000-vote margin? Blake Masters is going to need to win anywhere between 60 percent and 70 percent of the remaining vote if he hopes to win, guys.",

Get to decide the presidency. Get to decide control of the Senate. I mean the five states that flipped from Trump in '16 to Biden in '20, Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, plus Nevada, that may be it on the list of true swing states. And where -- and each of those states, as we have seen, are divided almost exactly in half, which means possibly something like 400,000, 500,000, 600,000 people in the country are deciding at this moment of intense polarization and division between the parties.So, to answer your question, there is a real incentive to, you know, put every ounce of effort into the ground game in those states because they tip -- by the way, 40 states have voted the same way in each of the past four presidential elections.

And, you know, Biden was not in great shape, either, but that -- those are very weak numbers. And the results, the fact that the Trump selected candidates ran so poorly, again, in these key states, these five states that flipped the presidency from '16 to '20, I think is a clear signal to the Republican Party.Look, Republican elites are ready to move on from Trump. I think that's pretty clear. You know, you can see \"The New York Post\" and Rupert Murdoch or many of the big donors, but he has -- still has a big piece of the party.
