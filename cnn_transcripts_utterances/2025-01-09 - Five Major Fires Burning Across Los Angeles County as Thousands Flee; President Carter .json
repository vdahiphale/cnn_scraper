They have been, as we understand it, picking up just a little bit.Kyung Lah is on the ground in Altadena near the Eaton Fire. I don't know if that's affecting things where you are, which is a little bit inland and west. Kyung, tell us what you're seeing there.",

      "sentences": "I can definitely feel that the winds are slightly picking up and I can tell some of that because some of the smoke is blowing, sort of clearing out this area and giving us a better look at what some of these neighborhoods are looking like. We've been basically moving just a couple blocks at a time. This is a different area.But I want you to take a look at what this street looks like. What you're looking at there is a gas line and the gas company is here to try to put out some of these spot fires and then to fully shut off the gas. And as Leonel pans through this community, each one of these is a home. You can see cars. I think that's a that's a water heater, possibly. This looks like this may have been a kitchen and, you know, a lot of chimneys. And you can see the front of homes so you can imagine what each of these families and homeowners had. But you really have to imagine it because there's just nothing left to give you a sort of a physical structure of what these homes look like. This is Altadena. I'm starting to see some residents come back. I'm on Harriet Street. This is a very typical community here in Altadena. And just you can see sort of signs of life as some of these homeowners start to walk these streets and try to figure out what's left. And what they're learning is there's just not a lot left, at least on this street and on some of the surrounding areas. When this fire came through with very little warning, you can see it just mowed through this community. So what today has been about that we've seen over and over again are these residents coming back and trying to figure out what to do to comprehend what's happened because it happened so quickly and then to look at next steps. Firefighters are still working an out of control fire here. There is zero percent containment. It's more than 10,000 acres. There is no power to this region. The surrounding regions, a lot of the schools have been shut down. Air quality is a major concern. So all of these problems, as the major firefight is still going on -- Brianna.",

      "sentences": "Well, kids, kids are not a school in this area the rest of the week. We haven't heard anything beyond into what's going to happen next week. What I can tell you about the families, though, remember how quickly this happened.We started out Monday thinking, OK, it's going to be a fire event. Potentially it might be a wind event. But I just want you to take a look at this, because this community, you can see how flat it is. This is a foothill community. This isn't in the mountains. When you think of California wildfires, at least the way I think of California wildfires, the places that are most at risk are the ones that are surrounded by tons of brush, surrounded by tons of trees and in mountainous regions. That's not what this is. This is a place where a lot of people bought their homes 25, 30 years ago thinking, OK, this is a great, safe, affordable place where I can raise my kids, send them to good schools. And, you know, this is going to be a great life. They didn't buy this thinking that there was going to be massive fires here. And that is something that has changed. So the big conversation between a lot of these families, the immediate one is, OK, we've got to get back. We've got to figure out where we're going to stay. Is there an Airbnb I can rent where we try to figure out how to deal with insurance for all of this? But then the next thing is, OK, this is what we live in now. So across this entire area, a lot of families I know are having this discussion of how safe are we to live in a place where we thought this isn't a huge fire risk. Everywhere is now a large fire risk in Los Angeles County. This has certainly put a period on that. It is very clear to a lot of people what we are living in now.",

He spoke earlier today at the state funeral. Here's part of what he said about one of Carter's lasting achievements, tackling the high inflation of the 1970s and also the appointment of Paul Volcker as chairman of the Federal Reserve.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) AMB. STUART EIZENSTAT, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Over the objection of all of his advisors, he chose Paul Volcker to lead the Federal Reserve, knowing in advance that Volcker's tough monetary policy would raise interest rates and unemployment because Paul told him that and would do so in a presidential election year. You take care of the economy, Paul. I'll take care of the politics. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Yes, he did. It's very interesting. When he ran for office, and I was his policy director both when he ran for governor and president, he was a great retail politician, indefatigable.I mean, for example, before the Iowa caucuses, which everybody else disregarded, he literally spent 100 days in Iowa. But when he came to the White House, he decided to park politics outside the Oval Office. That was a strength and it was a weakness. It was a strength because it allowed him to tackle issues like the Panama Canal, like the Middle East, like energy that other presidents had shied away from. It was a weakness, however, because a president has to be both a commander-in-chief and a politician-in-chief. Now, I think on that balance, it was better that he had taken these issues on because we wouldn't have the Middle East peace process otherwise with Egypt and Israel. We wouldn't have the kind of energy security we have today with the Panama Canal. We wouldn't have a new era in Latin American relations. But he paid a terrible political price for it. For example, nine Democratic senators who voted for the Panama Canal Treaty lost in the next election.",

And I said, Mr. President, we spent two years getting here. It's no fun to get here if you can't play Hail to the Chief. He finally realized that people didn't want to see him as just another common man, which is how he, you know, ran with carrying his own suitcase and so forth. They want the president to be somewhat elevated.He planned this funeral. This wasn't imposed on him. So I think now at the end of his life, he wanted to be seen as a president of the United States, not just as common man Jimmy Carter, that he was in that line of exclusive clubs, that he was the 39th person elected to this office. And he wanted to go out with the flourishes that he sometimes did not have during the White House.",

      "sentences": "Well, first of all, if I have a purpose in this speech, it was to redeem his presidency from the notion that he was only a great ex-president and implicitly, therefore, an unsuccessful president. And what I went through was a whole range of things, deregulation of all our institutions and so forth. I think that today he would be really concerned.And I know he was from talking to him before he passed away, because a lot of the legislation we passed, a lot of energy, deregulation of all the transportation modes, independent counsel, all of those things, inspectors general. We've got a lot of Republican support. And he had breakfasts regularly, not just with the Democratic leadership, the Republican leadership. He would really be very concerned with the tremendous polarization that we have in the country today. You can't govern this country if you view the other side not just as your honored opponent, but as the enemy. He never did. He had very good relations with the Republican leadership from both sides. Howard Baker, who was a great senator from Tennessee, Republican senator, majority leader, was absolutely essential in getting the Panama Canal passed. Just think of getting two-thirds of the Senate to pass a treaty today. It wouldn't happen. And so what I was also trying to say is he is an exemplar of an era which we need to get back to, of more bipartisanship where we don't, again, feel that the opponent is our enemy. And we realize that to make the system work, our system requires compromise. It's not a parliamentary system where you have an absolute majority in the parliament. There has to be cooperation between the president and the congressional branch and between the parties in the congressional branches. That's absolutely essential. And he would be very, very disturbed with the hyperpolarization that we have today.",
