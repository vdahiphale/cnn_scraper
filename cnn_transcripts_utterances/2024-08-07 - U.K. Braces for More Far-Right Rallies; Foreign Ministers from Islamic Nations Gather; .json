      "sentences": "A very warm welcome to the show, everyone, I'm Isa Soares. Tonight, police are bracing for more than a 100protests across the U.K. this hour as far right misinformation fuels violent riots leading to hundreds of arrests. We have the very latest for you. Plus, tensions in the Middle East remain on a knife-edge as Foreign Ministers from dozens of Islamic nations are gathered in Jeddah. We'll be live in the region with the very latest. And Russia accuses Ukraine of a ground incursion in the Kursk region. Such an attack could put large pressure of course, on the Kremlin. We have all the details for you this hour. But, first, tonight, from an extraordinary meeting in Jeddah to behind-the-scenes diplomacy in Washington, high-stakes talks are underway that could determine whether a simmering conflict in the Middle East escalate into a full-scale regional war. Foreign Ministers from dozens of Islamic nations are gathered in Jeddah at the request of Iran. It has threatened retaliation against Israel after the assassination of a Hamas leader, if you remember, on Iranian soil. Iran's proxies are also threatening action. Hezbollah says it's keeping Israel waiting as quote, \"part of the punishment\". The U.S. is calling on all sides to de-escalate. Iran's new President spoke by phone today with French President Emmanuel Macron, saying, if the West really wants to prevent a wider war, it must stop selling arms to Israel and force it to accept a ceasefire in Gaza. Meantime, a statement by Egypt is raising eyebrows. It has instructed all of its airlines to avoid flying over Tehran overnight for a specific three- hour period. Let's get all the angles for you to digest, there's a lot for us to go through. Our Nic Robertson is in Jeddah, Jeremy Diamond for us, joins us tonight as well in Tel Aviv. Let's start with you first, Nic, we are hearing as you just said from Egypt instructing airline carriers to avoid Tehran tonight. Egypt, I believe is part of this Organization of Islamic Nations, I'm not sure if they're there, their Foreign Ministers are there. But what are you hearing from your contacts on the ground there?",

That's something they want to respond for all that, something they said they'll respond for. But if there was a ceasefire deal in the offering, then they would be able to say, look, hold on a minute, we value the -- our sovereignty, our territorial integrity. But we also value Palestinian's lives so much better to go for that ceasefire. Well, that's not something that if you will, there was an answer for the meeting here today. The meeting here today which lasted about four hours, there was strong and joint condemnation for Israel, criticizing Israel for killing Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. Israel has not said that it did it, but that's what everyone believes. And also for violating Iran's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and also united criticism of Israel for the deaths of so many Palestinians in Gaza. I asked the Palestinian permanent representative to the U.N., who was the Palestinian representative in the meeting here, I asked him, did the meeting here lower the tensions and the risk of escalation at the moment?

I think the assessment more broadly is, there is still a window of opportunity here, but it's going to require the United States, definitely France, maybe the U.K., others maybe, to put pressure on Prime Minister Netanyahu to agree to a ceasefire. That's the de-escalation process that the meeting here was talking about, this emerging narrative. But it's not clear that the real traction for it is there yet.",

Butas of now, the Israeli officials I've spoken to have no clear indications yet, that there is a path to de-escalation. What is instead being suggested to me about the fact that we are now a week removed from the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, and Hamas has yet to carry out its vow to retaliate. Is the fact that Iran is playing psychological warfare games with the Israeli public. That is, of course, one interpretation. And another interpretation could be that they are working to ready their proxies in the region, that they are making plans for the possibility of a broader regional war, or that they are looking for that diplomatic off-ramp that Nic was just talking about. I also think that something else that needs to be considered is the fact that Hezbollah has also vowed to carry out retaliation, not just for the killing of Ismail Haniyeh, but also for the killing of one of its most senior military commanders, Fuad Shukr, which happened just hours before the assassination of Haniyeh in Tehran. And there is also the increasing possibility that Hezbollah could act alone without necessarily a firm green-light or a firm know from Iran itself. And so, certainly, that is something that Israeli officials are watching for as well. In the meantime, as they play this waiting game, what we are hearing from Israeli officials are projections of strength, including today from the Israeli military's top General, General Herzi Halevi, saying that Israel is prepared for all scenarios, and stressing in particular, the ability of the Israeli military and its Air Force in particular to quickly switch from a defensive scenario to an offensive scenario in any place in the Middle East, including Lebanon, but also perhaps further away.",

This is a protest, a demonstration that was organized to start around now. There was also far-right groups on the internet, far-right shots spreading a call to come out to this address just over here behind me, you can see it's been boarded up, but this is actually an immigration office solicitors found that essentially provides immigration services, asylum application, student visas, business relocations, all those kinds of things. And they were on a list, essentially, that was published online where far- right groups weren't expected to turn out at some point in the next hour. I can tell you we haven't seen any sign of that as of yet. So far, it's just these counter-protesters who are also seeing people from local Muslim and Asian communities come out. They've been telling us that they simply want to come out and show their numbers and show that they're here to protect their communities. But as Nada was saying, the police presence is intense. They basically put barriers around this whole area. There's more people gathered over there, they've sort of separated out. These people, the Metropolitan police has said that in addition to the thousands of officers already on duty, they've made another 1,300 or so public order officers available to join. They are making it very clear, not only through the sentences that we've already seen today, but through the rhetoric that we're hearing from officials that any offenses, any breaking of the law will be cracked down-on extremely hard.",

I mean, we are expecting as both our correspondents were outlining there, potentially more riots throughout the country today. I mean, this is not only absolutely appalling, but that terrifying and can imagine for so many. Why is this happening now and what's fueling this? HUMZA YOUSAF, POLITICIAN &amp; FORMER SCOTTISH FIRST MINISTER:  Look, first of all, let me say you're absolutely right to use the word rioters. I've taken real exception to some in the media who have called what we've witnessed over the last few days, protests, they're not. Mosques have been attacked, black and Asian people have been targeted with violence, and we've heard the most vile Islamophobia that I've ever witnessed in my life that's being said on the streets of the U.K. This is -- these are race riots. These are pogroms against Muslims and people of color. What's fueling it? Well, this has not happened in a vacuum. We've had years, if not decades of the far-right rhetoric against immigrants, against Muslims that has been adopted by our political -- by our politicians, has become mainstreamed in our political discourse. So, as opposed to confronting the far-right, what we've had is politician after politician. Certainly, in the U.K., government, party after party adopt that language, dehumanize migrants. And there's been many examples of that. We now have, in fact, just after the general election, a number of members of the parliament, you have a history, in fact,  amid 11 after making anti-immigrant remarks. And then of course, we had that terrible tragedy, the killing of three beautiful souls, young children in Southport. And of course, we know that misinformation and disinformation was allowed to run rampant. In fact, was amplified on some social media platforms like X, formerly known as Twitter. And of course, the owner of that particular social media platform himself, Elon Musk, playing a hand and amplifying that disinformation as well, because we know that the individual who's been charged with these terrible murders is not a Muslim refugee as the disinformation suggested initially.

Now, the reason for that is not down to the political party that I belong to, but for 25 years since we've had a Scottish parliament, all of the politicians, all of the political parties have spoken very positively about the benefits of migration, because ultimately, although, of course, nobody ever wants uncontrolled migration. Migration to the United Kingdom has been good. It's contributed to our economy, has contributed to our society, to our culture, to academia, goodness, it's even contributed, dare I say, to our cuisine.

The former high school teacher and football coach leaned into his every man-appeal and Midwestern roots. And he took very little time really attacking his Republican opponents. Have a listen.

Trump is selling a dystopianvision of a nation in the grip of crime, massive immigration, a country that's falling apart and needs a strong man to fix it. Hitherto, the Biden campaign has been talking a lot about democracy under threat. And it's not exactly the most optimistic image either. There are real throwbacks, I think, between now what we're seeing from the Harris campaign, the pivot in the last few weeks to a much more optimistic, hope fueled message. And it does remind me a lot of the Obama campaign in 2008. That event last night in Philadelphia, which I was at, was the most energy I've seen in a Democratic event since 2008. You certainly didn't see that with Hillary Clinton, for example, in 2016. And then, we had the COVID campaign in 2020. So, that is the trine of -- the transformational vibe, I think, that the Harris campaign is now trying to conjure. The question is whether that's a good fit for a country that has endured a lot over the last eight years. Perhaps everyone is ready to move on from the darkness of the Trump era and what followed the pandemic and everything else. But if it's wrong, it could be it could be a mistake and we'll see --",

Russia saysUkrainian troops crossed the border into the Kursk region. You can see that on your map. Their troops launched what it deemed a massive attack. Video from the area shows low flying aircraft and black smoke rising from burnt out vehicles. Russia says about 300 troops plus tanks and armored vehicles hit Russian positions. Ukrainian authorities have not commented on these claims despite significant video evidence of the assault. A Russian official says several thousand people have left the region in the past day. Our Nick Paton Walsh joins me now for much more on this. So, Nick, what are you hearing from your contacts, from your sources about Ukraine and why it did this?",

      "sentences": "It's a bit early. So, we don't know the full picture, but the first obvious answer is, this now means that Vladimir Putin, who called this amajor provocation, said that the Ukrainians were firing indiscriminately on civilians, a bit rich, given Russia's been doing that for years, and now, his forces say they've halted it, he's going to have to bring in reinforcements, already signs of that, from around Russia, to stop this assault from spreading and becoming worse. So, it puts the Russians on their back foot, catches them off guard, clearly. Bit of an embarrassment. And for Ukraine, certainly already, it's a headline that isn't Ukraine is slowly losing, and Ukraine is waiting for weapons. So, some positive effect for Kyiv. But there are some analysts suggesting there might be a wider play, potentially, here. Sudzha has a gas terminal on the border area between Ukraine and Russia that is key for gas deliveries from Russia to Ukraine to Europe. They're still going on despite this war being in its third year. And while there's been no change in transit at all today, according to the public records, we've seen this could be potentially part of Ukraine's game plan here. Can they hold it? Can they influence its production? Unclear. But we're certainly seeing here Ukraine trying something that looks pretty new, pretty different, has been significantly effective a day and yesterday, just in terms of the sheer embarrassment of what they've managed to achieve. But there are also questions too, about the broader strategy. What are they trying to do and why are these resources potentially not being used in the Donbass region where Ukraine is really losing ground slowly to Russia? And many Ukrainian commanders and observers are beginning to question that strategy and that resourcing, too.",
