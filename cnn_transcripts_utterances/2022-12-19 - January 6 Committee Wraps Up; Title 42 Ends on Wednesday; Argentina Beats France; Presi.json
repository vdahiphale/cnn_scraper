Those referrals would be non-binding, and it's up to the department to decide whether to pursue them.But CNN has learned the committee is weighing multiple alleged crimes committed by former President Donald Trump. They include obstruction of an official proceeding, conspiracy to defraud the government and insurrection. Here is what one member of the committee had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA):  Viewing it, as a former prosecutor, I think there's sufficient evidence to charge the president. This is someone who, in multiple ways had tried to pressure state officials to find votes that didn't exist. This is someone who tried to interfere with the joint session, even inciting a mob to attack the capitol. If that's not criminal, then, then I don't know what. (END VIDEO CLIP) HARRAK:  I want to turn now to Jessica Levinson. She's a professor of law at Loyola University and the host of the Passing Judgment podcast. She joins me now from Los Angeles.

All three of those are things that we've heard discussed in the past.I think the thing to remember, of course, is that it's very serious. We've never seen this in American history, that a house committee has voted to refer criminal charges regarding a former president of the United States. But it is just symbolic.

This is really a political decision.
