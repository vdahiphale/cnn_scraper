Plus, Larry Sabato, one of the nation's most trusted political voices, telling OUTFRONT that Democrats are calling him, asking what would happen if Biden is not the party's nominee. Who's calling and what are they saying? And new reporting tonight on Trump's ground game, bigger than anyone knew. Why he may have the Democrats to thank for that. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, we begin with the longest goodbye. Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un couldn't bear to part this evening, embracing on the tarmac, prolonging their goodbyes. Both standing there across from each other, waving goodbye. Once Putin got inside his plane, he continued to stare at Kim almost longingly, then waving smiling ear to ear. Kim and his cheering squad waving enthusiastically back, as hard as they could. It was almost childlike. Putin departing after signing what was the most significant defense agreement for Russia since the Cold War. Nobody knows exactly all the details. We do know that it includes ammunition, missiles for Putin's war in Ukraine. For Kim, access to crucial Russian nuclear weapon technology. And much as Putin may think or certainly used to think that the leader of North Korea is beneath him, he needed this meeting he went all in for it. And Kim treated Putin like a czar. Look at this, massive banners of Kim and Putin everywhere, crowds everywhere. They pose just for pictures together with these massive portraits behind them, taking time to drive each other around. You see Putin taking the wheel there. That has a new Russian built limousine that Putin is driving. They're not being driven by chauffeur, driving themselves all the while, thousands of adoring fans looked on everywhere they went. I mean, it was a rock star reception, fit for a czar. Just listen to how Russian state television, which was there on the scene reported on. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YEVGENY POPOV, RUSSIAN STATE TV HOST (through translator): The balloons were in the air. North Korean children came to greet Putin. Everything was involved, Soviet songs, Russian flags, and, of course, blaring cheers of the Korean people in honor of the dearest guest arrival from the invincible Russia. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The former director of national intelligence James Clapper tells OUTFRONT: The evolving partnership between Putin and Kim poses a serious threat to the national security of the United States. And Putin's total about-face on Kim and these past seven years does make sense in the context of his singular focus on taking on the West, a singular obsession shared by Kim. The West, of course, shorthanded to the United States. An obsession that may explain those long goodbyes and longing looks. Will Ripley is OUTFRONT. He is in Hanoi in Vietnam. That is where Putin has just landed after leaving North Korea. Will, a very different welcome for Putin, where you are standing tonight.",

And the time in 2017 when Kim Jong Un's brother was assassinated by what everybody in the world assumed was just an operation by the security service of North Korea, it was known that the North Korean agents who conducted the assassination or controlled the assassination, fled to Russia. And from there, they were headed over despite the request by South Korea for them to be handed over to South Korea, there were sent back to North Korea.What is not known and what were reporting for the first time is that these same agents, four of them, actually spent some time in Russia before arriving to Malaysia and to Hanoi before that, with that operation. So, clearly, there was some training, some assistance provided by Russia, whether logistical or more than that.

I mean, certainly, Putin's never had a welcome like this anywhere, even in his own country, they're not able to control people to this extent that they are North Korea. He got a big hug on the tarmac from Kim Jong Un, that personal touch. They take walks together. They got in the limousine together and Putin is driving Kim around and this limo that is made in Russia that he gave to Kim. I mean, Jean, when you look at this and you have been covering Kim since he took the public stage in North Korea, what stands out to you? What do you see in these moments? JEAN H. LEE, CO-HOST, \"THE LAZARUS HEIST\" PODCAST, BBC WORLD SERVICE: Well, Erin, I have to tell you that I had a knot in the pit of my stomach watching these images of Putin and Kim in Pyongyang, like you said, from that embrace to the massive portraits on Kim Il Sung Square that lionized these two men. I've never seen anything like that in all my years in North Korea. And I have to tell you that it evoked in me and emotion I don't think I felt since my childhood growing up here in America during the Cold War. And as the daughter of Korean War survivors, and I think that's precisely what these two men want to do by standing together as friends and as military allies is to instigate a sense of anxiety in us. But I will say that watching Kim seen him just go to Putin, embrace him, reminds me how far he has come and how much these meetings have given him legitimacy and legacy. Now, this is a huge ego boost for Putin, but it's also important for Kim. Both them are international pariahs. This is a moment to show their own people in addition to sending a warning to us, but to show their own people that look, we still have friends, friends were going to help us, friends that we can stand together with in case of war. So, absolutely interesting to see the interaction between them.",

Why? Because Russia is run out of spies around the world and this is not an exaggeration.
