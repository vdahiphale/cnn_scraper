This is the mosque the Masjid Muhammad Mosque in Newark, New Jersey. Police had just moved us back, press was up closer to the mosque a short time ago. There are members of the mosque out there now. Investigators from Newark PD and other investigative agencies are on scene looking into this.The very few details at the moment. (INAUDIBLE) six o'clock this morning, just before the morning dawn prayers. The Imam Hassan Sharif was shot in the parking lot, just outside of this mosque. And I want to show you on this side of us just how intense the media interest is, we expect shortly to hear from somebody from the mosque and possibly from the Council on American Islamic Relations as well about this mosque and this Imam and just how central they are to this part of New Jersey. But there is a great concern given the large number of anti- Islamic incidents that have happened since the October 7th incidents in Israel. And there were concerns that this may be in that line as well. But investigators are looking into it. They have now said we had thought we might hear from investigators here shortly. But now they're saying that this afternoon around 4:30 this afternoon at the prosecutor's office they will hopefully have more to share with, with us. So, we will certainly keep you guys informed.

But we need a strong border. And you -- we shouldn't have play offense on this and say, we want a verify, because we need to know who's in the country. We want stiff and heavy penalties for businesses who everybody knows, are looking the other way, because they want the cheap labor.And so, we have to crack down on those businesses, and then have an orderly process to get people into the country. Most people accept that immigration is a strength in the United States. They just want it to be orderly. They want it to be by the book. And so, let's set up whatever we have to right outside the border to process people coming in. But if we don't have a strong position, with E-Verify, cracking down on businesses, even putting up barriers where they may be needed around -- along the border (INAUDIBLE) --",

Trump's attorneys and Special Counsel Jack Smith are scheduled to present oral arguments next Tuesday. And until that is resolved, the Federal Election subversion case is on hold.Now we got a preview from Trump's team overnight because in a new court filing, they write, quote, the Constitution's text, history and policy support this conclusion. The 234-year unbroken tradition of not prosecuting presidents for official acts despite vociferous calls to do so from across the political spectrum provides powerful evidence of it. Let's dig deeper now with CNN senior law enforcement analyst, Andrew McCabe. He was also Deputy Director of the FBI. Andrew, great to be with you as always. Central to Trump's argument that he has immunity is the idea that everything he did after the 2020 election, whether January 6th, or his efforts to overturn election results, fake electors, et cetera. were official acts carried out by the President. Would you say that those are official acts? Does that argument hold weight?",

We know from prior Supreme Court holdings Nixon versus Sherald, for instance, that there is a definition to what constitutes official acts, it is at least defined by a perimeter, the court refers to it has acted within the outer perimeter of the President's official -- official duties. So therefore, there's -- there are some things that are beyond that perimeter.In other cases, obviously not -- not with former President Trump courts have determined that efforts to seek re-election do not fall within the official acts of a sitting president. That is a personal thing that the President does as a candidate. So, I think that that argument is likely to fail.",

I don't find any of them to be particularly persuasive. Secretaries of state very, you know, in every state are political to one degree or another. That doesn't prohibit them from administering the election laws in their state.He does, however, towards the end of the appeal, make some arguments that you can expect to hear him make in front of the Supreme Court. And those specifically are he claims that the President does not qualify as an officer of the United States in the Constitution. He also cites Section 5 of the 14th Amendment in claiming that the Section 3 cannot be held against him unless Congress takes some sort of legislative act. Again, I think the -- the constitutional scholars and law professors have a much stronger argument here that those clauses do not help him in the way that he hopes they will.

The fact that presidents could be held criminally responsible for things they've done while President that were crimes, not part of their official responsibility is something that keeps presidents from doing exactly that. So, I think that, you know, on the immunity argument, I think the deck is stacked very heavily against him. His claim for absolute immunity, while President is basically antithetical to everything we know and believe and hold sacred about the Constitution. It would lead to ridiculously absurd results of a president who, you know, who must leave at the end of a four-year term, just deciding they're not going to leave, because violating that part of the Constitution would bring no criminal effect.So, you know, there's many other arguments that I think are laid out persuasively by the court, and I'm sorry, by the trial judge, Tanya Chutkan.

I think that state and local officials can expect a lot more of this.Unfortunately, it imposes an additional massive drain on their resources, their time and attention during a period of increased threats.
