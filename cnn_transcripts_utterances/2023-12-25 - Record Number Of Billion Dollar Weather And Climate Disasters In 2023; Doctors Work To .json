Not just famous women like the ones we've been talking about, but regular rank-and-file white-collar women around the United States whose numbers have hit record highs in terms of the share of traditionally working-age people who are employed.You may remember that a couple of years ago there were all of these stories about the fear of the 'she-cession.' That the pandemic was disproportionately going to hurt women and did seem to hurt women, particularly those who had young children, and that they might be knocked off their career trajectories for -- if not forever for a very long time. That there would be these scarring effects. Instead, the exact opposite has happened. Women -- working women have come back with a fierce -- almost like revengeful level of success that they are contributing financially to their households. They are somehow managing to make work and family commitments work out. And I don't know if I would go so far as to say women are finally having it all but they are really punching above their weight. If we manage to avoid a recession next year, as many had feared not too long ago, it will be because of America's working women again powering this economy.",
