The country's army is ramping up its presence in the South as part of the deal to prevent Hezbollah from regrouping there.Thousands of displaced people are already returning home to Beirut and its suburbs, which faced intense bombardment during the conflict. Officials say the Lebanese army is bolstering its presence to roughly 10,000 troops in the south, and schools, many of which had been turned into makeshift shelters are expected to reopen on Monday. Residents say they're happy things are slowly improving. Humanitarian aid is also on the way to southern Lebanon, and the Lebanese prime minister says, now the process of healing and rebuilding can begin.

The cars that are made by Ford Stellantis and G.M. are made with foreign parts from Canada, Mexico and even China. And Trump says he's going to put a 25 percent tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico and an additional 10 percent on Chinese imports, and that will have a significant impact on the price of cars here in the U.S.Now, cars made with foreign parts, but assembled in the U.S. include Tesla's Model 3, the Honda Ridgeline and the Ford F-150, which is the most popular car here in the U.S. Cars assembled in Mexico that are coming over the border are the Chevy Blazer, the Honda HR-V, the Ram and Chevy Silverado. Now, the reason why U.S. car companies make cars and parts in foreign countries like Mexico is to keep costs down. It's cheaper to make cars and parts there, labor is a lot cheaper, and currently there's free trade between the U.S., Mexico and Canada, something that President Trump helped negotiate under USMCA. Now, the average car price in the U.S. in October was about $47,000 but with tariffs, that price will go a lot higher. So, why can't we just keep the production in the U.S. to avoid these tariffs? Well, we don't currently have facilities for that, and wages for workers are a lot higher here. And the U.S. is currently trying to build 16 semiconductor plants, but that will take three to five years to build, those semiconductors can be used for cars. But now, if prices of new cars end up going up, that will put pressure on the used car market, and those prices will go higher, and once again, inflation will kick in.

Jesper Brodin says tariffs don't support international companies or trade and end up costing customers more. He said neither the global economy nor IKEA have ever benefited from high tariffs. About 30 percent of IKEA's goods are made in China, one of the countries whose products would be targeted by Trump's tariffs.
