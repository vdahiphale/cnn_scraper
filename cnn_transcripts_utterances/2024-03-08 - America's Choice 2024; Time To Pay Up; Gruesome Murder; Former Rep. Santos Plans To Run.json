But is it a bluff, is he just trying to get attention, we'll ask one of his former closest aides who will be here this hour. Plus, a Friday feel good from my hometown, Philly. See how the power of popcorn is giving one group a sense of pride and independence. And leading this hour, President Biden on the road taking his State of the Union Address on tour. First stop, battleground Pennsylvania. And we're standing by for him to speak any moment now after last night's supercharged rather political speech. Let's get right to CNN's MJ Lee, who's in Wallingford, Pennsylvania, 19086 as I recall, where President Biden is about to speak. And, MJ, President Biden's speech is set to kick off a month long tour, continuing his State of the Union message. What exactly is the White House planning?",

And then on Wednesday, on Thursday, Wisconsin and Michigan, of course, two of some of the most important battleground states heading into November. And what the campaign is saying is that, between the President and Vice President Kamala Harris, they plan on the two of them hitting up every battleground state in the coming weeks. Now, of course, all of this is about amplifying the message that we heard from President Biden last night in his State of the Union remarks. And just a few minutes ago, we heard the President telling reporters on the tarmac about the idea of debating his GOP opposition candidate Donald Trump, and also whether he tuned into the Republican rebuttal to his remark last night. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And what we saw is that when he was on \"The Apprentice,\" he had an incredible amount of money from being on the show, and also from licensing and endorsement agreements that came along with that. In 2011, for example, he made $51 million just in that year from those things. That's a lot of money.But the businesses that he ran, his golf courses and his hotels, tend to require him to infuse cash on a regular basis. So as \"The Apprentice\" money dipped, the licensing might dip down to almost zero by the time he entered the White House, those businesses were starting to eat up more and more of this cash. The attorney general found there was one year where he would have been like literally out of cash except for the beneficial interest rates he got on some of these loans that were subject to this fraud case. So it does raise all these questions about whether he has access to it. I think one thing is certain, he does not have access to the 500 plus million he would need for the bond in this larger case. He can't just produce that much money and keep operating as a business. And that's what they said in that filing last week where they said we could maybe get a bond for $100 million.
