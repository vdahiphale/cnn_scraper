Israel's attack on Hamas in the refugee camp is part of its expanded offensive inside Gaza where overnight Hamas's underground tunnels came under fire. Israeli forces saying they struck about 300 Hamas targets that includes the, IDF says, military compounds inside those underground tunnels. At the same time a new threat to Israel is emerging from Iran. Iran backed Houthi militants in Yemen claimed responsibility for targeting Israel with drones and missiles near the Red Sea in the south. Israel saying it forwarded that attack. Israel also facing incessant rocket fire from Hamas in the west and throughout the country. This evening, Hamas has fired numerous rockets at us here in Tel Aviv, intercepted by the Iron Dome just a couple of hours ago. That's the intercepting missiles going up. And earlier today, here is what my team and I witnessed when we were driving north of Tel Aviv. We heard an explosion to the west. And every car on the highway pulled over, we all got out and we ran into a ditch that was built there. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And I think it sends the right messages to Iran and Russia and China about the seriousness for which we take the fence and the unity of our political leaders here in the United States. I don't know exactly why Republicans are split on this issue. Clearly, former President Trump has spoken out and others on that wing of the party, talked about the need to divert money for Ukraine to address border security issues.

When my unit went into southern Iraq, we weighed those issues as well, but taking precautions, abiding by the laws of war, and you want to make sure that you don't create more enemies than you kill or capture. And that's I think, what Secretary Austin was getting to.Look, Israel is a professional military fighting force. And unlike Hamas, they are accountable to a democracy to an elected government. And they have signed up to the Geneva Conventions, I believe they are doing the best they can to abide by the laws of war, you know, they've provided access to humanitarian organizations. It looks like they're trying to be careful, but in such a densely populated area, it's impossible to not have collateral damage, to not have civilian casualties. And that's the tragedy of war. I do not believe that Israel is targeting civilians. That cannot be said of Hamas, who are clearly, as you reported earlier, still targeting on a daily basis large cities, Tel Aviv, they continue to hold innocent as hostages in Gaza somewhere. Israel's not doing that either. So, look, I think we need to encourage Israel to be thoughtful as they prosecute this campaign. It's going to widen, of course, and unfortunately, it's going to get even uglier as ground forces move into Gaza.",

In one corner, you have GOP Leader Mitch McConnell and defense hawks like Lindsey Graham who say it is in the interest of national security to do a broader package that includes Israel, Ukraine, Taiwan, Border Security money.But then in the other corner, you have Senate conservatives who say they don't support more money flowing to Ukraine, and they want to say Ukraine and Israel dealings. And they also were worried about undermining the new speaker, Mike Johnson. So this issue has really picked Mitch McConnell against his own party and put him in line with Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer. Let's listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), MAJORITY LEADER: The House GOP package is woefully inadequate, has the hard rights fingerprints all over it. Making aid to Israel who just faced the worst terrorist attack in history contingent on poison pills that help ultra-wealthy tax cheats. SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), MINORITY LEADER: And we'll see if the bill comes out of the House, and if so what kind of margin it has. My own view I just expressed is that we need to try to treat all four of these areas, all four of them, Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan, and the border. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

House Republicans under Speaker Mike Johnson, working on a bill that would tie Israel aid to $14 billion in spending cuts that had been allocated to the IRS to, you know, crack down on tax cheats, et cetera, et cetera. Senate Democrats said that would be dead on arrival. I have to say, just hearing what Mitch McConnell said, supporting aid for Israel, aid for Ukraine, aid for Taiwan and strengthening the border, that just sounds like for things that Republicans would be in favor of. I'm kind of confused why House Republicans wouldn't be in favor of it. ERICK ERICKSON, HOST, \"THE ERICK ERICKSON SHOW\": Yes. Look, there's a division as to how much to fund it. And I think they support almost all of them. But we do have a problem on our hands as a nation, we're rapidly getting to the point where the bond yield is going to push us to all of our revenue coming in is going to have to just pay debt service. So Republicans are starting to think we've got to cut. They've contributed to the problem and should be honest about it. But as much as I'm with Mitch McConnell on wanting to fund these things, I also do see we're headed towards a serious fiscal crisis in the country and do need to start having the conversation about what to cut.",

He does understand he's in a precarious position with moderate Republicans as well.But he is going to fight harder than I think conservatives expected McCarthy would. Because, again, it is something that we as a nation have to deal with, Jake, that we're about to be in a position where 100 percent of revenue to the government goes just to debt service. So we won't even be able to fund anything without issuing more bonds accumulating more debt. And that's going to put us in a real world of hurt. So we've got to be mindful that I want all these things funded too more aggressively than he does. But I also realize where we're headed as a nation financially, interest rates probably going back up again tomorrow. TAPPER: Yes, Senate Republicans appear also divided on whether aid for Israel should be tied to aid for Ukraine. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. MITT ROMNEY (R-UT): Well, if we're going to have a piece of legislation that actually becomes law, it's going to include support for Ukraine, as well as Israel, it's not acceptable to abandon Ukraine, that would be devastating to our interests around the world. SEN. RICK SCOTT (R-FL): We have a Republican majority in the House, and so we ought to be listening what they want to do. And my understanding is Speaker Johnson has been clear.

And what we've seen on Cornell's campus. What we've seen on other campuses across the country, what we've seen all around the world with people screaming kill the Jews, gasps the Jews, F the Jews. This is a moment where we all have to sit up Jews and non-Jews alike and recognize the threat to the Jewish community that exists as a result of people standing on the side of Hamas terrorists who massacred 1,400 and standing on the side of civilization against those Hamas terrorists.

That's a call for violence.When they save Palestine from the river to the sea, you know this, you're there. From the river to the sea means no Israel, it means that exactly what Hamas wants, killing all the Jews. So every Democratic official should sever any ties with the DSA and the role that they play contributing politically to this horrific uptick in anti- Semitism. The same thing is true, Jake. As you may recall, I called out a colleague on the floor of the House who started in using some of the rhetoric. We have to be clear wherever anti-Semitism comes from right or left. We've got to call it out wherever we see it.
