You can see him standing before a cheering crowd, and then Barack Obama grabs Biden by the hand and walks with him off stage. The New York Post, among others, claiming Biden froze. There is no evidence of that, but Fox and others have been replaying this on a loop, claiming otherwise. For his part, Mark Cuban weighed in, saying -- quote -- \"Both candidates are old, very old. Both are going to have senior moments, misremember, forget things, and have physical frailties.\" He adds, \"One is great at soundbites, but also thinks in soundbites. The other is awful at soundbites, but thinks in complete sentences. Voters will decide which we prefer.\" Now, this all comes just days after Trump's allies pushed a misleading video of Biden at the G7 Summit, falsely claiming he was meandering into a field when in fact he was thanking a skydiver who had been cropped out of the video.

He will lead us into a completely different country than we know.And I'm happy to work across the aisle. I work across the aisle with many of my Republican colleagues on many different policy issues. But I cannot emphasize enough that what you're seeing from this revenge tour that he's on is not even Donald Trump in 2016. You are seeing someone who wants to get revenge for his own personal failings and his own personal misconduct. And he is using our government. He is using the possibility of becoming president to get back at his enemies because all he cares about, and I've known this since 2019 when I led the first impeachment investigation, all he cares about is himself. And you have Joe Biden, on the other hand, who has been a lifelong public servant, who cares deeply about American families, about the average American, about making life better for Americans.

And so, a consumer, a voter can get this information and not maybe ever receive information that disputes it.

I'll give those things to Joe Biden. It's the fact that he can't find a door becomes a problem. Like he goes to the podium and he has to be told where to go. He's going to the wrong doors. I'm sorry. You know, maybe Obama and Biden do have this friendship, but to the average person looking at this, seeing this weekend's image of Obama having to guide him out, it reinforces what we already see. It's not that he misspeaks. It's that he appears lost on the national stage and lost on the international stage. And that's the challenge here.

All right, so the Iowa presidential margin, Ann Selzer comes out with her latest poll from the Hawkeye State, and look at this, Donald Trump is ahead by 18 points.You go back to November of 2020, Trump won the state by just eight. In fact, this would be the largest Republican presidential win in the state in a generation or two, all the way back, you have to -- all the way back since 1956. Now, the question is, why is this such an important result from Iowa? And this may give you a reason why. All right, the final Ann Selzer poll error in presidential races, she's just really, really good at her job, all right, in 2012, she was off by just a point, 2016, off by two points, 2020, she was off by just a point. Keep in mind that the average state pollster during this time span was off by, get this, five, count them, five percentage points. So, the fact of the matter is Ann Selzer is significantly better than average. Of course, you may be asking yourself, why do we care about a result in Iowa, given that Donald Trump won it easily in both 2016 and 2020? Here's the reason why. You know what Iowa's next to? It's next to the state of Wisconsin. And you may know something about the state of Wisconsin. It's a very pivotal state for Joe Biden to win come November. He obviously won it last time, but Donald Trump won it back in 2016. And here we go, Iowa and Wisconsin presidential results since 1856, get this, only twice, only twice out of 42 times was there a difference of greater than 18 points between those states. So, if Joe Biden is losing in Iowa by 18 points, the chance that he's able to carry Wisconsin, very, very small. So, that's the read right now from Iowa. We'll see what happens down the way.

This is -- you know, what I find interesting about this is the stark contrast to the recent flurry of activity in support of Ukraine. There was a very, very large-scale summit, a peace summit in which Ukraine was able to marshal the democratic world, 80 signatories to a -- to a peace plan proposal or at least a course for -- towards peace. Before that, a G7 with a large number of bilateral security agreements, a $50 billion pledge towards Ukraine, a loan package that Ukraine is going to be able to tap into for its defense, all sorts of resources pouring in to support Ukraine's war effort. And on the battlefield, Ukraine is holding its own. It's actually starting to make tactical counterattacks and take back territory and really punish the Russian forces, stymieing Russia's offensive. What does Putin do? He reciprocates a visit that Kim Jong-un paid to Russia last year, and he is there kind of hand out asking for additional resources, additional artillery shells. He'll get some. Some 30, 40% of that artillery is ineffective, is pretty much useless. And he's going to go with his hand out around to the authoritarian world, to Iran with its drones that it's providing, but that's not going to amount too much. And the stark contrast is what's amazing. This is a guy that positioned himself as a world leader. He can't travel anywhere.

You know, you have to always be looking at something and watching something. There's always a piece of news.And so, it creates that kind of, you know, attention deficit disorder. That's a real issue where everyone is paying partial attention, continual partial attention to things. And so, again, I think something like -- there -- there are some very big issues about young men and being isolated, young women feeling self-esteem issues on these platforms. And so, the question is, how do we handle that? What's the best way to do it? And there is some regulatory relief here. It's just a question of what should be.
