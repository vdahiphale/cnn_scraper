It takes time to see it.I'm not here to declare. But I'm here to say we have a plan that's turning things around incredibly quickly. But we have more work to do. For example, does anyone here think that the federal taxes are fair? Raise your hand. No matter how much money you make. We're going to make it fair by eliminating loopholes, crypto traders, hedge fund managers. They got over $200 billion dollars last year. They got a $30 billion tax credit. We're going to get billionaires to pay up a little bit, at least a minimum tax. You know, when we began, there were -- before the pandemic, there were 750 billionaires in America. Now there's 1,000. You know how much average taxes they pay in federal tax? 8 percent taxes. No billionaire should pay a lower tax rate than a schoolteacher, firefighter or a cop. (APPLAUSE)",

If they just paid the top tax rate that exists now, 30 percent, we would raise billions and billions of dollars, lowering the deficit, allowing us to pay for so much more we have left to do.That's the next phase of this fight, making the tax code fair for everyone, making the wealthy, the super wealthy, the big corporations begin to pay their fair share, without raising taxes at all out middle class. I made a commitment when I got elected. No one in America making under $400,000 should ever have to pay a single penny more in federal taxes, as long as I'm president. And I have kept -- (APPLAUSE)",

      "sentences": "$400,000 is a lot of money where I come from.Let me close with this. When I came to office, I had a fundamental decision to make. We're going to continue trickle-down economics as a policy, but it's failed time and again. It grew in inequality. It saw jobs go overseas. Towns were hollowed out. I ran on the promise I was going to end this and I would build an economy from the middle out and the bottom up. We're not going to continue down the trickle-down path as long as I'm president. This is the moment we're timely going to make a break and move away from an economy that's exited in a fundamentally difficult direction. Here's the simple truth about trickle-down economics. It didn't represent the best of American capitalism. It represented a moment where we walked away, and how many in this country -- from how this country was built, how this city was built. Bidenomics is about the future. Bidenomics is another way of saying restore the American dream. It worked before. We've always been best as investing in America, investing in Americans. When we invest in our people, we strengthen the middle class, see the economy grow, and it benefits all Americans. That's the American dream. Forty years of trickle-down limited that dream, except for those at the top. Too many for too long have suggested that it's only available if you have a four-year college degree. You can work at a tech center. These new factories opening up, the fabs opening for semiconductors, without a college degree, you'll make $100 to $120,000 a year working in those fabs, $120,000 a year. (APPLAUSE)",

The president selling his economic vision to the country, Bidenomics.He opened by blasting trickle-down economics, a champion by many Republicans, the president saying we are tired of waiting for the trickle down. Blasting the wealthy and corporations, saying that that vision of economics has failed America. The president then talking about Bidenomics, which he says he did not name, but he argues he will take credit for it, because he says it is working. He touted enormous job growth since the end of the pandemic, historically low unemployment. The president also talking about huge investments in infrastructure and efforts to boost domestic production of all sorts of good includes vitally microchips. The president also talked about inflation going down by half, he says, the last year. Remember, it peaked at 9 percent last year. It's hovered between 4 percent and 5 percent. The president also saying we have more work to do. Let's discuss this with CNN's Jeremy Diamond, who is traveling with the president, and CNN chief business correspondent, Christine Romans, who joins us as well. First to you, Christine. Your impressions of what President Biden describes as a fundamentally different direction for the U.S. economy?",

That's the difference that he's casting here. He's trying to tout and remind people all of the things this administration has done over the past couple years that are meant to relieve price pressures on American families, lower costs for everyday Americans. That's where he says his focus is. He points rightly to more than 13 million jobs have been created in his presidency. The unemployment rate among Hispanic-Americans are at record lows, and that women, a record share of women are working in the workforce right now. But remember, Boris, when you look at the polling, people still feel pretty negative about inflation. It has come down, but inflation seems to be the issue that's still coloring the view of so many Americans and how they feel about the economy.",

We reached out to the Trump campaign, like what plans are you referring to? Because we know that prosecutors aren't only interested in him turning over the original documents that he may have had in his possession but also any copies of documents. But his campaign told us they were political plans. Donald Trump later on his plane coming back from New Hampshire told other reporters it was referring to building plans or plans for golf clubs.

And also, I think just having the audio itself is really problematic for Donald Trump. And so I think that's something that they're really looking at specifically. And the other thing, too, is the different variations of the different responses he's been giving to this, it is kind of a moving target for the jury and prosecutors as well as they try to nail down what exactly happened in that room. And that's why they're relying so heavily on who was in that room and who are the witnesses who are coming forward here.
