Hezbollah also launching rockets into northern Israel, where Israeli officials say some homes were damaged. CNN international correspondent Jomana Karadsheh is in Beirut. She joins us now live.

Now, you know, these evacuation orders come in late at night. It's unclear if people have gotten them. We have seen so many people, this mass exodus from the southern suburbs, people leaving in the past week or so. But there are some civilians who remain there. There are people who have returned there because they have nowhere else to go. They've returned to their homes. And they tell you that it's very difficult for them to be up all night, waiting for these evacuation orders. And this is one of those instances where there was a warning. But we have seen strikes throughout the day today where there was no prior warning and within 30 minutes, about almost of the first posts by the IDF spokesperson, those strikes began. And it is unclear as well, Jessica if those were the exact locations that were pinpointed on that map by the IDF. But what we do know is that it was a large -- it was a massive strike, really, and it was in the southern suburbs of Beirut. And we'll try and get you more information on that in the coming hours.

But instead, you have seen this increase in fighting occur there. And these images that you've seen play out could certainly be part of that as well. But President Biden, over the past few days, has really been focused on what the Israeli response to Iran's barrage of missile attacks that they had fired off against the country a bit earlier this week. While the president himself has not spoken with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu since August, senior administration officials have been in constant contact with their Israeli counterparts as they are gaming out the next steps of how they will respond. The U.S. has said that they believe that Iran should face consequences for its actions but behind the scenes, they are also trying to advise and counsel Israel with exactly how they should proceed. The ultimate hope here is that there could be a more measured response from Israel. But administration officials don't deny the fact that they do believe Israel will respond at some point in time. Now, President Biden himself when you're specifically talking about Israel and Iran, has said that he does not believe that Israel should target Iran's nuclear facilities. He also a bit earlier in the week, had left the door open to the possibility that Israel could target Iran's oil reserves. But then just yesterday, as he spoke at the White House press briefing room, he said that he does believe they should consider alternative options and not go after any oil fields. It really presents some of the complicated dynamics that the administration is grappling with in this moment. Now even as the president has said that he doesn't believe that Israel should target Iran's nuclear facilities, a senior State Department official said that they haven't received any assurances yet from Israel that they won't go down that route. There's still also a lot of questions about when Israel would make its decision to respond to Iran, and when they might decide to actually enact that and move forward with it. One senior State Department official saying it's hard to tell whether they might try to use this October 7th anniversary that's approaching on Monday, when Hamas had attacked Israel to try to use that as a potential time to retaliate. But the president has said he does not believe any action is happening in the future. But really at this moment, you're seeing the administration grapple with this conflict on multiple fronts. Biden has spent the last year trying to find a diplomatic solution to try to end the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, trying to get to some type of ceasefire. Then you have them now dealing with this conflict between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon. And then potentially another broader conflict between Israel and Iran, really speaking to the very complicated challenges Biden is facing in this moment, as they are trying to prevent that wider regional war that he spent the past year trying to prevent, trying to prevent that from going even further.",

And we heard her afterwards call on congress to help get involved. That they continue to assess what needs to be done, what help needs to be given on the federal level to North Carolina. And Jessica, as we've been talking about today, this is notably her second visit to the storm-damaged areas this week. She traveled to Georgia earlier in the week. Today, of course, in North Carolina, notably two battleground states. This is importantly a visit that she takes in her role as the vice president, in her capacity as vice president.

It is interesting. I am struck that Democrats are using Musk as well. The ad that you see the most -- if you're watching the baseball playoffs, you know, which include teams from or at least a couple of days ago, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, is a Democrat talking -- a voter talking about Trump's plans to cut taxes for the rich. And there's an image of Musk that is very conspicuously included in that, so it's a very much of a two-edged sword for Trump in terms of like, so many things, he does. And like everything we've been talking about, mobilizing his base, but elevating the concerns among other voters, even those dissatisfied with the economy, even those who think that he might be better on the economy, about whether they still want him to be president for another four years. That's what we saw in 2022, an unprecedented number of people who were dissatisfied with the economy still resisting Trump-style candidates because they viewed them as a threat to their rights, their values and to democracy itself. And that dynamic is still allowing Harris to stay ahead slightly in most polls, despite Trump's lead on the economy.",

Because we have this very strong news, this jobs report, the Dow hit a new record after that strong jobs number that came out yesterday.Just continual data points that the economy is performing well, and yet so many people, so many Americans feel so dissatisfied with their economic situation, with the way the economy could go and give the edge to Trump.

I think, for the vast majority of voters, their dissatisfaction is rooted in the big increase in prices in the period immediately after the pandemic.And that -- the overhang of that, even though inflation is now under control by the Fed's own standards, interest rates are being cut, the stock market is high, the job market is good, most people feel, rightly or wrongly, that they had more money in their pocket when Trump was president at the end of the week than they than they do today. And that explains why he has had this lead on the economy. But his lead over Harris on the economy is not nearly as big as his lead was over Biden, because she has successfully, I think, kind of pivoted the discussion more to who is on your side, who is fighting for you. And it's on those questions that she's really made up a lot of ground and essentially pulled even or ahead in some polls with Trump. And that's what you see very much in that ad that I mentioned, a kind of who's on your side, Trump is out for the rich. It's the hard- working middle class that needs a tax cut. That's the argument that Harris is trying to pursue, and it has brought her into a more competitive position. But in the end, I think there are going to be more people on Election Day who think that Trump is better for their bottom line than Harris. And that means, as in 2022, she's going to have to get a slice of people who think he's better on the economy to vote against them anyway because they find him unacceptable on other grounds to be president. And that's what's so, you know, strange in a way about the way he's approaching these final weeks. Yes, he is energizing his base with these wild and openly nativist xenophobic, even racist claims. But he is also elevating and activating those concerns that have prevented him from securing as many voters who favor him on the on the economy as you would typically see.",

He's going to be taking the stage at any moment after Eric Trump and Lara Trump finish.But we're also going to hear from Elon Musk, who I'm told flew and arrived with Donald Trump to Butler today. Of course, very notable, as that conversation before me was, as you guys were saying, because Donald Trump has really leaned into that relationship. You've seen Musk as well really promote the former president and his campaign and become a top surrogate ahead of November. Now, another thing I just want to bring up is some of the security we are seeing here on the ground. Because, of course, that was a major concern about Donald Trump doing a rally at the exact same venue where that previous assassination attempt occurred. I'm told that Secret Service and local law enforcement have many more agents on the ground here than they did back in July. They are also working under one combined command center, something again, another departure from what they had in July that should be able to boost their efficiency. They have a better drone command system. But one thing that I was told actually from an agent, a Secret Service agent here on the ground, and we've confirmed this with our sources, Jessica, is that right now Donald Trump currently has the same protections from Secret Service that a sitting U.S. President does, the same type of protection that President Joe Biden has. He did not have that level of protection when he was here on July 13th and had those bullets fired at him. So that is a big departure today.

I want to say it's around October 25th is when you get that \"M\" storm where -- at the beginning of October. So we are ahead of schedule for this \"M\" named storm by about two to three weeks. We are picking up the pace after we had a little bit of a lull just a couple of weeks ago and a little bit of a down period. But it has been picking up its pace. And we've had a lot of landfalls along the gulf coast. I mean, we had Beryl in Texas. We had Debby along the Florida panhandle as well. And then, of course, we've had Helene.

And this is an area of Beirut, the southern suburbs, that has had a heavy presence of Hezbollah. But it is also one of the most densely populated parts of Beirut. And this has been the focus of Israeli military strikes in the capital over the past 10 days or so. And we have seen nights of intense strikes, and we have seen nights where you have a few strikes. But this certainly appears to be another night of those -- of intense bombardment of the southern suburbs. We did hear from the IDF a couple of hours ago. They put out a post on X warning that these strikes are coming. It was a couple of posts from their Arabic language spokesperson addressing the residents of a couple of neighborhoods. Oh, as you can see, we're seeing more flashes now and we are seeing this -- we are seeing the smoke still rising. We have seen those blasts. We have seen the red flashes. And again, this was a warning that came out from the IDF a couple of hours ago, saying that they are going to be striking Hezbollah locations, Hezbollah interests, as they describe it. And asking people to move away from those areas that they're going to be striking. Now it's unclear if those strikes that we are seeing right now are, indeed, the same ones that they talk about in these evacuation orders.
