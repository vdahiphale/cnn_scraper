Plus, already flooded parts of California bracing for yet another powerful storm Good have you with us. And we begin here in the United States where the Biden administration is stepping in to contain the fallout from the sudden collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. Authorities say customers will have access to all their money starting Monday morning. The president also promised to hold those responsible for the bank's failure fully accountable. He will speak about the issue in the coming hours. Regulators also shot down another regional institution, Signature Bank, fearing it was also on the brink of collapse.

The announcement came in a joint statement between the Treasury Department, FTIC, and Federal Reserve, where they also revealed the closure of a second bank, Signature Bank, which is based in New York.Officials said that the same protections being offered to depositors with Silicon Valley Bank would also be extended to that bank as well. It came at a time when there are many questions for depositors about whether they would have access to their money. The FDIC only previously insured up to $250,000 being held at the bank. And the majority of customers had more money than that in their accounts. Ultimately, this move will ensure that all depositors will be able to access their money at a time when there were questions about how people would run their businesses and also how they would meet payroll heading into this week. Now, federal officials worked around the clock over the weekend trying to find some resolution to the sudden collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. One avenue that was also being pursued was trying to find a private buyer to purchase the assets of Silicon Valley Bank. Treasury officials said that they were evaluating those bids, but ultimately decided to move quickly as they were watching this situation quickly unfold and they wanted to offer some assurances to those customers who have been working with Silicon Valley bank. Now, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said earlier on Sunday that there would not be a widescale large bailout of the bank, similar to what we've seen during the 2008 financial crisis. Treasury officials pushed back on the idea that this was a bailout saying that the burden would not be borne by the taxpayers and also noting that shareholders and senior management would not be protected by these new rules. Now, ultimately, the White House and the Biden administration is trying to stress that they believe that the banking system in this country is resilient in part, due to those reforms put in place after day 2008 financial crisis. President Biden told reporters as he was traveling back from Delaware on Sunday that he would talk about this issue on Monday morning as his White House is trying to ensure that there are not more stresses put on the U.S. banking system and the U.S. economy writ-large.

Really signifying to the millions of residents in California that relief is on the way. This water trickles down into other reservoirs and lakes, helping beef up the water supply as we head into the drier summer months.Now, this latest atmospheric river event, it dumped over a foot of rain in some of the highest elevations of California, helping put in a lot of much-needed water to these reservoirs. Currently, Oroville at 115 percent of its historical average. It is actually 200 feet above the historic record low that was set back in 2021. And look what it's doing to the snow pack across the state. Over 200 percent of average right now in the southern Sierra. We're at 244 percent of average. Just incredible. This is the scene coming out of Mammoth Mountain. You can see complete homes buried under snow. And guess what, there is more snow to come. We have yet another atmospheric river event. I believe we are at number 11 now, right? Into the state, that will start to oscillate this fire hose of water from north to south, from Monday into Tuesday, picking up an intensity throughout the course of that storm system, and eventually reaching Los Angeles and Ventura Counties as well. Look at the flood watches, impacting over 17 million Americans. That includes Sacramento, San Francisco, just outside of L.A. And we'll be measuring the snowfall in feet. Once again, for the southern Sierras with a potential for over half a foot of rain. For some of those here in Nevada foothills, we have 2 to 4 inches of rainfall anticipated across the central coast. So, we're going to monitor for the potential of localized flash flooding. Weather prediction center picking up on that, moderate risk. That's a level 3 out 4 for both Monday and Tuesday moving southward with time. You can see the eradication of drought across the state as well. Quite a difference from two months ago. Back to you.",

The sci-fi adventure film \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" dominated the 95th Academy Awards Sunday night, winning in seven categories out of 11 total nominations. It won best film and its star, Michelle Yeoh, made history, becoming the first Asian woman to win best actress. Co-star Ke Huy Quan won best supporting actor. This was his first Academy Award nomination. It was also the first for Jamie Lee Curtis who won best supporting actress. The only major category, \"Everything, Everywhere\" didn't dominate was best lead actor. That award went to Brendan Fraser for his portrayal of an overweight gay father in \"The Whale.\" And CNN's Kristie Lu Stout joins us now live from Hong Kong. Good to see you, Kristie.

So, what is it about this film that has everyone in total awe? SANDRO MONETTI, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, HOLLYWOOD INTERNATIONAL FILMMAKER MAGAZINE:  Well, it's not your traditional best picture Oscar winner, but the clues were all there. If we look at the winners in recent years, \"Parasite,\" Nomadland,\" \"CODA,\" now there are 10,000 Oscar voters, of a pool that is much larger. They seem to be favoring independent, eccentric, quirky choices, rather than the traditional blockbuster. And when you think about voters, much like us critics who see 300 movies a year, you're always looking for something different.

      "sentences": "Yeah, Rosemary, in terms of that Xi Jinping speech, he actually stuck to the usual talking points. Obviously, the Taiwan line getting the longest applause as you would imagine. But the event actually was more closely monitored by many China watchers, was the debut performance by his new premier, the number two official, Li Qiang, because up till now, Li was a rather obscure figure outside of China, mostly known to be a close ally and protegee of Xi Jinping. And to be the communist party boss of Shanghai who oversaw that city's brutal two-month COVID lockdown.But during his press conference, Li Qiang actually made sure, reminding people several times that for years, he actually ran some of the country's most economically diverse and advanced regions including Shanghai, but some of its neighboring provinces. And naturally before the pandemic, he was often seen as one of the more pragmatic and business friendly provincial leader. So, he was obviously trying to reassure a global audience now that he has been tasked running the world's second largest economy with no national governance experience at a time when this economy is facing strong headwinds, both domestically and internationally. But the challenge here of course is this is now very much a one-man show in China. And Zi Jinping's agenda is very much still re-asserting the party's dominance in every aspect of Chinese society including the economy. If and how Li Qiang is going to use his closeness to the top leader to change or tweak the policy, that remains to be seen. But in terms of the China-brokered deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran, obviously, it's considered a major diplomatic coup by Beijing and officials and state media here have made sure the whole world knows about it for the past few days. Some analysts obviously have tried to frame this in the context of China trying to reassure of self-economic interest in the region given China is one of the world's biggest energy consumers and importing a lot of oil in the region. But it is worth noting, it is increasing the sign of China trying to go beyond its trade and energy flows in the region but trying to increase its geopolitical influence even though they insist this is not meant to fill any power gap, obviously, referenced to the United States.
