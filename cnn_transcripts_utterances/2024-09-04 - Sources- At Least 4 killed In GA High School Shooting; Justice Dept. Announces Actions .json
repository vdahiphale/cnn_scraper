This is as far up as we can go, because obviously this is a very active scene happening right here, but you can see fire trucks, their state, local, and federal resources out here. It's chaotic, as the sheriff said. The response has been immense. It looks like they're focused. But they're obviously dealing with a lot right now, the parents, too. This is not any sort of call or text that any parent would want to receive. I spoke with the parent right over there who told me she was at work when she got the text that there was an active shooter. Her child, who is over at the elementary school. All the schools here preemptively put on lockdown. She dropped everything that she was doing, rushed to her car and got here. She said she trekked over a mile to get here to figure out if her child was OK. So these parents are dealing with a lot. The community is dealing with a lot. And we're just beginning to put together what happened. And of course, hoping to get more details here in the 4:00 Eastern hour, the sheriff says he'll make another statement.",

We're hoping to learn some more details.Isabel, can you talk a little bit more -- and as you mentioned, even that parent you spoke with was an elementary school student. This is the high school, Apalachee High School. But all of those schools placed on lockdown out of an abundance of caution. So you said you spoke to a parent, and I'm assuming the -- you tell us if you know the reunification process may not just be going on with high school students could be going on with middle school and elementary school students as well. Where are the parents or are they just sort of standing around waiting for further information, is there a place where they can go?",

So right by my photojournalists is a street, and you have schools on either side of this stretch of grass right here.And what I'm seeing are just parents looking in this direction, looking at the schools, but they have no answers. They're looking at their phone, seeing if they will get an update via text, via a phone call. I saw a mother standing with her babies waiting to get more details on another child that was in a different school. But they don't know. So they're trying to keep their patience and wait for 40s to tell them what to do next. All that we know from the sheriff, Judd Smith, is that that reunification process has started. He also mentioned about the importance of keeping student privacy. So I don't know if that means that they'll be moving the students, maybe, away from all of these cameras. Understandably, there's a lot of cameras and media here in the field. But we have not seen any student exiting the school so far.",

This is above -- shooting above the football field at Apalachee High School. And you see what appears to be students gathered there for a prayer circle. They're joining a sad group of students from across this country, thousands now that have endured shootings in school. This, coming just one month after classes started for the school year. I do also want to point out we are expecting to hear from the attorney general, Merrick Garland, shortly. He was set to give a press conference on Russia's sustained efforts to influence the 2024 election. But we are told that he is going to mention this shooting at Apalachee High School in his remarks. I want to go to CNN's Josh Campbell in the meantime. Josh, as we're looking at these images of the students gathered at the school, how complicated is it for law enforcement to go through a scene like this with so many students and so many potential pieces of evidence scattered across a huge area?",

The number, at this point, according to sources that our John Miller is speaking to, 30 injured. Not entirely clear that all of those are related to the shooting, that those are gunshot injuries. So we are still waiting for a lot of details to come in. But this is what we're monitoring here, a shooting at a high school northeast of Atlanta. Stay with CNN for the latest. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)",
