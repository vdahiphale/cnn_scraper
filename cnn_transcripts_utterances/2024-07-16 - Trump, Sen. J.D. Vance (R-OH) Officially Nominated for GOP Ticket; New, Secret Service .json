I really appreciate it.I guess what's your reaction to Trump selecting J.D. Vance? He could have picked somebody like Senator Tim Scott or Senator Marco Rubio could have helped expand Trump's appeal to voters. He went with J.D. Vance. What do you think? FMR. GOV. ASA HUTCHINSON (R-AR):  Well, when you win the nomination, you get to name who you want. And it's interesting that J.D. Vance, who was once a critic, then becomes a convert, and now is one of his most loyal supporters, fully buying into the Trump agenda for the future. And I think the question is, you know, while he brings a lot to the table, he's got an incredible story, he brings the youth mix to the table lacking on executive experience. But the question is the Nikki Haley supporters, the independent voters out there, how are they going to react to it? And right now, he really does not have the national profile as many others. And so it's almost a blank slate in some ways. And his speech this week will help define his vice presidency as a candidate. And then, you know, following the mantra of Donald Trump, how's it going to shape up in the fall campaign? Are they going to reach out? Are they going to narrow it and focus on the base? That's the test to be seen, but not a whole lot of assurance being given to those that are on the sidelines hoping for someone that would be supportive of aid to Ukraine and America's global leadership, and we don't have that in J.D. Vance.",

Because of this, I find him reprehensible. God wants better of us. I guess we were hearing earlier in that sound replayed a short while ago that J.D.

That's the J.D. Vance that wrote Hillbilly Elegy. And he's had a conversion himself.And he's not going to have a hard time handling this. He's just going to say, I got to know Trump. I like what his policies were. I was wrong back then. So, even though that's a storyline, the Democrats will use it. I don't see that as a sticking point. J.D. is smart enough to be able to handle that and say, I was wrong. He was right. I'm in line now. And I love the MAGA agenda. Let's move forward.",

Those are choices that really are stark. And so and then, of course, how Donald Trump has handled himself afterwards saying, this is an opportunity to bring America more together. He invited Nikki Haley, who I'm looking forward to hearing speak at the convention. So, Donald Trump's steps have impressed me. And although I had picked somebody else's V.P., he won the nomination. That's what he gets to do. For me, I'm going to wait this out.
