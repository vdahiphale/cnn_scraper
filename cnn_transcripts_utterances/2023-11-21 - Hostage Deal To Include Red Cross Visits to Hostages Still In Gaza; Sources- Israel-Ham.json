I'm Boris Sanchez alongside Jim Sciutto.After 45 grueling days in captivity, the nightmare could soon be over for some 50 hostages being held by Hamas and other groups in Gaza. And as we speak, top officials in the Israeli government are meeting to consider a deal that would see roughly 50 hostages released from Gaza in exchange for about 150 Palestinians imprisoned in Israel and a temporary pause in the fighting.",

Those who are not released will be visited by the Red Cross in Gaza. This has been a demand for some time from the families. They want to know if they're safe and well, what their health is like. The deal still must get an up or down vote in the full Israeli cabinet. That vote could happen at any minute. They've been meeting now.We want to bring you our team of reporters across the globe now. Oren Liebermann, he's in Tel Aviv. So you've described, Oren, how there are multiple steps to this process. You had the war cabinet meeting. Now you have the full cabinet meeting. How soon do we expect them to come to a final decision?",

We are at the final stage of this process from the Israeli legal and political perspective. We're through the very small war cabinet meeting. We're through the larger security cabinet meeting and now we're at the full cabinet meeting, which includes all the ministers and the other members that have to make a decision here.It doesn't have to be unanimous, if I'm not mistaken. It simply needs to be a majority there. And from everything we're seeing, from everything we're hearing, it will have a majority vote. There are some far-right parties within the coalition who have come out against it. But from what we understand, they don't have the numbers to sink this agreement. We just saw a video released from the Israeli prime minister's office from within the cabinet meeting, in which Netanyahu made a strong case for this to be approved. He acknowledged it includes a pause in the fighting. He called that a difficult decision. But he also said it's the right decision. And all of the security bodies within Israel, so for example, the Shin Bet, which is Israel's FBI, the military and other security bodies have all approved this step, and they support it, even though it involves a pause in the fighting. As you pointed out, we also learned from inside the cabinet meeting that Netanyahu told the other members of the cabinet that the Red Cross will be able to visit the 190 or so hostages who will not be released. And that has been a key demand here from the very beginning, since international law requires the ability for Red Cross visits. So we expect a vote soon. We expect the results soon. And it looks like this is moving forward.",

You can see this big table that's laid out behind me. There are some children's places and adult places as well, every place representing one of the people that is held still inside Gaza and it's a place of pilgrimage as well where the families of those hostages, their friends, just supporters from Israel come to pay their respects and to put pressure as much as possible on the government to do what it can to secure the release of those people.You can imagine there are very mixed feelings here tonight because and although people are, to some extent, excited that there could be a release of 50 or more hostages if this deal goes through as it looks - as looks likely. There's also a sort of bit of sweetness to it because everybody here knows that even though 50 plus may be released, there's still going to be a lot more, many more Israelis, many more others that are still going to be held hostage inside Gaza as well. And so people are very disturbed by that ongoing trauma that has really deeply affected people in this country and particularly here in Central Tel Aviv where people, as I say, are paying their respects and sort of making pilgrimage to pay their respects to this location. There's a lot of criticism as well, Jim, about the way Israeli government under Benjamin Netanyahu has conducted this operation, prioritize the rescue or the release of this hostage. Many people here I've spoken to saying look, the emphasis has been on destroying Hamas, not on freeing the Israelis, it should have been the other way around. It should have gone at people at first and then sort of (inaudible) with Hamas is what people are saying to me here tonight. But nevertheless, some people, again, obviously, many people here, everybody, are very happy that some people soon could see freedom.",

It will take another couple of days of logistics to get it done. There's a legal procedure in Israel that has to happen when the names of prisoners will appear on a website, and people can submit objections to it. There will undoubtedly be a petition to the Supreme Court in Israel against the deal. The Supreme Court never intervenes in these kind of cases. So, we just need to see the logistics on the ground with the Red Cross and the Egyptians helping to facilitate the release of the hostages and eventually the release of the prisoners, who I imagine will be released to the West Bank and not to Gaza.",

They decided how many they will release and under what terms. The Israelis could either say yes or no. The Israelis were hesitating over most of this past week because they didn't like some aspects of the deal, in particular aspects of the ceasefire or the pause, and the fighting, the requirements to stop drone surveillance over Gaza, some other aspects of the deal. And they pushed back, and the Americans pushed hard on the Qataris, and the Egyptians were working also behind the scenes.So these kind of deals, they just take time until the sides are ready to make it. Even, I mean, Gilad Shalit was - the deal for his release was six months after he was abducted and it took another five years before the sides were ready to sign the deal and get it done.",

There is a necessary redeployment of Israeli forces during the pause or the ceasefire in any event. The Israelis are going to have to pull back from some of the places they've already taken.I'm sure it's not that big a deal. There's a massive amount of Israeli soldiers and army materials in the Gaza Strip.

But the U.S. says that it didn't cause much damage and that there were not any significant injuries from it. But previously, just to put this into context, these Iran-backed militias had been using small rockets and drones to launch attacks on these U.S. and coalition bases across Iraq and Syria. So using a short-range ballistic missile, a close- range missile, is certainly an escalation here.And the U.S. has been responding to these attacks. And we were told by Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary, Sabrina Singh, earlier today that the attack that the U.S. launched on a vehicle in Iraq was in direct response to that ballistic missile attack yesterday. And they launched this attack on a vehicle that is believed to have been used to carry out that attack and it killed a number of these militants that were inside the car. However, it is unclear just how many of those militants were killed. And it really follows a series of strikes that the U.S. has conducted in the region in Syria as well to try to deter these groups from attacking U.S. forces again. But clearly, it hasn't worked. Because as you mentioned, Jim, these Iran-backed militias, they have carried out 64 attacks to date against U.S. and coalition bases in the region. And it has resulted in scores of injuries among U.S. personnel, including more than two dozen traumatic brain injuries. So the question now that the U.S. continues to face is whether its approach is working in terms of striking these Iran-backed groups in an effort to deter them from launching future attacks, in an effort to degrade their infrastructure and their military capabilities. It does not appear like they are backing down at this point. And the U.S. has, of course, repeatedly warned Iran that it expects Iran to rein in their proxy groups. But clearly, either Iran is not getting the message or these proxy groups are simply continuing their attacks, thinking that they will be unable to be deterred because they still have, of course, these capabilities, Jim.",

The Israeli Prime Minister is also arguing that this is a difficult decision for the cabinet, but he says that it is the right decision and he said that all of the security establishments in Israel supports this. He also talked about his conversations in recent days with U.S. President Joe Biden saying that he spoke to President Biden and asked him to help improve the terms of the deal, and Bibi Netanyahu arguing that that was successful and that this deal comes at a lower price than the one that was being contemplated nearly just days ago. What is also clear is that if the war will continue after this truce is over, then it is also continuing right now. Throughout the day today, we have been hearing explosions. We have seen smoke screens being deployed, indicating very active fighting still ongoing in the northern part of the Gaza Strip.",
