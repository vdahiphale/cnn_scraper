Biden says Republicans must decide, will they serve Trump or the American people.I'm Fredricka Whitfield, with John Berman and Sara Sidner. Kate Bolduan is off. This is CNN NEWS CENTRAL This morning, possible Russian fingerprints on this too. So, in just a few minutes, the House Republican impeachment inquiry into President Biden hears from its highest profile witness yet, the president's own brother. Yet, as this is happening, perhaps the most stunning twist yet in the at times floundering investigation. Remember the ex-FBI informant whose testimony had been central to House Republican allegations? The one that special counsel David Weiss already charged with lying. Well, the special counsel now says not only did he commit perjury in implicating the Bidens in a business deal, this informant has now told prosecutors that he was trafficking in information, false it turns out, provided to him by the Russians. So, follow the bouncing ball here. House Republicans within an impeachment inquiry, based at least in part on false information from a guy who now says he got stuff from the Russians. CNN's senior crime and justice reporter Katelyn Polantz with all this, this Russian connection. Katelyn.",

So, what is at stake in his case is questions about what he was telling the FBI related to Hunter Biden, Burisma and Joe Biden. He had alleged that there were millions of dollars that was connecting the Biden family to this Ukrainian oil company at a time when Joe Biden was vice president. That's not true. That's the lie that he's charged with funneling to the FBI.But as the FBI has continued to speak to him, even after his arrest, and as the Justice Department has gone to court to give us more details about this longtime FBI informant, Alexander Smirnov. We're now learning that he was getting information from Russian officials, including about Hunter Biden as recently as this fall. There were four different Russian officials that were providing him information that the -- that he then passed along to the FBI about Hunter Biden. So, all of that is calling into question the -- everything that this man was sharing with the FBI, specifically if it was information that was damaging about Joe Biden or Hunter Biden. And on top of that, John, it just is highlighting how much disinformation there was in the 2020 election about Joe Biden and his son and their foreign contacts, as well as what appears to be disinformation coming from Russia still in the 2024 election about Joe Biden.",

That is what they're going to be looking for this morning in this closed door meeting. And it really comes at a critical point for the impeachment inquiry as House Republicans are really struggling to produce any evidence that connects Biden directly to getting some kind of benefit from these business dealings from his family. Now, he's - they're going to be meeting today with James Biden, the president's brother. Then, in a week, they are going to be hearing from Hunter Biden, the president's son, for a highly anticipated meeting. But the reality for the Republican Party in the House of Representatives is that they have a narrow majority, which means they have to convince basically every one of their members to support impeaching Joe Biden, if that is the decision that they want to make and go forward with. And right now there just isn't the kind of evidence that would make some of those Republicans running in swing districts comfortable with moving forward. We expect that the House leadership is going to make a decision after these two critical interviews whether or not to proceed with trying and impeaching the president. But the reality is that they are going to have to make that decision with the political reality happening with this inquiry that has been going on for months now in which they have yet to find that direct evidence.

And it is a range of targets, a significant range of targets that we have worked persistently and diligently to identify, to continue to impose costs for what Russia has done, for what it's done to Navalny, for what it's done to Ukraine, and for the threat that it represents to international peace and security.

It's the same sort of thing. Russia sees that U.S. democracy is in crisis. They see that American politics are increasingly tribalized and they love to help the Americans destroy themselves. So, and to the extent that our biggest enemy in the United States is internal division, the Russians want to promote that. That should be no surprise over the past few years that we're learning this now.Having said that, let's not pretend that Hunter Biden suddenly has no problems going forward. There still are real issues around the amount of money that he was receiving as the president's son for a comparatively corrupt Ukrainian energy company. And there was also challenges with him flying on Air Force To when Biden was vice president to China to promote his access to getting cash. All of it smells bad. All of it is challenging, and the Republicans will use it. But the fact that the Russian government and Russian operatives wanted to take that vulnerability and sharpen it and use it as a weapon against the United States and against the American president, that doesn't surprise me in the slightest.",

She is charged with involuntary manslaughter and tampering with evidence in the shooting of the film's cinematographer, Halyna Hutchins. Alec Baldwin, of course, fired the prop gun during a rehearsal, killing Hutchins.CNN's Josh Campbell joins us now. Josh, what can we expect here?",

      "sentences": "Well, John, prosecutors say this is the road to accountability for the people that they believe are responsible for the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. We know that Alec Baldwin has been charged. But today's jury selection is all focused on Hannah Gutierrez Reed. This was the person that served as what's called the armorer on the set. She was responsible for the safe handling of firearms, for the safe storage of ammunition. And, of course, we know that a live round of ammunition made its way into the gun that Baldwin was holding that killed cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. So, prosecutors say that Hannah Gutierrez Reed bears some fault here. She's been charged with involuntary manslaughter. Under New Mexico law, the prosecutors offer two competing theories. It's either going to fall under what they called negligence or without due caution. Basically what that means is that she will only, if convicted, be sentenced to one charge, but she still could face up to 18 months in prison.Now, it's worth pointing out that, of course, she has pleaded not guilty. But as this trial begins, we will get a sense now of what prosecutors are going to prioritize. We know that in court filings prosecutors had alleged that she was likely hung over when she, quote, inserted a live bullet into a gun that she knew was going to be used as part of this movie. Witnesses also allegedly told investigators that Gutierrez Reed had been drinking heavily, using marijuana throughout the course of this movie -- the filming, which, of course, is important because this is the person responsible for safety. So, that person certainly has to have their wits about them. What I think that we can expect, John, just in hearing from her attorney leading up to this, is that this movie, the prosecutors described it as somewhat chaotic. There was a sense of complacency as it relates to safety on that set. We also know that Hannah Gutierrez Reed had two actual roles. Not just the armor, but she was also tasked with roles pertaining to props on set, which, you know, I talked to a number of safety experts in Hollywood who say that that's just unheard of. You want your armor focusing solely on the guns, making sure that they're safe. And so I expect as this moves forward we could probably hear her defense saying that she was tasked with all of these different roles which, you know, could have led to what actually occurred here, the negligence. But we will wait and see. I mean finally, John, it's worth pointing out, this case has obviously received lots of publicity. And so today, during jury selection, we can expect that potential jurors will be asked what they know about this case. There's this misnomer that a juror can't serve on a case if they've heard about a particular case. In reality, what the judge is looking for, whether they can actually render an impartial verdict. We'll have to wait and see as this moves forward, John, but according to prosecutors, the road to accountability here in the death of Halyna Hutchins.",
