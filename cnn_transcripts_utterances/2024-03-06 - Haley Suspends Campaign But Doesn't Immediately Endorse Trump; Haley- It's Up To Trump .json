I said I wanted Americans to have their voices heard. I have done that. I have no regrets. And although, I will no longer be a candidate. I will not stop using my voice for the things I believe in.

Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics.First up, today is day one of what will likely be a bitter and grueling 244-day general election. An 81-year-old incumbent president versus his 77-year-old predecessor. Donald Trump was able to secure his spot as the presumptive Republican nominee for the third time in a row, just 51 days after the first votes were cast. And now he's one step closer to pulling up something that hasn't happened in 130 years. Grover Cleveland was the only president to win non-consecutive terms. CNN's Kylie Atwood is in Charleston, South Carolina, where Nikki Haley just announced that she was suspending her presidential campaign. Kylie, you've been doing amazing reporting on what has been going on behind the scenes. What can you tell us now?",

Although, she feels good about what she was able to do here. It's important to note that she has ramped up her criticism of former President Trump over the course of the final stretch here of this campaign. At one point calling him toxic, at another point saying that he wasn't qualified to be president because she wouldn't trust him to protect U.S. service members overseas.So, it's not altogether surprising that when she came out and announced the end of her campaign today. She also did not come out and endorse former President Trump today. She left the door open to potentially endorsing him ahead of the general election in November. But she essentially said the onus is on him to make the case to the voters who have supported her. Listen to what she said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And she is trying to now play up the leverage that she has on those voters, putting herself into a position of power, even though she is stepping down and ending her candidacy today.And it's important to note, Dana, that she very clearly said that even though she is no longer going to be running for president, she is going to continue to use her voice for the issues that she cares about. One of them she said was the need to stand with U.S. allies, calling that just incredibly important. Dana?",

And we were told going into this speech that Nikki Haley was not going to endorse him. And I was told by advisers that they believed she was going to go out there and trash him.But before she even got through her speech, in which she asked Donald Trump to earn the votes of Republicans that didn't support him. He posted this on social media. He said, Nikki Haley got trounced last night in record setting fashion, despite the fact that Democrats for reasons unknown are allowed to vote in Vermont, and various other Republican primaries. Much of her money came from Radical Left Democrats, as did many of her voters, almost 50 percent according to the polls. At this point, I hope she stays in the race and fights it out until the end. I'd like to thank my family, friends and the great Republican Party for helping me produce by far. The most successful Super Tuesday in history and would further like to invite all of the Haley supporters to join the greatest movement in the history of our nation. Biden is the enemy. He's destroying our country, make America great again. So, he starts by saying that Haley's supporters and donors are Democrats. He's also said that anybody who donates to Haley was not somebody who he wants to donate to him. And then he ends was saying, if Nikki supporter -- Nikki Haley supporters want to support him, he welcomes them. This was then sent out by the campaign. This is why I'm pointing this out. In a note that said Donald Trump's statement before Haley's speech, which indicates to me there might be something else coming because this was not sent out before Haley's speech. This was sent out in the middle of his speech, and I am told that he was watching this speech. I knew it was happening at the time. But I think we might see something else another turn of the wheel here because, Dana, as we have said, time and time again. Both Biden and Trump going into this -- every single vote is going to count a general election. And that includes those Nikki Haley supporters. Yeah, the turn of the wheel will probably go about 180 degrees is my sense. Kristen, thank you so much for that reporting. There's so much to discuss today. And here with me is an all-star panel. CNN and Bloomberg Nia-Malika Henderson, CNN's Jeff Zeleny and Amy Walter, of The Cook Political Report. I told you all, I want you to sort of just kind of open up your brains and spill out the most -- sort of the biggest takeaway. Our viewers have been listening to this and we'll get into some of the nitty gritty in a second. But kind of the big picture of what this means in the body politic going forward.",

      "sentences": "Well, now we're serious. The rematch really is on starting today. And 244-some odd days until the final election day the voting comes earlier. But look, I think the biggest sort of thing I'm struck by as you look at all the maps of the primaries are the coalitions.There's work to do on both sides in terms of rebuilding their frame Coalition on the Biden side. That is clear as we see the uncommitted votes in Minnesota again last night, joining Michigan last week in other places, that's just one slice of the coalition he has to rebuild. But he has to do the same with progressives, young voters, Latino voters, black voters, others, but Donald Trump also has to rebuild his coalition, the Republican coalition. I talked to so many voters out there this year who voted for him once twice, some may do it a third time, others simply don't know. So, I think that is what we'll have our eye on going forward for the next eight months. What about those people who don't know? We call them Nikki Haley voters now. They're not all Nikki Haley voters and she doesn't own them. They'll do different things. But some said they're going to vote third party, some said they're not going to vote. Others have to be sort of wooed in. So, her comments are this morning, that was a time for his choosing. The burden is on him. It's not her burden. AMY WALTER, PUBLISHER &amp; EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, COOK POLITICAL REPORT: That's a very, very good point. Look, you mentioned in the open. This is the third time Donald Trump now has a presumptive nominee, but he enters this race in stronger shape than he's ever been in his political career. You know, think back where he was in 2016. He didn't win a majority in any of those states. In the primaries or in the caucuses, the party was deeply divided. 2020 he came into that race behind Joe Biden. At this point in 2020, he was trailing by about four or five points. Today, he's got a party behind him clearly. And yes, I do agree with Jeff that those Haley voters are going to be important. But there are far fewer of them than there were in 2016, who are really debating this. And Joe Biden is a much weaker candidate than he was in 2020. So, this race starts in a very different place than the rematch and then it did in 2020. The rematch looks very different. NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, CNN, SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Yeah.

      "sentences": "One of the factors -- one of the many factors, but maybe the most important factors that Donald Trump is facing this time around that he wasn't in the other two races is a criminal charges and court case after court case that he's facing. And it was striking in the exit polls that we saw last night.These are questions that were asked of Nikki Haley's voters, specifically about whether or not they're satisfied -- they would be satisfied as Trump is the nominee, only 19 percent said yes. Believe Trump is fit to serve if convicted 17 percent. Now that might look like a pretty low percentage. But if you think about what that could mean in -- let's just take North Carolina and Virginia, particularly Virginia, for example. Well, I think North Carolina is probably the better example. If those people don't show up for Donald Trump, Joe Biden could win a state like North Carolina.",

If I was a betting person as an old courthouse reporter, I would say no. I mean, that seems to be where it's going.But you mentioned wildcards. Boy, I cannot think of a presidential race with more wildcards from the third-party candidates to the individual health and sort of stature of both candidates to all of the criminal cases. So, we're going to reset, have to take our breath and see how this shakes out. But I do think it's an important opening here for the Biden campaign and they're going to try and seize upon it. I mean, they have a lot of vulnerabilities. But their biggest task above all, of course, is to try and make this not about Joe Biden, but to make it about Donald Trump about his negatives. And there's a lot that helps him -- them in that respect. But again, the criminal charges has helped Donald Trump consolidate the Republican base unlike we've ever seen in his two other races as at this point.",

Donald Trump made it clear he doesn't want Nikki Haley supporters. I want to be clear. There is a place for them in my campaign. I know that Democrats and Republicans and Independents disagree on many issues and hold strong convictions. That's a good thing. That's what America stands for.

And so, every single one of these voters who fits into that category in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, and Arizona matters a lot and a lot more than what we'll see maybe at the national level.Look, this has been Donald Trump's challenge as a candidate and it still looks -- even as I said, he's coming in in better shape than ever. Like his continued challenge, which is his hard ceiling. Even in the swing state polls where he's ahead. He is getting basically the exact same percent of the vote he got in 2020. Or he got in 2016. He has never been interested in expanding his coalition. But again, if you're going to win into these states ---",

That's when the electoral college certified Joe Biden's victory. Mitch McConnell went to the floor declared Joe Biden the victory that did not go over well with Donald Trump. And of course, January 6 happened.Mitch McConnell voted to acquit Donald Trump in that impeachment trial, but then went to the floor and absolutely eviscerated Donald Trump, calling him morally and practically responsible for the events of that day. And then we have seen everything that happened since then Trump attacking McConnell, Trump going after Mitch McConnell's wife, Elaine Chao. And really rather racist terms attacking -- McConnell rarely even says Trump's name. I asked him regularly about Trump, the campaign trail. He doesn't even want to discuss any of it. But he had said for some time that he would ultimately endorse the nominee and that's what he said in that statement today. I'm here to endorse the nominee. Now Dana, this is not just McConnell falling in line. This is the Republican Party establishment falling line including McConnell's potential successors. John Thune and John Cornyn, both of them are running to replace Mitch McConnell in the next Congress. I caught up with both of them today. Both of them had expressed concerns about Trump's viability in the election -- in the past about how he can appeal to voters in the suburbs.
