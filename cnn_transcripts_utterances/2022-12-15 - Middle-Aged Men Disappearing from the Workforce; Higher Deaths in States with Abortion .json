Let's back track and look from 2020 and before to see what health care for women, maternal health care and outcomes, and babies look like. Where were the weaknesses and how might these bans exacerbate that. So, essentially, they took data from the CDC and the March of Dimes and they compared those 26 states with the restrictions and bans to those that did not have them and they found that, in fact, there were more maternity care deserts in the states that have restrictions and bans. So, places where you don't have access to providers or even hospital or birthing services. There were less OBGYNs and certified midwives, so less providers. More women were giving birth who were younger, under the age of 30. More were giving birth in rural areas. And more were giving birth without prenatal care or with late prenatal care.

Between 2018 and 2020, if you looked at just women of reproductive age, 15 to 44, there -- for all-cause mortality it was 34 percent higher. And the maternal mortality increased. The rate of increase was two times as much over those years.And let's not stop at the mom. Let's talk about what happened to the babies. Again, infant mortality from 2018 to 2020, higher for that whole first year across all races and ethnicities.
