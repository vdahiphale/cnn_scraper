I will say everyone will say he should have known or if he knew. All's we knew at the time was there was a rumor we are going to deploy. And I can tell you that since -- when the Iraq war started, the rumor came up that every unit was going to deploy. And that does become true. But you don't deploy on rumors. If you need the NAS (ph), which didn't come until July, and you need this sourcing order, that didn't come until August. And if he knew, I didn't know. I've sat in the same chair as him. When he got ready to deploy in our last deployment, I didn't know any sooner really than the rest of the unit knew. So, you know, that part of the conversation I think is baseless.",

I'm defending what I know about a soldier who I served with. From what I know about him and the situation, saying that he is a traitor or shirked his duty, in my opinion, is an unfair assessment of what took place. I think, if you want to attack him on other levels, on his record and that stuff, have at it. But I don't think it's fair to take the 24 years that he served and try to decide that he didn't serve honorably or if he did something he shouldn't have done. That's just not fair.",

That's really -- his reasonings we're, at least what he told me, was that he was going to choose to serve his country in a different way. And that was going to be in the House of Representatives. If he got elected. So again, I don't know anything other than those things. If someone's going to speculate that he got out because of the rumor of a deployment, that's just their opinion.

That statement is untrue. That's misleading to the American public.And when he had on his bio that he is a retired command sergeant major, that's untrue also. The rules -- the rules are simple. When he gets selected, he can get promoted by signing up for the academy. The other requirement is you've got to graduate, walked across the stage. And then, I believe in the guard, I had to give two extra years of service. He didn't do those three things. [13:35:58] So when you retire, you go to the next -- the previous rank you have. So he was never a retired command sergeant major. Although he does have the right to say he was a sergeant major. He did do that. But he can't, under the rules of the Army, retire as one.

And it's big. And they've been in for a couple of days now. They've advanced several miles into Russian territory. And they're using not just Special Operations units or partisans inside Russia to carry out these operations. Because we've seen some of these surprise attacks inside Russia before. Some of these are regular Ukrainian units, as well as Special Operations units, I'm told, which speaks to a bigger, more ambush -- ambitious push inside Russian territory. And frankly, an embarrassing one for Russian forces. They stormed across the border, clearly caught Russian forces off guard. And they're doing some damage. And they've -- this has led to some surrenders by Russian forces as well. So it is a -- it's a piercing of the Russian armor, if you want to call it that. I'm told that the intention here is, in part, to surprise and demoralize Russian forces.
