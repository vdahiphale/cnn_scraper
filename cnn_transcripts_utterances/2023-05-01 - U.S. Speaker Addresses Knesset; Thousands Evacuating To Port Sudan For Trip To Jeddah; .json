Thousands of people continue to leave the country amid a fragile ceasefire. Kevin McCarthy addresses Israel's Parliament during his first trip abroad as U.S. House speaker. French protesters take to the streets for May Day demonstration's unhappy with the new pension reform. And First Republic Bank becomes the second largest bank failure in U.S. history. A perilous journey with a happy ending at least for those lucky enough to escape the fighting in Sudan. Evacuees from all over the world and making the more than 800-kilometer journey across the desert to Port Sudan. From there, they're ferried across the Red Sea to Saudi Arabia. This is video of American evacuees in Port Sudan boarding a U.S. ship for the trip to Jeddah. The New York Times reports American drones have been flying overhead to monitor land convoys headed to Port Sudan. Well, meantime, there's another extension of a 72-hour truce but smoke is rising over Khartoum and witnesses report more gunfire in the capital. Doctors say more and more dead bodies lining the streets creating an environmental catastrophe. But we're covering all angles here with Larry Madowo in Jeddah and David McKenzie is in Johannesburg for us. But let's go to Larry first in the port of Jeddah. Larry, those there who have been evacuated are definitely the lucky ones. What have they been telling you about their escape and those that have remained behind?",

They're finally out of the conflict after making anarduous journey from the capital Khartoum through more than 500 miles. It's over 830 kilometers to Port Sudan and then waiting, sometimes for days to get on a ship to cross the Red Sea to here in Jeddah. There are also a lot of kids in the midst of it. People who I just met a three-week old baby who was born at the beginning of this conflict. That wait an extra week to get a British travel document for her. Her name is Nur, which means light and Arabic. So, these are the stories that you see so much about. When they get here to Jeddah, they process a place like this, where the British or Australian or German or American embassy will look at their papers. And then they go over to customs. You see over there, officials from the U.S. embassy who have been receiving them this morning, a big consignment, a big ship run by the U.S. Navy came through here. The USNS Brunswick and they had mostly Americans, more than 105 Americans, more legal, permanent residents as well as 24 Brits, for instance, people from other parts of the world. And in the midst of that, there's still kids running around and playing and enjoying the moment, which is, I think, a good reminder that even in through so much adversity and so much pain, children will be children. This innocence in the midst of it. They don't know how bad it's been for the parents worried for them, worried about the bombing and the shelling and the gunfights and not sure if they're going to make it safely in that long convoy from Khartoum to Port Sudan. And then across the 10, 12-hour journey to Jeddah, we did that trip over the weekend with the Saudi Royal Navy, took a Navy warship to Jeddah and then evacuated 52 people back. And that's the problem, even though there's so many of these shadows being run by the Saudis they can only take so many people. There's a lot more important to them that are desperate to leave.

You don't anticipate that stopping because the fighting hasn't stopped even if on paper, there is a ceasefire. Now, it must be said there have been some periods of more calm than there has been fighting over the last few days. And that has allowed people to stream out of the capital on buses and on planes from north of Khartoum from an airfield there, particularly British nationals. But even this morning and into today, there are reports from CNN journalists on the ground of significant fighting north of the capital. There's also been a sporadic fighting around the presidential palace in Khartoum. And it speaks to the overall very dicey situation for civilians there. You mentioned the Sudan Doctors Union saying they were buddies on the street, also pointing to the fact that garbage hasn't been collected and services haven't come through. There is some sign that international aid is getting in dribs and drabs. And that's very significant. The World Food Program saying they're going to be able to resume their operations in the country to feed those who are hungry after several of the staff members were tragically killed in the opening days of this conflict. You've also had the International Committee for the Red Cross that is getting a second plane into Khartoum with vital aid. Over the last few days and over the weekend, we've been speaking to doctors within Khartoum who've run out of all kinds of critical supplies. So, you know, while people who can afford it or have the support from their governments to get out of the country, those who are stuck in the country are very much facing a terrible situation.

In France, we're seeing massive crowds still angry about President Emmanuel Macron's pension reform. Some protesters in Paris and other French cities even clashing with police. The French President's decision to raise the retirement age by two years unleashed a wave of strikes over the last few months. It says the change which he signed into law last month was needed to keep the pension system running. Well, our Melissa Bell is live for us in Paris. And Melissa, despite this pension reform set to become law, you are seeing their huge protests continuing.

And I think that's part of what's fueling the anger you're seeing on the streets of Paris today. What we're showing you now is what's happening all along the head of the march. Letters it is and it's always tends to be the case of these marches by the Black Bloc. These are the most extreme elements that seek confrontation with the police. So far, that's been pretty successful today. Behind them are many more tens of thousands of protesters we expect on the streets today. The trade unions are out once again to make their anger plain. But we were always expecting today, Julia, to be particularly tense. The authorities were because of that convergence of the traditional May 1st Labor Day protest. And of course, all the anger about the pension reform itself. And I think on both sides, there's a determination ready that today should in a sense, from the point of view of the protesters be a barometer of the wider anger in the French population on the part of the government, that this may be one last moment when they're out to vent. And the government hopes put an end to it because remember, Julia, that this pension reform was one of the early ones in Emmanuel Macron's mandate, second term, his determination is that there will be many more. The determination of the protesters is that that's not going to happen, Julia.",

It goes back to the 19th century, before that, medieval times. A traditional French revolutionary noise that is made. And that's been chasing Emmanuel Macron around the country as he's tried to make his peace in his case with the French public. And I think one of the things -- the thing -- that thing at the forefront of the minds of the protesters out here. I'll just show you the images, Julia, if I may behind me because as you'll see, throughout the day, you're going to see a lot of the fires that are being led just behind the protesters, perhaps you can see the smoke rising up from there. This is something we've seen a lot these last few weeks and we're likely to see a lot more of today. The determination I think of the protesters out here is also driven, Julia, by the knowledge that the wider public feels as strongly as it does. It is 62 percent of the French who are opposed to the pension reform. And one of the most interesting things is how -- what a great proportion of French has actually increased in support of this protest movement. Despite all these many weeks of strikes, despite all these many weeks of inconvenience. And indeed, some of these chaotic scenes that we've seen week out on the streets of Paris, Julia.",

This was a deal that came together late last night and was announced early this morning by the FDIC. And we're learning new details about how this deal came to be. Yesterday on Sunday, the FDIC held an auction for First Republic and JPMorgan was the top bidder. It then took 800 employees from JPMorgan as well as others from the FDIC and Treasury to make this deal happen by early this morning. As part of the deal, JPMorgan is assuming the deposits of about $92 billion. This means that if a U.S. customer is going into a First Republic Bank today, it is business as usual. Your deposits are safe. They're also assuming $173 billion in loans and they're also paying the FDIC $10.6 billion to make this deal happen. But this, as you mentioned, happened just weeks after a huge $30 billion cash infusion led by JPMorgan, we heard from Jeremy -- Mr. Dimon just a few moments ago on the media call with JPMorgan. The CEO saying that he hoped that this cash infusion of 30 billion would help stave off this very issue. But in the end, it was probably just a little bit of a stretch to get the bank through these last six weeks. But the big question here now is, is this the last bank failure or is this a signal of more to come? Mr. Dimon saying on that call, again, that he believes that we may see one more potential bank failure, but this is really the end of the road. He went on to say that he believes that the banking system is sound. He also said that he does not believe this deal will have any impact on a recession nor did he go ahead and make this deal to stave off a recession. Christina?",

And so, they said that that is the reason that they haven't organized U.S. government flights for those citizens that are still in the country, they think those are a bit more dangerous. And they also have allies that are doing those flights and allowing American citizens onto the flight. So, they are looking at these overland convoys. For the first time over the weekend, there were two U.S. government organized convoys that left the country -- excuse me, that headed out of the country to Port Sudan. Those were the first efforts that were actually completely organized for U.S. citizens by the U.S. government. We heard over the weekend, from the State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller describing essentially the support that they gave to those convoys, you know, they were able to provide surveillance, running over the top of those to make sure that they didn't run into any violence along the way. We don't know exactly how many Americans were part of each of these convoys that were taking these citizens to Port Sudan to get to a safer place. Of course, out of the country, but what we do know from the State Department, as if they say they have facilitated the departure of nearly 1000 citizens from Sudan. So, essentially, what that means is that, you know, these convoys and other efforts with allies have meant that about 1000 U.S. citizens have gotten out of Sudan, with some kind of support from the U.S. government. And what they say also is that there are fewer than 5000 Americans who have reached out for some kind of support in Sudan. Not all of those Americans want to leave. And when you talk to State Department officials, they make it clear that some of these Americans are obviously, you know, also Sudanese Americans. They want to leave one day. They might want to stay another day if the violence goes down in the areas where they're leaving. But we'll have to continue to watch this space, because as you said, there had been some criticism that the U.S. government wasn't doing more for its citizens when compared to the other countries that were providing these government sponsors flight out of the country.",
