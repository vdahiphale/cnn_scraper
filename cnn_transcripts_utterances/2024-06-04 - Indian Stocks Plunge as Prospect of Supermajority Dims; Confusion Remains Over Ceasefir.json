This is the scene inWilmington, Delaware, where the son of the U.S. President is facing felony gun charges. It is 9 am on the East Coast of America. It is 5 pm here in Abu Dhabi. I'm Becky Anderson. This is \"Connect the World\" coming to you from our Middle East Programming Hub. Also happening this hour, the world's biggest democracy is now counting ballots what we know so far about the results in India's election live from Delhi. Plus U.S. President Biden expected to announce a big change in U.S. asylum policy, a major shift during this election year. And the markets in New York will open in about 30 minutes and we are looking at a set of red arrows on the futures markets across the board if they are any indication. The markets in New York set to open. We're keeping an eye on those for you and we'll get the open, bottom of the hour for you. All final results are due anytime now from a potentially pivotal race in the world's largest democracy. Right now more than 600 million votes are being counted in India's sprawling six week election. It does appear that the Hindu Nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi is on track for a third straight term. Early results show the right-wing BJP and its allies with a comfortable lead, although the opposition is doing better than many had expected. Rahul Gandhi, the son of the famed Gandhi dynasty is the face of the Congress Party lost in the past two elections, of course to Modi. Well, India's economy has thrived under Mr. Modi. But certain freedoms have not. For more CNN's Ivan Watson standing by in New Delhi, Ivan, let start with where we stand with election results at this point.",

And as you can hearbehind me, his supporters are celebrating, it does look from the preliminary results, it does appear that Modi is set to serve in office for another term after a decade in power here. However, the preliminary results also suggest that this is not the landslide victory that he had predicted. He was talking about his alliance winning some 400 seats out of the lower house of parliament. As it looks right now, his alliance may not even get 300 seats. And in fact, his BJP may not break that 272 seat threshold that would give him a simple majority in the parliament. What does that mean? Well, he might have to govern in his next term in a coalition. That's something he's never had to do as Prime Minister before, and that he didn't have to really do as minister of his home state previously. On the other side of the political divide the opposition, the India alliance led by the Indian National Congress. They're calling this a big win and a big defeat for Modi, even though he looks to be ruling again, for another term. They're saying this is a victory for the people standing up to what they said was Modi's erosion of democratic freedoms in this country, of course, he would deny that, but we are definitely seeing a shift here in the country. And I do think that the reactions in the Indian stock market reflect that on Monday when the exit polls were coming out suggesting a big win for the BJP, the stock market surged breaking records. Well, today they have plunged, as the results have proved different from what had been predicted, falling more than 5 percent. And I think that indicates that's an indicator of what a surprise result, these -- preliminary results are appearing to be so far, Becky.",

      "sentences": "Well Becky, President Biden is expected to announce a sweeping executive order that would essentiallyshut down the U.S.-Mexico border for asylum seekers crossing into the country illegally, when a certain apprehension number is met. Now, sources who have been briefed on the plan tells CNN that that limit is expected to be about 2500 encounters a day, which essentially means that this would go into effect right away as current apprehensions at the U.S. southern border are just under 4000 apprehensions on a daily basis. Now, it's important to note that sources say this would exempt unaccompanied minors, which is worrisome to some immigration advocates, who are concerned that this might encourage families to send their children to the southern border on this journey by themselves. Also, it's expected that the president would be using an authority that was actually used by Former President Donald Trump when he was in office, a move that was decried by Democrats and eventually struck down by the courts. It's expected that when the president rolls out this executive order that there eventually will be some legal challenges as well. But this has already caused some consternation among some progressive Democrats and immigration advocates who say that the president is focusing too much on enforcement actions. But it does all come as the president's trying to address a major political vulnerability for him heading into the November election. As we have seen in poll after polls, more Americans express concerns about border security as they are trying to make up their minds about this upcoming election. So what the White House is trying to do is show that the president is trying to tackle one of his biggest liabilities, an issue that's of concern, as you noted, to many Americans.",

This announcement is coming just a few weeks before Biden and Trump are set to face off in that June 27 debate right here on CNN. And Trump has really made his own hardline immigration policies, a key feature of his presidential campaign. He repeatedly lambastes President Biden for his approach to the U.S. southern border. Now, at the same time, we have seen the White House really trying to take this more aggressive approach when it comes to immigration, especially in the wake of those failed bipartisan border talks. President Biden has repeatedly called out Republicans for listening to Trump who urge them to tank that plan up on Capitol Hill, and he has said that he will use this time to try to remind voters that it was Republicans who stood in the way of a bipartisan border deal between these lawmakers. But it all comes as we've talked about that there this issue of immigration, issue of border security. Americans continually say that they have become increasingly concerned not just along the U.S. southern border, but also as we have seen many cities, states up north, also impacted by the rise in border crossings over the course of the past few years in the Biden Administration.",

This is an opportunity for defense attorneys and the prosecutors to lay out their theory of the case before the jury. And I also want to talk a little bit about this jury, because yesterday, during the jury selection process, it was a little bit of a challenge for both sides to find people who did not have a link, some link to the Biden family didn't know someone, for example, someone was dismissed because they used to play a sport with Beau Biden. But they did ultimately select a jury, six women, six men, the majority of the people on this jury are black, there are several gun owners, and jurors who talked about their own experience with loved ones who had issues with addiction. The overwhelming majority of potential jurors all talked about how they had some sort of experience with addiction. It's a reminder of the drug addiction epidemic here in the United States. And this is a key issue in this trial. Now, the first witness we expect to hear from today, after opening statements is an FBI agent who worked on this case. And then as they go through the case, as you noted, we do expect to hear from several women who are romantic partners of Hunter Biden who can give firsthand accounts of his addiction issues. And this is of course, the first of two criminal trials, Hunter Biden is facing. There's this case and then in September, out in California, he's expected to face a separate trial related to tax issues.",

Three staged proposal announced by U.S. President Joe Biden on Friday is shrouded in confusion. Biden said the plan had come from Israel and it was welcomed by Hamas. But Netanyahu then seem to undermine the proposal vowing to continue the war until Hamas was destroyed. Netanyahu's political career is at stake as Israeli hardliners wanting to continue the assault on Gaza, while opposition leaders and protesters are increasingly demanding that a deal be reached. Our Nada Bashir following developments so for us today, she is in London. There is some level of confusion, not least about whose proposal this was? Was this a U.S. proposal announced by Joe Biden on Friday late? Or was this an Israeli proposal? Certainly the U.S. administration sold this as an Israeli proposal for Hamas to either leave on the table or accept.

      "sentences": "Look at this stage, we are still hearing very mixed messages from both the Biden administration as well as theIsraeli government. We heard over the weekend from Prime Minister Netanyahu as well as spokespeople from within the Israeli government saying that the conditions for a ceasefire that the Israeli government has long put forward still stand despite this peace plan. This three phase peace plan put forward and announced on Friday by U.S. President Joe Biden that the Israeli government wants to see the full destruction of Hamas in both political and military terms in Gaza. Now, that stands in contrast, what we heard from President Biden on Friday. He said that this is the time to strike a deal that Hamas has been downgraded to a point where they are not able to carry out according to a U.S. assessment and attack at the scale of which we saw on October 7. That has, of course, long been framed as a -- priority by the Israeli government with regards to its objectives in this war against Hamas in Gaza. And of course, as you mentioned, Becky, we are seeing the Israeli government facing different kinds of pressure from different corners, of course, as the international pressure coming from the likes, the U.S. and other world leaders for this war to come to an end for a ceasefire to be struck given the mounting civilian death toll that we are still seeing in Gaza and the unfolding humanitarian catastrophe that we are seeing. We're also seeing pressure from Israeli citizens. But over the weekend, still more protests taking place against the Netanyahu government calling on the government to focus more on securing the release of hostages held captive by Hamas in Gaza. But Netanyahu is also facing pressure from within his own cabinet on the opposing side from those hardline. And far right members of his cabinet who do not want to see the war come to an end, who wants to see the full destruction of Hamas. And of course, that was something that President Biden touched on during his speech on Friday. He said there would be members of the cabinet who want to see a continuation of the war, who in his words may want to see an occupation of the Gaza Strip. But that this will only further Israel's isolation on the global stage and also would not work towards the security of the Israeli state. Now, when it comes to Hamas, of course, we have heard from Qatari officials -- while there are some positive indications at no firm commitments just yet with regards to the deal, but they are looking for further clarification on some of the language. While the U.S. State Department says it is confident that Israel will go along with the plan. It has also noted that the terms of this current peace plan are nearly identical according to a spokesperson's words to a proposal agreed to by Hamas weeks ago, so perhaps some positive indications there.",

What do you make of President Biden's decision to late on Friday night announced the details of a ceasefire proposal on hostage deal, which -- at the time he called an Israeli proposal? But since then, it seems that the Israelis haven't actually signed up to this. Why did he do what he did on Friday? What was the thinking behind the scenes here? HALA RHARRIT, FORMER ARABIC LANGUAGE SPOKESPERSON FOR U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT: Look, Becky, I think clearly, Biden is a bit fed up with what's going on in Gaza. Clearly, he realizes that this is undermining him domestically. The elections are only six months away. There has been a significant uncommitted vote, which jeopardizes his, own reelection. And I think he wants to put this war to an end, as he very forcefully said, and for the first time really said out loud, I think it was very telling that he spoke directly to the Israeli people and asked them to support this ceasefire, which clearly is a strange tactic when you're saying that it is an Israeli proposal.

He is the CEO of the tech company, Broadcom and he took in $162 million last year. He's the only CEO in the S&amp;P 500 with a 9 figure pay day. This was more than double what he made the year before and it was largely because the stock price of Broadcom almost doubled last year. He made more than 500 times the median employee. Some of the other notable names on this list include the CEO of Apple, Tim Cook; the Netflix CEO, Ted Sarandos. And look the stock market down a bit this morning. But as we know it's trading right near all-time highs. So Becky, you got to think that some of these CEO pay packages, they're only going to get bigger this year. The question of course is whether or not worker pay will also rise by the same amount. Stay tuned.",

Well after an amazing career at PSG Kylian Mbappe has finally made it official. He is moving to Spain. Real Madrid is setting another star to their constellation and he is calling it a dream come true. And Amanda Davies joining me now that I know you caught up with him recently. I mean, I spoke to Kylian about what was it 2.5, 3 years ago about whether or not he would be leaving PSG to go to Real Madrid has been absolutely a question of when not if, hasn't it?

Real Madrid winning that 15th European crown on Saturday in such emphatic style, and whilst he might be describing it as a dream come true, what he's wanted as a move since he was a young boy, is potentially an absolute nightmare for everybody else because it is making an already very, very good side even better. We've been speaking getting some of the reaction to the news from Spain. It's been impossible to avoid the excitement and the anticipation and that's where we're going to be finding out a little bit more about in just a couple of minutes in \"World Sport\". Of course it's still got the Euros to come with France before we see him in a Real Madrid shirt for the first time but certainly a major moment for him and football in Spain.",
