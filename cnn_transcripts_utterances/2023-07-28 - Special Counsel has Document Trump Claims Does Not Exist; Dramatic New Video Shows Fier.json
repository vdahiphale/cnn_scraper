This is Trump's caught in a lie about a classified document he said doesn't exist.Plus, dramatic new video from the front lines where Ukraine says it is making gains tonight, as we are seeing just how far Putin will go to keep his friends in his corner. And CNN's taking underwater to see firsthand the full blown emergency that is unfolding along Florida's coast, as the only living coral reef in the continental U.S. is now dying because of blistering ocean temperatures. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Jim Sciutto in for Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, Trump caught lying. As the former president faces major new charges in the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case, CNN has learned that one particular document about Iran war plans, document that Trump openly discussed on tape, was ultimately returned to the National Archives by the former president's team. That is significant, because it is a document that Trump has denied is even real or that he ever showed them off to anyone on type. I want to first play CNN's exclusive audio of Trump talking about the Iran or plan in the 2021 recording at his New Jersey golf club. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)",

He is Yuscil Tavares, and I.T. expert who oversaw the surveillance camera footage at Mar-a-Lago.According to the indictments, the Mar-a-Lago property manager, Carlos de Oliveira, who is also now facing charges, took Tavares to a small room known as an audio closet. And according to investigators, de Oliveira asked Trump employee four how many days the server retained footage. Trump employee four responded, he believed it was approximately 45 days. De Oliveira told Trump employee four that, quote, the boss wanted the surfers elated. Trump employee four responded that he would not know how to do that and he did not believe that he would have the right to do that. These new details come as law enforcement braces for another criminal indictment, this time in the DOJ's January six investigation. CNN is learning opponent officials believe charges could come anytime next week, and that the Secret Service, D.C. Metropolitan Police Department, and U.S. Capitol police are now working with U.S. marshals to prepare. Security preparations also underway in Georgia. Orange barricades are now outside the Fulton County court house, as officials there prepare for a possible indictment in the state's case against Trump, and his efforts to overturn Georgia's election.

Ryan, I do want to begin with you. So, given Evan's reporting, what do you believe the special counsel entered the charge around this particular document about Iran war plans? If you return it in January 2022, does that give you an indication that he has -- the special counsel has testimony that in fact the president was waving a classified document? RYAN GOODMAN, CO-EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, JUST SECURITY:  It certainly seems that the special counsel will have testimony and proof that they think they can show beyond a reasonable doubt that there was this document and that document was being waved around. And the setup for the conversation which Trump does supposedly a wave of this document does seem like it was preplanned. It's not like it spontaneously came to him, go get me this document. He was trying to rebut something and the media about the idea that the chairman of the joint chiefs had tried to dissuade him from attacking Iran. So he came prepared with documents. You can imagine, if they've interviewed anybody they might have interviewed anybody involved with preparing the documents, bringing them to the room, and therefore knowing what a greater level of visibility what the document was.",

It could be one of a couple of reasons. One, for example, one of the elements of the crime as he has to willfully retain all of the documents, right? So, one question will be, he returned to the Archives, so did he willfully retain it? Or maybe that was a question, or maybe it's so secret and so sensitive that the intelligence community didn't want Jack Smith to include this because it can't be revealed. We don't know why. But Trump, when he went on Fox News and denied the existence of this document and claimed it was just a magazine, papers, or clippings, the document didn't exist, he almost gave Jack Smith no choice but to go to the intelligence community and get permission to put this in the indictment and show that Trump is just lying.",

Only 30 boxes were returned on June 2nd for the attorney to review. The next day, the FBI came to review the documents that were collected by attorney number one. And when they were doing this collection, they looked around and they saw this video camera, they saw the security system.
