And then, actually, when she announced her retirement in July of 2005, he was actually first selected for her Associate Justice seat.

That was a time when she was very aware of the optics, not just because of optics, but because if you want them to be truly objective, she believed at the time that she could not comment and no pine on things, because then it would undermine her credibility.
