Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world, I'm Wolf Blitzer, you're in THE SITUATION ROOM. Tonight officials here in Washington and in New York City are gearing up for something this country has never seen before, the possibility that a former president of the United States may soon be indicted and arrested. Our Senior Legal Affairs Correspondent Paula Reid has details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA REID, CNN SENIOR LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice over):  This was the day former President Trump claimed he would be arrested on charges related to a hush money probe but there is no sign yet of an arrest or even an indictment. Still, law enforcement continues to prepare for possible protests. In Washington, D.C., barriers erected around the Capitol, in New York, police officers told to be in uniform and ready for deployment. So far, officials say there are no credible threats despite online chatter calling for civil war if Trump is indicted. Today, small groups gathered outside Trump tower and Mar-a-Lago. There has been no word from the Manhattan district attorney after a last- ditch effort by Trump to avoid charges, Attorney Robert Costello appearing before the grand jury Monday to attack the witness at the center of the investigation Michael Cohen.",

Well, that is an open and shut case as a misdemeanor. That's the base case under New York law. And then if you make those false entries to advance or cover up another crime, that becomes a felony. And I think while there's some complexities that the D.A. has a strong felony case here because these payments benefited the Trump campaign. Those kinds of benefits are routinely prosecuted as well. Michael Cohen pled guilty to a campaign finance violation. So, that elevates the misdemeanor up to the more serious felony charges. That's the legal theory and I think it's a valid one.",

They are responsible with the Secret Service for the security of the U.N. General Assembly in Manhattan every year, and the court officers and the NYPD are accustomed to seeing high-profile criminal defendants come into 100 Center Street in Lower Manhattan for an arraignment, for a surrender. And so this one is clearly unprecedented, but they know what they are doing. I have a lot of confidence in the NYPD, in the court officers and the Secret Service. A point that I think needs to be emphasized here is that the Secret Service is responsible for the physical safety of their protectees, not responsible for avoiding political embarrassment or things like that, that has to be a discussion between the Manhattan D.A.'s office and his personal lawyers. You know, should he be photographed? Where should he be photographed? Will he be photographed being fingerprinted? Will the mug shots be released, for example? That's not something for the NYPD and the Secret Service to be negotiating. That's more between his lawyers and the Manhattan D.A.'s office.

So, you know, this offers a window into his thinking as he potentially decides to rule one way or another on this case. Of course, Fox has asked this case to be dismissed in its entirely. Dominion has said it has proven actual malice and asked the judge to rule in its favor. Both sides want to theoretically avoid a trial. Unclear whether the judge will rule one way or the other in totality but he could issue some rulings ahead of a potential trial and perhaps his line of questioning offers some insight into his thinking in the case.",

Fox is, of course, denying this. But I spoke to -- I spoke to her attorney last night and he said they have ample documentary evidence in all forms that support a broad swath of her claims.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Handcuffed and leg shackled, Irvo Otieno is brought into the intake area of Virginia's Central State Hospital with some difficulty. Within minutes, he is on the floor. For the next 12 or 13 minutes, he will be held down by deputies and staffers, sometimes with a deputy on top of him. At points, his position changes or the officers reposition their grip. There is no audio, and for much of the video, Otieno is not in full view. At least once a deputy seems to use his knee to restrain him. Later, he is turned on his side. A person appears to administer an injection, and then CPR. It is not clear exactly when he died or his official cause of death. Today, seven deputies were indicted by a grand jury for second degree murder as were three hospital staffers.",

Police in Aurora, Colorado, say 45-year-old James Toliver Craig showed intent to end his wife's life by searching for ways to kill someone undetected by giving her poisons that align with her hospitalized symptoms.Investigators say Craig bought arsenic as well as potassium cyanide. Police laid out a chilling time line that began March 4th, when arsenic was delivered to the Craig's home. Two days later, Angela headed to the hospital complaining of dizziness and difficulty focusing her eyes, symptoms consistent with arsenic poisoning according to the police affidavit. Angela texted her husband that day saying, I feel drugged. Her husband James texted back: Just for the record, I didn't drug you. Investigators say Craig used a computer at his dental practice to research poisons. Police say his search history showed phrases such as how many grams of pure arsenic will kill a human, and top five undetectable poisons that show no signs of foul play. Police say around the time Angela was hospitalized again from March 9th to March 14th, James Craig ordered potassium cyanide online, the highly lethal drug was delivered to his dental practice, so concerned a staff reported what they found. Charges are set to be filed formally Thursday while the case has rocked their community.",
