How do you respond this morning? SHENNA BELLOWS (D), MAINE SECRETARY OF STATE: Good morning. Thank you for having me. I think it's really important that people understand the process. As a general matter, states have the power to control their own ballots. And, in fact, do under the Constitution. And Maine law specifically delegates to me, as secretary of state, a requirement to review the qualifications for any candidate running for office. So, for example, last week the superior court found that my decision to bar Mr. Chris Christie from Maine's presidential primary ballot due to lack of signatures was lawful and correct. So my job, I qualified Mr. Trump for the ballot, and under Maine law any registered voter can bring a challenge to that qualification. In this case there were three challenges, and I was required by law to hold a hearing, an administrative hearing, to review the evidence, hear testimony. Both sides were represented by council. Mr. Trump was represented by an attorney. And then I'm required to issue a decision. That's my obligation under the oath I swore to the Constitution.",

Local municipalities are not structured to be able to carry the weight of a crisis like this. And I've sent a delegation to the border to see firsthand what our bordering cities are experiencing. And what we have said repeatedly is that there has to be better coordination. And without a coordinated operation, this is going to crush local economies because there is a financial responsibility that we have all taken on.
