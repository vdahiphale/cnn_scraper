And this is really a trend that we've seen over the last several days. He's always kind of leaned into that playbook of using dark imagery to paint this kind of scary picture of America at the present time.But it's been escalated I'd argue to a level that I haven't seen yet this election cycle. He's really been ramping that up in this final stretch before November 5th. So what we heard him do tonight was talking about what he argued were millions of illegal immigrants coming across the border thanks to Kamala Harris, and arguing that part of that is Venezuelan gangs, other gangs coming here to commit crimes. Of course, we have heard from many local Republican officials and all -- in some of these different cities specifically really Aurora, Colorado, where he was in -- where he was visiting on Friday, pushing back on some of these claims saying that they are exaggerated, but Donald Trump really leaned into those tonight. I want you to take a listen to what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, CURRENT PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: For four straight years, she's imported an army of illegal alien gang members and migrant criminals from the dungeons all over the world. Not South America, all over the world. They come from prisons and jails, insane asylums, mental institutions. From Venezuela, from the Congo, all over. And she's resettled them into your communities to prey upon innocent American people. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Now, Jessica, a few things I want to point out here is that when I talked to Donald Trump's campaign about this language that he is using, they argue that they think it could help him. There's no signs that he's going to move away from it. If anything they're going to ramp this up even more. They tell me that they think it helped him propel him to the White House in 2016, and they believe it could help him again this cycle.And so I don't think you're going to see Donald Trump tamping any of this down in the coming weeks, even as some people question whether it's the right time to really play on this fear-mongering and stoke fears with voters about immigrants in this country.",

He also touted an endorsement from the Border Patrol Council. That is the first official endorsement this cycle for Donald Trump, although I will say they have really long supported the former president in the past.But Donald Trump said that if he is elected in November, he plans to announce a goal of hiring 10,000 new Border Patrol agents to really beef up their presence on the southern border. He also said he was going to call on Congress and ask Congress to give those agents a 10 percent raise, as well as a $10,000 retention and signing bonus. So clearly, really trying to gather more support from that group and lean in to what they do at the border. He said they have one of the most important jobs. One thing that was actually interesting as well, I know we talked about this a couple of weeks ago where Donald Trump was referencing migrants in this country who committed crimes. He said that they had bad genes, language that we know he has kind of used in the past, very controversial language that has been -- received a lot of backlash from people like the ACLU. Today, he said something different when talking about these Border Patrol agents. He actually said they have great genes. You guys are the kind of people who have genes. So again, kind of leaning into that nativist language, some of that rhetoric that all plays into what I was saying earlier, which is that Donald Trump is really seizing on immigration and this dark rhetoric in the final weeks of his campaign -- Jessica.",

There are some Democrats being very vocal, others speaking on background, but they're worried about Harris's momentum. They think the race has plateaued. They're concerned voters still don't see how she's different than President Biden. What do you think?GOV. JOSH SHAPIRO (D), PENNSYLVANIA: Well, look, Jessica, in Pennsylvania, the last two presidential races have come down to 44,000 votes and 80,000 votes representing about a point or less. So it shouldn't shock anyone that the polls are within a point or so, or even a dead heat. These are close races. But the stakes are incredibly high. The contrast is clear, and I'll tell you what, I would much rather be us than them. I think we've got momentum. And look, I'm a sports guy.

A lot of people look to you as a model for how to win that state.Now you were running against a candidate that was pretty weak, but nonetheless, you did quite, quite well.

So they don't have a particularly strong track record in Pennsylvania. But it is true that the races for president tend to be a lot closer in our commonwealth.Kamala Harris just needs to keep doing exactly what she's doing, which is showing up in communities that are oftentimes ignored and left behind, forgotten areas that, you know, in the past had maybe been flyover areas for national candidates. She's showing up. She's answering questions. She's looking folks in the eye and kind of letting people kick the tires. You know, we're still -- we're a big state but we're still a retail state. I think she's doing what she needs to do. I joked with her the other day when I saw her in Pennsylvania, I think she had been in our commonwealth something like four-and-a-half out of the seven days that week. She's returning weekly. Governor Walz has been in Pennsylvania quite a bit. So they're spending a lot of time, a lot of focus, a lot of energy on Pennsylvania. And I think they're showing up in the right areas.",

Great to see both of you. Colonel Leighton, let's start first with you. As Nic was just reporting the IDF now investigating how this drone entered Israel without triggering an alert. How might that have happened and how significant is that? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes, Jessica, it's extremely significant and one of the things that could have happened and there's indication that this might be the case, the drone in question may have flown along the surface of the earth. It's very hard for radar to pick up things that are really low flying. Not impossible, but very difficult. And if they did what we call a map of the earth navigation that would then make it very difficult for any defensive system to pick the drone up and actually eliminate it, shoot it down. That said, that's what I think may have happened in this particular case. And it's certainly something where it's clear that Hezbollah is refining its tactics and Israel is of course a consequence of that.",

So we should remember that these are all in many ways connected conflicts.To your question, I think President Biden was looking for a way to help the Israelis make the case that another Iranian missile attack on Israel would fail as the previous two will have failed to do much damage, and by putting this additional Patriot system together, he's got the moment to go do that. But I think what else we're learning here is that the president's tolerance for having American troops in the way here in, even in defensive positions in Israel is increasing a little bit, that he is -- thinks it's a relatively small risk to have 100 Americans there. Obviously there are thousands of Americans on board the ships and in nearby bases to try to help defend Israel as well.",

It's what they call a THAAD system and will handle a variety of Iran's most advanced defenses, and they certainly want to tell the Iranians that if they do launch another missile attack, there are more likely to go intercepted. And they're saying this because of course we're all waiting for the Israelis to do their counter attack from the October 1st attack.And the fact that here we are in the middle of the month and it hasn't happened yet tells you that the Israelis have taken a little bit different view than they did when the first missile attack happened back in April. At that time, they were in a big rush to reassert deterrence by shooting back right away. This time they seem to be taking their time, picking their targets, enjoying the fact that the Iranians are closing their airspace at various moments out of fear that the attack was coming and they're willing to let it sort of dangle there a bit. And I think it tells you about sort of a newer confidence they have in their ability to make the Iranians doubt whether or not their missiles really can do much harm to Israel.",

A lot of it has come since the presidential debate in early September, but a lot of the issues, the central issues in Springfield started way before any presidential debate.And that has come with an increase in Haitians that have come to Springfield legally either under humanitarian or either under the Biden administration's parole program or they've then been able to acquire Temporary Protected Status. Regardless, it has led to a population increase there and as you may know, the population in Springfield is around 58,000 in 2020. The city estimates that anywhere between 12,000 and 15,000 immigrants are in the county where Springfield is, of course, the biggest city. So that understandably, regardless of any immigrant status that increase in population has put stresses on things like education, health care, housing prices, things of that nature. and then you add the fact that there's a language barrier here that I think, based on my experience, there has helped contribute one, to a lack of understanding in some cases. But also, just difficulty in adjusting to life in Springfield. There is one unmistakable effect they have had on Springfield that we've heard from many people from city officials and business leaders and that's their effect on the economy. Take a listen to some of what we found. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JIMENEZ (on camera): When would you say you hired your first Haitian immigrant?",

They just would disappear.And that is a real problem when you're running a production facility. You need to have a reliable workforce that you can count on to be at work every day. The influx of the Haitian population has allowed companies to expand and grow from an economy standpoint for the community, they are shopping, they're paying taxes. It just boggles my mind the people that think that they're just getting this incredible free ride. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
