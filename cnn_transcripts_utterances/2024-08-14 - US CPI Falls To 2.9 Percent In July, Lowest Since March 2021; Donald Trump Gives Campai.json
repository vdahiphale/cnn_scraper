      "sentences": "The Dow on a positive note there, given the tailwinds it had today from some positive economic news. Thoseare the markets, and these are the main events. This hour, former President Donald Trump will deliver a speech on the economy, and as I was just saying, a key measure of US inflation falls below three percent for the first time since 2021. And a tasty tie up, Mars has agreed to buy the company behind Pringles and Cheez-Its. Live from New York, it is Wednesday, August 14th. I'm Paula Newton in for Richard Quest and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. And good evening. Any moment now, former president -- US President Donald Trump is expected to deliver remarks about the economy. He will be speaking in Asheville, North Carolina, always important to remember, it is a crucial swing state. Now the Republican candidate often blames the Biden administration for the high inflation of the last few years. There was, however, good news on that front today. Consumer prices rose 2.9 percent in the 12 months ending in July. That is the first time headline inflation has come in below three percent since early 2021. Now investors, widely expect the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates when it meets next month. Julia Chatterley is in New York for us and Steve Contorno is in Florida. Julia, first to you, it was a good data point, no debate there. But how does it fit into the political landscape at this point in time, especially for both campaigns that really need to stake out some real estate on economic policy? JULIA CHATTERLEY, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR, \"FIRST MOVE\": I think there is something for everyone in this number to your point. I think it seals the deal as far as the Federal Reserve is concerned, to begin lowering interest rates in September. I think it justifies or equates to around a quarter of a percentage point, not more, which is important, but that is going to be good news for the Biden administration. Good news for borrowers, of course, and we've already seen things like mortgage rates come down. One of the key components of this and it formed the bulk of the pressure on prices comes down to shelter, to housing and actually that was double the price rises in that sector that we saw even last month. So that's a thorn in the side of the Federal Reserve and it is certainly a flag point for both of these campaigns. Talk to people about how you're going to help increase affordable housing? How are you going to increase this share and the supply of houses overall, quite frankly? And they both made hints in different ways and we can talk about that in a moment. On the downside, and I think this is what helps the Trump campaign in what they can point to is the fact that overall in the last two years we've seen shelter prices up 13 percent, electricity prices up 10 percent. We've got food and beverage prices up eight percent, transportation up 18 percent. I am just mentioning a few of these, child care costs up six percent. If you want to hammer the Biden administration, you can talk to them about the affordability crisis that is still true today for many Americans, and then you can talk about what you're going to do to fix it, and we are sort of lacking on the detail as far as them that the Trump campaign is concerned, but I am sure that won't stop him lamenting the rising prices for people. There is opportunity for both sides on this. The question is, do they take it? Solutions rather than problems.",

Many economists from both sides, they're saying that look, that is just something America cannot afford given both the debt and the deficit, and so many other things in the offing that perhaps an administration, another Trump administration or a Harris administration should worry about and one of them as you've pointed out many times, is the overwhelming worry that Americans have over housing costs.",

Iknow that the Harris administration or the Harris campaign have talked about, it is going to require more housing. The problem is, I was looking at the data today. There are 295,000 open construction jobs. They can't actually hire the workers that they need in order to build buildings even if they could to provide more housing. So what's the plan there? And if you're starting to criticize the immigration in the country, again, I point to those kinds of stats as huge vacancies in the manufacturing sector as well. And unfortunately, restricting some forms of immigration is hurting the nation not helping. So it will be interesting to see what he says on that. I am sure he is going to talk about the fact that they want to remove tax on tips. Interesting, there has been some pushback on that because of the distortions that it creates. I know you've already talked about it on the show this week, it impacts 2.4 million people according to the estimates that I have seen, and it doesn't really help the lower income members of the American population that one, don't earn tips; and two, don't even pay taxes at all. So, if you want to help people, raise the minimum wage. Let's talk about some kind of policies like that. He's going to talk about energy policy, too.

Harris and Biden waged war on American energy, threw open our borders, flooded the country with low-wage migrant workers, passed the green new scam, racked up almost $10 trillion in debt and buried our workers in job- killing regulations costing $10,000.00 per family. That's a lot of money. You don't have to imagine what a Harris presidency would look like. You're living through the misery right now, except it will get worse and you're paying the price, a price like nobody has ever paid and we are disrespected all over the world as a country. We were respected before. Putin respected us. President Xi of China respected us. Kim Jong-un of North Korea respected us. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)",

I think you can tell attimes when he was on script that is listening to the teleprompter -- reading the teleprompter and what was written there, and many times going off prompter. He certainly made some direct attacks against the VP Kamala Harris especially on the economy, and writ large she called her an incompetent socialist lunatic, who will destroy the economy. He did make some claims there, though, about the economy saying that things like mortgage rates have tripled since they came to power. That is not true according to a report out at Zillow. They've gone up enough, most Americans will tell you. They've almost doubled since then, but not quite tripled as he has said. Also saying that insurance rates, car insurance rates have gone up well over 80 percent. Also, according to CNN, insurance rates went up about 21 percent up until February, although we got new numbers on that from CPI today. And yes, they are high. Rana Foroohar joins me now as well. Rana, I mean, look, the fact check here is not anything that is easy to do, especially as he's speaking here, and yet he did, he was much more disciplined and really honed in on what is an Achilles heel for VP Harris, right, and again, it's that whole adage that we can talk about inflation, we can look at data points, but most Americans feel it, right?

I will note that as you were just talking about, it is true that the economy is better, that we have seen this uptick. However, I talked to voters at these rallies every single day or every time he is on the road, and they just don't feel that way. So regardless of what the cause was, they feel like they were better off under Donald Trump. Now that's not everybody but that is enough people to where you look at the polling from the last several months, you see that he was outpacing President Joe Biden when it came to the economy. People thought he handled it better. And that's why it is that his team wants him to focus on the economy because he wants -- they want him to remind people that it was better under him. Again, regardless of the actual -- the actual data that we have seen, we are talking about how voters feel. Now the other thing that they want him to be talking about is immigration and crime, we do expect to hear more of these kind of smaller policy speeches. This is not a rally. People are sitting in seats, where he goes over and talk specifically about one issue. But I don't think we can undervalue how the economy feels to the American voter because that is why that is why you are seeing his aides and his advisers want him to stay on message. And again, going back to that polling that we saw for months while President Joe Biden was in office, that's what they're going off of. They're going off of American people saying that they felt like they were better off under Donald Trump. And that's why they want him to say it. The other part of this is Donald Trump has yet to really make an attack line on Kamala Harris that has landed. And what you've heard today is clearly the direction that they're trying to go in now, which is Kamala Harris can make several promises, but why hasn't she done it yet? Now, obviously, there are a whole host of reasons that she would not -- it's not her only administration, Congress, there's a lot of different things at play here, but that is where they're going to see the messaging heading, which is that Kamala Harris does not exist in a vacuum. She has been in the administration for quite some time. So any pain that you're feeling particularly at the pump or when you're buying groceries, that's also partly on her not just President Joe Biden. Now whether or not that's successful we'll have to see. Obviously we have seen a huge boost in both enthusiasm and pulling around Kamala Harris. It is unclear that people are linking the two of them, President Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and the policies together at all. But that is an effort that Donald Trump's team is making right now.",

So, yes, we can afford a lot.In fact, we can afford more than I think many policymakers think. Let me just step back for a moment because the \"Financial Times\" actually recently did a poll showing that more voters now trust Kamala Harris on the economy than Trump. So that's one of the first polls you've seen, you know, showing that kind of shift. And I know that it's been a real tailwind for her campaign. I think that you're going to see the same issues being taken on and talked about in very, very different ways by Trump and Harris. Let's talk about affordability and housing because frankly if you break down the latest inflation numbers, housing is where you still see a problem. Everything else is either flattening or in some cases disinflationary, which, P.S. to fact check what Trump was saying, we are not seeing hikes in insurance prices. We're now actually seeing deflation in things like car insurance, but we'll put that aside for the moment. Housing is still an issue where we do have concerns, but let's look at why that is. If you, go back pre-pandemic, you already had pretty robust housing crisis. That's something that's been happening for 15 years now. That's been happening since we were, you know, lifting the economy up after the financial crisis. You then go into COVID, you see a lot of Americans moving to different, different parts of the country. You see areas that had had lower housing prices taken off. Then you get the bout of inflation from the supply side issues I talked about. The pandemic, the war in Ukraine, trade tensions, et cetera. Inflation goes up, interest rates go up, that then creates kind of a perfect storm for housing where you've got high prices that have been with us for a long time under many administrations. And then you have interest rates which are high as well. That means people have a hard time getting a mortgage if they -- even if they can get it, they may not want to pay those rates. Those two things created this real, you know, I would just say a perfect storm for the housing market. The latest inflation and jobs numbers point to a fed rate cut in September. That will start to take pressure out of mortgage rates and out of the housing market. And I think that you're going to see Harris riding a little bit of that tailwind. I think you're also going to start to hear talk as you put it about housing affordability, about, you know, nimbyism, about, you know, how will we actually creating housing in this country? Maybe we need to change. You know, the last time we really had a revamp of housing was in the post-World War II period. So it's long time overdue to start talking about housing policy.",

In reality, she was given a much more limited immigration related assignment, which was to lead a diplomatic effort to deal with the so- called root causes of migration in three Central American countries. He claimed as usual that he gave Americans the largest tax cut in history, certainly a significant tax cut. It was not the largest in history. He claimed that Harris has allowed 20 million people to legally come across the border into this country. Aside from the question of Harris' role and responsibility here, it's not anywhere near 20 million people. There have been about 10 million so-called border encounters of both the northern and southern border, and not even all of those people were allowed in. Many of them were expelled back to Mexico and other countries. He called switching candidate, you know, from Biden to Harris a minor form of cheating. It is not any form of cheating. It's perfectly permissible under all laws and election rules. He boasted -- this isn't quite a lie or a false claim, but he boasted of African-American poverty during his own presidency. He said no one has ever seen it that good. What he didn't mention was that the African-American poverty rate has actually fallen lower under Biden and Harris than the record that was indeed set under Trump. So better today than it was then. And then there were a whole bunch of subjective or not quite checkable claims that I think many people would dispute. He said California where many millions of people live happily is unlivable, that the U.S. is a banana republic in a third world country. He claimed there wouldn't have been a Hamas attack on Israel under Trump.
