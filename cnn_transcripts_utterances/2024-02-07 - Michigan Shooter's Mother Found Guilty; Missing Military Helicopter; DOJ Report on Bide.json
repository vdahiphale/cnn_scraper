First of all, she said that both sides were very well represented in that jury room. So, that is obvious that there were two sides to this. People for guilt, people for not guilty. We know what happened in the end. But she also said, lives were in the balance with this verdict, lives, plural, which is very interesting.

And that would have been for the day, in his backpack, for the shooting.There is not an answer to that in the evidence at all.

This is about carelessness. Involuntary manslaughter seeks to get at, right, is it foreseeable, number one, that if you act in that way and you put a gun in that child's hands, in terms of accessibility, could something like this happen? Number two, on the issue of notices to the mental health maladies of your son, what did you know or what should you have known? And so I think, ultimately, the injury concluded that the mother did not act reasonably and, as a result, said, you know what, you're going to be held accountable, and that's what they did.",

Because this prosecutor basically said, I'm mad as heck and I'm not going to take it anymore, and decided to use this law, involuntary manslaughter, which, again, is a gross carelessness, right, were you grossly careless, to say, I'm going to criminalize your behavior if you put a gun in the wrong hands and succeeded in doing that. So, I think the deterrent value, I think the value of care and people being more reasonable and responsible. And with respect to your -- the other question, the father, James Crumbley, who's going on trial, I think it's bad news. Why? Because he is the person who purchased the weapon. He's the person who was supposed to secure the weapon. And he's the one that Jennifer Crumbley was blaming on with respect to allowing Ethan to get access to that weapon.

Apparently, there were psychiatric records which would suggest that the parents didn't know. Jennifer Crumbley wanted those admitted. They were not.

And so when this report is released, special counsels do have to give their findings to Congress and also to the attorney general. It will lay out the findings of what happened with these classified documents. Very important point, though, that the sources are telling Hannah Rabinowitz, Paula Reid, Even Perez, and others on this story, that there are no criminal charges expected in this special counsel investigation. Even though a special counsel does have the power to bring criminal charges. Still, the other expectations here is that politically this report, and its release, could invite comparisons to the case against Donald Trump. The criminal case against Donald Trump related to the mishandling of classified records after he left the White House at Mar-a-Lago. Of course, though, John, just to reiterate, there's a difference in a special counsel's report where one results in criminal cases and the other is a report of, this is the law, this is the findings, these are the findings, with no criminal charges, which is what is expected for the current president.
