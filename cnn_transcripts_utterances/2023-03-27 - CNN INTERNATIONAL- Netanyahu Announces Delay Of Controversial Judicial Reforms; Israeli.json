Israel prime minister says he is delaying a bill in Israel's legislation that could overhaul the country's judiciary. Now, we just learned after a day of strikes across many sectors as well as massive protests, the Trade Union group says the strike stops now. In just the last few minutes, prime minister Netanyahu addressed the nation, saying, a small minority was trying to rip Israel apart and criticized members of the military, refusing to train and serve over the law. Many of Mr. Netanyahu's right-wing coalition argued that changes are needed to balance the government giving more power to the legislature. Now, he's critics argue that either roads checks and balances and undermines Israel's democracy. I want to bring in professor Gideon Rahat.

And now, he's coming like, you know, the great moderator, but I think that he is responsible for the rift that happened and he's also responsible for the danger for Israeli democracy and many Israelis so that this danger is coming and protested against it.And I think that only by having so many forces against this reform and for having some kind of negotiations did he stop with promoting this anti-democratic reform. KINKADE:  We are looking at live pictures right now from Tel Aviv there. Protesters on the streets. We've seen three months of protests across the country, cumulating in a mass general strike. We've just got the news in that the Labor Union leader is calling for an end to that general strike.

So, I think that this might -- at the time being, might hurt the Likud a little bit.But on the long run, I'm still -- I'm not sure. And of course, we are not going to have elections in the near future. So, the Likud can still gets -- to gets back its power if Netanyahu will take it to -- more to the moderate form, more to negotiations, more to type of consensus politics rather than a dividing politics.",

So, it's really easy for him to survive these votes because of the extreme right-wing cannot really threaten him because they would not support an alternative government. So, I don't see how he can be ousted through a constructive vote of no confidence unless he really lose so much support from within his own party, from at least a third of his own party, and that's another story. But at the time, I don't see how he can really be ousted in a vote of no confidence and being replaced by another prime minister without having new elections.",

He waited to see how far he can go without these negotiations, and he decided that it's impossible because of the pressure from all over the place, from the local government, from the unions, from business, from everything.So, now, he might do -- try to do two things. One, he may negotiate, but the other maybe to try to slow down and to promote his reform piece by piece, hoping that the protests wouldn't have -- wouldn't survive for a long time. Protests have short -- can live for a short time. So, he might think that he's buying time and that he will be able to promote his reform piece by piece after piece, you know. And then, in the -- not in the near future, but within two months, he may restart the whole process and instead of doing a blitz, like he did right now, he will do it step by step.",

That's what officials at the children's hospital at Vanderbilt told CNN affiliates.The Nashville Police Department says the shooter was engaged by offices and is now dead. The person is described as a female who appeared to be in her teens. The incident is the 19th shooting at an American school of universities so far this year in which at least one person was wounded, that's according to a CNN tally. The Kremlin says Western reaction will not affect the plan announced by the Russian president over the weekend. Vladimir Putin says he intends to station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, a close ally of Moscow. The European Union's top diplomat calls the plan a threat to European security, while NATO denounced the announcement as dangerous and irresponsible. CNN's Matthew Chance is in Moscow and filed this report a short time ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, what Putin said is that Russia is planning to station a number of tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, the first time since the 1990s that any part of Russia's nuclear arsenal has been stationed outside the country. Putin added that a storage facility is scheduled to be completed by July. So, by the summer, potentially these small but powerful battlefield weapons could be deployed.But while Putin's frequent references to Russia's nuclear missiles and weapons are alarming for the rest of the world, they don't necessarily mean that we're taking a step closer to Armageddon. Much of this maybe for domestic consumption, to show Russians that Putin still has the initiative when actually progress on the battlefield has been pretty stagnant. Certainly, the U.S. State Department has reacted calmly to the announcement, saying, they don't see any reason to adjust their nuclear posture, no any indication that Russia is preparing to use a nuclear weapon. Where this Russian decision will be felt though is Belarus, Moscow's ally, in what it calls its special military operation in Ukraine. Putin made it quite clear that the tactical nuclear weapons were not simply be handed over to Belarus but would remain under the command and control of Moscow. And what that means is that Russia will likely be stationing even more of its troops there, slowly but surely moving into Belarus, gradually tightening its grip over that country.

And Israel's prime minister says he will delay the second and third votes on the legislation to overhaul the country's judiciary. And in response, the leader of the Histadrut Trade Union has announced the end of a general strike.Now, it's nearly 9:00 p.m. and the protesters are still on the streets of Tel Aviv. Live pictures coming into us just there. Benjamin Netanyahu says the controversial reform plans will be pushed back to the next legislative term to give a \"real chance for real debate.\" Now, the proposed changes sparked massive protests and strikes driving the country to a standstill. Mr. Netanyahu called for those who oppose the plans an extremist minority who are ready to tear Israel apart. Our senior international diplomatic editor Nic Robertson is on the streets of Tel Aviv right now and joins us live. Good to have you there for us, Nic. So, we heard from Netanyahu not long ago essentially saying that there is still a need for judicial reform. But right now, his plans will be delayed. What exactly was your take on that?",

It is up to the security officials to make sure that the country remains united, that it is strong, that it is ready to face the challenges.And he really gave a sense of what he feels is happening, what others on both sides of the debate here have felt like is happening, that this country is pulling itself apart. He used the parable about a baby, where two mother's claim the baby. The king of the time offered to cut the baby in half. So, he is likening it to a situation where the country is being torn apart. This area where I am, outside the Supreme Court, not far from the Knesset, has been a site of gathering for pro Benjamin Netanyahu, pro his government's views for the judicial reform. Now, I have to say, looking at the crowds here, it is thinning out. Quite a few people are leaving, quite a few people taking their families back home. Young children headed away from here. But the sense that this isn't anyway over, I think at the moment, is really open for debate because the reality is the deadline has been pushed away, the core issue hasn't. And really, the prime minister's expecting even critics within the defense forces, and this is what triggered yesterday's situation with the family that the defense minister must fall in line. So, this is far from over.",

Have you heard anything about any other plans for protests in the in the coming hours tomorrow?",
