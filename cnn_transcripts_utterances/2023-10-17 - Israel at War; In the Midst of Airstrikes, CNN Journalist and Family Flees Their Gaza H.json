On our third day, a nearby building is hit. This man was injured in the explosion. He is my father's cousin. Thankfully, he only suffered minor injuries. I must get away from the hotel. The situation is very difficult. We load our car and head south to Khan Yunis. Seconds after we left the hotel, they fired a rocket that heavily damaged the entire area. Now, we're in Khan Yunis. There are still airstrikes, but it is safer here. It's only a matter of time until we flee again. I hope one day we can return home. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

My family is a strong family. We are supporting my sister as much as possible. She is in recovery now, especially mentally after being captive for hours. My nieces are with her.Yesterday, we found the family dog which was injured badly but was found alive, and they were reunited with him. And that will bring strength to Lishai (ph), Ronie (ph), and Alma (ph). And it's a grave tragedy for us, but we coming from a strong resilient family. We grew up in Sderot, it's a working-class town that was targeted by Hamas and other terrorist organizations for 23 years now. And so, we learned to live with this conflict and tragedy, now it hit us personally.",

They were thrown to the floor. They were handcuffed. They were treated violently.I don't want to go into too much details because in my opinion it's not something that can be processed by civilized human beings. They were treated violently. The babies were woken up with guns pointed at their heads. And I'm sure that two-year-old Ronie (ph) will be remembering this for the rest of her life. I have my first memory when I was two years old from falling down a staircase, and I'm sure this will be much more traumatic to her. They were -- later were grouped with another family, another two more families in a different house. When they entered, they went through the kibbutz, they saw bodies lying around. So, houses being burned with people inside. When they entered, they saw a teenaged girl lying dead, shot on the spot by Hamas terrorists. They saw a terrified family. The parents, the two siblings of that young lady terrified, hollow faces covered with blood. This was also livestreamed on a Facebook off, I believe, one of the -- those who were held captive. They took all the phones and they decided to use it. They were mocked. And again, they were violently treated, tortured for hours. Eventually, Omri (ph) and a few others from the -- that house were taken hostage in a car, they're missing since Saturday. The terrorists threatened my sister and a few others that they will be coming back to take them. They will be coming back to do whatever they wished with them because they are their property now. And for hours, my sister and the other members of the other family that were not taken were sitting terrified. Hearing all the screams, babies screaming, my sister said.",

We have so many silly photos from that event with the -- with my nieces, with my nephew, with my sisters, my parents.

I was considering to go back, but the past few days, including yesterday, my family is begging me to stay here. Fight or -- I'm now a soldier of my family and a soldier for all of the hostages and a soldier of all of the victim of this atrocity that was committed against the people of Israel, and also foreign nationals from all around the world, Thailand, Nepal, Cambodia, the U.S., France, the list goes on. And for now, I'm not going back but the situation is so fluid.
