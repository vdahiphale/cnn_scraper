      "sentences": "I'm Victor Blackwell, live in Orlando, Florida, continuing CNN special live coverage of Hurricane Milton. In just the last few minutes, the wind and rain have really picked up here in central Florida as this hurricane is now moving east and causing havoc on the East Coast. It's not done with the rest of the state.We've gotten reports from local officials here across Orange County of reports of flooding, trees down, at least one report of a roof collapse as well. But right now, local authorities are on standby because the gusts of wind that you'll see during these live shots, they're just too strong to put those first responders back on the road. So they're waiting until the wind's calm and they expect that will be soon to get out and try to answer some of these calls. We know that tens of thousands of people who live in this part of the state across central Florida toward the east are without power of the two million across the state without power and we're expecting significant, because of what we saw in Ian flooding in certain areas. Now there have been those reports we have seen some video on social media but not until the sun comes up will we see the true legacy of Hurricane Milton for Orange County and Osceola County. The shelters in Osceola County are full. They're told, we're told they're at capacity. Thousands are in shelters here in Orange County and we're waiting to see just how bad this storm has been. Let me send it back into Erica Hill, my colleague who's in New York. ERICA HILL, CNN ANCHOR AND U.S NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, Victor, the daylight certainly will tell us a lot as Victor said. I'm Erica Hill here in New York. As we continue to follow these developments, Hurricane Milton has been tearing across the state of Florida for hours now, initially making landfall near Siesta Key to the south of Tampa and St. Petersburg. And what we are starting to understand is what was left behind by those destructive winds, by the rain. You can see some of the pictures here. That's the roof or what's left of the roof on Tropicana Field, which is the home stadium of the Tampa Bay Rays Major League Baseball Team. That roof now in tatters. It was one of the only non-retractable roofs. Well, now it is open. And what's really important to note here is you see all those cots. This is the stadium that was prepped earlier in the week to be used as a base camp for emergency responders. Tampa's Fire Chief says the danger posed by Milton's winds now prompting officials to stop emergency services. As you just heard from Victor there in Orlando, similar in Tampa, they have to wait until it is, of course, safe for first responders to be back out there on the ground. And really the danger is on full display in St. Petersburg. Take a look at these pictures. That's a crane that came crashing down into a building, other parts of it ending up on the street. The wind, of course, one of the major threats of this storm. The hurricane itself spawned more than two dozen tornadoes, including on the east side of the state in St. Lucie County. The sheriff says there have been multiple fatalities after a tornado tore through a retirement community. CNN meteorologist Chad Myers is in the weather center with the very latest on the storm's movement. We talk about those tornadoes and the fact that they were popping up early on Chad, not where we were looking at the storm initially. That really, I think, had a lot of people sitting up and paying attention.",

      "sentences": "Absolutely. I mean typically when you look at a something spinning out of a hurricane, it's a water spout that comes on land. Those were not water spouts. Those were EF3s and maybe even an EF4 tornado that was on the ground out of a supercell thunderstorm just like you would see in the Great Plains.A very rare event and a tragic loss of life there in St. Lucie County. We'll have to look at that tomorrow of course because they're not releasing anything to us today. Venice, you had winds out of the west at 107. That pushed the water into your community. So did Punta Gorda, so did Fort Myers. There was a lot of flooding south of the landfall. Not north of the landfall because the wind was blowing the other way. That's St. Pete and St. Pete Beach over 100 miles per hour with gusts there. And on top of the Tropicana Field, I would suspect because the wind goes up with height in a hurricane, you might have been talking about gusts of 110 to 115. And think about why a plane flies because the top of the wing is farther around the bottom of the wing and it gets faster because of that little foil there. Well that's probably what happened with that too. So the wind's on top of that. Tropicana field likely exceeded 120 miles per hour. St. Petersburg, 18 inches of rain today alone. And then all the way over toward Lakeland, we still have the flash flood emergency going on there. The rain continues just to the east of Orlando as you saw with Victor. Look at this stripe of purple. Now there's no white in here. White would indicate more than 20 inches of rain. [03:05:02] But a large area here of greater than 10 inches over the entire state from east to west, all the way across the state, and it's still raining in some places, the rain will continue, so will the wind, but we've really kind of calmed things down right now. Here's the latest from the Hurricane Center. I haven't even seen it yet. 85 miles per hour updates every hour on the hour now because we're on land, not every three hours like it does when it's just out in the ocean. So we're down to 85. That's some good news. I haven't even seen a gust of 85 over anything, but it's not out of the question that still could happen today and into tonight. Now, by morning, by the time the sun comes up, the center of this storm is in the ocean. It's long gone. But the damage will have already been done. And the problem is at this point in time, we don't know how much damage that is. We don't know whether Casey Key Road down here in the Comas got overwashed and washed away homes. We don't have those pictures. It's still dark. Can't even get there. So it's going to take some time to truly realize what the damage that this storm did. And obviously the loss of life is the tragic part to me because of those tornadoes that no one expected. Yes, there was a tornado watch. And yes, there probably should have been an EF-1 or maybe even an EF-2 tornado, but not something that completely tears up a community. Erica.",

Let me head down to Tampa and our colleague Brian Todd, who's been watching that area. What are you seeing? Because at some point you're seeing a bit of calm, and then at other moments you're seeing fierce winds and rain. Give us an idea what you're seeing now, Brian.",

Well this city now collectively feels like it's just taking a barrage of punches from a heavyweight fighter and it's still trying to get up off the campus -- the  campus, excuse me. We're still getting a little bit of rain here, the rate is now tapering off.But I can tell you that the rain was hitting us pretty much steadily for, I think, close to 13 hours probably more and at its height was violent, it was relentless, and it was very dangerous and that part of it for several hours. We're finally getting maybe our first break in this as far as just the actual weather event that's hitting us. In a few hours, daylight will break and then the first responders will be out. They're already going to be starting to get out before daylight to try to get an assessment of the damage, try to get to where they need to go. Maybe conduct, if they have to conduct any water rescues or anything like that, they'll be starting to do that very soon. This has become obviously a power outage event. Roughly 400,000 customers here in Hillsborough County are without power. That has affected water usage. Water facilities, water processing facilities, treatment plants and other things, they have been suffering some power outages. They're working to get those back online, but in the meantime, they're asking residents to limit their water use for at least the next few hours while they work on that. You know, it's just, again, a deceptively dangerous period here. It's calm now. There's just a few sprinkles left. You'd think that it was just a normal rain event if you were just out on the street right now. But it's very deceptive. There's still a lot of ponding on the roads, these deep culverts of water that people try to drive through. That's when they get hurt and get stuck. So again, you know, just these are some of the most dangerous and deceptive periods of a major hurricane is when the brunt of it has passed you and people start to think that they can venture out. They really cannot do that. As a matter of fact, officials here in Hillsborough and nearby counties have been telling people in the shelters, hundreds of thousands of people in the shelters, to stay in the shelters for the next few hours. Don't go out yet until officials have a chance to fan out and get their assessments and get back to you as far as when you can get back to your home. So Victor, I know you're taking the brunt of it where you are, and I know how relentless that can be, because we just went through it. And these people here are just going to wake up in a few hours to try to embrace some of the reality of what's happened here.",

We know that there have been calls for flooding trees down at least one roof down as well, but not in. the sun comes up, will we get to see the real legacy of this storm for this part of the state and across all of Florida? Let's go to now my colleague Randi Kaye, who's in Sarasota, who saw what I'm feeling right now just a bit ago.

So certainly brace yourself for all of it because we've been through it here on the west coast of Florida. Here in Sarasota, we saw the heavy winds, the heavy rains throughout the day, certainly throughout the evening and into the overnight.[03:20:05] We saw, as you mentioned, a lot of the debris has been flying around here. This was a fence that was separating the property lines from where we are to the home next door, which is boarded up and evacuated. But this just started flying around during the heaviest winds that we've seen came apart. The entire fence just started blowing around here. And then there was this other little tarp that was sort of covering this patio there. Now that you can see is just all mangled there behind the fence. So we do know that here in this area we are getting some reports of flash flooding. We also know that the majority of customers in Sarasota County are without power. We've been without power now for several hours. We don't have any phone service either. So I would expect that a lot of the people here in this county are in the same boat that we are, whether or not they're home. To know that, we just don't know. It's unclear how many people evacuated. We won't really know that until daybreak and we get some light to survey the damage here. But there were certainly a lot of people who were concerned about what happened with Helene. They -- may have stayed behind and then they saw what happened with Helene so that they decided to evacuate this time around for Hurricane Milton. We're only, where I'm standing, we're only about 20 minutes or so, Victor, from Siesta Key where Hurricane Milton made landfall right near Siesta Key. So that's one of the barrier islands. We know that the bridge to those barrier islands was closed at 7 p.m. the night before the storm hit. So it's still again unclear according to the mayor of Sarasota, if everyone have evacuated. So, again, I think as soon as first responders can get into those areas and assess the damage, assess who may have been left behind, who may, people who may not have evacuated, we won't really know exactly what the toll is here in Sarasota County and in downtown Sarasota where we could see storm surge. They were expecting seven, or expecting nine to 13 feet of storm surge, so we won't know again until daylight. So right now we're just watching, waiting and hoping that it isn't too bad. Victor?",

Give us an idea of what you know about the damage from the storm and give us an idea of what it looks like there now. HOWARD TIPTON, LONGBOAT KEY, FLORIDA TOWN MANAGER (on the phone): Well good morning, we know that we had a top wind of around 110 miles an hour and we're still waiting to see the surge damage but we do know that the bridge that serves our southern entrance kind of off of the Ringling Causeway in the Saint Armand's and then over to Longboat that bridge was damaged and it unable to pass.

It's an older bridge. And it really wasn't deemed safe for the team to take their vehicles over the eastbound lane. And so treated and are going to be talking with the Florida Department of Transportation about that bridge but in the meantime looking to go up through Manatee County to see the Bradenton Beach access point and to see how that went. Otherwise we have no other reports from the island.

I mean, we have now the backside of the eye itself right over Orlando where it's been raining now for hours and hours and hours.But I know I was just watching some of those pictures out of St. Petersburg when it just looked like sheets of rain blowing across the streets at 85 or 90 miles per hour. St. Petersburg itself picked up a foot and a half of rain today alone. So yes, even for Lakeland, you picked up a lot of rain, flash flood emergency for you, which means flash flood is happening. And it's happening all the way off toward the east as well. There's the rain, here's our Victor Blackwell right there. Notice the backside of what was probably an expanding eye or maybe just an outer band, but that's now getting down to Victor. And if you were with us earlier, every time the rain comes by, the wind picks up. When the rain subsides, the wind subsides. Well, now there's more rain for Victor. Here is the rainfall, though, across the state. This is what has happened. It's a radar estimate, but it's close enough. Everywhere that's purple is more than 10 inches of rainfall. And it's OK if 10 inches falls in a small little town or in some place rural. But when you put this much rain in counties worth of property, there's no place for that water to run off. It is all going to just try to get into the lowest spots. That's why we think that there's probably going to be so many flooded roads by morning that you probably shouldn't be going out at night because it's very hard to see those flooded roads. Just looks like some water or maybe a wet road, but it's not. It's feet of water out there. Now the storm is pretty much done for the most part. It is going to get into the ocean, into the Atlantic Ocean in the next two or three hours. We'll still have another two to three inches of rainfall still to come for some folks, but for the most part we're kind of winding this down. The water is coming back into Tampa Bay and I know we talked about how Tampa could get this big surge. That didn't happen because landfall was down here, well south. So what happened all day is that the wind was blowing out of Tampa Bay, not into Tampa Bay. The water was blowing into Fort Myers, into Naples, into Punta Gorda. Those are the places in Venice, those are the places that flooded, those are the places that had surge. There's still a chance that we could get a hurricane force wind gust later on tonight, but look how quickly this gets into the ocean and sayonara, get out of here. We're pretty much tired with this because we've had wind gusts well in excess of a hundred miles per hour in a large swath. Not just one swath, but I mean to go from Venice to Sarasota. It's going to take you at least an hour and a half to probably drive that even without traffic. So that's how wide of an area had so much wind, so much wind damage, 2.8 million or so people without power. It's going to be weeks before everybody gets power because you've got 2.8 million people to get recovery, to get recovered. I mean it's just, that's a long duration. And we have so many crews in North Carolina and South Carolina trying to put power lines back up there.",

I think we had like 23 foot surge in this town and my house was only about a foot from having water in it, my mother-in-law's house. And so we were just not that nervous about staying for this one knowing that it was going to be far enough south and we were getting the lighter side of the storm that was going to be pulling the water out as opposed to pushing it in. Winds we weren't too concerned about. It's more the storm surge and kind of stuff that you got to worry about right here.",

I mean I would imagine you have a little bit of that too having to deal with so many storms in such a short period of time, what is it like as this is coming at you again, even if it was further south this time, but knowing what you just went through two weeks ago, knowing what happened a year ago, it's a lot to weigh on you?CARL (on the phone): It really was, yeah. It's a lot to lay on anybody in this town. We're all kind of starting to suffer emotionally from it. It's -- it's hitting really hard every time somebody hears of another system or you know, they heard that this one was coming. It was people were starting to break down.",

Yeah it's getting scary how fast and how big these things are becoming and how unpredictable they're becoming, I mean, you've got the cone but you see them wobbling a lot more now and it's just getting harder to trust the trust the spaghetti models in the past.",

On the topic of power outages, we've been checking with local authorities here and utility companies, an additional 10,000 customers lost power in just the last few minutes. So those numbers we're expecting to continue to grow as the winds pick up here. And there've been a report to those trees down.Let's check back in now with Randi Kaye who's in Sarasota. Randi, I understand that you are in a moment of calm, at least you were last time we checked in. Hopefully those roads are still clear because authorities do not want people out checking on the damage. What are you seeing around here?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, exactly. Victor, the roads are still pretty quiet here. We have seen just a couple of emergency vehicles, but the neighborhood that we're in is pretty dark and pretty quiet. But one reason why they don't want people out is something like this.We were here earlier and this is a piece of -- this is a fan blade. There was a ceiling fan up on the patio, up on the deck right above me that came flying off during the storm. So that's one of the reasons why you have to, you have to evacuate and you have to be careful where you go during the storm. This is some of the fence that was separating our yard where we are from the neighbor's yard and this fence just blew apart during the storm and some of it was airborne. So they were very concerned about projectiles and pieces of furniture and fencing and other items becoming projectiles and harming people. So that's why people were told to evacuate. I do want to just mention Siesta Key where we are about 20 minutes or so from Siesta Key. That is the barrier island off Sarasota where Hurricane Milton made landfall just nearby that. And I wanted to share the story of this woman who we met just before the storm came through. She said that her husband had ridden out Helene on Siesta Key just a couple of weeks ago and they had been watching the weather like a lot of people do as you know Victor. They watch it, they think that okay it's not going to get us and they stayed -- he stayed put, she evacuated, and he ended up with five feet of water. He was chest deep in water. He had to swim in the dark of night to another house where he could get to higher ground and then had to swim back to their house. The house was completely destroyed. All of their, there's mold all over, so they're going to have to gut that house. But there was, all of their belongings were destroyed. So when you think about Milton coming across Siesta Key and making landfall right near Siesta Key, I just think about what if everybody hadn't evacuated there? And we just don't know. And I had asked the mayor if everybody had evacuated from those barrier islands, and she wasn't able to say for sure. So that's a big question because if this storm was worse than Helene at that barrier island, and we heard that story from that woman about her husband at Siesta Key, you can only imagine what those people might have gone through, Victor.",
