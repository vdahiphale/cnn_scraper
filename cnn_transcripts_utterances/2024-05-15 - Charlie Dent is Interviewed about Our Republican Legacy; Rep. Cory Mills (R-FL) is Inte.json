They write, \"millions of Republicans are struggling with the question of how to vote in November. Not content with the choices offered by either party, they find themselves at a loss as to how to proceed. Some are considering staying home, writing in a name of their own choosing, or voting for a man they don't really want to see in the White House.\"Those lawmakers are now launching a new group that they're calling Our Republican Legacy. They're trying to say that it's a home for voters who think that the modern Republican Party has abandoned the values that were once held dear by the party. They say it's the Constitution, union, fiscal responsibility, free enterprise, peace through strength. Principles that, I mean, do you hear Donald Trump talking about them? We tried to figure that out. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RONALD REAGAN, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: American prestige and power have been restored. We've dampened aggression and promoted peace. And we've come to an even greater realization of how much our renewed military strength has meant to all of us. DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This is genius. Putin declares a big portion of the Ukraine - of Ukraine. Putin declares it as independent. Oh, that's wonderful. GEORGE W. BUSH, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: Just as important as maintaining free markets within countries is maintaining the free movement of goods and services between countries.",

Congressman, very grateful to have you. Thank you for being here. So, I have to say, you are not the first group of people to come out and try to do something like this. We have seen efforts all the way along since Donald Trump was elected, since before Donald Trump was elected, honestly. Why is this any different? Because the reality is, there haven't been - there isn't a track record of success. CHARLIE DENT (R), FORMER U.S. CONGRESSMAN AND SENIOR ADVISER, OUR REPUBLICAN LEGACY: Well, we're - we're - we've created this, Our Republican Legacy, for a few reasons. One, we think there needs to be a strong alternative argument or alternative narrative to the MAGA movement. That's what this is about, Kasie. You just laid out those five principles that we believe very strongly in and that have sustained this party from Abraham Lincoln, to Theodore Roosevelt, to Dwight Eisenhower, to Reagan, the Bushs and forward until MAGA. And so we think it's imperative that we give Republican voters, many of whom are very dispirited and dissatisfied. [06:35:01] In fact, you're seeing it - Nikki Haley is getting about 20 percent of the vote and she's not even running.

MATT GORMAN, FORMER SENIOR ADVISER TO TIM SCOTT'S PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN: I mean, yes. I would say a couple of things. We just had a competitive primary. I don't understand what, you know, where was this before when we were actually having this robust debate about this. I worked for Tim Scott. I was a part of it. Also, like, look, I - I respect Senator - Senators Danforth, Simpson, Cohen, obviously Congressman Dent. Look, the fact is the youngest senator who signed that, I think, was 83-years-old, and they left office when I was in second grade. The - it's just not in touch with where the actual Republican Party is at. It's been getting more populist. And look, we played a clip of George W. Bush. Senator Danforth has been a persistent critic of George W. Bush. He started in 2005. Was a critic throughout his second term. And the fact is also, look, I agree with many of the points you made, I do, but the tough part is, and I think where you saw Bush fail, and certainly what Danforth criticized, was that peace through strength and fiscal discipline can be at odds oftentimes. And I think that - the reason there was such high deficits during the Bush years was because we promoted that agenda, obviously rightly or wrong with Iraq and others. So, look, I think in the long - the long and short of it is, the party was getting populist for a long time. I think like a lot of things, Trump didn't necessarily transform the party. All he did was speed up a lot of change that were happening already.",

But looking last night at a couple of the results, Nebraska, my home state, interesting results in Sarpy County and Douglas County. The reason this matters is, Nebraska two. That is where the one congressional primary where the one electoral vote could go to Joe Biden as it did four years ago. Nikki Haley got about a quarter of the vote there. So that is the challenge here for the MAGA movement, if you will, the Trump align candidate lost that congressional primary to Don Bacon significantly by 25 points.So, I think, going forward, there's no doubt the Republican Party is going through identity crisis, I guess, to be charitable, but not sure that a group like this is going to change things in the short-term.
