You know, whether Telegram was complicit in fraud, in money laundering, and in child sexual abuse material trafficking, drug trafficking and I think the key point here is what you mentioned at the end of your intro there, whether Telegram was willing to hand over information and documents related to that investigation. It sounds like up until this point, Telegram has not agreed to do that and that is why we now see CEO, Pavel Durov in police custody and this really gets at the heart of this debate that is happening across the social media ecosystem: How do you balance free speech with protecting users and avoiding illegal activity happening on your platforms? Telegram has certainly fallen much more strongly in the camp of free speech. This is an encrypted app, which means that the platform itself doesn't have a lot of control or oversight in terms of how people are using the platform and law enforcement also doesn't have a lot of oversight in terms of the kinds of conversations that are happening here. Durov has sort of become this champion of free speech, and so you can understand why, given the fact that he said he is focused on protecting the privacy of his users, he wouldn't want to hand over its user data.",

Hezbollah then launched hundreds of rockets and drones towards Israel in response to the killing of a top commander by Israel last month. Both sides are declaring victory and for the moment it appears, wider conflicts have been averted. Jim Sciutto is in Tel Aviv this evening. Good evening, Jim. Thanks for staying up late.

Yesterday, we had an enormous exchange of fire along the border, but then it stopped and Israel clearly had intelligence prior to the launching of the bulk of this attack and was able to take it out, take out the firing positions, preemptively, and then Hezbollah launched what appeared to be a smaller attack than planned and then somewhat declared victory and said, that is our response for now. It could have been much, much worse had Hezbollah managed to launch those many hundreds of rockets and missiles as Israel said it was planning, had some of those struck civilian targets. You can imagine what the Israeli response might be. So you had some calibration by both sides and by the way, Israel, keeping its attacks to the southern part of Lebanon, there have been concern about it expanding up to and around Beirut, perhaps. That's a precipice we were quite close to, but didn't fall into, and I think we shouldn't underestimate the importance of that and also just how close the region got without tripping into the abyss as it were.",

I will say Richard, there is another element to this is that Israel with US help seems to have effectively neutralize may be too strong a word, but reduced the effectiveness of Hezbollah's ability to fire with all those missiles and rockets and it did similar in April when Iran fired a number of missiles and drones, a large number of missiles and drones at Israel, that you have exposed some -- I don't know if vulnerability is the right word, or at least the limits of each's ability to attack Israel. That's not to say they couldn't attempt something bigger, perhaps overwhelm Israel's defenses.

And so, I have confidence that they've, you know, thoroughly done everything that they can to make sure that this thing happens safely. But, you know, it's exciting. I have to say that I am for commercial space. I am for missions like this, because it's kind of a natural progression. The government funds these big programs, figures out the technology, figures out how to do it, and then the commercial side comes over and starts, you know, building off of that. So, all in all, I think this is a great thing and I wish those guys great success.",

From Boeing's point of view, having this piece of junk attached to the ISS that won't -- that they can't get back, or at least they'll have to deadhead it back.

You walk into this huge airlock, which vents the vacuum in a matter of seconds and then you float outside and you're listening to your heartbeat and your own breathing. None of that is true. It takes hours to get everything together and prepared and to get into your suit, go through all the checks. It takes a while to go down to vacuum. The airlock is very small, because you want to lose the smallest amount of gas you can. You got to make it up or you've got to pump it, you know, in and out. And then when you're outside, it's -- or when you turn the suit on, it's very noisy. There's a loud fan blowing oxygen over your face, which is a good noise, but it's -- you cannot hear your heart for anything. And you also -- interestingly, in the American suit, the pressure inside is so low you can't whistle, so you're not listening to your own breathing or anything like that. And -- but the impression, I think, is what you're getting at. Once you go outside that view of space through the helmet visor, you get your peripheral vision involved and it's spectacular.

You know, you can't see the stars out on that part of the orbit. And so, yes, it's -- it makes you think about a lot of things and also, you're very much aware of the risk. You're at a very much higher risk level when you're out there. And I -- I'm in a state of all six of my space walks, I was in a state of what I call hyper awareness. I was very aware of where my tethers were, making sure I was always attached to the station, you know, just knowing where all my equipment was and I wasn't going to get things tangled up in my legs or anything like that.

But we, we have to bear it. Remember that there's risk, real risk. I don't just mean theoretical risk.
