In a statement, a national security council spokesperson saying the following, quote, \"the president is a strong supporter of a two-state solution and has been throughout his career.? It goes on to say, \"he believes a Palestinian state should be realized through direct negotiations between the parties, not through unilateral recognition.\"Of course, the president has said that he supports a two-state solution. He said so last weekend during his address at Morehouse College, saying - or calling it, quote, the only solution where two people live in peace, security, and dignity. We heard from senior administration officials over the last several weeks and days who say that they are working toward this, and what this would look like post-conflict. And that is all underway. But what is clear through this statement is that it's not going to happen simply through recognition, but rather that it is - involves direct negotiations, diplomatic negotiations, and that is something that the administration is currently engaged on.

Look at that. More than 100 people were hurt. One passenger died. You can see just the debris everywhere in there.This happened ten hours in to a 13-hour flight from London to Singapore. The pilot declared a medical emergency, diverted the flight to Bangkok. The NTSB is now joining the investigation. With us now, CNN aviation and aerospace analysts Miles O'Brien. Miles, always great to see you. This much turbulence, to cause so much damage, you know, how does it happen? MILES O'BRIEN, CNN AVIATION ANALYST: Well, we're talking about what we think in this case is clear air turbulence, John, which literally comes out of the blue and is something that an aircraft cannot detect, air traffic control cannot detect, weather forecasters cannot predict. And there are rivers of air up there, we call them jet streams, traveling along at hundreds of miles of hour sometimes. And it's a bit like a layer cake. And sometimes the direction of those layers changes dramatically. And as an aircraft encounters that, it can suddenly change the amount of lift that the wing receives, and that causes that abrupt change. It's not getting as much lift as it got very suddenly. Now, this trend is actually getting worse. There's a study from the University of Reading which shows that over the north Atlantic, over the past 50 years, severe air turbulence events and the time which they have occurred have increased 55 percent. And that has a lot to do with a changing climate.",

And one of the best ways that pilots can get information is from other people who have been in the air. O'BRIEN: Yes, pilot reports. And - which is fine if you have somebody going ahead of you and they see it and anticipate it. That helps. But if you're the first flight in, or the first aircraft in, that's not going to help you, of course. And, of course, it's a dynamic thing, which changes and can worsen very suddenly. So, a lot of it is just those reports. Clearly, there are other kinds of turbulence associated with big cumulus clouds and thunderstorms, which pilots and weather radar, et cetera, can see and avoid. But there is this category of turbulence which remains invisible and we really don't have technology to detect it.",

The lawmakers, they've been calling for these Americans to be released for some time now, arguing that these group - the group of Americans, rather, all unknown to each other, did not know that they had ammunition in their luggage when they traveled to the country. The Americans, they are facing a minimum of 12 years in prison for bringing ammunition into the country. Here now is Virginia Republican Congressman Bob Good on the message that he said he delivered to officials. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. BOB GOOD (R-VA): We're appealing to the good nature of the Turks and Caicos officials that, hey, this is the unintended consequence. But if they - if they were to continue to allow Americans to suffer as if they had criminal intent, to be treated like they were bringing, you know, multiple machine guns and full magazines and things like that with - if they're going to treat them that way, then we would have to advise and ask our own State Department to issue a travel advisory about going to Turks and Caicos, which would have a tremendous negative impact on their tourism dollars.

About what we see four years later is a - the advancement of AI, easy to use tools like ChatGPT, but many others where you can just input a little bit of audio, a little bit - a little bit of video, or just one picture of someone, and then it can replicate that and mimic it very easily. My colleagues and I recently reported last week that in 2020 U.S.intelligence found evidence that Iran and China had experimented, explored with - with deep deepfake technology to use on U.S. voters, but they never did. Four years later, that technology is a lot easier to use. It's more advanced. And it's going to, according to U.S. officials, perhaps really accentuate the disinformation out there. The main concern is amplification, John, not really any - anything magical or think that we're not seeing out there on the internet right now.
