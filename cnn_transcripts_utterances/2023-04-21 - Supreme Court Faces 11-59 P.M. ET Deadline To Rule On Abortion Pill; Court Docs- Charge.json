Up to ten weeks of pregnancy, the ability for women to get it through the mail after consulting with medical personnel rather than have to pick it up in person, and the availability also of a generic. Those are things that lower courts had lifted. And if the Justices do not grant the Biden Administration request, those restrictions will go into place at 11So, grant or deny or do something in between, and the Biden Administration says if the Justices try to get fancy with some regulations and not other regulations, they'll just be creating havoc across the country for, not just this abortion medication, but for all FDA approval of existing and new drugs.

That had to do with the gun, modifications to the gun that Alec Bobbin was holding on the set of \"Rust.\" Meaning, that potentially those modifications could mean that the gun might have fired a bullet without Alec pulling the trigger. The same thing that Alec Baldwin has maintained in interviews to me and ABC News.

You've done something wrong, so egregious or there is something so exculpatorious to say, no one ought to ever bring this case. So they're leaving themselves of a window.It might be a bit of a saving of the face. Remember the process here, you had one prosecutor who stepped down, another one who stepped down, two now special prosecutors who are in this place who've now said, something has come to light to show us that we cannot bring this case or follow this timeline. I think the notion of culpability, though, is use of words, not guilt, but culpability. There are still civil suits that are happening. He settled one with the widow and the son. There is one ongoing, I believe, with the sister and mother of the cinematographer for loss of consortium, meaning loss of opportunities to bond or spend time with or love in the presence of somebody. And so, there is a combination of those things. The word choice here is so important. But can you imagine a jury having this case one day and seeing the different iterations of the prosecutorial frontier and saying, well, now this is a winner, something has changed. And to the point that Chloe made, remember, if a gun was modified in some way, it might explain why the armorer has not yet had her cases and her charges yet dismissed. That is the person on the set whose job it is to ensure that what is handed to the actor or whoever is going to handle the weapon, that it's safe, secure, and according to the guidelines. If there's a modification, then that will be very interesting. But remember, he was also focused on because he was a producer. And so --",

What are you doing, if anything, to try to get them to stay? GOV. MIKE DEWINE (R-OH): Well, Jake, what we're doing to try to get them to stay is to give them all the facts that we have. We continue to test just last week. For example, there was a concern expressed by some farmers, they're growing a crop. One farmer, we went out to his field, he was growing, you know, winter wheat, which is now starting to really grow, and we took samples of that. And we're going to get that evidence back. We're going to continue to test the water. We're going to continue to test the soil. We're going to continue to test the air. So I think those are positive things that we can do. It's interesting, I was listening to at least part of your report, and I had a meeting in the governor's residence in Columbus just several days ago with the CEO, Alan Shaw, and one of the things that I said to him is that if people sell their house and they do not get what that house was worth before the train wreck, I think you owe them the difference.

It's a new record, many of them directly targeting the nearly 2 million transgender people in the U.S. at a time when one in four trans adults say they've been physically attacked, according to a Washington Post survey.In the last few weeks, Idaho's governor signed a bill restricting transgender students from using school bathrooms that align with their gender identities.

Tennessee faces a lawsuit to block its transgender health care ban. And in Montana, the Republican led legislature passed amendments to enact barring children from receiving access to health care such as puberty blockers. Before that bill passed, the Montana House, however, the state's first openly transgender legislator, Zooey Zephyr, criticized it and the legislators voting for it on the House floor.
