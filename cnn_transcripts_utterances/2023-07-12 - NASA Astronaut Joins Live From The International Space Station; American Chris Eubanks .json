But also, the development of the procedures and the ground team coordination in getting all the systems and equipment ready. And then we do maintenance on board on the suits to get them ready. So, really, it takes a long process just to get to that morning of the EVA.Nowadays, when you get up in the morning for an EVA you start about normal time, but then you work continuously for the first six hours or so before you even get out the door to start your spacewalk. It takes that long to get your body adjusted and get the suits configured and everything ready to go so that you can go out and execute the plan. And then, obviously, the coordination during the spacewalk is just beautiful choreography, actually. It's amazing to see the whole process and the huge team that comes together to get spacewalks done. And that's one reason you don't do it very often. PAMELA BROWN, CNN ANCHOR:  You have had such a fascinating career. You were a submariner. You're an astronaut. So you've been -- you've gone to the depths of the ocean. Here you are in space. I'm wondering what your views are on climate change given your perspective, right? I mean, the weather from space -- it might look beautiful but, of course, we can't say the same here. I mean, we've been talking about this all morning long. We've had catastrophic flooding. We've had extreme heat. Wildfires in Canada. What perspective do you have from up there on the impacts of climate change and how we as citizens of the planet should respond to this challenge?",

The impact that everything that we do has on the planet.And that dynamic sense I think is really what we're coming to grips with as we look out, whether it be in the ocean -- and during my time in submarines we were looking at -- so the northern reaches and Arctic and Arctic ice. And now, even during our increment, looking at the wildfires in Canada. That was impressive to see. As we flew over Ohio, the Great Lakes, New York, up over New England you could see the smoke as it layered over New York and D.C. You can see that dividing line actually, which is interesting, where -- I think it was a low-pressure system with the rain and New England was kind of keeping the wildfires south of them -- that smoke south of them.

On the line, a shot at the semi-finals on tennis' grandest stage.The 27-year-old Eubanks, who was toiling in tennis' minor leagues with some degree of obscurity only months ago, stunned fans by beating world number five Stefanos Tsitsipas on Monday. That win guaranteed him $439,000 of prize money, raising his career total more than 20 percent. Now he faces world number three Daniil Medvedev.

      "sentences": "Yes, thanks for having me again, guys.I think you can because I remember -- and I was much younger when I reached my first quarter-finals at the French Open in 1982. I was only 17 years old. But I think that's irrelevant. You are heading into the unknown so you always get the question weren't you nervous? No, not at all early on because I don't know what happens if you -- if you win or lose in such a big stage. So I think for Chris Eubanks -- I think it's the same thing. I think he's just playing another top player. And also, the style of game. I mean, he's in control of the points most of the time because he serves -- he has a very hard serve. He's six-foot-seven. Hits the ball hard from the baseline and he comes to the net. So he asks his opponent a lot of questions but he also has a lot of answers but then he makes unforced errors -- but he is in control. So I think he's sailing way. He's not going to space but he is -- he's a very, very tricky opponent. Now, Daniil Medvedev is so consistent. Here you have a player who doesn't make mistakes. He's won a Grand Slam at the U.S. Open. He runs better than most players. But he hasn't had great success on a grass court so there is no advantage for him there. In fact, Eubanks, with nine matches in a row, might actually feel like he has an advantage because he's got more grass-court tennis. But very difficult to pick, to be honest.",

We have some other Ukrainian women that have struggled with it and can't really compartmentalize the two, but she has. And Iga Swiatek -- you have to put that in there, too. She's done so much relief work for the Ukrainian people that emotionally, this match was nearly uncomfortable to watch. And then you realized that no, these two are pros and they are just playing tennis right now. So it's a Cinderella story and she can go far. She can go further.

Thank you for making time for us. I know how busy you are. So, first, I want to ask you about this exchange at the NATO public forum that you had with a Ukrainian activist. It was a tense exchange and this activist was really questioning the decision by NATO, including the U.S., not to allow Ukraine into NATO right now until after the war is over and the different reforms that the U.S. wants to see from Ukraine.

That sounds like kind of bureaucratic but what it fundamentally means is that Ukraine has a plan that it has authored for the steps that it needs to take, including in security sector reform, including in democratic reform, including in anti-corruption. So that's all detailed in an existing Annual National Program that was referenced in the communique. Now, that program gets updated. And what the communique says is thatNATO and Ukraine will work together on a set of priority reforms to put a special emphasis on moving quickly in certain areas to improve the resilience of Ukraine's democracy.

That is an inescapable fact.Now, you ask a fair question. So do we have to wait until a certain time or day relative to the war? Do certain conditions on the ground have to obtain? We didn't put a mechanical formula down because war is dynamic. The situation is dynamic. And NATO needs to be able to retain the flexibility working closely with Ukraine on its pathway to make a determination about when down the road it makes sense to admit them. And in the meantime, we're not just sitting around. We are providing an unbelievable amount of weaponry and military assistance to Ukraine. And today, the G7, led by President Biden, will stand up with President Zelenskyy to announce we're prepared to provide that security assistance long out into the future and certainly for the duration of the period while Ukraine is working its way on the pathway towards NATO.",
