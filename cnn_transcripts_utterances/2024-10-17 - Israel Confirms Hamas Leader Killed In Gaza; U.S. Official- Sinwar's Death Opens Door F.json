Hamas leader, Yahya Sinwar, the mastermind behind the horrific October 7 attacks that killed over 1,200 people in Israel, including 46 Americans, Hamas kidnapping more than 250 people, and as a result, brought an IDF counterattack, unleashing pain and suffering and death to his fellow Palestinians. That man, Yahya Sinwar has been killed. Israel's defense forces say he was killed during a routine military operation near a building in Gaza.The IDF moments ago, releasing this remarkable drone video, which they say shows last moments inside a building in Rafah. The video shows Sinwar sitting in a chair holding an object that Sinwar then throws at the drone. Let's get straight to CNN's Nic Robertson and senior White House Correspondent Kayla Tausche, who is traveling with President Biden in Berlin, Germany. And Nic, we heard from Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu earlier today, he called this a heavy blow to Hamas. He said there's still more work to be -- to do. So what lies ahead?",

And also, I think when he said there's more work to do, that was a message to the Israeli people, you know that there's -- there is cause for celebration, but it's not all done yet. And I think there was also a message there as well to the region, where he talked about essentially going after this sort of access, Iran, without saying it in as many words. So I think you get the impression there that really, unless Hamas, despite the pressure and the wishes of the United States, that this could be an off ramp, a diplomatic off ramp, that he still feels that there is more military work to be done against Hamas, even though they cannot really fire a volley of missiles, that they're disorganized on the ground that just lost their leader. He's indicating that unless they hand over the hostages, then they're also going to be chased down as well.So I think this is still a work in progress, and I think that's very much the, you know, the view from the care from the prime minister's cabinet, that they have the upper hand here. And this is not -- this is the time to execute on all the things they want to do.",

I mean, there are a few issues at play here, but the President, you heard him this evening say that now is the time to move on to end this war. And in a call with Prime Minister Netanyahu, he expressed just as much. And when I spoke to U.S. officials after that call took place, they expressed some of that optimism that at least, unlike in previous conversations, President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu appeared to have more common ground on next steps and the end game, at least as it pertains to Gaza. They point to the language in the readout that the prime minister's office put forward when he says both leaders agreed that there's an opportunity to advance the release of hostages, and that they would work together to achieve that objective.Now that being said, sources also acknowledge that that is one front in this war, and that the retaliation against Iran still looms large, and that that is still expected, perhaps as soon as in the coming days. And so while there is this cautious optimism that perhaps there is now a new, renewed goal toward that hostage and ceasefire deal, which Netanyahu did not use the word ceasefire in his statement, there is also the acknowledgement that there are two other fronts in this war in both Iran and Lebanon, and those have their own unique challenges, too, Jake.",

They've lost all of their top leaders. Netanyahu says at least 20,000 of their fighters have been killed or captured. Gaza is in shambles. Countless numbers of innocent Palestinians have been killed, wounded or don't have homes to sleep in. Obviously, October 7 was a -- it was horrible for Israel, and then, even worse for Gaza.

His son Sagui joined American- Israeli citizen was kidnapped by Hamas on October 7 is believed to still be alive in Gaza. Jonathan, what's your reaction to learning that the man who allegedly planned these horrific attacks in which your son was kidnapped has been killed? JONATHAN DEKEL-CHEN, FATHER OF ISRAELI-AMERICAN HOSTAGE: Well, in a most basic level, I believe, like most right minded people that justice has been served, that this man deserved the end that he got. That's the easy part of the answer. The second is -- the second part of the answer is that -- on the one hand, this might create opportunities. It's a new day in the Middle East. It's a new day for the world, certainly in our little corner of the Middle East, so that can be used, I would hope, to create a better future, both for the hostages Israel and the Palestinians. The fear, of course, is that it won't roll out that way, that Hamas fighters, upon hearing of the death of their leader, will take out their frustrations or their panic on the hostages, or on the other hand, Israel's leaders will not use this moment to use all means possible to get the hostages home and thereby secure all of our war goals. Rather, they'll use it as a kind of justification for more military action and justifying somehow a forever war in our region.",

I assume that you share that concern.DEKEL-CHEN: I think it's a real possibility. You know, it -- look, the -- it's pretty clear that the death of Sinwar was not a planned action in the field. Rather, it's something that happened in the fog of war, and I certainly will shed no tears because of his death. But it creates, again, both opportunities with wise leadership, not just from Israel, but from Israel's allies and from the mediators and so on to create the conditions in which, if not as an organization, then individual Hamas terrorists will choose the root of life and not death. But given that, over the course of the last couple of months there have been at least 12 hostages that we know of that were executed by their Hamas captors. It certainly creates a great deal of fear. And if we didn't need a reminder of the urgency of getting them home, the death of Sinwar today is absolutely a reinforcement of that.",

So, as late as this morning, we had a call with the State Department. I believe we'll be having another call tomorrow with senior State Department -- I'm sorry, with senior administration officials. As far as Israel is concerned, it was a kind of -- I got a kind of pro forma call this morning from someone in the Defense Department who handles hostage affairs. So, that's where we're at right now.

I hope they all get home soon. We turn now to Congressman Jim Himes, Democrat of Connecticut, Ranking Member of the House Select Committee on Intelligence. Congressman, good to see you. What does the killing of Yahya Sinwar mean for the region? How will it potentially change Israel's actions in Gaza and everything else in the war? REP. JIM HIMES (D-CT), RANKING MEMBER, INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE: Well, Jake and thanks for having me. You know, it obviously satisfies in every decent soul, the yearning for justice for such a monster who visited such a horrible, horrible thing on the state of Israel on October 7. And more than that, of course, I think while there have been any number of obstacles to a negotiated solution, a ceasefire for release of hostages, there was probably nobody higher on that list than Yahya Sinwar. So, it opens the possibility that maybe Hamas will say they can get anybody, they have decimated us. That Hezbollah will say the Israelis have done a pretty good job at decimating us. Maybe the Iranians will say we're not winning this, and in fact, we're being militarily humiliated. Maybe, just maybe, they say, let's take a different path. Sadly, I fear that Sinwar's ethic of fighting until the very last Palestinian is not unique to him. So I think there's a lot of soul searching that has to happen in Iran and amongst the remaining leadership of Hezbollah and Hamas about what's really best for their people.",

You know, the leadership of Hezbollah and of Hamas and a lot of the sort of senior commanders in Iran are no longer with us. And so again, it's sort of a fork in the road for Iran and its clients, which is, do you keep want -- do you want to keep doing this because you're not winning? And the problem is, of course, that, you know, there is a strain of thought, which is, it's OK to lose so long as we do it gloriously, and that's the kind of thinking, of course, that will lead to more carnage.So yes, I do think it's an opportunity, but it's going to take whatever leadership remains, and primarily in Iran. But also the Israeli leadership, seizing this moment to say, look, we've really demonstrated what we can do militarily, let's see if we can bring this to a close, not just by solving the military problem, but also by putting forward a vision, a vision of what could be for the Palestinians, should they choose to no longer support Hamas, to, you know, for the people no longer support Hezbollah.

It matters to the perception of the State of Israel around the world, which is important.So you know, again, I think any right thinking person with moral sensibility is not really mourning Yahya Sinwar.

Yousef defected from Hamas. He worked undercover for Israel for 10 years and he now lives in the U.S. He's the author of the book \"From Hamas to America.\" You might remember that I spoke with him last year from Israel after the October 7th attacks. Welcome, it's good to see you again, sir. From your perspective, how will the death of Yahya Sinwar affect Hamas?MOSAB HASSAN YOUSEF, FMR. UNDERCOVER AGENT FOR ISRAEL'S INTERNATIONAL SECURITY SERVICE SHIN BET: Well first of all, Hamas is in real trouble. Their infrastructure has been destroyed. Their last place is Rafah. And the operation in Rafah had been delayed. And this what actually lengthened the lifespan of Hamas. Hamas is in real trouble. Their leader Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated. Their military chief, Mohammed Deif, was assassinated. Today, Yahya Sinwar is killed. And the -- all these people have orchestrated, planned, executed a genocide against the Jewish people on October 7th. But worse than this, they used civilians as human shields. They weaponized children and women to achieve their political gain, for -- for their financial gain, to delegitimize Israel and to legitimize their violent cause. So today, the death of Sinwar is a -- is a reality that is showing that violence is a dead end. So, no matter how the Palestinians will try to sacrifice children for political and financial gain, which is not a new practice by the way. This practice is a 70-year-old practice inspired by the Iranian Ayatollah, when he sent thousands of Iranian children to sweep mine fields, to sweep minefields with their bare bodies. This evil practice must stop and the world -- the world unfortunately instead of prosecuting such criminals, they have rewarded them with legitimacy. They have rewarded them financially. And this is why they came stronger and stronger every time. This is not the first war in Gaza, Jake.",

Obviously that was horrific and barbaric. But also it was not a surprise that the IDF would respond militarily.And so in a way they also did what they did to -- what's going on in Gaza is Hamas, Hamas' responsibility in many ways. Obviously Netanyahu has been and Yoav Gallant have been in charge of what the IDF is doing technically. But obviously there was going to be a response and I guess my question is, with so many leaders of Hamas now dead with 20,000 Hamas fighters according to Netanyahu, killed. With so many innocent Palestinians killed, wounded, made homeless, et cetera, why doesn't Hamas surrender? Like what -- what is the thinking continuing to fight, continuing to wreak havoc or invite the havoc wreaked on their own people? It just -- help us understand the mindset of Hamas leaders.",

And, you know, to -- to your point a -- a -- about sort of what this 100 years has been, you know, he used to always say that his childhood really was defined of course bef, you know, an hour before daylight, before the civil rights movement in the old days of the south.
