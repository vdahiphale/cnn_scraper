I'm Fareed Zakaria coming to you from Davos, Switzerland.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ZAKARIA (voice-over): Today on the program, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. His nation's fight was part of practically every discussion in Davos this week. And I had a conversation with the man himself about the state of war and the potential for peace. We'll also bring you my conversations with other world leaders at Davos. First, Sanna Marin, the prime minister of Finland. Her nation shares an 830-mile long border with Russia and is waiting to be granted NATO membership. Then, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the prime minister of Greece. A nation once seen as the sick man of Europe. The current state of Greece's economy may well surprise you. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

But it did raise in my mind, and of course, it must have raised in your mind the question of your own safety. Do you feel that there are still ongoing active threats that are increasing? Do you worry about your own security every day?ZELENSKYY (through translator): No, I'm not worried about that. Just to add, with your permission, you said accident. I'd like to tell you that because of the war experience that I have now, society has now, this is not an accident, because it has been due to war. And the war has many dimensions, not just on the battlefield. There are no accidents at wartime. These are all war results, absolutely. All those steps, everything happening, missiles striking our civilians, our kids being killed in kindergartens, at schools, every intermedial, every death is a result of the war. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

He's settling in for a long haul, and he is essentially destroying cities, civilian areas, targeting power stations. What do you need, what does Ukraine need to respond to that kind of warfare?ZELENSKYY (through translator): We have to protect our weaknesses together with -- we have to protect points where the enemy is hitting. Air defense system is our weakness. Compared to other countries maybe this is not a weakness comparatively, but Iranian drones are hitting us. And not even dozens. Now Russia is getting ready to use another package. I don't know how many days or weeks or months they want to prolong this, but we can fight this back, absolutely. We know how much it will take to do it. We know and our partners know the energy infrastructure of our country and all the places where Russia can hit to get the blackout they're looking forward to. And this is one of the main things when we're talking about energy infrastructure because this is linked to potable water, to electricity, to other utilities. The livelihood of our cities depend on this, and we have to make sure that people stay in the cities, because this is about jobs, about taxes. We have to protect them economically to make sure that the business is operating in the meantime. And we do need this financial assistance with this as well. We need to financial cushion. We have to move forward in the battlefield, as well. And for that, we need specific type of equipment, artillery systems, and we have to provide for the shells that we lack right now. We are not inventing some kind of deficit which doesn't exist. And we are not urging to do something urgently out of the blue. This is not the COVID-19 beginning, when everyone was looking for the vaccine. The vaccine against Russian tyranny, against their weapons is available. There is a list of the countries who have it. There is a specific list of what our needs are. If you want to help, do so without a dialogue, just help us.",

I wanted to know the U.S. intelligence community's perspective on where the war is now and where it's headed. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) AVRIL HAINES, U.S. DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE: The way we would say it, it is not a stalemate, but really a grinding conflict at this stage, where quite literally we're talking about hundreds of meters being fought over in the context of the frontlines. But I think from our perspective, both militaries obviously have challenges. It will be extremely important for Ukraine to receive essentially military assistance and economic assistance moving forward in order for them to be able to continue to manage what they have been heroically doing, and on the Russian side, we see also significant challenges, ammunition, morale, exhaustion, some dysfunction in the leadership, and so on, things that are I think making it more difficult for the Russian military as well.",

I am ultimately extremely confident. And I'm extremely confident first and foremost because of the magnificent, magnificent job Ukraine is doing. And as President Zelenskyy very crucially pointed out, supplying Ukraine with the money it needs to win the war is ultimately in our own self-interest.So I'm a finance minister, and if you were to say to me, what is the one thing that G7 finance ministers, G7 governments this year could do that's actually in our power, right? We don't control COVID. We don't control global supply chains. We don't control whether there will be immaculate disinflation or not. One thing where we have some real practical levers is we can help Ukraine win clearly, definitively. And if we do that, if that happens this year, you know as well as I do, Fareed, that would be a huge boost to the global economy.",

After that, the war in Europe, and now Europe is in the middle of an energy crisis because of Putin's war in Ukraine.The world today is a very different place than it was three years ago. And right now, the war is not only concerning Ukraine but actually the whole world. The rule-based order is being challenged more and more.

We are fully prepared to become NATO members, and there shouldn't be any obstacles on the way. Of course, we are still waiting for two countries to ratify.Hungary has said that they will ratify as soon as their parliamentarian period will start, hopefully very soon. Turkey, that's another matter. And we have discussed and agreed in NATO's member summit about the steps that we will take, and we have been taking those steps. And now we are waiting for Turkey to ratify. I don't see that there should be any problems, and I have also personally talked with President Erdogan, and he has said what he has said also in public, that Finland isn't -- that there isn't that big of issues with Finland, maybe some with Sweden. But for our perspective, it's very important that Finland and Sweden are going into NATO together, because we are sharing the same security environment.

And if I look at the image of Greece today and I compare it to three years ago when I was, again, at Davos pitching my story at the time, at the beginning of our term, then I sensed interest but also skepticism. Now, we have the facts to support the argument that we have, indeed, turned the corner.
