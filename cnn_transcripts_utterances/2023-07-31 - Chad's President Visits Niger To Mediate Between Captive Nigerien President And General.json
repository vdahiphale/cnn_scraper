The president of Chad travelled Tunisia earlier meeting with his counterpart in the army, as well as the general who led the revolt in an effort to mediate a deal. Meanwhile, ECOWAS, the Economic Community of West African States gave the country's current leaders a one-week deadline to reinstate the president threatening to use force if that doesn't happen.

And they see the former government that President Mohamed Bazoum as that that enabled the continued influence of France and the countries. Called France a freak that influenced the France has on its former colonies and in Francophone Africa, so to speak. And many of these people are tired of international meddling in their situation. They want all foreign militaries out of the country. The French have about 1500 troops in the nation. The U.S. has about 1000 troops involved in counterterrorism operations, and they don't want any of them there. They were even critical of the Economic Community of West African States, ECOWAS, that has given the military junta there one week. They either instead President Bazoum or they will use force. They've done that before once in the Gambia. And that was effective. So, the people on the street though, seem to support the military. Listen to this one man.

So, it's not only important because it's a pathway for -- the likes of ISIS and al Qaeda who've been largely pushed back into the ground in a lot of places. It's a -- it's a place for them to operate and perhaps get a bigger foothold. Just a decade or so ago, I was meeting in Niger with U.S. officials who were running counterterrorism and border operations. And since then, that airstrip in Agadez in the north of Niger has been built. So you have on the one hand, those important security interests there, but as you say, it's what's inside the ground. And we know that Russia has been growing its interest in Africa through Yevgeny Prigozhin, the Wagner Mercenary boss and his interests.

You have people on the streets in the army and the capital saying we would rather have Russia, we think that the French interests here, the U.S. interests in terms of counterterrorism have just been too slow. They're flat footed. And they say -- and this is the Prigozhin cell that Russia can do this counterterrorism stuff much, much more effectively. So, what does progress there look like? As you say, it depends on the prism you come from.

Well, as Russia voices what it calls serious concern over the coup in Neger that Nic and I have just been discussing. It also says it is intensifying its attacks on Ukraine. This comes in response to alleged drone strikes in Moscow. Now the Kremlin says three drones were intercepted on Sunday but in a business area in the west of the Russian capital was hit and furious.

Now one of the witnesses, Natalia Balaba (ph) from her apartment block near where one of these missiles landed described how her husband was knocked off her feet and how a child was basically safe because they were in the bathroom. And indeed, another missile landing near a polytechnic for economic and technological studies where another witness described how there was nobody in the building where the missile landed, but they simply didn't have time even to respond. This startling, frankly, because it appears to be an escalation by Russia to hit civilian areas. Kryvyi Rih as you said, Volodymyr Zelenskyy's, the president of Ukraine's hometown, a vast, sprawling industrial town quite far at this point since the front lines have changed away from the fighting. But clearly a place that Russia today wanted to inflict damage upon. Now it's important to point out now when we talk about Ukrainian, it seems Ukrainian drone attacks on areas like you showed the video there Moscow city in the Russian capital, that pales into insignificance compared to the daily damage being done to Ukraine by often indiscriminate, blatantly vicious Russian missile strikes. But the images that emerged from Moscow city and upscale class towered financial district, a sign really of the opulence that Russia has tried to maintain on the global stage over the past decade. That being hit by Ukrainian drones that frankly, a year ago you wouldn't even thought could possibly get through Russian air defenses. That is indeed a deep psychological blow. And one, I'm sure that the Kremlin feel they have to respond to in some way. Despite the fact strangely today, their spokesperson Dmitry Peskov calling those drones attacks and act of desperation. But we are here in the south Zaporizhzhia where Ukraine continues to push forward in its counteroffensive, some slow and at times reverse progress, particularly to the east of these front lines. But the tempo of this war certainly rising at this moment as Russia feels itself potentially, in his motherland more under attack. Volodymyr Zelenskyy said yesterday that the war is gradually returning to Russia. But it is quite clear that we will continue to see this blatant bid by Russia to impact a civilian toll on Ukraine regardless of how they're faring on the battlefield here.",

That's now of course at the key that at the center of this of this case of this prosecution against the former president who face an additional three more charges in that superseding indictment that was unsealed.

We just don't know howclose it's going to get, how long it's expected to stall out because it is expected to stall out once it gets a little closer. And then it's expected to head to the north. So, depending on how close it is to the coastline, and when it makes that turn to the North will make all the difference in how many impacts or how big the impacts will be felt along the China coast. So right now, the remnants of Doksuri is headed to the north. So the bulk of the rainfall has wrapped up for places around Beijing. Now most of the moisture is well to the north, but we had 200, 300, 350 millimeters of rain in just about a 48-hour times frame. And a lot of these areas received about a month's worth of rain and just that short amount of time. So the result of that are the swollen rivers, we saw a lot of the debris of floating around the rivers, the cars, small homes or shacks pushing down the river. And so, very dangerous scenario that unfolded here around Beijing with all of this rainfall coming out once. So the forecast accumulation over the next five days takes the bulk of the rain across northern China, around Beijing, we're looking at about 25 to 40 additional millimeters of rain. So really not a whole lot of moisture left with this, the bulk of it will be to the north. But the one that you're talking about, the second one right here with winds 200 -- 50 -- 15 rather, kilometers per hour. Gusts of 260. It's moving to the northwest right now at 15 kilometers per hour. It is going to cross over Okinawa, impact the southern islands of Japan. It is going to weaken a little bit as it heads to the west. But you can see by this cone of uncertainty, there is a lot of uncertainty with the storm. So we're really not sure how long it is going to sit here just off the coast. If it decides to stall out sooner rather than later, you're going to have bigger impacts across the southern islands of Japan. If it decides to stall out a little closer to the coast then you're going to have bigger impacts for China. So, it all depends on when that stalling takes place and when it decides to head to the north. So here are your forecast wind gusts. This is Friday, 3:30 local time, and you can see the strongest gusts still staying offshore, but we still could pick up some pretty significant winds on the coast and then this particular forecast model has it shifting to the north, just offshore. But like I said before, still a little too early to tell. We'll be watching this closely throughout the week.",

So, imagine the board approving this compensation package during that time, like he was not really performing as the greatest CEO or as even as the CEO we know him as today. But the board is stacked with his cousin, people who are close to Elon, they don't question his actions. And I think shareholders -- large shareholders see that Elon basically owned the board.
