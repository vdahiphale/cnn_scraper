I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. The prospect of any rapid ceasefire between Israel and Hamas seems to be dwindling. Israel is not attending talks in Cairo. Hamas says it can't meet Israel's demand for a list of hostages, saying that it doesn't know the fate or location of many of them. Here's U S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken with the Qatari Prime Minister, a key mediator, in Washington earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  And here, we have an opportunity for an immediate ceasefire that can bring hostages home, that can dramatically increase the amount of humanitarian assistance getting into Palestinians who so desperate need it, and can also set the conditions for an enduring resolution. And it is on Hamas to make decisions about whether it is prepared to engage in that ceasefire. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Our government has only five factions, and we wanted to have an advance payment for the Palestinian factions to come together in a unified position so that all Palestinians will be part of a deal after and tomorrow.

There are certain prerequisites for Hamas and other political factions to be part of the Palestinian political arena, and these sorts of prerequisites are still being under discussion. There will be a follow-up meeting after Moscow. Our president today is in Turkey discussing with the Turkish president and others in order for us to really reach a consensus. And as you rightly said, and you quoted me correctly in my resignation, because simply we wanted a government to be in charge of all Palestinian territories. The problem is there are certain questions that has no answers yet. One is how long Israel is going to stay occupied in Gaza, and the other, what sort of Hamas we will have in the day after. By all means, the Palestinians, they need to be united. And that a situation in which the new emerging reality need to be looked at in order for us to really face the challenges that are ahead of us. Remember one thing, the challenges are very serious. We will have a very serious situation, 13,000 to 15,000 orphans, 281,000 housing units destroyed, 30,000 Palestinians have been killed. 70,000 have been injured, total destruction of infrastructure.

That comes from the Gaza Health Ministry. And it does seem to dovetail with the Israeli figures as well, because Israel claims to have killed some 10,000 Hamas fighters, and the Palestinian Authority there -- or rather the health authorities, say that 70-odd percent of the killed are women and children. So, those are roughly the same kind of figures from both Israel and the Palestinian health authority. But what I want to ask you is this. To react to \"The Wall Street Journal\" report from last week, which says that the Hamas leader, who Israel blames for October 7th, Yahya Sinwar, his goal is for, \"Hamas to emerge from the rubble of Gaza after the war, declare a historic victory by outlasting Israel's firepower, and claim the leadership of the Palestinian national cause.\" Do you think that that's a viable possibility?",

You know, what Israel has achieved until now is only a total destruction of Gaza. Israel did not release the hostages. Israel did not do this and that, the goals that they have set for themselves. One thing that Israel has achieved, total destruction of Gaza. According to satellite images that we have seen through the World Bank, European Union, United Nations, 45 percent of Gaza has been destroyed. And as you rightly said, 30,000 Palestinians, 75 percent of them are women and children. That's not what I am saying, that is what the United Nations is saying, that is what secretary of defense of the United States has said to the Congress. So, the issue is not about that Israel has killed tens of thousands of Hamas activists. Those who are the victims are innocent people, the victims are women and children, and those who have been put to starve. This is a real genocide that Israel is committing in Gaza. So, for whatever the Hamas statement is going to say, what we have seen there is a total destruction, and still Israel is trying to force transfer our people out of Rafah. 1.4 million people have been squeezed into a little tiny geography that is called Rafah. That is the real issue, regardless of what the statements from this person or that. My main concern today is that there has to be an immediate cease fire. This killing should stop.",

And I just want to ask you, again, according to \"The Wall Street Journal,\" people who have been meeting Hamas leadership in Doha, they basically report a message that Yahya Sinwar sent to that meeting saying that Hamas fighters were ready for an expected Israeli assault on Rafah and that \"high civilian casualties would add to the worldwide pressure on Israel to stop the war.\" This is an incredibly cynical and cruel view from people who claim the moral leadership of the Palestinian cause. You have said your cause is in danger. So, I'm trying to figure out what happens. How do you think about the day after who will be the leadership? How does -- how do you discuss that?

Remember one thing again, you repeated this question every now and then. And let me answer you for once and for all. We are democratic people. We want elections and we want Israel not to veto our elections, because Israel wanted us to have elections in one part of Palestine without Jerusalem, and we said, no way we are going to surrender Jerusalem as the future capital of the State of Israel.

After 1,200 Israelis were killed and 240 were kidnapped, over 30,000 people killed in Gaza, a large proportion of them, women and children. We know all this and we've just been discussing it. We've also talked about the aid agencies, which are warning of extreme child malnutrition. As you can see here in these pictures, the reality is devastating. While UNICEF reports that over 1,000 children have had one or both legs amputated. Meantime, inside Israel, the wounds of October 7th have not healed. And over 100 hostages are still held inside Gaza. And this week, after a visit to Israel and the West Bank, a U.N. team reported \"convincing information that hostages have been sexually assaulted.\" They also found reasonable grounds to believe that sexual violence was committed during the Hamas attack. And they heard \"concerns raised over cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment of Palestinians in detention, including sexual violence.\" So, what does each side know of the other's deep wounds and ongoing trauma. How does coverage differ in Arab and Israeli media? Oren Persico is an Israeli journalist for the investigative magazine, \"The Seventh Eye,\" and Dalia Hatuqa is an independent Palestinian journalist.

We didn't know that it would lead to the death of -- or the killing of 30,000 Palestinians and some of the other statistics that you mentioned earlier. The thing that we need to understand is that Palestinians are not a monolith. Some have praised what's happening -- what happened, some have condemned it, some were somewhere in between. It's hard to paint every Palestinian with broad brush strokes. But if you look at how the media portrayed it, almost all have said to varying degrees that October 7th was a result of decades of siege on the Gaza Strip, the home demolitions, the confiscation of land in occupied East Jerusalem, the rising death toll in the West Bank, and rampant Israeli settler violence. Some media outlets, especially the ones affiliated with Fatah, the ruling party in the West Bank, took a more neutral tone, expressing the need for achieving peace and social justice to everyone living in the area from the river to the sea.

But as the United States gets more and more polarized, the number of swing voters diminishes. People just don't want to switch teams. And so, what becomes much more important, winning elections, is trying to capture the vote of what I call ambivalent voters. And these are the people who have mixed feelings about voting. The big question for them isn't so much, which candidate do they support, but why should they bother voting at all? And there are millions of them. So, on average, since 1920, 42 percent of the American electorate has decided not to vote. And even in 2020, when we had a historic turnout rate, we still had more than 100 million Americans who didn't cast ballots. So, there's a huge audience of potential voters that these campaigns can fight for.",

Sometimes, you know,people are less likely to vote if they have to stand in line for the polls for an hour to be able to cast their vote. Voting is not -- our election days are not held on a Sunday. It's not a national holiday. So, really, we're asking people to take time off their work, to make a serious investment to cast a ballot. And for a lot of ambivalent voters that just doesn't feel worth it unless two things happen. And one of them is that there's a really big difference between the candidates. And the other is that there's significantly anxiety-provoking or just stabilizing events happening on the national or international scene. So, we're talking about when America enters a war or when there's a significant change in the economy, like a recession, or when the pandemic happens. Then when the choices are really clear and the stakes of not voting feel really significant, then these ambivalent voters decide, OK, it's worth it for me to go and invest the time and cast a ballot this year.",

So, on the one hand, we do have this high candidate contrast. We do have a very anxiety-provoking national international scene right now. But there's this other factor that affects ambivalent voters a lot, which is that when they don't like their choices, they don't act. Basically, if they don't like what's being served for dinner, they're not going to come to the table. And right now, more than half of Americans are expressing unfavorable poll ratings for both Biden and Trump. And so, that's something that could really end up affecting the vote. And the other change that's happened since the last election when we had a historic turnout is that during that election, there were a lot of, sort of, temporary measures taken for the pandemic that made voting a lot easier. There were drop boxes for ballots. There was extended early voting. There was no excuse necessary to get a mail-in ballot. I even spoke to somebody in Texas who had drive-through voting, but these are mostly temporary measures. And since then, early voting has actually been curtailed in a lot of swing states, it might be harder to vote this year than it was before the pandemic in 2016.",

There was a poll by 538 that found that the people who never or rarely vote were much more likely to have had to stand in line to vote for more than an hour in the past.

It's definitely saying, neither of you got me excited. Now, there is one factor here that could be shifting things a lot, which is that there's some indications that have come out in the past couple of years, that these ambivalent voters and independent voters may be driven not just by things like the economy and their personal feelings about candidates. That a significant number of these voters may be actually strongly issue-driven. And we saw that in the last midterms when Democrats did a lot better than expected. And the reason why was because the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. And there were a lot of voters who were concerned about the future of their medical care for reproductive issues. So, abortion, miscarriages, IVF, these sorts of things. And so, we are already seeing this kind of shape the way the candidates do their messaging. So, ambivalent voters are not going to be responding very strongly to positive messages about the candidates. You know, Joe is a great guy, don't love the Donald. Those messages aren't going to have a big effect with them. However, messages about you might be losing something that you care about, something that you feel strongly about is in danger, messages that provoke fear and anxiety are more likely to get people to come out and vote despite their feelings about the individual candidates.

There were -- you know, Biden won the state by about 20,000 votes, and there were more than 150,000 registered Latinos. And precincts that had more than 50 percent of their registered voters in that precinct were Latinos were more than four times as likely to go for Biden than for Trump.

So, it's true that they turn out less, but for Biden in 2020, almost half of the people who voted -- who reported voting for him were under the age of 50. He got 60 percent of the youth vote. Whereas Hillary Clinton before had only gotten 55 percent of the vote. But things aren't looking so good for him this time around.
