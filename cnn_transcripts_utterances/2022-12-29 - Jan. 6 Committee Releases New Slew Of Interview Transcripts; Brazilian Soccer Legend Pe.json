      "sentences": "Good afternoon. I'm Sarah Sidner, in for Victor Blackwell. Welcome to CNN NEWSROOM.The January 6 committee just released yet another big batch of witness interview transcripts from their investigation into the Capitol insurrection. The new list includes interviews with 19 witnesses including the former president's son Donald Trump Jr., Kimberly Guilfoyle, Trump's attorney, Christina Bobb, and former Trump adviser Stephen Miller. It also contains conversations with people involved in the state-level effort to overturn the 2020 election like Doug Mastriano. CNN's Paul Reid is joining me now. You are going through this. I know it's a lot. There are hundreds of different people with you know, many, many, many pages of transcripts. What has stood out to you so far?",

      "sentences": "Well, fortunately, we have the support of a big team that's combing over these. And, Sara, right now, I want to start with some of the revelations in the transcript from Donald Trump Jr. Specifically, the transcript reveals new details about text messages that the former president's son exchanged with then-White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows. Now, we've reported on some of these text messages, we're getting new details and new contexts.For example, they dive into a text message that Donald Trump Jr. sent on January 6 to Meadows where he says that his father, the then- president needs to \"condemn this expletive.\" And he's encouraging Meadows to press his father to condemn the violence on Capitol Hill. Now, the committee pressed him and said, well, why didn't you reach out to your father yourself? Why are you going through Mark Meadows? He said, well, my father doesn't text and that he believed it was -- he could not reach out to him. So, he was going to reach out to Meadows to do this on his behalf. Now, it's really interesting, Sara, to see Donald Trump Jr. asking his father to condemn the violence on January 6 because if you go back two months to November 5, there were other text messages that he was actually sending to Mark Meadows outland -- outlining strategies, sharing ideas for how his father could remain in power. And what's interesting, is in these text messages, he's basically outlining a strategy that is nearly identical to the one that was ultimately adopted by his father and his allies as they attempted to undermine the certification of the Electoral College over the next two months. Now, what's also interesting here is that Donald Trump Jr. says he doesn't remember where these ideas came from and who sent him the strategy. He was just passing along the idea that he said, seemed the most well-laid out. Also, notable that Mark Meadows throughout these transcripts over the past week or so, as we've been looking through these, Sara, Mark Meadows is at the center of so many of the most interesting and notable moments in everything that's been laid out. You know, here, you have him being the one receiving these ideas, receiving these outlines, also being the one that people are trying to communicate to the president through, also, in the past few days questions about him burning paper in his office helping people get pardons. So many questions for the former White House Chief of Staff out of these transcripts.",

Energy infrastructure was heavily damaged. Here, you can see crews battling a fire at the energy site in Kharkiv. Power is out in several regions. The Ukrainian military said they intercepted and shut down 54 of the 69 Russian cruise missiles. CNN's senior international correspondent Ben Wedeman is live in Kyiv at the scene where one of those missiles landed. I think you're now back in the bureau there in Kyiv, Ben.

Now, we went to one residential area where there was really widespread destruction. There, a 14-year-old girl has injured as well as her mother and a man nearby. Now, the crews were quickly cleaning up the area. They're accustomed to that sort of thing.Then we went to another house where some debris had caused a large crater right next to their home. Half of the house was completely destroyed, windows shattered, walls had collapsed. But the two men who live inside and the elderly father and his adult son escaped only with scratches. But more than scratches happened to elsewhere. In Kharkiv, if two people were killed. In the Donetsk region, another person was killed. Now, here in Kyiv, 40 percent of the city is without electricity. The mayor has called upon people to stock up on water and charge their cell phones. In the city of Kharkiv, four missiles got through the air defenses and hit critical energy infrastructure. And in the western city of Lviv, 90 percent of that city is without electricity. And this is what President Zelenskyy predicted several days ago that the Russians would try during this holiday period to once again knock out the country's energy infrastructure, Sara.",

First to you about the impact of Pele, everyone knows his name, even if you're not a sports fan. He is an icon in his own right.CHRIS WITTYNGHAM, SPORTS ANALYST &amp; COMMENTATOR (voiceover): No question. I think when you look at the history of the sport in this country, I think you look at for example, in the United States, he comes to play for the New York Cosmos in the mid-1970s. And as a result, his name almost become synonymous with this sport because it was not terribly popular for several years. If you said the word soccer or even the word football, you would just sort of say Pele, that was the first name. And you would say in a variety of ways, right? Because him being from Brazil was sort of sedative right, Pele, Pele, Pele, and so you hear this sort of wide variety of his notoriety within the game. And he is sort of the first name that comes up to many, many generations of Americans. And obviously, the world over is known as being someone who is so influential in this sport and has, you know, championed the sport in Brazil and around the world. A three-time World Cup winner remains the only three-time World Cup winner. We just celebrated Lionel Messi for winning one. I think Pele kind of got left behind a little bit in the greatest of all-time discussion because he's won three. Just because he did it in black and white television doesn't mean that he is not one of the greatest figures in the history of this game.",

You talked about him winning three World Cups.One of the stories that I -- that I had heard about him, and that always struck me was that during 1967, there were factions that were fighting a civil war in Nigeria. And this is the power of Pele. They agree -- the two sides fighting agreed to a ceasefire so that he could play an exhibition match in Nigeria. [14:15:02] It just goes to show you the power this man had to bring -- almost to bring people together. He literally stopped the fighting so that he could -- so that he could just come and play and give people relief. Do you have any stories that you particularly like to remember about Pele?",

You talk to people who are agnostic to soccer in the United States, and even they, for a brief moment in time, in the mid-1970s, when he played the New York Cosmos. And like you say, it's just sort of his ability to present that impact, almost no matter where he is. Because it's very easy to suggest global celebrity now, right?I mean, we have social media, we have all these abilities to sort of translate celebrity. But I think when you look at where the globe was back then, you win World Cup in 1958 and again in 1962. And in 1958, arrived to the Brazil squad as a 17-year-old and lit up that World Cup and scored a goal in the final against Sweden. And he, from there, becomes this one word that is synonymous with sport, and like you say, almost with diplomacy in a weird way. He can go to any single place in the world and stop traffic and stop what was going on. I remember growing up and hearing this man's name, and it was like, you know, it was vaunted. It was laudable. It was something that was synonymous with something that we don't even -- we can't even access because it came from a different time. And yes, to me, the way that he came to the United States and changed the way that American youth soccer was just sort of incredible, and I think laid some of the groundwork for what we see today with Major League Soccer, with a lot of the way that the sport has grown. I think that period in the 1970s when a lot of big soccer stars headlined by Pele came over was a huge part of it.",

He made that famous and you now see players doing it as well, but the -- but incredible athlete and person.And I do just want to end here with what his name really is.
