      "sentences": "Hello, thanks so much for joining me. I'm Alex Marquardt in today for Fredricka Whitfield.We begin at the U.S. southern border where officials say they are seeing fewer migrants crossing than expected despite the end of Title 42. Authorities say that the long lines of people who once-waited to enter the U.S. have dissipated at many border crossings. Many had expected a surge after the COVID-era policy, Title 42 expired at midnight on Thursday. In its place, the Biden administration has reenacted tougher border policies which require longer processing times and impose severe consequences for those who cross illegally. The White House has sent thousands of asylum officers, Secret Service agents and even U.S. troops to reinforce screening efforts and to mitigate the already challenging humanitarian crisis. CNN's Polo Sandoval is in El Paso, Texas. Polo, you're on the ground. What are you seeing?",

      "sentences": "Alex, well, it certainly has been less chaotic the last 48 hours since the lifting of Title 42. That being said, there is an expectation among Customs and Border Protection that this break could perhaps be short-term. That's according to reporting from our colleague Priscilla Alvarez. It says that when you look at a recently filed court filing, there's a Senior CBP official that projects that in the coming days or weeks perhaps, we could see a number of average encounters go from about 9000, which is what we're currently seeing, to as many as 14,000.That would certainly be a noticeable increase. But nonetheless, just to be clear, it is not what we're seeing at this particular points. What we are seeing, though, is an opportunity for DHS officials to basically play catch up here, to process the close to 23,000 people that are still in CBP custody. These are people that still have to have their credible fear hearing. And that's why those are continuing throughout the weekend to make room for any potential increase that we might see of some of the people on the Mexican side. Here, though, at the border, you see the border wall behind me. Again, things are very quiet right now. So I think what we're going to see is some of the focus shift to some American cities like Denver, Chicago, Washington, D.C. where you at, and certainly New York City, where I've been covering this for the last year, where many of the people that cross here don't stay here. They get on planes, they get on buses, and they make their way to American cities. So there's certainly concern among elected officials in Washington, D.C. about what these people will be able to do to potentially step out of the shadow, secure work authorization, if that's even possible, amid the backlogs and the bureaucracies. So really, that's sort of the state of play right now in terms of what we're seeing post Title 42, Alex.",

But the criticism has really come from both ends of the political spectrum. Even within the President's own Democratic Party. There are some who believe that the administration is insufficiently prepared for the ending of Title 42, while others are frustrated, saying that some of the policies are a bit too harsh. And then from Republican, they have really been trying to seize on this moment. It's pointing out a political vulnerability for the President. One congressman, Congressman Pete Sessions of Texas, compared this situation to the chaotic situation that played out during the withdrawal from Afghanistan. The White House very forcefully pushed back on that idea. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

One of those is down in the state of Florida, where a federal judge temporarily blocked a plan for the release of migrants from CBP custody without court dates.That is a tool that has been used in the past to try to alleviate crowding concerns in some of these facilities. That program is now -- or that plan, I should say, is now on hold for 14 days. But the Biden administration has requested a stay in that matter, so we will see how that winds its way through the courts. There is another lawsuit that was filed by ACLU which really challenges the asylum rule that would prevent migrants who are traveling through other countries from seeking asylum him in the United States. That is also a matter that has to make its way through the courts. Now, the White House has specifically responded to that ruling from the federal judge down in Florida, saying that Republican officials are trying to sabotage the administration's efforts to deal with Title 42. But it's certainly a very challenging few weeks ahead for this administration as they are trying to get a handle of this situation.",

Mexico, I think, is doing whatever it can with its resources managing hundreds of thousands of migrants. The solution, as I think Mexico has always said and Secretary Mayorkas has been saying, quite rightly so, is a structural reform in the U.S. The U.S. needs to reform its immigration laws. Its immigration institutions has to improve its capacity to decide or to accept asylum seekers or not to have legal pathways for people that can come or want to come to work. Because we need to remember that the U.S. is an enormous need of migrant workers or labor to fill thousands of posts here. But while the U.S. does not do that, for Mexico just to impossible to solve it, so we are helping. I think Mexico is helping as much as it can. I think President Lopez Obrador is helping the U.S. as much as can to enormous political, let's say, challenges faced in Mexico by him. This is very complex. The U.S. needs to put, to act together, particularly legislatively speaking.",

They're being promised by coyotes and smugglers that they can still get into the United States. Do you believe that the U.S. is failing to get out the message to these migrants about new U.S. policies?GOMEZ-CAMACHO: Listen, I think the U.S. is doing the best it can to send this message. Mexico is doing the same. But when you are facing human need, human aspirations, fear, in many cases, it's very difficult to listen. And then you have to compete, if you like. These messages have to compete with lots of unscrupulous people that are out there, smuggling people, criminals that are lying to them and manipulating them. So it's very easy to manipulate fear, it's very easy to manipulate people when they have this enormous, enormous needs. So I think that what is needed, this will not be corrected, Alex, unfortunately, just by messaging. This will only happen, this will be fixed when it is actually fixed in the system itself. When both the U.S. of course Mexico has to improve, no doubt can put together rules, institutions capacity to really channel people properly. What is very real is that and this is global, it's not only the U.S.-Mexico border, people are moving for different reasons, legitimately or credibly or not that's another story. But they are moving. And let me just add something that many people don't know. Mexico is the largest corridor of migrants in the world. Hundreds of thousands of people, is very difficult just to stop by messaging.

He has called the bill a, \"disaster.\" And as of a few moments ago, as you mentioned there, surrounded at a veto rally by doctors, by abortion rights supporters. He stamped onto the bill a veto, officially vetoing that bill.Now, under the current state law, abortion is legal there in North Carolina up to 20 weeks of pregnancy. But if Senate Bill 20 survives, and it can, because the General Assembly can vote to override the Governor's veto. Well, it will ban abortions, nearly all abortions, after 12 weeks, by placing a series of duties on doctors, abortion clinics, and women seeking the procedure. So take a close look right here where we break down what this bill would do. It would ban doctors from, again, performing surgical abortions after 12 twelve weeks of pregnancy, with some exceptions. It would require in-person examinations by doctors for medical abortions. It will prohibit people within North Carolina from mailing drugs to pregnant women. And it will mandate doctors to confirm a probable gestational age, making sure that the fetus is no more than ten weeks before signing off on a medical abortion. Here's what else the Governor had to say about the veto and the bill. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) GOV. ROY COOPER, (D) CAROLINA: Therefore, I veto this bill. (CHEERING &amp; APPLAUSE)",

Not whatever the Russians may wish to sail their proxies in the east of the country in occupied territory about whether or not these were Storm Shadow missiles. The Ukrainians have cruise missiles of their own, their own homemade ones, or home produced.They've also got longer range missiles, all capable of hitting Luhansk. As they have in the past. It's not often that that city gets hit, but it does get hit. It has been hit in the past, and we've seen longer range attacks deep inside Crimea in particular, where airfields and other locations have been attacked there, in particular even shipping. So the Ukrainians have the capability. I think more broadly, this will start to be considered part of the shaping operations ahead of a much- vaunted summer offensive. But the other day, as you recall, Alex, President Zelenskyy said that the conditions weren't quite right yet for the Ukrainians to launch their summer offensive. And they're very keen to keep their enemy guessing and indeed perhaps even their allies about where and when that offensive will be launched. But clearly with the addition of Storm Shadow to their armory, they are getting more and more of the longer range, more strategic weaponry that they say they've been needing for some time. And just in the last 24 hours, they've got nearly 3 billion euro more of German funding, in particular in the form of antiaircraft tanks and other equipment that will help them secure their skies and significant additional supplies of ammunition. All of which really being a significant boost to the morale, I think, of the Ukrainians ahead of this planned summer offensive. Alex.",

      "sentences": "Pope Francis is meeting with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy is important because since the beginning of the war, Francis has tried to position himself as a mediator for peace. Just two weeks ago, returning from Hungary, the Pope said that the Vatican has a peace process underway. He didn't give any further details on that, and authorities in Kyiv and Moscow immediately said they were not aware of this plan.But the Vatican has insisted that they are, and so presumably that has been one of the focal points between the Pope and President Zelenskyy. The problem, of course, with the Vatican peace plan is that while the Pope and President Zelenskyy have a relatively good relationship, this is the first time they're meeting face to face since the beginning of the war. But they have had several phone conversations since the beginning of the war. The same cannot be said for Francis' relationship with Vladimir Putin. He has not had any direct contact with the Russian President since the beginning of the war. So Francis has tried via the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kiril, who is a strong supporter of President Putin and the war. But that dialogue as well has stalled, although there was some sign of hope earlier in May when Patriarch Kiril sent the equivalent of his foreign minister for the Russian Orthodox Church to the Vatican to briefly greet Pope Francis. Nonetheless, the meeting with President Zelenskyy for Pope Francis, I think there is no expectation on the Pope's part that there will be some kind of immediate result from this meeting. However, it is a sign of the Pope's willingness to be available as a mediator and to try to offer, as it were, a safe space at the Vatican for dialogue. And certainly implicit in that is the hope that eventually, however remote it may seem at the moment, Russia will also want to join that conversation. Delia Gallagher, CNN, Rome. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And we offer our congratulations to all of the Bison's graduating today.Ana Navarro, I want to come back to you. Black voters were obviously key to President Biden being elected in 2020, and polls have shown that his support among young black Americans has softened. How worrying is that or should that be for the president's reelection prospects?",

As, you know, the speeches, the commencement speeches that a president and vice president gives are (technical difficulty) and are curated and are picked. And this is a reason for that.",

They just don't carry the same positive name ID in the Republican Party as DeSantis. He's the only one in double digits. I think Trump thinks that he could go ahead and dispatch DeSantis now. None of these other people are ever going to be able to rise up and consolidate the anti-Trump lane of the party, or at least the people who want to do something else. Maybe they don't dislike Trump, but maybe they think we need a new nominee.So dispatching DeSantis before he ever really gets out of the gate, which he is working very diligently on, obviously, is priority one for Trump. And there's some evidence that it's working at the moment. But I wouldn't count out DeSantis. There's a lot of runway left in the race.",

Remote work has really hurt some of these stores in downtowns because you have fewer people heading to the offices and then shopping during the day or after work.Online shopping in Amazon have also taken a big bite out of sales at these stores. Fewer people shopping in-person. And then these cities have some of the highest retail rents in the country. San Francisco, about double the national average. Also higher rents in New York City, Chicago, and then, as you mentioned, CVS, not just closing in cities, but across the country, 900 stores over the next three years.
