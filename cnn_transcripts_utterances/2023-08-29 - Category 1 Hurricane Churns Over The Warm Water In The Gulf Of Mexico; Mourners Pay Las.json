Welcome to One World. The number one killer in all these storms is water. That's the warning from the top official of the Federal Emergency Management Agency as Hurricane Idalia barrels towards Florida. The Category 1 hurricane is expected to rapidly intensify as it churns over the warm water in the Gulf of Mexico. Forecasters predict it will make landfall Wednesday, north of Tampa. FEMA says the massive storm surge and torrential rain could be more lethal than the strong winds. At least 22 Florida counties have issued evacuation orders. And it appears many Floridians have heeded that warning. They're stocking up on essential supplies, clearing out store shelves. Well, Idalia is already lashing parts of Western Cuba with heavy rain and strong winds and thousands have been evacuated. We are covering this from all angles for you. Our Senior Meteorologist, Brandon Miller, is standing by for us in Atlanta. But I want to start with Patrick Oppman, who joins us live from Havana, Cuba. And Patrick, we've already seen the inundation of water in Cuba, the flooded streets. And this was when this storm cell was just a tropical storm and tens of thousands of people had to be evacuated. Just take us through what you've been seeing.",

And even though it did not make a direct hit on Cuba and was a tropical storm in that category, one hasn't passed by this island, it still caused a lot of heartache for people. There's flooding across much of western Cuba. We know that tens of thousands of people are without power right now. The government is working on trying to restore their power. The cell phone signal -- the only cellphone company there is here are government cell phone company, has been going in and out all day. So, it's really has created a lot of disruption, even if it was not as bad as it could have been. At this point though, we know of at least 8000 people that were evacuated. Those are the numbers we got late last night. And much of the western part of this island is without power. So, that'll probably take several days for them to restore. And of course now, Idali is heading into the warmer waters off of Cuba, heading towards Florida and that is of course the issue. Those warmer waters are the fuel for hurricanes and it is expected to pick up even more power as it heads to Florida and it certainly will cause even greater damage there.",

The U.N. on Monday saidMoscow was promising to continue providing what it called comprehensive assistance in Mali. It's currently estimated that about 1000 Wagner mercenaries are in the West African nation, aiding the military junta there as the Kremlin seeks to amplify its influence in the world. We're also seeing rare footage out of Russia of American detainee Paul Whelan. Take a look at this footage we got in. You can see him wearing a Russian prison uniform. The White House says Whelan is being wrongfully detained, held on bogus espionage charges since 2018. This video is shot by Russian state media back in May as a chance for Whelan's family to see him on video for the first time in three years. Returning to Ukraine now, where the country's slow-moving counteroffensive appears to be picking up some much-needed momentum. Kyiv claims its forces have gained a deeper foothold in the Zaporizhzhia region after breaking through Russia's defenses and liberating a small southern village. The settlement lies on an important road towards the strategic hub of Tokmak. Meanwhile, one local official says the mandatory evacuation of children from areas close to the frontline fighting is now underway. Well, they're a growing calls for the head of Spain's Football Federation to resign. The regional heads of the Spanish Football Federation say their organization needs new management and they want Luis Rubiales to step down. Rubiales sparked an international outcry when he kissed Jennifer Hermoso on the lips at a ceremony celebrating Spain's victory at the Women's World Cup. Spanish prosecutors have opened a probe into whether Rubiales committed an act of sexual aggression. Well, Atika Shubert has been following the story for us and joins us now live. Good to have you with us, Atika. So, this kiss was really just the tip of the iceberg in a long list of complaints. Even at the Women's World Cup final, it wasn't just the kiss. We also saw the president grabbing his crotch while standing next to the Spanish queen and her young daughter. We saw the coach of the Spanish football team seemingly grabbing the breast of another assistant coach.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PEDRO MALABIA SANCHIS, SPANISH WOMEN'S PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE: It's not only a problem of Luis Rubiales himself, it's a problem of the whole federation, of the whole system, of the whole model. So, what we expect is that we pass from words to action. It's unacceptable. It's unfair and I could say many, many words. It's just now, the U.S. is a women's football country. You know perfectly what it means to win a World Cup. For us, it's one of the biggest success in the story of not of women's sports, but of sport, of Spanish sport. So, we've been stolen this moment of celebrating together and CNN should have called us just to realize what's behind this success, not to talk about the behavior of the president because he's not representing, he should be representing the values of Spanish football, but indeed he showed that he's not aligned with this. So, of course, there has been a massive impact internationally and it's a shame and it's unfair that people are thinking that Spanish football is like this. Spanish football is not like this.

So, what happened here is that essentially this was a case of bad timing, right? This cohort of Uzbek nationals traveled to the United States seeking asylum -- they declared themselves to U.S. authorities, they were vetted according to standard procedures, and then they were released into the country pending a court date, as typically happens. It wasn't until later, just in recent weeks, that the U.S. intelligence community received intelligence that allowed them to understand that this group of people, their travel to the United States had been facilitated by a human smuggling network that included a member with some troubling ties to ISIS. Now, this obviously rang alarm bells across the federal government. The FBI immediately jumped into action here, scrambling to try to locate, investigate the backgrounds of, assess all of the different individuals that had traveled to the United States with the help of this particular smuggling network. The U.S. also worked with the government of Turkey at U.S. behest arrested members of this smuggling ring to include the facilitator with links to ISIS. That allowed the U.S. to understand pretty quickly that this person wasn't actually a member of ISIS. He was sort of a kind of an independent contractor who had some personal sympathies with the group. So, that allowed the Biden administration fairly early on to get a sense that this case was more a human smuggling case than it was a terrorism case. So, for some officials this is evidence of the system working the way it should, but for some officials' real concern that this shows a key vulnerability along the U.S. southern border.",

A Pakistani court has suspendedthe three-year sentence given to former Prime Minister Imran Khan. The court granted Khan's appeal and has allowed him to post bail, though it's not yet clear when he might be released from prison. Khan was convicted of corruption for selling state gifts while in office. He still faces several other charges. There's still no internet access in Kabul days after the country held its national elections. The government claims the move is intended to avoid the risk of violence and spread disinformation. The environment minister who was able to post this statement says he's waiting for the results to be announced. Zimbabwe's main opposition party is demanding a new election after disputing the legitimacy of last week's national vote. The Citizens Coalition for Change Party led by Nelson Chamisa says a new ballot is needed to resolve the country's current political crisis. The current President Emmerson Mngagagwa was declared the winner. But a spokesperson for the CCC says the entire process was shambolic and illegal. Sudan's military leader has taken his first international trip since civil war erupted in his country. General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan arrived in Egypt earlier and met with the President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. The two discussed Mr. al-Sisi's offers to mediate the talks between the two warring factions. Dozens of people have been killed since the fighting between Sudanese forces and the Rapid Support Forces began back in April. I want to turn to Uganda now. In three months after the nation enacted a controversial law targeting the LGBTQ community, two men have been arrested and are facing separate charges of aggravated homosexuality and they could face the death penalty. Uganda's Anti-Homosexuality Act was signed into law in May during widespread condemnation from around the world. CNN's David McKenzie has been following the story and joins us now from Johannesburg.

In fact, most people had been focusing on cemeteries inside the city of St Petersburg, and that's because the authorities had gone to sudden lengths to make out that that's or to hint that that's where the funeral was going to happen. There'd been metal detectors placed outside the key cemeteries. There'd been security placed outside. People were being checked as they went in and giving the impression that, you know, there was a big funeral that was going to be happening. In fact, it's an hour outside of St Petersburg here in the Barokhov Square, cemetery where I am now, which is I say a good hour's drive also outside the center of St Petersburg. You can see inside this wooded area where there's a sort of pretty small cemetery, the security personnel, actually members of the Russian National Guard that are posted every five meters or so and if you walk up here Luke you can see that continues around the whole perimeter we're not permitted to go inside, and it's a very closed location. In fact, we're told by locals that only 20 to 30 people attended the funeral. We can catch a glimpse though, if you come over here, it's very difficult. If you look through the sort of leaves and branches over there into the wooded cemetery, you can just perhaps make out the Russian flag, a very simple wooden cross. There's some flowers laid there, as well. That's the grave site of Yevgeny Prigozhin. Apparently, he is lying next to his father, who's buried, as well. That may have been one of the reasons why this cemetery was chosen. But it's also likely to be because it's out of the way. And, you know, the Kremlin and the authorities have obviously been going to great pains to try and get this under the radar, to play it down, to make sure there weren't crowds, and this didn't become a rallying point, a sort of pro-Prigozhin, you know, kind of sentiment. And they seem to have succeeded in that. And to say the situation is very tense in the sense that you can't get any closer than this and this is the -- as close as we can actually get at the moment to Yevgeny Prigozhin's grave site.",
