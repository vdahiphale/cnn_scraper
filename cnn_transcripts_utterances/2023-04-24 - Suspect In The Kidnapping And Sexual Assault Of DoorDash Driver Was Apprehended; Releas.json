According to the authorities there, the victim was wearing headphones when she was making this food delivery, and she was on the phone with a girlfriend. When the girlfriend quickly realized that something was going terribly wrong, the 38-year-old, as you said, has been identified as Joseph Killins.Now, according to police, he forced the victim back into her car, drove her some six miles and that is where he sexually assaulted. Now, the victim's girlfriend was able to get in contact with that woman's family. They were tracking her phone this entire time. So, they showed up to the location where she was being held. Now, according to authorities, when the accused here noticed that her family was trying to rescue her, according to police, he opened fire, striking one of the family members. Now, police, they don't get their break in this case until a day later, and that's because we're told that the accused robbed a woman in the same area, and while they were investigating that crime, that's when they were able to link him to the sexual assault as well as the kidnapping of this DoorDash driver.

She can't possess any ammunition.Now, the state law says that she is required to stay in the State of Minnesota unless she receives written approval saying she can serve the remainder of the sentence elsewhere. Potter has been approved to serve the remainder of her sentence in Wisconsin. Her attorney told me by phone that she has no plans to return to Minnesota. And for those of you who don't remember, Kim Potter is the former police Brooklyn Center police officer who grabbed her gun instead of the taser during a traffic stop and she killed Daunte Wright. She was released in the 4:00 central -- 4:00 a.m. central hour this morning. The Department of Correction says she was released at that time out of an abundance of caution. Kate.",

She is going to be able to watch her kids have kids. I can't even touch my son.She said that she is afraid of forgetting the voice of her son, Daunte. But what does give her peace, she says, she will never be able to hurt anybody as a police officer again. One thing notable that I also want to underscore, Katie Wright told me, her family hasn't been able to grieve together.

And yet, what I'm getting from at least on homeowner that I spoke to is a sense of frustration over how this has all played out.So, let me show you what this looks like right now because we are less than 24 hours away from when these residents have to be out of this building, 36 units, 55 residents. And we have seen all morning long, folks coming out, filling up U-Haul trucks, and quite frankly having a sense of frustration of not getting enough notice and also, not really knowing exactly what is next. What the plan is? Where they will go? When they can return? What is available in terms of assistance, something that the mayor promises will be there for them. Now, let's back up a little bit, John. Let's talk about how we got here, right? This is a building that was built in the 1960s. And so, it was up for that 60-year-old building recertification. And so, they have the inspection as part of that just 10 days ago, April 14th, and it didn't go well for them. As you mentioned, they're talking about sagging floors, termite damage, there was a leak that caused a partial ceiling collapse and impacted quite a few of the condos in there. And so, as a result, the mayor said that this is deemed unsafe and gave that deadline of tomorrow that they have to be out of the building. But as I mentioned, I had a conversation with one of the homeowners and it was an overwhelming frustration on his part. Even questioning outside of interests here. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
