The headlines we're following. The Houthis vowed to continue attacking Red Sea shipping on this program, all angles. You'll hear from the CEO of Maersk and the boss of IKEA. AI, the future of jobs, the managing director of the IMF gives her views, along with the Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte. We have a busy hour ahead of us because we are alive in the World Economic Forum. It is Wednesday. It's January the 17th. With AI Al (ph), I'm Richard Quest and, together, you better believe it, in Davos, we mean business. Good evening. Day three of Davos, and the weather has actually heated up. It is above freezing, and that's why we -- I mean, you can see it's sleeted and even though snow on the trees has all gone. The -- it's freezing, and the World Economic Forum is also heating up. The week is reaching it's crescendo. It's the busiest day so far, and that means more meetings, more panels and, of course, more top names to bring you on tonight's program in this busy hour that we have ahead of us. You're going to have them to prime ministers no less than three CEOs, throw in a managing director, and a secretary general, and you've got the full house. We first, though, turn our attention to the escalating crisis in the Middle East. Tensions arising in the Red Sea as the US designates Yemen's Houthi rebels as a terrorist entity. The relisting exposes the Houthis to economic sanctions. And, of course, it follows their attacks on merchant ships. Data shows that traffic through the Red Sea has now fallen to its lowest point since 2019. That's when a ship blocked the Suez Canal. The US has launched a third round of strikes against the Houthis on Tuesday. Hours later, the group fired a missile at a Maltese flag carrier. A Houthi official said today, they will not stop their attacks on what they're calling Israeli-linked vessels. Oren Liebermann is our Pentagon correspondent, so that's where we find him, at the Pentagon. Oren, lots of ground to cover. Firstly, what is the goal here from the Pentagon and, indeed, the UK and others? At the end of the day, the Houthis are well-used to being attacked by missiles.",

Still, the US, the UK, and others are trying to find some way to restore safety and security to the Red Sea, the Bab-al-Mandab strait, one of the world's most critical waterways. The problem is that's just not what we're seeing now with the Houthis vowing to continue attacks against international shipping. They say they're targeting ships with ties to Israel and no others. US Central Command has pointed out that many of the last ships they have attacked have no connection to Israel whatsoever. The latest attempt by the White House and the Biden administration to try to deter Houthi attacks on shipping is re-designating them as a specially designated global terrorist that comes with economic sanctions. It's worth noting this will go into effect in 30 days. The US trying to send a message here, also, trying to save a little bit of space so they can work some humanitarian assistance to Yemen. They have not gone as far as to relist the Houthis as a foreign terrorist organization. But, Richard, you're absolutely right.

So let's begin with Maersk. Its chief executive says the disruption in the Red Sea will probably last a few months. Maersk said on Tuesday that two of its vessels sailed to waters in close proximity to the US Navy. The two ships turned off their tracking systems.

That means that we have ships that suddenly have to sail full throttle. That means more emission, more fuel. It means also that they will not be, despite that, back on time in China.
