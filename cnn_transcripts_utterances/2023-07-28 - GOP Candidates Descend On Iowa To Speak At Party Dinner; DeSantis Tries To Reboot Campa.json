      "sentences": "Well, it's going to be quite a night. We're really seeing all of Trump's legal issues colliding right into this 2024 presidential primary, as we've seen time and time again in the last several months. And, you know, we looked at some of the polling that we got from Fox Business over the weekend, and it just shows Donald Trump's incredible hold over this race in the state of Iowa.Now, it is early. Things change. There is certainly Trump fatigue based on the voters I've been talking to. But one word that did not come up yesterday, either from Ron DeSantis, who I was with on his bus tour, which I'll get to in just a second, or from the voters I was talking to, was indictment. Nobody was really talking about that. They were talking about who can win in 2024 against Joe Biden. That's the calculation that the voters I was speaking to are making, and they're trying to ascertain who that person is. Governor Ron DeSantis in the middle of kind of a campaign reset. A couple of months into his campaign, we've seen him shedding about a third of his staff. They're promising a leaner and more insurgent campaign, and I asked him about that yesterday, Dana. He told me that sometimes, you know, you have to make new decisions. You have to have this kind of commander's intent, and if they're not following what needs to be done, then you have to make changes. And that he's all about substance and that's what he's going to focus on. What he's not doing is directly talking about Donald Trump on the stump. And aside from Asa Hutchinson and Chris Christie, as you well know, we really aren't hearing any of these candidates directly take on Trump. They're really trying to thread this needle with voters that likely voted for Trump in the last two elections and convince them that they're the person to do it. What we're hearing from DeSantis is this electability argument. He keeps coming back to what he's done in Florida. Yesterday, he said he won by 20 there, Trump won by three, that he was able to get independents to come to his side, making the case that that's what he could do in a broader election. Dana, whether or not voters are absorbing that and going to side with that, we'll see. But it is going to be interesting to see them all on that stage tonight and then Trump whirring into town and really, will he suck that oxygen out as he often does.",

If you look at -- around that many Iowa polls, but generally speaking in the way that people feel about the former president.

The truth is that anything you can learn, any benefits that people suggest you had done slavery, you would have had a free person.

He's trying to tell a different story about the Republican Party.And you saw even Representative Byron Donald, who's supporting Donald Trump, come out to kind of rally around Trump's side here. But let's be kind of honest. For this primary to even be competitive at all, someone needs to grow in Iowa. I mean, if Donald Trump is winning Iowa by 46 percent, this primary hasn't started yet, right? And so I'm saying there is a baseline that even the Tim Scott still have not cleared yet, that I think we have to re-remind ourselves, even though he's kind of taking up some of that energy that was being coordinated around Ron DeSantis, that wasn't enough to surpass Donald Trump.
