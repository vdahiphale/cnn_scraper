And that is conserve significant amounts of Alaskan sea and land forever.I was able to see to it that we literally able to conserve millions of acres, not a few, millions of acres of sea and land forever so it cannot be used in the future. I am banking on we'll find out that the oil company is going to say not -- that's not going to be challenged and they're going to go with three sites. And the energy that is going to be produced there estimated would account to 1 percent, 1 percent of the total production of oil in the world. And so I thought it was a better gamble and a hell of a tradeoff to have the Arctic Ocean, the Baron Sea and so many other places off limits forever now.

While President Biden was speaking, CNN learned of another attack targeting U.S. forces in Syria. Let's go straight to CNN's Natasha Bertrand who's at the Pentagon for us.

Now it is unclear whether there are any casualties or any damage at this point, and we are told that the U.S. is still assessing that. But it comes, as local residents did tell CNN that they had heard multiple explosions and we are told that this attack was carried out using rockets.Now, the big question, of course, is whether the U.S. is going to now retaliate against this attack because this is the third attack in two days by proxy groups associated with Iran. And that is, of course, really an escalation here of what Iran has been doing. Just earlier this morning, we had heard that Iran backed groups had also launched 10 rockets at yet another U.S. base in Syria. Now, that caused no casualties, but it did wound two women and two children. And then, of course, yesterday, the Iranian backed militias, they launched a drone attack against a coalition military base in Syria as well, and that killed an American contractor and wounded five U.S. Service Members and an additional U.S. contractor. So all of this kind of tit for tat, kind of violent volleying between the U.S. backed -- the Iran backed militias and the U.S. in Syria, it was really reaching kind of a boiling point here. And the big question is whether the U.S. is now going to respond to this latest attack like they did yesterday with that U.S. airstrike on Iranian backed facilities in Syria that house munitions as well as were used for intelligence gathering.

But at the same time, President Biden knows that he's got to maintain some of what in the business they call escalation dominance, which is to say, once the U.S. has counterattacked, if there is a response, they've got to come back hard. And that runs the risk that you get up a ladder that you don't really want to be climbing. I don't think it's going to worry them that much if this is contained in the Syrian theater. I think it will worry them if it begins to spill over into anything that deals directly with Iran, because as we discussed before the press conference, they've got an ongoing issue with the provision of weapons to Russia, which a pipeline, I think, the U.S. and certainly the Ukrainians would like to stop.

Look, these are all, for the most part, fact witnesses who were placed very close to the President both on January 6 and, of course, in the days following the election.They're also his top advisors. And so, presumably, when the former president was communicating with them, he thought it would be under a shield of privilege. He probably had even more candid exchanges with them than he ordinarily would. And now we're going to hear the stories that they have to tell. Big development today.",

As we know, he was a bit of an intermediary from people, from the outside who are calling in saying, could you intervene with the President? Be very interesting to hear what he has to say about that day.He presumably was also involved in the President's efforts to overturn the election. He was at his side listening to the President strategize. He was on that call to Georgia, to Raffensperger. I'm sure he has a lot to say that the special counsel will be very interested in.",

But let me just hash out something that Elie Honig told us earlier, which is if they invoke the Fifth, Elie Honig said, the prosecutor could say, we're going to give them immunity.We're going to give them immunity so they can't invoke the Fifth against self-incrimination, because we're saying that there is no self-incrimination possible, and then there's actually just a contempt of court charge and potential jail time if they continue to refuse to testify.

I mean, immunity often you will do if you want the cooperation of a witness who you think probably hasn't done anything wrong and maybe has misplaced fears. I'm not sure any of these people fall into that category from the perspective of the special prosecutor.So although he could offer an immunity deal, I guess I'd be a little surprised knowing what we know if he actually offered immunity to these people.",
