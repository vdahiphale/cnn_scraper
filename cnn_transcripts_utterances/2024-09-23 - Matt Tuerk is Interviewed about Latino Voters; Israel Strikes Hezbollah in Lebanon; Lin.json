They're treating us seriously. They're treating us like adults. And we're seeing kind of gimmicks from the Trump campaign, like Nicky Jam and misgendering him onstage.What's different is that we're being treated seriously, where people - the campaign understands that the kitchen table politics, the kitchen table issues that are important to us are what we need to hear from - from leadership. So, it's - it is about prices. It's about housing. It's about education. And I think the Harris campaign has understood that and understood that Latino's are interested in more than just the border. That we're interested in making sure that our families can do well.",

But I think you also see significant numbers of people who fundamentally are interested in decency and kindness in a candidate and strong character and somebody who is going to, again, uphold those values, help our families get ahead and ensure that - that we have an opportunity. That's what I hear from the Harris campaign here on the ground and inPennsylvania. I hear a campaign that respects us as human beings and as Americans. I can't, you know, I can only speak to what I see here in Allentown. I can't speak to Latino voters in Texas and Arizona.

And we're still - you know, we're still working class, middle class voters, it's just that many of us speak Spanish now. There's a strong Dominican and Puerto Rican influence here. But it's fundamentally the same Allentown in that respect, that we - we still have those basic concerns. We want to make sure that we have economic opportunity. We want to make sure that there's housing. I think that's one of the things that's compelling about the Harris campaign is that they're talking about investing in 3 million housing units across the United States that will help folks in cities across the United States do a little bit better.We contrast it against the Trump campaign, whose approached to reducing the cost of housing seems to be mass deportations, as detailed in Project 2025. We, again, I'll keep coming back to, Latino voters are American voters. We have these fundamental values that are important to us. And that is the opportunity to get ahead and not just get by. We - we need to see that. We - I talk to so many people here who are interested in being involved in the economy, who are interested in entrepreneurial opportunities, and we - we resonate with candidates that present a vision for the future that is a way forward for us. That's going to be Allentown 20 years ago, 50 years ago, and 20 years and 50 years into the future. This is a city that works hard, that rewards hard work and is interested in doing a little bit better for our families.",

And the Israelis have put out a warning to residents of the Bikov (ph) Valley to the east of the country, a very large area, telling them that if they live near or in any building that contains Hezbollah weaponry, that they should leave immediately and stay at least 1,000 meters away or go take shelter in nearby schools. That's a huge part of the country.And, of course, when people hear that, their inclination is probably simply to leave the entire area whatsoever. They were given a two-hour warning. And, in fact, within the last half hour, we have seen two Israeli warplanes flying north over Beirut. And we've also heard drones as well. So, what we're seeing is that this is the most intense day of Israeli airstrikes going back to the war of 2006. And as a result, we're seeing a mass exodus of people moving out of the south of Lebanon, trying to reach safer ground. Of course, the worry is that at this point there really isn't much safer ground. In fact, we were just on the phone with one individual who is a resident of the southern Lebanese city of Tyre, which is about 25 kilometers north of the Israeli border. He said, it has been raining bombs since 5:00 a.m. And he says he saw several buildings collapse. And these are his words, the city is being emptied of its residents. Everyone is fleeing. And what we're seeing indeed is that the highways going from the south of Lebanon toward the capital are absolutely crammed with cars, people leaving in that area. Not just one side of the highway. Both sides of the highway. Everybody is trying to flee north. Now, as a result of these Israeli strikes, the Lebanese minister of education has announced all classes for all educational institutions are suspended as of tomorrow morning. The Lebanese prime minister saying that he's appealed to the United Nations in what he called influential countries to deter Israel from carrying out these strikes. But all words from Israel seem to indicate that this is just the beginning of this offensive. This perhaps yet another war between Lebanon and Israel. Sara.",

What's your response to that? LINDA THOMAS-GREENFIELD, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED STATES: Look, we have been clear from day one that we do not want to see this war escalate. And that is a message that we have given to both sides. But let us not forget that on October 7th, when Hamas attacked Israel, Hezbollah, in support of Hamas, started to send weapons across the border into Israel. We support Israel's right to self-defense. But again, we do not want to see this war escalate. That is the message that President Biden is giving to both sides of this conflict.",

What is the thrust of the message, Ambassador?THOMAS-GREENFIELD: So, we have laid out three priorities that will be reflected in the president's speech. First and foremost, we want to work to find peace. So, we're putting all of our efforts behind peace and security, not just in Gaza and Israel and Lebanon, but we're also focusing on Sudan. We're focusing on Ukraine. And so all of these will be part of our agenda, as well as conflicts elsewhere in the world. Secondly, the humanitarian system around the world. It's under tremendous stress. Humanitarian workers are - are being attacked. They do not have access. They don't have all the resources they need. So, the president will raise concerns about the humanitarian system and how we can give them more to be able to respond to the situations we're seeing on the ground. And finally, as you know, we have been talking over the past two years about U.N. reform and how we can make the security council more inclusive, but also empower the security council. And so we made an announcement, I did a few weeks ago, announcing our support for two additional, permanent seats for Africa, a rotating seat for small island developing states, and to move toward text-based negotiations that will allow for us to actually moved the needle on U.N. Security Council reform. So, that will be the broad parameters. We're excited that we have over 100 heads of state, many foreign ministers, and there will be a series of bilateral meetings that the president will be engaged in, including with the secretary general. The secretary of state will also participate in bilateral meetings, as well as myself.",
