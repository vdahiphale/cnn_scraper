Sweden and Finland had indicated over the course of the past year, year-and-a-half or so that they were looking to join NATO.Finland was the first to join in April of last year. And now after there were some bumps along the road in the form of Hungary and Turkiye, Sweden now officially part of NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. At least ostensibly, this was what Russian President Vladimir Putin was trying to avoid. One of his stated reasons was that he claimed NATO was trying to encroach upon Russia. And now he was trying to, what he said, head off essentially expansion of the alliance, but that's exactly a cause of his invasion of Ukraine. As Sweden and Finland, of course, Finland joining a year ago, now becoming part of NATO. The U.S. has pointed out that Sweden has a very capable military that will now work, exercise and be allied with 31 other members of NATO. As Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement, just a short time ago, \"Sweden's decision is another reminder that Putin's war is not the result of NATO enlargement. It is the cause of NATO enlargement.\" So a major accomplishment for the alliance. And certainly, a knock against Putin and the decision-making that lead for him to invade Ukraine here -- Boris?",

This is right outside of Anchorage, Alaska, where the Defense Department is analyzing it to see if it is another spy balloon, as was picked up floating over the United States and ultimately shot down last year. It's not definitive yet. DOD is working with other agencies to analyze this. They received it from the FBI. The FBI picked it up when the fishermen brought it into Alaska. It is now in DOD custody at that base, just outside of Alaska, undergoing analysis. Of course, Boris, the key question now, what exactly is it? Is it another spy balloon? And to whom does it belong?",

What we saw there was just the arbitrariness and irrationality of the screening process that had been set up by the Netanyahu government at crossing points.We visited a warehouse in Rafah, Egypt, that was just filled with items that had been rejected by the Israelis at these checkpoints. Some of the examples of the goods rejected, maternity kits, water purifiers, all sorts of things for which real plausible justification that they could be used as a weapon. I mean, maternity kits have this teeny, little scalpel that may have to be used in the event of emergency during delivery of a baby. So it's just one example. And I should say that when a truck has one of those items that's rejected, the entire truck with all the other goods on it is rejected, has to turn around and go to the beginning of the line. And that takes weeks and weeks now for trucks to cross. So this is just one example among many of the unnecessary restrictions on lifesaving aid to starving people in Gaza.",

I understand that people haven't given up. That, obviously, is the best way forward. In the meantime, though, we have this crisis going on. I'm glad that the president is going to be building this port. That does take 45 days or so. So that will be important for the longer-term. But we have people starving to death day. And the only way to address that is to insist and use more of the levers of U.S. influence to demand that the Netanyahu government open up for these crossings. Do a better job on de-conflicting, because we have aid workers and others who are -- and their protection, their security protection ,trying to deliver aid, but being targeted and killed in many instances. And obviously, that's a great deterrent to people getting the aid that they need.",

They were displaced from their homes. And they went to Rafah because they were told it was a safe place to be.If -- if the Netanyahu government decides to go into Rafah, the current humanitarian situation, as awful as it is, will actually get a whole lot worse. Which is why many of us have been -- have been very clear that the president needs to make -- say to the Prime Minister Netanyahu that that's just unacceptable to do that at this point. Look, I'm sure the president tonight will and he should talk about the horrors of the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7th. We can have no more October 7ths. But that does not justify the humanitarian disaster that's affecting over two million innocent Gazan civilians right now. And so it's really important that we address all those issues immediately.

February now, 1.77 degrees Celsius warmer than before. That's over three degrees Fahrenheit. And the last 12 months, the warmest in at least 120,000 years or so, or something. We saw the line chart comparing all of the Februarys of years past going back to the 1940s. Freakishly warm there. But look at the list of cities that had record temperatures shattered in -- there's -- there's the line chart that shows Februarys through history. But we also have this list of cities that were shattered in this month. Austin, Texas, 72 degrees, Baton Rouge, Burlington. So from the north to the south. The Midwest has been ice-free. The Great Lakes region there as well. And this has so many knockoff effects that you don't really think about. The governor of Louisiana just declared a state of emergency for the crawfish industry because they've had a record drought in Louisiana.
