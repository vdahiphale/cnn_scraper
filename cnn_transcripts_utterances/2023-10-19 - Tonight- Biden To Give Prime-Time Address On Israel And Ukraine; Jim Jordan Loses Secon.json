Patrick McHenry has made clear that is up to Jim Jordan to decide.But the risk that is posed if he goes back to the floor today is he could lose even more votes than he lost yesterday. He had 20 defections on the first ballot; 22 defections on the second ballot. And the expectation is that he would have even more today if he went to the floor. So the question looms does he decide to go forward or does he try and continue with a vote? So far, it doesn't seem like that effort has really gotten him anywhere. In fact, you have a number of holdouts who say that they are not going to vote for Jordan no matter what. So it's really hard to imagine, Phil, how he closes this deal. That means that Republicans really have two options at this point. Do they try to run another candidate? Likely, anyone who would run at this point is not going to have an easy time getting 217 votes. It's really not even clear if anyone in the Republican Conference could get 217 votes at this point. The other option, as you mentioned, would be empowering Patrick McHenry. McHenry has said repeatedly he is focused on getting Jim Jordan elected. But at what point does the Republican Conference say enough is enough? We have to govern. We have a deadline coming up on November 17 to fund the government. We have to do something for Israel. We have to do something for Ukraine. Those are the Republican voices right now that are really driving the train on the effort to try and empower McHenry in short order. But again, McHenry has a very delicate balance here because he has to let Jim Jordan decide for himself when it's time to call it quits -- Phil.",
