There were some elements of national security in it, but then he went on rants about the Obamas and the speeches that they gave. And then, of course, this morning, we heard Donald Trump. He did an interview with \"Fox and Friends\" where he railed against how -- how many of the speakers are using their time to attack Donald Trump. He says they're going -- they're talking way more about him than they are about policy. And he also discussed their critiques of Project 2025. Take a listen.
