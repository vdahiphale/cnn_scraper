Now it gets really serious, Donald Trump's third indictment in four months, accuses the former president of multiple schemes to stay in power, despite knowing he lost the 2020 election.Full-fledged war, as Ukrainian drones continue to strike inside Russia, a senior Ukrainian official warns the war will soon be waged on Russian territory. And the three amigos, why the military regimes in Mali and Burkina Faso are now warning any attack on Niger will be seen as an attack on them. Good to have you with us for CNN NEWSROOM and we begin with the third indictment of former U.S. President Donald Trump. This is without doubt an unprecedented moment in U.S. history. Former President indicted for allegedly plotting along with six co-conspirators multiple schemes to overturn the 2020 election and steal the presidency. The two earlier indictments, one for falsifying business records to hide hush money payments to a porn star, the other for mishandling classified material, a serious and consequential on their own, but pale in comparison to the latest charges from Special Counsel Jack Smith, accusing Trump of knowingly and deliberately spreading prolific lies about the 2020 election, even though he knew he'd lost to Joe Biden. Trump is scheduled to appear on Thursday that's when he will be formally charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, obstruction and attempt to obstruct an official proceeding and conspiracy against rights. According to Special Counsel Jack Smith, Trump's repeated lies about the credibility of the 2020 election ultimately fueled the January 6 insurrection on the U.S. Capitol. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JACK SMITH, Special Counsel: The attack on our nation's capitol on January 6th 2021 was an unprecedented assault on the seat of American democracy. It's described in the indictment. It was fueled by lies, lies by the defendant targeted at obstructing a bedrock function of the U.S. government and nation's process of collecting, counting and certifying the results of the presidential election.

And it's hard to argue with that. The fact that so many Republican elected officials even before reading the evidence in the indictment were quick to dismiss it categorically as politicalization, weaponization of the Justice Department is ominous going forward.

And of course, his argument is it's not really him. He's just in the way, these are the elites in the deep state targeting you.I mean, the extent to which the Republican coalition is buying into these arguments, as I've said, is ominous about where this is headed. You know, you see in the polling in the New York Times Siena poll, only something like 13 percent of Republicans believe he has committed a serious crime, three quarters say that it is post 2020 actions. All he was doing was exercising his legitimate rights to contest the election, not threatening American democracy. 60 percent now describe January 6 as legitimate protest. The inability or unwillingness of voices that Republicans trust their elected leaders to make a contrary case to push back against Donald Trump has in effect painted them into a corner where the vast majority of their coalition believes his arguments, and they have kind of created a self-fulfilling prophecy in which they are afraid to challenge him.

I mean, it suggests that the germ of election denial, the willingness to undermine democracy, if that's what it takes to advance partisan goals, has extended way beyond Trump, and that even legal consequences for him will not undo the process that he has set in motion. I mean, this is going to be a very fraught time for the country, because unless something changes, he is going to be the Republican nominee, shuttling between the campaign trail and the courtroom.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Ukrainian forces advancing your Bakhmut as Kyiv says they have Moscow's army on the back foot on nearly all battlefields. And now, Russia's capital increasingly in the crosshairs, another drone attack hitting a high rise building. Suddenly, there was this explosion and we immediately ran, this residence says, there were shards of glass and then smoke rising. While authorities claimed the attack was thwarted. One drone damaged a building already struck two days prior in a complex housing several government offices. Kyiv's message to the Kremlin, the war is coming to them. I think Moscow will have more and more war on its territory, the presidential adviser says, and this has nothing to do with Ukraine alone. Now, this is due to the historical significance of this moment. If you start such a war, you have to expect that this war will be on your territory. Ukraine is increasingly using drones to strike Russian targets both inside Russia and in Russian occupied territories, both in the air and on the water. After Kyiv have hit the Crimean bridge three weeks ago, Moscow now saying its forces thwarted a naval drone attack on cargo ships in the Black Sea, though Ukraine denies targeting civilian vessels. The ships of the Russian Navy which escorted the sea transport detected and destroyed all the boats in a timely manner, the spokesman says. With Russian forces slowly getting pushed back in southern Ukraine, a rare alleged frontline visit by Putin's stop General Valery Gerasimov getting updates from commanders in the Zaporizhzhia region, the Russian say.

Add on the next seven countries for the top 10 donors for a total of $75 billion.By contrast, even with a recent surge in spending, Russia's defense budget is said to be around $85 billion.
