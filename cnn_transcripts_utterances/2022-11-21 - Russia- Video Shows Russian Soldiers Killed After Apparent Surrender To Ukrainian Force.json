They were able to trace some of those postings back to a computer used by one of the suspects. I want to read to you one of the tweets that was so alarming. It said, \"Gotta ask a priest if I should become a husband or shoot up a synagogue and die.\" There were also postings about a date and time, but not a target of a possible synagogue. Of course, you can image, sources are telling us there was a frantic effort within law enforcement to try to identify this person and also, of course, find them, which they did. They sent out an alert to law enforcement cell phones last Friday, called a BOLO, be on the lookout for. And two MTA officers -- the officers that sort of man the subway systems in New York City -- spotted this person, 21-year-old Chris Brown, along with a friend of his, Matthew Mayer, and they were both arrested. As Bianna said, federal charges are a possibility. Right now, state charges are there for Chris Brown, terroristic threats along with a weapons charge. He is still behind bars. The friend has bonded out on a criminal possession charge. But the most alarming part of this, why was this such an imminent threat? I want to explain to you what law enforcement said they had in their possession. They had a swastika arm patch. They had a bulletproof vest, a long knife, a gun, a 30-round magazine, ski masks. I mean, law enforcement was working so hard to find these people. And then, of course, to come across this. I want you to hear from the mayor, his reaction to all of this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR ERIC ADAMS (D-NY): To have a person armed -- have the means, the hate and the desire to carry out a crime of this magnitude is serious. We averted that step.
