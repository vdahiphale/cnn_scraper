Because as we understand from our team on the ground there, the thumb drives with the exports and the tabulating machines have now been handed off to the county where the upload has now started. And as of now, the estimate is we'll have those votes within 10 to 15 minutes. At this point, it may be less based on when we got that communication. And these are the city of Milwaukee absentee ballots. And part of why this is so critical, I mean, let's just take a look back at when President Biden won the state here in 2020. You see how close it was based on where we are right now, with 96 percent of the vote in at this point. The margin is much bigger than that with Donald Trump in the lead. These added votes, again, if this timing holds up here within the next few minutes, could give us some clarity to how this race will ultimately turn in the end. We'll keep you posted -- John.",

They have a pretty good sense of where this is going based on how much vote is in, but there is still a significant amount outstanding here in Milwaukee, largest county in the state of Wisconsin, and a Democratic stronghold.And I think the big question with this new batch of votes is not necessarily is it going to change the race, is it's what's it going to do to this margin? Because this margin is an underperformance by a pretty significant margin, by about five points from what Joe Biden did, four points from what Joe Biden did back in 2020. And I think the issue that Democrats have, the issue that Harris campaign has had is they were willing to acknowledge that they had work to do in urban areas, particularly with some of their Black voters. And Donald Trump had made inroads there. What they said was in places like Wisconsin, if you push out or you go into our suburban strongholds, if you go to more educated parts of the state, that's where we'll make up for it. That's where we'll balance it out. That's Dane County. That's the University of Wisconsin. That's the home of Madison. This is a place that is a, that is a Democratic stronghold. They expected to blow out the vote here. You look at that margin, you say, all right, 99 percent reporting when you've got a 74 percent in your favor, almost 75 percent. That must be exactly what you did, but it's underperforming Joe Biden by a point and a half. You can't drop off. You can't be as soft as they've been in those urban centers, population centers that used to be strongholds -- It's still hard to some degree -- and not make up for it in a significant way in places like Dane.",

Those were the places where Harris really needed to run up the score if she was going to have a shot here. And as we saw Trump making gains elsewhere in more rural areas, even in urban centers among, you know, African-American Black voters, she really needed to get things going there. They ran a strategy aimed at that, you know, kind of late in the game here, but it wasn't enough. I mean, what is going on?",

And she would either hold pat or just fall slightly behind what Joe Biden performed at. And so at the end of the day, you were comparing everything to 2020, and they just did not meet that mark. And that, you know, the question is, why? What was that fundamental inability to meet that mark and not being able to offset the rural uptick that we saw Donald Trump being able to achieve?",

And it was always going to be very hard.I mean, they weren't just trying to build the plane as they were flying it. They were trying to change out the crew, put in the jet fuel. So I mean, I think as we get more data and better understand what's happening in the electorate, some of it may be things we've talked about. The electorate just didn't feel like they knew her well enough or didn't feel like they knew whether or not they could trust her with the economic issues. Which, by the way, for women candidates, the economy and national security are always two very hard issues where you have to, you know, shore up your credentials.

So let's start first in Pennsylvania, where you see Dave McCormick, the Republican leading the incumbent Senator Bob Casey, 49.2 to 48.2. That's with 95 percent of the vote in. Look, this was a seat Democrats certainly hoping to hang on to. Dave McCormick, you'll remember, ran last time in the primary against Mehmet Oz. He did not win, so this is his second try at it. Let's take a look at our next state here, Michigan, where you'll see Mike Rogers leading Elissa Slotkin, a current representative at 48.5 to 48.4, just a razor thin margin there in Michigan, with 91 percent of the vote in. And also in Wisconsin, where you have Eric Hovde leading the incumbent Democrat Tammy Baldwin, 49.8 percent to 48.1 percent. Again, 94 percent of the vote in there. Again, all three of those would be pickups for Republicans who already control the House. Because take a look at the -- I'm sorry, the Senate, the balance of power with Republicans at 51, two Democrats at 41. They've already picked up two seats tonight. So now the question is, John, will they continue to pick up more seats? That is what we're tracking.
