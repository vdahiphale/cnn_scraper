Barely changed for the Dow Jones on this Tuesday. Those are the markets and the main events of the day: International pressure is growing on the Israeli prime minister. He says, no force in the world will stop Israeli troops from entering Rafah. The Highest Court in the US state of Arizona rules. The state must adhere to a 1901 law that bans nearly all abortions. And King Charles gets a look at the new bank notes, those that bear his portrait. Live from New York on Tuesday, April the 8th. I'm Richard Quest, back in New York, where of course, I mean business. Good evening. We begin today with Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, who said no force in the world will stop Israeli troops from entering Rafah. As the world tries to ramp up pressure for a ceasefire, the French foreign minister has suggested, sanctions could be used to pressure a ceasefire. He said in an interview, there must be multiple ways to force Israel to allow more aid into Gaza. And the new Irish prime minister, the Taoiseach said as he was being sworn in, innocent people are being starved and slaughtered. In the US, Senator Elizabeth Warren said Israel's actions could be interpreted as genocide. Our international diplomatic editor is Nic Robertson. He is in Jerusalem. Nic, I don't want to parry or pass phrases here, but when Benjamin Netanyahu says, no force in the world will stop Israeli troops from entering Rafah, does not then follow a sentence, if it wants to. In other words, if Israel intends to do it.",

Now, there are reasons both of them would not want to push that button. But the IDF believes that there is a strong military rationale. The prime minister says that rationale is that the Hamas still has five brigades there, they still haven't captured or killed the head of the political wing of Hamas, the head of the military wing of Hamas, and a lot of other commanders. Hamas is still able to fire rockets, still able to attack IDF forces inside of Gaza. So the rationale, the military rationale the political rationale is all there. The prime minister says, there is a date. Secretary of State Antony Blinken today indicated that he still expects more conversations with Israeli officials next week. He is not seeing a date. The US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin spoke with his counterpart here in Israel, Yoav Gallant today, they talked about the upcoming operation in Rafah, but again, no date communicated there, and I think if you look what the IDF said over the weekend about the troops it pulled out of Khan Younis, they indicated that they would get some recuperation time and preparation time. So it doesn't seem that it is imminent. We may be looking at weeks here though -- Richard.",

That is a view a lot of people have. Look, I spoke to a lady over the weekend whose brother was killed at the Nova Music festival in the 7th of October, along with 350 other people by Hamas, but she said the pain is worse than it was.

Thank you.Well, you remember the scenes, these horrific scenes, which was the aftermath of the aid delivery turned deadly. Now, more than a hundred Palestinians were killed, hundreds more injured in Gaza in late February. The Israeli military claimed its tanks fired warning shots into the air to disperse a crowd after seeing people were being trampled. Our analysis of videos, interviews, and eyewitnesses, and the testimonies they gave cast doubt on Israel's version of events. CNN's Katie Polglase reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KATIE POLGLASE, CNN INVESTIGATIVE PRODUCER (voice over): It is early morning on February 29th on Al-Rashid Road in Northern Gaza. Thousands of starving people have gathered here to receive food, but as the aid trucks arrive, this happens. (GUNSHOTS) POLGLASE (voice over): The night would become known as the Flour Massacre. By morning, over a hundred would be dead, in one of the single biggest mass casualty events of this conflict. CNN investigated this incident, obtaining never seen before videos of that night, collecting evidence from 22 eyewitnesses and tracing the aid itself all the way to a Muslim charity in the UK. It was the IDF that was then responsible for safely delivering these vital supplies, but we found they opened fire on unarmed starving Palestinians at close range as the aid arrived. Their explanation for the tragedy using this drone video was the stampede that caused soldiers to fired warning shots in the air, they later admitted to firing some shots directly at so-called suspects who approached them. But the IDF footage is incomplete. It cuts between crowds surrounding the trucks and bodies lying on the ground, even this reveals they were firing in a densely packed area likely to cause severe bloodshed. CNN requested the full footage from the IDF, but it was denied. Jihad Abu Watfa was amongst the starving Palestinians and started filming as the trucks crossed into Northern Gaza. JIHAD ABU WATFA (THROUGH TRANSLATION): We decided to face the danger, to risk our lives to obtain piece of bread for our families.",

The moment mesmerized Lisa Van Slett, a curator of mammals at the Dallas Zoo. So did the total eclipse today meet your expectations?",

Flamingos packed together in the middle of a pond in their habitat. Primates apparently also thought it was bedtime.
