All right, if Donald Trump is unable to post a $464 million bond in his civil fraud case by Monday, the former president's private estate and golf course in Westchester County, New York, could be seized by the state. From the newly available records, New York Attorney General Letitia James filed judgments in the suburban county earlier this month, indicating the state's preparing to seize those properties.Trump now has four days to post that bond, convince an appeals court to let him post a smaller bond or defer the payment until after his appeal. The panel is back with us. Sarah Longwell, we were kind of debating this yesterday in terms of like how this cuts if this actually goes forward, and Letitia James starts like putting proverbial padlocks on these properties.

Why that's the case? I'm not sure. But that's a trouble sign for him. What's a better sign I think for President Biden is that thus far as between both states, they look at it more as a referendum on Trump, than they look at it as a referendum on Biden.

It's the economy that noses out those other issues as to what's top of mind. In the end, both sides have something that's going to motivate their base. On one side, it's the border and its crime.
