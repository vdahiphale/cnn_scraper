Four different men made accusations against Spacey dating back to incidents between the years 2004 and 2013. But at the end of a nearly month-long trial, jurors cleared him of all nine charges.

And in his mind, that is exactly what he was able to do, found not guilty on all nine sexual offense charges. As that was read out, the not guilty one by one by one. Kevin Spacey was brought to tears. He later stepped out to the reporters, including ourselves, that were standing outside the courtroom, gave about a one- minute statement in which he said he was humbled by the decision, thanked the courtroom staff, thanked the jury, but also said that he has a lot to process. And as you mentioned, there is, of course, the possibility still of civil cases against him. Look, these were very serious allegations, very serious accusations against this award-winning actor. Again, nine offenses, including seven counts of sexual assault, and one the most serious of causing a person to engage in penetrative sexual activity without consent. That, on its own, could have carried decades in prison. Again, he's been found not guilty of all of these offenses. Kevin Spacey will see this as an opportunity to revive his career, but what played out in court was truly riveting, Zain. And as you can only imagine, will have an impact of course, on Kevin Spacey's reputation. The prosecutor who brought forward the incidences, the accusations of these four men, described Kevin Spacey in this period between the early 2000s and 2010s, a time when he was the artistic director of the old Vic Theater, he described, or she described rather --the prosecutor -- as -- Kevin Spacey as a sexual bully, as, and I quote, \"at one point, telling the courtroom he delights in making others feel powerless and uncomfortable\". Kevin Spacey, of course, hit back at this in court saying, yes, I am a big flirt, telling the jurors that he is sexually promiscuous, but of course going on to say that doesn't make him a bad person, that he was throughout many of these incidences describing them as romantic and, of course, describing them as consensual. It's important to note that these all surfaced, these accusations surface in the wake of the \"Me Too\" movement, so this is potentially a blow to that movement. But for today, for Kevin Spacey, he'll see this as a victory and as you said, as a chance to reclaim that award-winning acting career.",

We also learned a short while ago, CNN, according to a source close to the president, that the presidential guard and the government are involved in discussions. This source is not telling us what these discussions are about, but we also know that the roads around the presidential palace are blocked. Some government ministries have been closed for most of today. The city appeared calm. But something suddenly has been afoot, a heavy military presence around the presidential palace, and now we understand that the military appears to have taken control of state television. It's still broadcasting, at least according to feed on their website, but the military is understood to be in control of state television in Niger. This is a situation that has earned condemnation from the regional body, the economic community of West African states, ECOWAS, the African Union, and the European Union. In fact, the ECOWAS, that regional body, West Africa, warning anybody involved in this that the ECOWAS and international community will hold them responsible for the safety and security of President Bazoum, of his family, and of senior government officials, anybody, citizens involved in this situation. He was elected in 2021. Niger is a relatively more stable part of an unstable neighborhood. There's a big jihadist crisis in the Sahel, especially in Mali and Burkina Faso. And with French troops leaving Mali, Niger has become the linchpin of France's strategy in the region, so a key ally for both France and the United States there. The United States Embassy said that it had received reports of political instability in the country and said that even though the situation appeared to be calm, it advised people to limit unnecessary movements and especially avoid all travel along Avenue Rue de la Republique until further notice. We have seen a statement from the presidency's official accounts on Facebook and on Twitter, though that statement disappeared from these official accounts, except this one section that I want to read for you that remains on the Twitter account of the presidency of Niger. \"The President of the Republic and his family are doing well. The army and the national guard are ready to attack the elements of the presidential guard involved in this fit of anger if they do not return to their better senses.\" So, this statement initially said that there were members of the presidential guard who were involved in anti-Republican status in vain and that they were being dealt with. So, the disappearance of that is something that is odd. There's a lot still we don't know there in here, but suddenly a worrying situation in Niger.",

Right now, to Israel, where the Supreme Court says it will not temporarily block a new law that limits its own power, at least for now, but it will hear challenges from seven petitioners trying to get the so-called reasonableness -- reasonableness law thrown out. In a ruling, the High Court said it will hold a debate in September. One group petitioning against the law celebrated the court's decision, vowing to quote, demonstrate and fight everywhere and on every platform until the threat is removed.

The Knesset said Wednesday, the law has officially been published in records and entered into force.

A number of African countries are feeling the impact of Russia having withdrawn from the Black Sea grain deal with Ukraine. A lot of African countries, especially in the eastern part of Africa, are experiencing food insecurity as a result of Russia pulling out of that deal. Let me bring in David McKenzie, joining us live now from Johannesburg. Here's the thing. When Russia had an Africa summit back in 2019, you had pretty much about 43 African leaders attend that summit. This time, the number is much smaller. It's closer to roughly around 20.

He was expected to plead guilty to two misdemeanors over late tax payments as part of a deal with prosecutors to resolve a separate felony gun charge.

So, Evan, this plea agreement appears to be in jeopardy, but I'm also hearing that there's a lot of movement, things are changing. What more do we know? EVAN PEREZ, CNN SENIOR U.S. JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Things are changing. High drama at this courthouse in Wilmington, Delaware. Here's where we are at this moment. The judge is asking questions of Hunter Biden, what he's willing to agree to. She had raised some concerns as to whether the agreement that had been published, the one that had been made public whereby Hunter Biden agreed to plead guilty to two misdemeanor counts for not paying his taxes on time in 2017 and 2018, and in a separate gun charge, whether all of this was connected, whether it meant that Hunter Biden was protected from prosecution on anything else. And that's where things sort of fell apart. And at this hour, right now, it appears that the two sides, the Hunter Biden's lawyers and the prosecution have come to terms that there is a much more limited scope, that Biden is protected under this deal, that he cannot be prosecuted for any of his taxes from 2014 to 2019, as well as his possession of a gun at a time when he was addicted to drugs, which is a federal violation, a big, a major violation here in the United States. And so, he can't be prosecuted for those things. But there is an ongoing investigation and there are other things that he could face some legal jeopardy over. So, it appears for now that the agreement is back on. It's much more limited in scope than certainly we thought earlier in the day, but it does come at the end of a lot of drama within this courtroom where the judge had to recess the proceedings to let the two sides try to figure out whether they actually understood what Hunter Biden was agreeing to.

I think my question to you and I think my real concern is that the pace of the effects of climate change are really troubling. So, if you look at some of the weather events we're seeing this summer, compared to last summer, compared to the previous summer, it seems to be getting way worse, far quicker than I anticipated. And so, even though, you know, a lot of these global initiatives are working and we're reducing carbon emissions, are we doing it quickly enough, Marcy?",

And one of the things I think a climate optimist needs to do is use all ofthese impacts that we see that are very scary and use them as motivation to get involved, to be part of the fight, and to seek out actions that are happening around us where we can get involved and make a difference.",

In fact, there are everyday people like you and me getting involved in larger efforts alreadyunderway that are making huge differences in their local area. So, this is an instance where we should look local and look around to see what's available for opportunities to get involved. So, some of the most impactful work that you can do is advocate for policies in your local area that will make it easy to bring green energy and energy efficiency initiatives to your area. So, things like easing the way for wind and solar farms to get built in your town or making it easier for people to install rooftop solar or build community solar programs or installing more EV cheap, EV chargers around your neighborhood. Oftentimes, these initiatives require champions on the ground pushing for policies that are going to make these things successful and that's where we come in, that's where we can make the most impact.",
