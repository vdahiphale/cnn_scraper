The tough talk came into Washington media dinner. A big question now, whether Pence repeats it when he's with GOP voters in Iowa, New Hampshire and beyond.And President Biden green lights a giant oil project in Alaska. Progressives are mad. Again, the drilling project follows Biden moves on crime and immigration that suggest an early move to the middle with an eye on 2024. Up first for us though, a pair of bank failures and a White House emergency plan. The president says, we'll protect the economy but not at your expense. President Biden speaking this morning before U.S. financial markets open for trading and before most banks open for business. His goal makes the case to Wall Street and yes to Main Street, that he and his team are on top of things and that you should be confident your money and the overall economy are safe. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRES. BIDEN: Americans can have confidence that the banking system is safe. Your deposits will be there when you need them. Every American should feel confident of their deposits will be there if and when they needed them. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The president's words this morning were deliberate and very intentional and effort to provide assurance to Americans who are, I think, understandably very anxious based on what they've seen over the course of the last several days. But also try and walk the political line here. The administration officials are keenly aware that they have to balance.On the first point when you talk to officials that have been involved in this real sprint over the course of the last several days, they made clear. They move very quickly. And they move very dramatically to try and basically nip this in the bud before it started to expand. And this is interesting in the sense that this is not the type of bank that you would traditionally think. And Silicon Valley Bank would be one of the systemic banks that threatens the entire industry. And yet, as officials watched the market and reaction play out over the course of several days, listen to what they were hearing from investors, people on the ground. The concern was both real and palpable, and they decided to move and move in a major way in terms of backstopping those insured deposits over the limit of $250,000, as well as opening that federal reserve lending facility. However, they are cognizant of the political dynamics here and the president made clear, he is as well. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRES. BIDEN: No losses will be borne by the taxpayers. And we repeat that, no losses will be borne by the taxpayers. The management of these banks will be fired.

And yet, perception drove what we saw on Friday, perception threatened many more banks beyond just Signature and Silicon Valley.Administration officials are clear, what they triggered over the course of the weekend was big, and it was important. And it was not just symbolic, but it certainly was a dramatic backstop here, both for lenders who are in trouble to some degree, or who are on the verge of being in trouble, as well as those depositors who were very concerned about their ability to make payroll over the course of the next two days. That said, they're watching the market very closely. They recognize. It's going to be a bumpy couple of days here, perhaps longer.

What we have now is a lot more visibility and what banks are doing.The Fed pays a lot more attention to this stuff. These banks are mostly regularly stress tested. I think the similarity though, is that we watched a lot of sort of known risks grow in plain sight, you know, this bank, in particular wasn't part of the regular stress testing cycle. You know, some of these midsize banks that we sort of looked at as not particularly problematic are turning out to be actually, you know, pretty problematic, pretty system wide threats as they crashed down.",

But we can see from the market reaction this morning, that not everyone is feeling very calm about this.We're expecting a lot more volatility in the markets, because people are wondering a couple of things. What are some of the other a hidden risks that are out there that emerged like Silicon Valley Bank unexpectedly, because of the pressure of the Fed raising interest rates over the past year. And the other really is whether or not there will just be some human reaction where people and business owners say, I'd rather move my money to a bigger bank. KING: Right. And so, I didn't mention this at the beginning. But you're out with a very timely new book. Obviously, we were talking about last week, during just the uncertainty, the volatility in the economy right now. And the Fed being central to it. What tools limitless is the title of the book, the Fed can print money on a limitless basis? What are the tools are you watching right now? As they're implemented that tell you, OK, they seem to think they're in control of this, whether it's the Fed or the FDIC.

The Obama administration inherits the fallout from that. But when the president says, you know, the taxpayers will not pay for this, and the people at these banks will be fired.The people out on Main Street, if you think back to 2008. If you asked 20 Americans on the street, it's not quite this simple. But most Main Street Americans would say, the bankers played with monopoly money, and I got the bill.

But if your deposits are there, you're safe. But as Jeanna was saying, there's certainly a risk here that people are identifying that it could have grown faster than they wanted to if they hadn't gone in last night. And to your point about FDIC insurance, I think that's another thing that's going to come up quickly on Capitol Hill, which is whether or not that limit of 250,000 is too low. We should raise it even though as Jeanna was saying, the Fed has come in and basically said, we're backstopping fully everyone's insured and uninsured deposits.",

He's not talking to the base. He's talking to the media. He's talking to the people that will be listening. And he wanted to. And I think Mike Pence would appreciate this. I'll take you to Sunday school a little bit. You know, he wasn't at - he was given these statements, but he wasn't hot or cold. He was lukewarm. And he needed to get off the fence, right?
