But he also said, when you get down -- \"When you get knocked down, you get back up again.\" And he received roaring applause to that line as well. Clearly acknowledging that he was knocked down on the debate stage last night and that there needs to be a reset. But President Biden today was animated. He was high-energy here at the North Carolina State Fairgrounds. And it appeared that he was using many of the lines that he used onstage last night. But also using many that appeared to have been drafted for the debate but did not get used. He talked a lot about how, I would tell the truth, how Donald Trump -- Donald Trump, in his words, it's a one-man crime wave with no respect for women, for the law.

How does he get out of the mess he got himself in? Well, we just got the answer. That was an extraordinarily energized speech. It was an entirely different Biden than we saw last night, almost two different people. A lot of the messaging was the same and some of the lines we're the same, but they we're delivered with the verb. And I thought Jill Biden introducing him and wearing her \"vote\" outfit and having the feedback, the given and take for four more years and, \"Yes, you can,\" coming out of the audience was reminiscent of an Obama rally. So that's about as good as you're going to get for the beginning of a rebound from the debate. And we just caught it live.

Because very clearly, after last night, it is not Joe Biden. And this is a discussion that should be up for debate between now and November. He can't run the country. He's not running it now. He can't run it possibly after November. And so the choice between either of them couldn't be any clearer.
