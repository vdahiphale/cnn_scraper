We're looking right now at live pictures of the newest one, the Sunset Fire. It has broken out in just the last few hours and is burning on the top of the iconic Hollywood Hills. People are being urged to evacuate.And elsewhere in L.A., the situation is no better. The descriptions from our reporters on the ground and the people they've been talking to tell you everything you need to know about just how bad this all is. They say it's beyond comprehension. They say the scale is gigantic. Residents tell us their neighborhoods are now unrecognizable. Many people have lost everything. These are where the six fires are burning right now. The Palisades and Eaton fires are the biggest and most destructive, scorching thousands of acres and forcing tens of thousands of evacuations. The Eaton Blaze has killed at least five people. That inferno is sweeping across the community of Altadena. Anderson Cooper says the houses there are systematically being destroyed one by one as the embers spread. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Here is a satellite picture of the Eaton Fire just this morning. It shows nearly every building in western Altadena on fire. In the Palisades, the destruction, it's immeasurable. The fire there has destroyed at least 1,000 structures so far. Homes now smolder and rubble. Restaurants, businesses lost. A public library totally destroyed. Multiple schools significantly damaged.And these fires, they are sparing nothing. They're impacting communities from all walks of life and destroying places people visit every single day. Here's a Starbucks in the Palisades just before the fire. Now, this is what it looked like when it was ravaged by flames. It's now just a husk of charred cement, only a frame of what it once was. Here, the entrance of the Will Rogers State Beach in the Palisades. And then, the apocalyptic scene when the blaze came through. Palm trees aflame. This is what once was the Altadena Community Church. Here it is just hours ago. Flames bursting through the windows. And these are homes in a neighborhood along the Pacific Coast Highway before the inferno. This is them after. Covered in smoke. Nothing but rubble. CNN's Bill Weir is live in Pacific Palisades. Bill, this sixth fire, sixth fire breaking out now in Hollywood Hills, it's very worrying, as are the others. What can you tell us about this?",

Unbelievable.Your team actually captured aerial images of the Palisades Village earlier today. I mean, structures still, Bill, engulfed in flames. What are those conditions like right now?",

They've been, you know, restricting drone flights, not to interfere with the firefighting aircraft, of course, who were very careful to stay low to the ground when we were allowed to fly there, just to get a sense of things.And it just reminds me of what happened in Paradise and what happened in Lahaina, Maui in which total devastation -- just block after block has been gutted by flame. And they lost two of their groceries, their two major grocery stores, two schools. A library here just in this block that I'm surrounded in. You see the embers behind me of what was the Lurie Art Gallery, brownie shops. This was a UPS store, doctor's offices around. It's so devastating. You know, Paradise, I just went back there five years after. That was historically the most devastating fire in recent history in this state. Only about a third of the people remain. They came back to rebuild, and they had to rebuild in a whole new way. The people who were there really want to be there, but they had to rethink their relationship with the land, and that certainly will be the case in a place like this. The Palisades, 100-year history, settled by Methodists like a century ago, and then a lot of Jewish intellectuals fleeing World War II settled here. So, it's this really beautiful melting plot, very aspirational real estate. A lot of folks in the entertainment industry living in these million-dollar homes. But there's also the waiters and the cops and the teachers as part of this community who may not be able to afford the fire insurance that comes with living in a place like this right now. So, all of this mounting sort of economic stressors on top of the infrastructure, on top of knowing where your kids are going to go to school next week, all of these communities have to wrestle with that in real time. And none of these are contained. That's the thing, Laura.",

And so those are built for residential use and that usually supplies the city of Palisades well.So -- but they're not designed for urban wildland firefighting for 15 hours straight. So, you can imagine all the water that that pulled out because they're not part of a main system because of the terrain, because of the steep hills and the windy roads and things like that. That what works for that community, but they aren't really built for that type of excessive use. So, as soon as that started dwindling, I think it was Department of Water and Power who came in, and they helped filled up those tanks. They're really trying to pull that all together and get those hydrants all working again. And the ones way up needs more pressure, need more volume, so it took a bit.

We just constantly were tweaking and we loved it and cherished that house. Our kids were raised there. Four days ago, my daughter said that she wanted to raise her kids in this house.It's that kind of a place to us, obviously, way before these fires happened. And it's just -- you know, and I'm sure many people can relate, it has got so many memories. [23:35:03] We're so grateful for so much. We're so grateful that we can rebuild a lot of the things. We're so grateful that we're all healthy, obviously. But there's just so, so much that you can't replace. And you don't really feel that until you go through it. You know, when you go through it.
