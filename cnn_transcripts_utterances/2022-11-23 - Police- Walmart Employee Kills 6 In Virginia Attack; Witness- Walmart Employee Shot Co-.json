Bullets interrupted the normal routine of picking up roasting trays, box stuffing and employee shuffling on and off the floor at this Chesapeake, Virginia Walmart. This hour six are dead. Four other victims are hospitalized, their conditions unknown. Police giving few details so far. The gunman a Walmart employee entered a break room and then opened fire with a pistol.

There was a woman who was a survivor of this shooting, Briana Tyler. She told ABC News that this was a manager who she had been told to \"look out for because there was always something going on with him, just having an issue with someone.\"Briana Tyler said that she had gathered with co-workers in a break room on Tuesday night for their shift that she looked up and her manager opened the door. At that point, they saw the shooter opening fire. He wasn't aiming at anyone specifically according to Briana Tyler. He did not say anything as he moved around the room shooting at people. Here's a quote from Briana Tyler. \"He looked directly at me but luckily he missed my head by an inch or two.\" Again, she's telling ABC News that this was a manager who she was told to look out for because there was always an issue with him. Police filled in a couple of other gaps for us too, as well, John, as well as law enforcement sources. Police saying that this shooter used a pistol in this attack. They're not aware of any other weapons that he used. The timeframe from when first 911 calls came out at 10:12 pm Eastern time from the time that police entered the building, four minutes enter the building at a 10:16 pm Eastern time and secure the building a safe 11:20. But I can tell you that the overnight hours police were taking a long time to get information to report because they were still combing through this building for hours, looking for anyone who might be a survivor, anyone who might be hiding. A lot of places to hide in a Walmart and they had to take several hours to process the scene. John? [12:05:00] KING: Brian Todd live for us at Chesapeake. Brian, appreciate to be on the scene reporting. Let's get some more insights. Now joining me the former homeland security official Juliette Kayyem, and the former federal prosecutor and national security analyst Carrie Cordero. Juliette, let's listen more to Briana Tyler.

Those are people who are used to, that's a generation that's used to the idea of mass shootings in a way that I think even people in their 40s and 50s are not talk to anyone in their 20s and 30s. And they call themselves generation lockdown for a reason.And they're also in shock. So, I think that their sort of description that may seem a little bit off putting right now to us. It may be just they haven't even processed what they were so close to. So, the investigation is actually narrowing. Last night it was all through the evening. He didn't know what it was, and Walmart's are large. We don't know what kind of shooter it is. It now appears that they - he's known. The reason why he was at that store, you know, maybe we don't know the triggering event. We know the weapon. And the victims are in isolated group, unfortunately. So, the investigation will mostly - I mean, you have a dead killer. So, there's going to be no trial. So, the investigations mostly going to go to motive at that particular moment what issues he was going through. And then also what kind of supervising him? Supervisors know that he might be a danger. Did Walmart know those kinds of issues will be investigated as well?",

This is someone who worked there, walking in with a pistol. As you heard one of the witnesses saying a manager, she has been told to watch out for so anger issues of some kind. Is there anything here from a legislative standpoint? Is there anything that can be done about this?CARRIE CORDERO, CNN LEGAL &amp; NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Well, the difficult policy issue is whether or not the country or individual states want to try to restrict access to weapons. From a law enforcement homeland security perspective, this is mostly about trying to identify whether there are warning signs and having friends and family members to bring those to law enforcement. So that's something that Virginia state police, for example, want people to be able to bring individuals to them and bring warnings so that law enforcement potentially can have a better idea of how to prevent it. But you know, at the center for American security, we did a survey of a focus group of cross section of Americans to try to figure out what are people most afraid of, and mass shootings by far top the list. And when we were looking at the timing of when could we actually do this survey. We thought well, there was just the - we did it last summer, there was just the buffalo shooting. And then we looked at well, what if we would have waited a couple of weeks and we would have run right up into Highland Park in Chicago.

I don't know what kind of security they have at the door. But this was an inside threat. You're not going to be able to stop a manager who is, you know, hell bent on wanting to co-employees. So, we will continue to have a never-ending conversation about gun control, but I think period are also reflecting on a sort of, you know, I think we have to admit it that without that gun legislation, it is going to take a stepping up by community members, family members about whether someone in their midst is a threat. They have got to consider the rest of the community and not wish it away. This is where we are now in the absence of control over gun and gun usage and responsible gun ownership at this stage.",

The justices there, clearing the way for the House to get Trump's tax returns. Next, tough questions about Trump's legal strategy in the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case. In that hearing, three appeals court judges all sounded skeptical of Trump's argument that a special master should be kept in place to sort through those records.Plus, a state judge in New York set a trial date for the New York attorney general's lawsuit against the Trump organization. That trial now scheduled for October of 2023. Just in time for the presidential election. And there's more Senator Lindsey Graham was forced to testify before the special Georgia Grand Jury investigating Trump's effort to reverse the 2020 results there. And the former Trump Chief of Staff Mark Meadows lost a second bid to block the January 6 committee from enforcing a subpoena for his testimony and additional records. With me now to sort through this list. Out senior justice correspondent, Evan Perez, still with us, Carrie Cordero, CNN national security and legal analyst, and also joining the conversation our CNN crime and justice reporter Katelyn Polantz. Where to begin. Let's start with the taxes debate because Trump has fought for years to keep - he kept saying he was going to release, release, release. He has fought for years to keep his taxes private. The House now has them and in the Trump organization trial, the tax trial going underway in New York right now. The testimony said that he didn't pay personal income taxes for a long stretch of time. What is the significance of that? The Democrats lose the House in 41 days.

And that's the argument that the Justice Department is making is that in this case, the judge ordered the special master, gave former President Trump basically a special privilege, treated him differently than anybody else would be treated. And the Justice Department needs to think about all the other national security investigations and regular criminal investigations where they don't want that precedent set.
