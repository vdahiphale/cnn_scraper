We are monitoring the United Nations General Assembly this hour as itmeets to mark the second anniversary Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The anniversary is tomorrow. The Ukraine war and indeed the war in Gaza have sowed deep divisions on the global stage, most acutely between the West and the rest. Well, Israel joining talks in Paris aimed at negotiating a ceasefire and its war with Hamas and a potential release of hostages. So, should the war wind its way to some sort of conclusion, we are getting an idea of Israel's plan for post-conflict Gaza. Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is offering up a plan that calls for the complete demilitarization of the territory and the freedom of Israeli forces to operate freely to prevent new threats. Well, the Palestinian Authority says it's really a plan to reoccupy Gaza. CNN's Jeremy Diamond has been following these dual developments for us from Tel Aviv, and Natasha Bertrand is in Washington where the Biden administration has been pushing for progress in these ceasefire talks. So let's start with those talks. We know that there are parties meeting in Paris, Natasha. What more do we know at this point?",

However, we have not yet gotten confirmation that he is actually there, but also the president's senior envoy for the Middle East, Brett McGurk, he also was meeting with senior Israeli officials last night to discuss this potential plan, these hostage negotiations, so it remains to be seen just how much progress was made there. But U.S. officials are generally optimistic. They say it's a good sign, of course, that these talks appear to be moving forward, that they have been restarted now. And of course that this Israeli delegation is going to be going to Paris to discuss a potential hostage release. Now the sticking point here, of course, is really the details, how is this going to be, you know, panning out, because the U.S. has insisted that if there is any kind of Israeli incursion into Rafah in southern Gaza, then that is going to really upset the very delicate negotiations that are underway right now. And it remains unclear at this point whether Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is willing to discuss a more long-term ceasefire that would see the release in several phases of the remaining hostages in Gaza. So a number of sticking points here, including Hamas' demand of course that over 1,000 Palestinian prisoners be released from Israel. But the U.S. is scrambling right now to get this hostage deal done before Ramadan. They say that any Israeli incursion into southern Gaza at that point could further inflamed tensions in the region.",

And I think this would -- even though we haven't had further response at this point, this would be the feeling in the region. This plan, and of course it is the very initial plan by Benjamin Netanyahu does not allow in any shape or form a Palestinian state. And that is the crux of the issue here by saying that the Gaza Strip has to be demilitarized, a state is by its very nature able to defend itself. It needs to be militarized in some sense. So what we're seeing from this plan is counter to what we've been hearing in the past from the likes of Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia, for example, saying that it could normalize relations with Israel in the future if there are concrete plans for a Palestinian state, this plan does not allow for a Palestinian state at this point in the short term, and so from the regional point of view, that would be their feeling, that this would not be welcomed.",

And while we are going to hear soon for more sanctions from the Biden ministration against Russia, Russia appears to be on its front foot, certainly. And as the third year of this war gets closer, we were in Kherson where we saw the war begin and where Russia invaded in the first 72 hours, taking over that major regional capital to see exactly frankly how grim, how restrained, how repressed ordinary life is for people living in Kherson, at times just hundreds of meters away from Russian forces. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WALSH (voice-over): It's night when it's loudest. Kherson has seen every stage of the wars two years. Invasion, occupation and liberation, yet day is when the damage is clearest. Well, the Russians may be now on the other side of the river. But you can see the force of the explosions that hit here just by these tree branches thrown up here on top of a roof. And it feels kind of like a remote occupation through Russian drone strikes, artillery attacks as well. So many of the buildings around here devastated. (Voice-over): But Russian positions are visible across the water. And on this side, freshly dug trenches show how worried Ukraine is still. Across the river, Ukraine sent troops months ago. Their hopes of a lightning dash to Crimea stuck in this rubble. And this week, Russia raised their flag over the tiny Ukrainian foothold of Krynky. Kyiv denied they've taken it and said drone footage showed the Russians fleeing. Yet just meters from the row, thousands of daily silent stories of survival in a city Russia cannot own, only crush with seemingly inexhaustible shelling. At 4:00 a.m., we've woken by three shells. They landed 100 meters away. They're saying that they are first hit in November, and that blew out the glass in this slide here.

Today, the announcement that the administration has pushed down on these sanctions marks the single largest sanctions package to date since Russia's further invasion into Ukraine. Now these over 500 targets include, for example, hundreds of entities involved in Russia's military industrial base. 26 third country entities facilitating Russian sanction evasion. And those companies go from China, Serbia and the United Arab Emirates. They're also announcing trade restrictions against more than 90 entities. And that's through the Commerce Department. The idea here, according to U.S. officials, is to choke off Russia, essentially slow down their ability to obtain certain goods and any goods that would also help them build weapons. Now, in a statement this morning, the president saying, quote, the following, \"These sanctions will target individuals connected to Navalny's imprisonment, as well as Russia's financial sector, defense industrial base, procurement networks and sanctions evaders across multiple continents.\" Going on to say they will ensure Putin pays an even steeper price for his aggression abroad and repression at home. Now, Becky, as you know the United States, along with other Western governments, has been imposing sanctions on Russia since the start of this invasion of Ukraine. Russia has remained undeterred. It has gloated in some instances about being able to push through these sanctions. But what the U.S. officials that I've talked to have said is that this is long term, this is hampering their economy, and will do so in the long term as well. But the other focus here at the White House is the aid to Ukraine that they're trying to get passed through Congress. That $60 billion in additional aid to Ukraine. Now the Senate passed a package that included those funds. The House is on a recess currently and has not budged on them, and it's unclear whether they will when they return. So the president here today is both pushing these sanctions, noting there's a consequence to Russian president Vladimir Putin for his actions, but also continuing the pressure on Congress to make sure that those funds for Ukraine do get passed is another necessary component to push off Putin's aggression -- Becky.",

Under Trump, that obviously wavered enormously. Trump rejected that vision and had a much more transactional vision of America's role in the world. But even during his presidency, there was a substantial remnant of traditional GOP internationalists who held the line and prevented him from both any administration and in Congress, and prevented him from doing some of the more extreme things that he talked about, such possibly leaving NATO.
