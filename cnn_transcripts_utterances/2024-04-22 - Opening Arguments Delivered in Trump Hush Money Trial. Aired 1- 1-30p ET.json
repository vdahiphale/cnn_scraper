Trump, the defense promising to puncture the prosecution's theory of the hush money cover-up case. Trump's lawyers painted Cohen as a liar and Stormy Daniels as an opportunist. The prosecution arguing that Trump's alleged scheme to keep an adult film actress quiet is election interference, pure and simple, in those words. I want to turn to Paula Reid and Kaitlan Collins, who are covering this, along with me, here in New York. About what we expected from the opening statements both by the prosecution and by the defense. We only heard a little bit from David Pecker, but we will have a lot more of him tomorrow. He's really an essential sort of start-off for this, framing the entire nature of the deal.",

Tomorrow, the judge is going to hear arguments about a gag order and whether Trump violated it. So, court is not even going to start until after 11:00. And it only goes until 2. There's no court on Wednesday. Then we will be back in session Thursday and Friday. But I would be surprised if they get to any other witnesses besides David Pecker this week. He's a great one to start off with. Not only is he a colorful New York character, but he helps the prosecution frame their argument that this was not just a one-off time when someone came looking for money to keep quiet about an affair. This is, they allege, part of a pattern, an effort to suppress negative stories about then-candidate Trump to help his chances in the 2016 election. And David Pecker can frame his efforts, his meetings with Trump. Even though he was not directly involved in paying Stormy Daniels, he can set the stage for the criminal case.",

We were certainly concerned about them. But the added complication is when it comes to the jury. Anything -- for example, Trump had at least one social media post where he was quoting a FOX host suggesting that there had been liberal activists planted in the jury pool, something like that. You know that is going to draw negative attention the jury. And the concern there is that, if the identities of these jurors are revealed and a critical mass of them no longer want to participate, there could be a mistrial. So I think, when it comes to this gag order, it is all significant. The judge has to find a way to enforce it, but the most significant thing for the integrity of this trial is protecting those jurors and their identities.",

And so the question is whether they didn't find out until later because of that very concern that the prosecution has and how they handle this going forward, because Trump's team made clear today they think that Stormy Daniels is certainly going to testify.

So the jury might be -- it kind of tickles in your head a little bit as to why, but the cover-up portion of it is going to be really key here.It's about why he did it. Was it for his family's benefit? Was it for his brand? Or was it because he wanted people not to be -- not vote for him? Also, it was election fraud, pure and simple. Here is where they're talking about the underlying crime that he was trying to avoid or trying to cover up actually committing. Also here is, so what have we done? Right now, we have ended testimony today so far with David Pecker, who, of course, is the head of AMI, who oversaw \"National Enquirer.\" He and another person allegedly corresponded with one another to say that, what had we done? Now their whole job is about something called a catch-and-kill. This is where you find Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels. Now, if you're the defense team, of course, a little bit different here, their key arguments that he was trying to protect his family, reputation and his brand. That's not a crime. Notice what you don't have there? Anything about politics, anything about the campaign. But to go to that very moment, he had this to say: \"There's nothing wrong with trying to influence an election. It's called democracy.\" Well, that would be nice if that was just a bare-bones reading of it. But, in fact, if you're trying to cover up a crime or trying to engage in election interference, that in fact is not democratic. Finally, use your common sense, where New Yorkers -- why we're here. This is where the jury selection becomes so important. Who is on this jury is going to be vital to trying to figure out how to make your best statements and your actual arguments. What they want you to look at is say what Trump had to say in front of the courthouse earlier, which was, listen, this comes down to this very bare-bones notion, a payment to a lawyer. I have noted it as a legal expense. That's all this is. And for that, I got indicted? They want you to think about it this way.",

Let's get right to CNN's Kara Scannell, who was one of the CNN reporters inside court all morning sending us these updates that we have been poring over. Kara, give us a sense of what the mood in court was as Donald Trump sat and listened to prosecutors, his own lawyers, and David Pecker.",

He was looking ahead. In front of him is a screen which shows the view in the overflow room that shows the bench where the judge is sitting, Trump sitting at the defense table, as well as the witness stand. So, Trump seemed to be watching himself watching the trial as he was looking and hearing the prosecutors lay out their evidence. When it was his attorney's turn, Todd Blanche, who got up to speak and say that Trump did not commit any crimes, that he is just like you and me, as a husband, he's a father, and that he was not part of any conspiracy, Trump was more engaged. He was turning, looking at the jury, looking at his lawyer as he was pleading his side of the events. And that is Trump's attorneys arguing that he was not part of any business record falsification, that he didn't know how accountants were booking these and noting these records in the general ledger, trying to distance Trump from the allegations in the case. He also spent a lot of time just trying to discredit some of the key witnesses before they even take the stand, notably Michael Cohen, saying that Michael Cohen was obsessed with Donald Trump and his entire financial livelihood depends on trying to take down Donald Trump. We didn't -- we saw Trump passing a lot of notes back and forth to his attorneys, but he didn't react in any audible way or disruptive way in the proceedings, which the judge has made clear he would not allow. When the first witness taking the stand is David Pecker, he is a longtime friend of Donald Trump's. When he walked into the courtroom, he actually came through a side door and walked right behind where Donald Trump is sitting on his way to the witness stand. Now, Pecker answered the prosecution's questions. They just were starting to set the table of what's to come, establishing what AMI is, American Media, the publisher of \"The National Enquirer\" at the time, and David Pecker's role, saying that he was the one that had the approval of any, as the prosecutor put it, juicy story, so just beginning to set up what will be the description of the catch-and-kill scheme that prosecutors allege this was all a part of and that all began in 2015 at a meeting at Trump Tower. [13:20:02] So, David Pecker, a key witness here, mostly, though, just setting it up. And then, when he left for the day, he walked past Donald Trump's table, nodded, smiled, said hi toward the table. We couldn't see from where I was sitting if Donald Trump reacted to that. But they are longtime friends. And Pecker said that he was testifying today under subpoena, and he has received immunity for his testimony in this case, Jake.",

      "sentences": "Well, I can tell you that, when the opening statements were being given, the jury's eyes were locked on the lawyer and the prosecutor who was speaking at that time.Right before openings began, the judge asked if any jurors wanted a notepad and pen so they could take notes, more than half of the hands in the box went up. So that took a moment for them to distribute the notebooks and the pens, so, clearly, the jury wanting to engage on this, wanting to take their own notes in the case. So we saw them paying attention then. And then, when David Pecker was testifying, it began with the prosecutor trying to establish certain things, indicating we're going to see some records of phone calls. And so David Pecker was asked to give the last four digits of about six different numbers. He confused one and laughed at times, and the prosecutor said to him: \"Don't worry. This isn't a test.\" And Pecker has a very loud laugh. So that was a moment of levity in the room, where we saw even Trump's attorney react laughing, but we couldn't see any change in expression on Donald Trump's face, but the jury, again, paying attention for about the 20 minutes or so that Pecker was on the stand. He will be back on the stand tomorrow at 11:00 a.m. to continue his testimony. Before that, prosecutors and the defense attorney, there will be a hearing over whether Donald Trump violated the gag order in this case by comments he has made about some of these witnesses.",

      "sentences": "All right, Kara Scannell, thanks so much. Appreciate it.Let's bring in presidential historian Douglas Brinkley. Professor Brinkley, good to see you. You said last year when Trump was indicted that this trial would be, in your view, a defining moment in U.S. presidential history. It's certainly unprecedented. Now that we are here, does it still feel as weighty as you thought it might be? DOUGLAS BRINKLEY, CNN PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN:  It does, but what one can always underestimate is how Donald Trump can use media culture to his own advantage. Very few politicians would do the courthouse step strategy, in the sense of he's using it as a podium and a fund-raising opportunity. And I also think underreported, Jake, is the Palm Beach crowd of Pecker and Trump and others, Newsmax. They had formed their own Cayman Island-like financial enclave down there. These are a lot of global pirates finding ways to hide money and know each other's secrets. So the thought that Pecker is going to somehow stick a knife into Donald Trump and then say howdy to him down in Palm Beach next week, it seems to me unlikely. But we -- at all costs, we have got to remember, and as you're rightfully doing on CNN, this has nothing to do with Joe Biden right now. This has nothing to do with Donald Trump's reelection. This has to do with very likely guiltiness on Trump for business fraudulence and for hush money payments, which could have very easily, this act, have changed a presidential election. So the stakes are high. Trump wants to just use New York as a stage, whether it's at a bodega or at the court, and then, looking at July 15, Milwaukee Republican Convention, when he feels he will fully own the Republican Party.",
