Tonight, Israeli settlers and far-rightpolitician Itamar Ben-Gvir march in the West Bank with tensions growing every minute. Four dead and another mass shooting in the United States, others critically injured. What we know out of Kentucky this hour. And then later, a controversial requests from the Dalai Lama. What he said to this little boy that has shocked many. But first, this evening. Palestinian officials call it madness that it could inflame the entire region. But Israelis who took part in a controversial march say it's just the beginning of retaking land they  believe belongs to them. Thousands of settlers marched to an evacuated outpost in the occupied West Bank today, as you can see there, under the heavy protection of soldiers. Too far-right Israeli ministers and some parliament members were among them, protesting their own government's policy that considers the outpost illegal. Palestinians in a nearby village protested the march, some clashing with Israeli forces. The Palestinian Red Crescent says 216 people were injured, some by rubber bullets. Elsewhere in the West Bank, mourners buried 15-year-old Palestinian boy killed by Israeli soldiers in a refugee camp near Jericho. Israel says its forces came under attack during a raid to arrest a terrorist suspect. So they responded they say, with live fire. I want to bring in our correspondent Frederik Pleitgen, he's following developments tonight for us from Jerusalem. Fred, good to see you this evening. So we've heard i believe from the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the last what? Twenty minutes or so. What did he say?",

In fact, he opened his speech that he gave tonight, which you're absolutely right ended just a couple of minutes ago, saying that Israel was, as he put it, under a terror attack. And then he outlined some of what he called very tough measures that the Israeli government has taken in the past couple of days, saying, for instance, that they hit both Hezbollah and Hamas targets last week, and of course, over the weekend as well. Then having hit Hezbollah target is certainly something new that the Israelis so far hadn't said before. What he also did is he took a couple of jibes at the predecessor government, and in fact, Naftali Bennett who headed that government. He has already tweeted, calling Netanyahu's speech disgraceful. But you are also absolutely right, Isa, that all of this comes in an extremely charged atmosphere, and you know, we were at that march that took place today by those settlers, and here's what we witnessed. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PLEITGEN (voice-over):  Amid an already highly-charged atmosphere, thousands of Israeli settlers marched in the West Bank to an abandoned settlement called Evyatar, demanding to open it back up. DOR LEVI, PRO-SETTLEMENT DEMONSTRATOR:  We're ready to fight for it, if it needs to be with our enemy, if it needs to be with our government, because nobody will disconnect us from this land.",

It was a mother and her two daughters, and the two daughters were killed in that crash. They were pronounced dead at the scene. And the word at that point in time was that the mother had survived, but was in very grave condition, now, she has also succumbed to her wounds. Her funeral is set for tomorrow, as you say, and that of course, is something that is extremely emotional, not just for the family, but also for this entire country.

The U.S. is in full damage control mode after highly classified intelligence made its way onto social media. South Korea says it will hold necessary discussions with the United States after the documents revealed a conversation between two senior South Korean national security officials. The U.S. Defense Department says an inter-agency effort is now under way to determine the impact. We are covering all sides of the global ramifications of this story.

Do -- does the U.S. believe Russia was behind it? What is the U.S. saying at this moment? KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT:  No, we really don't know who was behind this leak. We know that the Department of Justice is conducting the criminal investigation, you know, to figure out who was behind it, and to, of course, potentially bring charges. And then you have the Pentagon arm, which is leading the inter-agency effort to try and summarize the damage assessment here. You know, what damage was done by seeing this private U.S. Intelligence now opened into the public. But   when you do look through these documents, even though we don't know who was behind the leak, it does appear that they come from the same source. Someone who was able to gain access to U.S. Intelligence, because the United States does share intelligence with five eyes partners, of course, that's the U.K., Canada, New Zealand and Australia. But some of these documents that were photographed had markings that they weren't to be shared with any U.S. Intelligence-sharing partners. So that indicates that the initial source had access to the U.S. side, you know, of this information. The other thing to consider here is exactly what the diplomatic fallout is going to look like, obviously, there will be aspects of the U.S.-Ukraine relationship that will have to be looked at as Nick was discussing. But then there's the U.S.-South Korea relationship, the U.S.-Israel relationship, which are both under scrutiny right now, because there were elements of U.S. Intelligence related to both of those allies that were part of these documents. You should assume that these countries know that the U.S. spies on them. That is just part of U.S. foreign policy. It's part of what U.S. Intelligence officials do around the globe. But you have to also consider the state of the U.S. relationship with Israel or the state of the U.S. relationship with South Korea, to try and figure out how those countries are going to respond at this time, if they're going to really, you know, exercise this and make this a main topic of concern, or if they're going to downplay it over the course of the following weeks, we just don't know yet. And that's of course, something we're watching. The State Department spokesperson just told reporters here in the briefing that the department is communicating with allies and pressing to them that they are safeguarding U.S. Intelligence, of course, exactly how they're making that promise after this major leak is a question that we continue to ask.",

Officials say the lone gunman using AR-15 style rifle and is now dead. Police believe the shooter may have been a former bank employee. Shimon Prokupecz is tracking this story for us from New York. And Shimon, what more do we know unfolded here, and critically, who was behind this? SHIMON PROKUPECZ, CNN CRIME &amp; JUSTICE REPORTER:  Yes so, police have not yet identified the gunman here, but they certainly know who the person is. They believe there's some connection to the bank, whether it's a former employee or current employee, but certainly, some connection to the bank, and they're still trying to sort out why this happened. Sadly four people were killed, several others have been injured. Some of the people, thankfully, have already been released from the hospital. So there is some good news there. And really, police just described a chaotic and hectic scene the minute they arrived within three minutes. They -- of that 9-1-1 call, they arrived on scene and encountered gunfire. Ultimately, the gunman died. It's not clear if he shot himself or if police actually killed him. The key now for authorities obviously is to figure out what happened here and why and what really led up to this. But you know, yet again, we have another situation of a mass shooting here on the streets of really in this country in Louisville, Kentucky. And now authorities trying to figure out why? As you mentioned, the weapon here are the AR-15 style rifle commonly used in mass shootings. So now authorities are trying to figure out how he purchased that weapon or how he got his hands on that weapon, so that's all still very much under investigation at this point.",

So here's what happened, on the 20th of February, there was a   public event in Dharamshala, that's where the Dalai Lama has been living ever since 1959 in permanent exile. This young boy came up to him and asked him for a hug. The Dalai Lama invited him to stage, asked him to give the Dalai Lama a hug as well as a kiss on the cheek, the boy obliged. Moments later, the Dalai Lama pulled him closer and asked him to give a kiss on the mouth, and then he pulled his chin towards him and kissed him on the mouth. And then, seconds later, he looked at the boy, smiled and said, suck my tongue. Now this has led to massive outrage in social media, people have expressed their disappointment in the spiritual leader, they have called it outrageous. They -- some of them have called it disgusting as well. Because of the furor on social media six weeks after the incident, Isa, you had the Dalai Lama's office issue a statement of apology. I'm going to read from that because I do want to even talk about that in a moment from now. Just a few excerpts from it -- \"his holiness wishes to apologize to the boy and his family as well as his many friends across the world for the hurt his words may have caused. His holiness often teases people he meets in an innocent and playful way, even in public and before cameras\". Two things here, Isa, the first is for the hurt his words may have caused. They don't even speak of his actions here, which actually as scary, as worrying, as disturbing as the words that he used in the interaction with the boy. And secondly, his holiness often teases people he meets in an innocent and playful way. Was this really innocent? Was this just teasing the boy is the bigger question. And that's what child rights group and child activists -- child rights activists in India are concerned about. Take a listen in to what one of them had to say to CNN earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BHARTI ALI, CO-FOUNDER, HAQ CENTER FOR CHILD RIGHTS:  That's not the language that you use in a playful manner. You know, the children are, you know, playfully kissing each other, but you know, that's not the language they use even when they do it playfully with their parents or relatives or friends.

Ariane, first to you, I want to get really to the news that we just broke in the last few minutes that the Department of Justice has made a move. What have they done exactly and what's next? ARIANE DE VOGUE, CNN SUPREME COURT REPORTER (on camera): Right. Just five minutes ago, the Department of Justice went to this federal appeals court asking for emergency relief. It wants to put on hold that decision you were talking about, that basically said that the government's approval of that drug can be put on hold. Keep in mind, that approval was 20 years old. So now, in these new briefs, the Department of Justice is racing as fast as they can. The district court gave them about seven days to putting his decision on hold. So, they know the timing here is very short. They have filed and they said that that ruling, \"severely harms women.\" They want this appeals court to act quickly. But the problem for the Department of Justice is this appeals court is one of the most conservative appeals courts in the country. It is filled with nominees of former President Donald Trump. So, most people believe that this issue is going to land back at the Supreme Court. And keep in mind, it's less than a year ago since the conservative-leaning Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.

And in fact, in filings that we just got five minutes ago, we had two doctors who weighed in and they signed under oath that -- how safe the drug is, and how damaging it would be if it were no longer available. So that's the real thing here. You have a judge who did an unprecedented thing, in that he revoked the approval that is more than two decades old.

All they can do now is patients who were scheduled to come in, say, Monday of next week, they're telling them, you know what, you really should come in this week. But beyond that, they don't know if they're going to be able to use these drugs or not be able to use these drugs. And it's important to keep in mind, Isa, in the United States, 53 percent, about 53 percent of abortions are done with pills. They're medication abortions, not surgical abortions.

There are these different aspirations, so they were never merged. And you sort of see in some areas, where The Troubles were at their height during back in the day before the peace agreement, you see young kids getting engaged again, in violence. We saw that in Derry today. It was the older men in the crowd that were directing the younger boys, some of them looked like they were school age, who are carrying the petrol bombs, directing them where to go with the petrol bombs and to throw them at the police when the police came on the scene. The boys did it without, you know -- quite happily, they feel very happy about what they were doing. They weren't forced. But it's that idea that another generation is bringing into this very young generation who were born a long time after the Good Friday Peace Agreement, sort of, repeating a cycle of violence. And it's, to me, no coincidence that in that city of Derry, you have the young schoolgirl in the story there who was beaten in a sectarian way. When you have young kids of school age throwing petrol bombs at police, it spills over more broadly. And I think that's an unease about the situation here that a lot of people are aware of and worry just doesn't get worse and gets addressed by conversation.",
