Last week, of course, it was Tampa for the president here in Duval County, which is a county that the president won back in 20.The first time that a Democratic presidential candidate was able to win this county since 1976. They are going to try to replicate that and that success all across the country. Of course, here in this county, one of the reasons for that success was turning out the black vote, something that, again, they're hoping they can do successfully in other parts of the state and other parts of the country as well -- Alex.",

When did they actually make the call for assistance for them to come in? That does need to be investigated because basic response, law enforcement response to any type of protest activity is first ensure that everyone's First Amendment constitutional rights are protected.However, the safety of the general public and the protesters need to be, you know, a priority for law enforcement. And part of that is ensuring that disparate groups, opposing groups are separated so that there are not these types of clashes. You can have disagreements, you can have different points of view around topics, but what you can't have is things escalate into violence like we saw where people are getting injured. That is the responsibility of law enforcement, but it's predicated upon awareness that something is going on. And that falls back upon university officials to call in law enforcement before things get out of hand.",

Students, including there was there was a Jewish student who does not like the encampments does not feel particularly safe on campus, who said that as this violence started to happen, no one was stepping in. And then we also heard from a reporter with the Daily Bruin, who was among four journalists with the paper who were violently accosted by counter protesters. We also heard from her.So in that situation where she was saying that police were just standing by and not doing anything. What do you think about hearing that from those students?",

They needed to act to protect the public. That is the duty of law enforcement, right?It's to maintain civil order and suppress the criminal element. Those tenants are reinforced during these times of tension when you have groups protesting. So that actually has to be investigated. I can't defend the actions of the administration or of law enforcement because I just don't know all of the facts. However, if these are the accusations that are being made, government officials, investigators need to look at what exactly happened because that is unacceptable.",

Even Donald Trump doesn't want her to follow through. I'm told that he communicated to the head of the RNC that he wanted him to relay to the House Republican Conference during a meeting yesterday that Trump wants to see the party united ahead of November.But so far, that has not deterred Greene. She's planning to call up this motion next week. When that happens, leadership is expected to quickly tee up a vote to kill or table that motion. And it is expected to fail, this motion to vacate the speakership, because Democrats are vowing to step in and save Mike Johnson from that threat. But supporters of the motion to vacate say they want to still put every single member on the record even as other Republicans warn that now is not the time. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. THOMAS MASSIE (R-KY): I think the main thing that we'll get out of next week if we don't succeed is a list, a list that people can use when they go to vote in primaries and general elections, both on the Democrat side and the Republican side. REP. MATT GAETZ (R-FL): No one is taking much exception with those substantive critiques, but in terms of the timing, I think we've got to be sensitive to the calendar and the realities. REP. RALPH NORMAN (R-SC): Marjorie had every right to do it, but it's not the time. Who's in line to take over? Who wants the job? (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, what the reclassification might look like, Alex and Brianna, we know that the DOJ is planning to reschedule marijuana from being a substance, one substance to being a schedule three substance. And here's what that looks like. Schedule three substances include drugs that are seen as having a currently accepted medical use.These are drugs that are seen as having less potential for abuse than substances in schedules one or two. And this would put marijuana in the same schedule as drugs like prescription ketamine or Tylenol with codeine. And currently, the way marijuana is scheduled is as a schedule one substance. Under schedule one, drugs are seen as not having current medical purposes. They're seen as having high potential for abuse. So that's the shift that we could see play out. But I will say, Alex and Brianna, with this plan, we still need to see it go through the formal rulemaking process. We need to see this finalized, published in the federal register. But once that happens, this could take months. But in the coming months, if we see this play out, it can mean that rescheduling marijuana from schedule one to schedule three would make it more easily accessible as a form of medicine. It would make it more easily accessible for science and research. And this could have implications for businesses in the cannabis space. So this is an area to watch in the months to come as these discussions continue around how we see marijuana scheduled and how we view it and interact with it as a substance -- Alex and Brianna.",
