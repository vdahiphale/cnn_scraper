And they have been highlighting this contrast for several weeks now, with President Biden taking a sharper attack against his Republican rival, even saying on Twitter a sarcastic congratulations to Donald Trump when he sent out a message about winning all of the golf tournaments that he had won at his various resorts. So, certainly, this was a common refrain from the Biden campaign. And they take every opportunity they can to show the president in a jovial and upbeat mood. But there were also some more serious moments in the conversations. There were no press inside. There were no cameras that the press were allowed to have inside. But, in speaking to attendees, there were some moments where President Clinton, I'm told, talked about how the economy was very good under President Obama and President Trump has been allowed to take credit for that and that he will likely take credit or attempt to take credit for President Biden's historic job creation in his first term. And there was also quite a bit of conversation about the stakes in the race, which has been a recurring theme from the Biden campaign. And here's one of those additional clips on that topic.

This is the choice for president. We will look now, right? We have got no clear leader, but Donald Trump at 47 percent, Joe Biden at just 44 percent. Compare that to where we were four years ago at this point. What a different picture. Joe Biden was clearly leading in that campaign 50 percent to 43 percent. He never trailed during the course of the 2020 campaign. And now we're in a situation in which we're in a very tight race, although Trump with a nominal advantage, 47 to 44 percent. Now, I will note that obviously we have Trump versus Biden, but we also have some third-party candidates. So here's the two way race, right, Trump 44. And then we have Biden at 43 percent in my own average of polls. And then we're looking here at the third-party candidates and what do we have? We have Trump at 41, Biden at 38, and then, look, RFK at 13 percent. But the fact is, there's no real difference that's going on here. There's this whole idea that RFK may in fact make a major difference in this campaign. But what I'm seeing right now is that it's basically the same campaign, even if Kennedy is pulling 13 percent of the vote, quite a significant share for a third-party candidate, in fact, the highest- polling third-party candidate at this point dating back since Ross Perot in 1996.",

And, right now, obviously, we have Biden and Trump in a race in which there's no clear leader, a very, very tight race, right? Things can definitely shift. Look at where we are, how far the polls have been off at this point from the eventual margin since 1972. In the average election cycle, the polls have been off by an average of six points. Look at the biggest difference, a 21-point difference. Jimmy Carter was blowing Ronald Reagan out of the water at this point in 1980, blowing him out of the water. And yet, of course, Ronald Reagan easily won that campaign. So the polls can definitely shift. Yet, at this particular point, you have to say that it is advantage Trump, because we talk about the popular vote, but, of course, it's the Electoral College that really matters. So here's the race to 270 based on recent polling and past results. Look at this. Trump is ahead. He would win at this particular point with 283 to Joe Biden's 225, with Trump flipping such states at this point, Michigan, where he leads, Nevada, where he leads, Arizona, where he leads, and Georgia, where he leads, all states that Joe Biden carried last time around. But now, if you're looking at that state polling, it's a completely different picture, which matches what we're seeing nationally with Joe Biden, in fact, probably trailing Donald Trump at this particular point, compared to that four years ago, where, of course, Joe Biden had a clear advantage throughout the entire campaign.

We were told by an official at the command center that they werehoping to get it operational later today, so it could start that work of clearing some of the debris. But that timeline is really fluid at this point. We understand two more, at least, of those vessels are coming to the scene as we speak, that according to the transportation secretary, Pete Buttigieg. But this is going to be a tall task. Engineers are still trying to figure out how they are going to cut all of that steel and concrete into smaller pieces, so they can actually remove all of that debris from the river. And look, they're going to have to do this really carefully, delicately, and sensitively, because there are concerns that those four missing construction workers may be buried underneath some of that rubble. And once this operation is complete, they're hoping that they can send divers back down to recover them, so they can bring some closure to their families. So, the more that we go through this process, it does seem like this could take days, if not weeks, Kristin. Meanwhile, the Port of Baltimore seems to be almost shut down, with thousands of jobs at risk, potentially millions of dollars in a hit to the local economy here in Baltimore between salaries and business operations. So, this is a major step forward with this crane arriving. But, look, the scale of pulling all of that debris out and then moving that ship, which is about the size of the Eiffel Tower just on its side, it could take quite a long time.",

That news conference is going to be held by CASA. It's an organization that provides aid to immigrant families, to Latinos as well. And they will also have at this press conference other construction workers from the Maryland area who plan to stand in solidarity with those who were lost. Kristin, I want to also say we're learning more identities of some of the six victims who are feared to either be presumed dead or have already been found dead. First, there's Maynor Yassir Suazo Sandoval. We have mentioned him. He's from Honduras. We spoke to his brother earlier this week. Miguel Luna, he's from El Salvador, lived in Maryland for 19 years. He was actually a member of that organization CASA. And then the new name that we learned over the past 24 hours is Jose Mynor Lopez, also a husband and a father. And then the two people who already have been recovered,they were pulled from a pickup truck down underneath that wreckage of the bridge, were Dorlian Castillo Cabrera and Alejandro Hernandez Fuentes. But, Kristin, I just want to say there have also been stories of two survivors who managed to be on that bridge and come away with their lives. The governor of Maryland, Wes Moore, he actually described a conversation that he had with one of those survivors. Take a listen to how he characterized that conversation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. WES MOORE (D-MD):  One of the survivors who I had the opportunity to speak with, one of the things he mentioned to me was, as he was moving off of the bridge and literally saw the bridge fall right after he moved off, it was because it was a first responder who was telling him to move off of the bridge.

I want to read to you a part of that statement. He said: \"Shortly after his,\" Evan's, \"wholly unjust and illegal detention, he drafted a letter to his family from prison, writing: 'I am not losing hope.' As I have told Evan's parents, I will never give up hope either. We will continue working every day to secure his release.\" Now, what we know is that, in December, there was, according to the State Department, a new and significant offer that the U.S. put on the table for Evan and also Paul Whelan, another American who's been wrongfully detained in Russia for more than five years now. That proposal was rejected by Russia. The State Department this week not updating us as to if there have been any other back-and-forth since that rejection by Russia. But, interestingly enough, earlier this week, we heard from the special envoy for hostage affairs, Roger Carstens. He spoke with our colleague Christiane Amanpour. He said that he's actually hopeful about the next 90 days, because Russia has actually just pushed forward this pretrial detention for another 90 days. He thinks it's possible that Russia sees a possibility of coming to an agreement to secure Evan's release before a trial actually begins. We will just have to watch and see. FISHER:  So, there's definitely hope. And they're hopeful. But as you were saying, I mean, this week, Moscow lengthened his detention until, I guess that would be June 30.
