Donald Trump, the overwhelming favorite of Iowa Republicans to challenge President Biden in November, winning by a historically strong margin. We saw Trump a short while ago thanking his supporters who appear undaunted by the former president's four criminal indictments, 91 charges in his 2020 election lies. They're giving him a strong headwind into the New Hampshire primary next week.Trump topping 50 percent with most of the vote counted. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis pulling off a needed second place showing in a state he was counting on to keep his campaign going. Former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, a close third. She looks to friendlier turf in New Hampshire, where independents can vote and the kind of Republicanism is more moderate. Let's go now to Jessica Dean, who is with the DeSantis campaign in Des Moines. Jessica Dean, what's going on there? They're off to New Hampshire.

They are going to South Carolina, an unconventional schedule on the way to New Hampshire. Usually everyone's getting on the plane right now and flying directly to New Hampshire. Instead, DeSantis has just added a second stop to an already planned first stop in South Carolina before he's going to head to New Hampshire. And advisers are telling myself and our colleague Steve Contorno that this is representative about where this campaign is headed, that the governor remains adamant he is staying in this race and he has trained his eyes on the state of South Carolina, where he and advisers feel like Nikki Haley is vulnerable.Of course, it's her home state. She was governor there. They make the case she hasn't been on the ballot in many --  in several years and that the voter makeup there is more of a DeSantis voter than it is a Haley voter. And to that end, we are told that campaign staff is moving from here in Iowa to South Carolina. They know that New Hampshire is not polling great for Ron DeSantis in their campaign. So, it is not a surprise that they are starting to divert a lot of their attention right now to South Carolina. But the big question in all of this, Jake, of course, is you need money to continue on, to continue forward. We know, according to sources that have told Steve Contorno and I that they will begin calling donors first thing tomorrow morning. But what I'm told by one fundraiser is that he came in second. It's a marathon. They have to get to South Carolina where they believe that DeSantis can knock Nikki Haley out. Now, that's a tall order. And there's a lot of ground to make up. As you mentioned, he came in a distant second place here in Iowa after spending millions and millions of dollars visiting all 99 counties and really putting in a tremendous amount of time and resources here. So, moving to South Carolina, it will be interesting to see if they can have a better showing there. With a little less time, a lot less time, frankly, months less time. But we do expect that he will really turn his attention there, that that's where they feel like this is headed. They also feel like, Jake, advisors and sources close to the campaign have told us they feel like Trump could be vulnerable should he be convicted of any of these counts that he's currently charged with.

And you know what I'm talking about. She's obviously into me, not only maybe the personal or character flaws that she sees, but also the idea of the baggage, the weight of all of it.

Iraq report at least four civilians were killed.Iran says some of the missile strikes were in response to the recent ISIS terror attack in Kaman near the grave of slain military leader Qasem Soleimani. The U.S. says no American personnel or facilities were targeted and that it supports the territorial integrity of Iraq. Well, meantime, Houthi militants in Yemen are sending a clear warning to anyone planning to launch an attack on the country. It comes after they claimed responsibility for attacking an American vessel in the Gulf of Aden on Monday. U.S. officials say an anti-ship ballistic missile struck a bulk carrier causing minor damage. Here's what a Houthi military spokesperson had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BRIG. GEN. YAHYA SAREE,  HOUTHI MILITARY SPOKESPERSON (through translator): The Yemeni armed forces consider all American and British warships and vessels participating in the aggression against our country as hostile targets within the bank of targets of our forces.

We saw the president tweeting some minutes ago that this election is about me versus extreme MAGA Republicans. The campaign said in a fundraising email earlier this evening that if Donald Trump is our opponent, we can expect endless lies. One Biden campaign advisor I was speaking with said, what tonight does is basically solidify and cement the idea that the Republican Party is the party of MAGA, and importantly, the party of the MAGA agenda.And they expect the party to sort of double down on all things Donald Trump going forward. You know, Erin, we've talked about this a lot. The Biden campaign fully expects that the very likelihood in November is that they are going to be going up against Donald Trump. But, you know, when I've spoken to campaign advisors, campaign aides, White House officials, supporters of the president over the last few weeks, you know, almost to a person, everybody says this is going to be a really tough race. This is going to be a really close race. And they are particularly sensitive to the fact that their economic message hasn't broken through. But I would say the big asterisk to all of that is that they say voters are not yet paying close attention. And they say that at some point when that changes, there is going to be a major reset of sorts. And, of course, what we're seeing tonight with Trump being projected the winner, he takes a big step in that direction. And the Biden campaign is very cognizant of that.",

So, first of all, overall tonight, the economy was the number one issue. Thirty eight percent of Iowa caucus goers said economy was the most important issue, followed very closely by immigration, 34 percent; foreign policy and abortion down there at 12 and 11 percent. So, let's look then. Among economy voters. Right. So, for that 38 percent that said the economy was most important, Trump wins 52 percent of them. He wins a majority on the most important issue for voters.DeSantis way back at 19 percent. That is larger than the overall 30 point lead. He has Haley at 16 percent among economy voters. Then look at this immigration voters again. They make up roughly a third of the electorate says it's the most important issue that they had on the top of mind with their decision tonight. Trump wins two thirds of immigration voters. Sixty four percent to DeSantis is 18 percent. That's a 46-point lead on the a dominant issue for Iowa Republicans. Haley down at 11 percent. And just to show you one slice foreign policy, it was a much smaller share of the electorate that made that their most important issue. Only 12 percent. But that is where Haley bested Trump. Forty five percent to 36 percent. There just weren't that many voters, though, John, who said foreign policy was issues on the economy and immigration, which, by the way, you hear Donald Trump talk about on the trail in his ads every single day.

It's a challenge, I think, for Democrats in particular, because Trump is not going to be easy to beat. He has a knack for consolidating.

And for them to have immigration as one of their top priorities stood out to me.But listening to Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley give their speeches where they both were touting how they finished here, even though neither finished the way that they wanted to, it also just shows it's a failure, at least certainly in Iowa. We'll wait to see what happens in New Hampshire of the Trump alternatives in this race. There have been many people who stepped forward and presented themselves and they were outright rejected to a large degree from these voters. And so, the question is whether or not that persists. But what we have seen is, is Donald Trump, at least just in Iowa, able to resurrect his political career after leaving the White House the way that he did with January 6th. He was being impeached. He was an outcast. He was an outcast with a lot of Republicans before Kevin McCarthy made his trip down to Mar-a-Lago.

So among Republicans, the vast majority of voters tonight, 69 percent say yes, only 27 percent saying no, he wouldn't be fit for the presidency. And look at this among independents on the same question. So independents are a much smaller share of the electorate, just 16 percent, but they're splitting evenly: 49 percent say yes, Trump still fit for office even if convicted of a crime; 47 percent say no. We also asked about whether or not folks think the Biden election in 2020 is a legitimate one, which we know it is, but among Republicans, 69 percent, seven in 10 say no, Joe Biden's election was not legitimate. They're wrong. It was legitimate. Twenty-five percent say yes. Again, among the smaller share, the 16 percent of independents -- And again, these are independents who are participating in a Republican caucus -- 41 percent say Biden was legitimately elected, but still six in 10 of these independents participating today wrongly say that the 2020 election was not legitimate, Anderson.

      "sentences": "Yes. All eyes move here to the tropical paradise that is New Hampshire, compared to Iowa. And based on what we saw tonight, obviously, former President Trump comes in with all the momentum based on his projected win there.But what's really interesting and what we're going to be looking for is a potential opportunity for Nikki Haley. Obviously, she's projected to finish third in Iowa tonight. But one of the reasons why she has a potentially interesting opportunity here in New Hampshire is that, when Chris Christie dropped out last week, who we were speaking to many of his now former backers, and many of them are ready to get behind Nikki Haley. And the reason why that's significant is because recent CNN polling had showed her pulling within single digits of the former president. And in New Hampshire, you get undeclared voters along with Republican voters that they can vote in the primary, as well. So you have a little bit of a wider pool. Now, the question, with all of that, is will that actually be enough to make a difference? We heard Nikki Haley talking about how she believes it is now a two- person race, despite again, finishing behind Ron DeSantis in Iowa. But depending on how she can do here and potentially capitalize on some of these Chris Christie former backers could actually solidify that into a reality. Now, it's easier said than done, because a lot of his supporters, as well, have also said it's not going to be so easy to win them over. One, we haven't seen any form of endorsement from Chris Christie, who some of these supporters said that would hold weight in swaying some of these folks. But also, some of the holdouts at this point believe that Nikki Haley should be going harder against Trump. It's why they liked Christie. It's what they want to see in Haley. And they -- and they were troubled by some of the comments in the past; in particular, saying that she would pardon former President Trump if he were in that situation, as well. So a potential opportunity for Nikki Haley to turn, again, what she believes is a two-person race into an actual reality. And that's why we've already got campaign events scheduled with her starting tomorrow. But obviously, with all of this, you're going up against a major force that we saw play out in Iowa in the former president, Donald Trump.",

We'll dig deeper on them.But as we go onto New Hampshire, this is exactly what Donald Trump wanted, right? So he goes onto New Hampshire with just what he wanted at stop one, Iowa. He's above 50 percent. His opponents are way behind him. Not only they are way behind them, they're fractured. No one candidate emerged as Look at me, the voters want me to be the alternative to Trump. So now as we move on, we're having the conversation -- the people at the table have been through this, right? Since 2015, 2016. Yes, but. Yes, Donald Trump did well, but we're going to a place where we're going to get them right? This is a conversation that has happened since then. Well, maybe that will be in New Hampshire, but let me do the \"but.\" Remember, that was his first win in 2016. He has a strong base there. Yes, he's vulnerable. Independents can vote, Democrats can cross over. Yes, he's vulnerable. The governor's on Nikki Haley's side. But remember this was the source of his first win in a fractured field. It's not as big as it was then. But North of Concord, that's Trump country. Rural New Hampshire, just like rural Iowa, that's Trump country. Can she beat him? Well, let's come back to the 2024 map and look. Can anyone beat him? Let's just look at that poll Omar was talking about. Forgive me for turning my back. I just want to stretch this out. Yes. Our poll, taken about a week ago, did show she's in striking distance. Then single digits, 39 to 32. Significant that he's below 40 percent there. Remember, he got over 50 in Iowa tonight. So you have him down. And Christie's now gone from the race. He was third. Right? So as Omar said, when you talk to Christie supporters, they're thinking maybe -- who are we going to go? Well, in our poll, this is the opportunity. Whether Christie endorses or not, 65 percent of his supporters in our poll said Haley would be their first choice.",

And whether it's going to be conservatives that show up next Tuesday or more independents. Now, I understand, Manu, that -- and I think Audie did raise this point earlier. The definition of an independent can mean anything anybody wants it to mean, right? A lot of people who identify as independents have really only ever voted for one party. I understand it's complicated. An Iowa independent's not necessarily a New Hampshire independent. But if you look at how Trump did among independents tonight in those entrance polls you've been looking at, he won them handily. Forty- seven percent of independents, self-identified independents, voted for Trump tonight. At least they said on the entrance polls, which is about in line with his overall performance.",

She does not have momentum coming out of Iowa.She had momentum over the last several weeks. You know, there were poll after poll suggests she was doing a lot better. Our poll showed her within single digits. \"The Des Moines Register\" poll that came out on Sunday did her absolutely no favors. It raised the expectations heading into today, because it said that she -- had her narrowly in second place. Now is third place, a distance third place. She's going into this state, this must -- almost must-win state with the views she's in third place. Despite her saying this is a two-man race, it is not a two-person race. That's going to be a real challenge for her. Yes, the electorate will be so significant. But if that is still a more moderate, more liberal electorate that comes out and votes, that's not going to be the case for primary state after primary state on the calendar after New Hampshire, which is the real risk from Trump.",

Even if it is a little bit of a boost, that could potentially help him, because Ramaswamy did say he's going with Trump to that rally tomorrow.And on top of Nikki Haley also not having momentum coming out of this, despite saying that it's this two-person race, as she framed it earlier, Trump had a decisive win in Iowa. It's not like he was beneath what the expectations were and she can use that to her advantage, which is something that her team and certainly DeSantis, as well, was looking for. It was him to be beneath that 50 percent threshold, to not do as well as his team had been predicting. And that is not something that she is going to be able to use. So I do think that's a real question. We don't know what's going to happen. But John King is right that New Hampshire was Donald Trump's first big win of the 2016 campaign. He still enjoys a healthy base there, and so we'll have to see what it looks like with that. But I will also note that, before he gets to that rally in New Hampshire tomorrow night, he's on the plane right now going to New York. He is going to be at the opening statements of that jury trial in New York for the E. Jean Carroll defamation trial. They've already found that he is liable for defaming her. They are deciding how much a jury will have to pay -- a jury will decide how much he will have to pay in damages.",
