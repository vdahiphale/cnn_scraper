      "sentences": "Hello, and welcome to CNN Newsroom. I'm Lynda Kinkade, we're following breaking news. The political leader of Hamas is Ismail Haniyeh was reportedly killed in Tehran. That's according to Iranian state media, which cites the country's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.You can see him here earlier today meeting with Iran's President just before the President's inauguration. Of course, he attended that and then he met with the Supreme Leader of Iran. In a statement, Hamas claims that Haniyeh was killed in a quote, Zionist raid on his residence in Tehran after that ceremony. There's no official word from the Israeli military. When asked for comment, only a brief statement saying quote, they don't respond to reports in the foreign media. Haniyeh was a longtime member of Hamas, joining in the late 1980s. And rising through the ranks over the years before becoming the group's political chief in 2017. We're going to go live now to Haifa, Israel and CNN Jeremy Diamond. Of course, this Hamas leader was once the Prime Minister of the Palestinian Authority. Jeremy, give us a sense of the response from the Palestinians.",

      "sentences": "Well, make no mistake this is an enormous moment in this now nearly 10 month long conflict. Ismail Haniyeh was not only Hamas' political leader, but he was also one of the chief interlocutors at the negotiating table over these ongoing hostage and ceasefire negotiations. He was a key voice at that table. He was viewed as a more pragmatic voice at that table.And now there are major questions about what the impact will be on the ceasefire negotiations and on the internal power dynamics within Hamas, but there's no question that overall among Palestinians, and particularly Palestinian leaders, there are outpourings of sympathy and praise for Ismail Haniyeh, including from the presidents of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, who, quote strongly condemned the assassination of the head of the Hamas movement, the Great Leader Ismail Haniyeh. In a statement, Abbas also calls this a, quote, cowardly act and a dangerous development. And he calls on the Palestinian people to unite in the face of what he describes as the Israeli occupation. Now beyond the impact on the ceasefire negotiations, beyond the impact on Palestinian political leadership, this is also a very tense moment in this region. And we have to ask at this hour, whether or not this will be yet another of multiple steps that we have seen over the course of the last week, that could potentially push this region deeper towards a potential all-out war. It is not that this is one step that would lead to that. But when you think about the accumulation of events that have happened over the course of the last week, this is certainly a major, major question. Earlier this week, Hezbollah carried out this crooked attack, according to Israel on the Israel occupied Golan Heights, killing 12 children in the Syrian Druze community of Majdal Shams. Israel within the last 24 hours responded to that with a targeted airstrike in the southern suburbs of Beirut that killed a senior Hezbollah commander. And now over the span of the same 24 hour period, Israel has apparently though it is not confirming or denying it has apparently carried out this assassination on Hamas' political leader inside Iran. And so those are two very senior leaders of two key Iranian proxies being killed in the span of less than 24 hours. And you have to think, how will Iran responds, how will Hamas respond, how will Hezbollah respond to and this puts a region that was already very much on edge now teetering, potentially further off of that very, very dangerous cliff of escalation.",

      "sentences": "Yes, well, as we saw after that Hezbollah rocket attack in the Golan Heights, there were calls for deescalation. There was an understanding from the United States in particular that Israel would have to deliver some kind of military response against Hezbollah, but there were also urgings to moderate that response to carry it out in a fashion that would not tip this region into all at war, a tip this long simmering conflict between Israel and Hezbollah into all-out war. And so you can make no mistake that in the wake of this there willalso be urgings on the other end for avoiding a further dangerous escalation. I assume that there will be back channel efforts with Iran, back channel efforts with Hezbollah as well as Hamas to try and limit whatever response will come here. But there is no doubt that Hamas will carry out some kind of response for this. The question is, will that come in the context of its war against Israeli troops inside the Gaza Strip? Or will it come in the form of further rocket attacks against Israeli towns and cities? And again, what will Hezbollah do? Hezbollah was already likely to retaliate for the killing of its senior, most military commander in the suburbs of Beirut last night. Do they feel compelled to escalate that response even further now that the leader of one of its key allies, a fellow Iranian proxy has been killed in an assassination in Iran? Just so, so many questions at this hour and developments that we're going to be watching very closely.",

He is the Middle East correspondent for The Economist. He's also the author of \"How Long Will Israel Survive? The Threat from Within.\" Good to have you with us. So within 12 hours, Hezbollah's military commander killed in Beirut and now Hamas leader assassinated what's your reaction? GREGG CARLSTROM. MIDDLE EAST CORRESPONDENT, THE ECONOMIST: I think the strike in Beirut, we all knew there was going to be some sort of Israeli retaliation for this rocket attack in Majdal Shams over the weekend. But I don't think many people certainly foreign diplomats that I had spoken to, were expecting that retaliation was going to come in Beirut, there had been a sense that the Israelis were going to strike perhaps elsewhere in Lebanon, but not strike the capital city. And so I think that took people by surprise and then waking up this morning in the regions of the news that Ismail Haniyeh was killed. That was, I think, entirely unexpected. He's someone who had been on Israel's hitless. I mean, I remember back in October, even speaking to Israeli officials who said Haniyeh was someone that they intended to assassinate for his role in October 7, but it happening today it happening in the context of everything else this week, was very surprising.",

They're in favor of making a deal with Israel, releasing some hostages and at least temporarily halting the war in Gaza. Then you have Sinwar, the leader of Hamas in Gaza, who has refused time and again, any efforts at a ceasefire deal. So I think a big question now is what Haniyeh is that there's going to mean for those ceasefire talks going forward, whether by removing someone who was an influential advocate for a ceasefire that makes it more likely that the internal leadership of Hamas, the leadership in Gaza, will continue to reject the deal.",

On the other hand, if you go back all the way to October 7, Hamas when they carried out their attack in Israel, they thought they were going to get direct Iranian support and big support from Iran's proxies across the region. They didn't really get that. Hamas was disappointed that Iran was not willing to go to war on its behalf. And I think something similar is likely to happen. Now there might be a face saving response from the Iranians. I don't know whether they'll do that directly, or do that through proxies find some way to lash out at Israel. But I don't think this is going to lead to a major escalation on Iran sparked, they are just not interested in going to war on behalf of Hamas.",

And so, he has tried to for 10 months keep all of Hezbollah as attacks on Israel, calibrated the state below the level of all-out war. And I think that is likely to be the case. Again, there's been some very tough rhetoric coming from Hezbollah about attacks on Haifa, attacks on Tel Aviv, you know, warning Israeli civilians that their big population centers might be targeted, but I don't think we're likely to see, you know, a big barrage of long range missiles aimed at Tel Aviv or something like that. I think it will be a lesser response to try and keep this below the level of fully fledged war.",

It will impact the negotiations. This is not a small event. Whoever did this, in that sense, has to take that into account. Ismail Haniyeh was not in the Gaza Strip. And I very much agree with what Paula was saying before that the one who calls the shots is Yahya Sinwar, who is in the Gaza Strip. His number to Mohammed Deif, at least according to Israel, in that sense, died or was killed by Israel in the last few weeks. At least he's disappeared.
