He says that Trump did engage in the insurrection, but should stay on the ballot. I'll explain why in a moment.But happening today, the Illinois election board will meet. Their meeting is supposed to begin any moment in Chicago. There's eight members on the board, four Democrats, four Republicans, it is bipartisan, and obviously you need a majority to take Trump off the ballot. They will be reviewing that recommendation from the retired judge, who himself is a Republican, Clark Erickson. He told the board that they should dismiss this challenge against Trump because based off his understanding of Illinois state law, the board does not actually have the legal authority to undertake a complex constitutional analysis of the 14th Amendment and its implications. But he went on to say that if the board does believe it has that power, that they should go all the way and remove Trump from the ballot. He said, based off of the evidence at that hearing that Trump engaged in the insurrection and should be removed, but it might be up to the board or the courts. Sara.",

And \"The New York Times\" just issued a report about an auditor or a judge who has been overseeing that empire during the trial, Judge Barbara Jones, who gave a report to Engoron that said, among other things, she found missing disclosures, typos, math errors, and questions about a $48 million loan between Mr. Trump and one of his companies.

Oh, maybe I can persuade you that there's no problem. But if not, let me fix the problem.Judge Engoron is about, to not only decide how many hundreds of millions of dollars of damages, but whether or not Donald Trump and the other Trump Organization executives can continue to do business in New York, right? You are regulated when you're a business in New York. The government has a right to do that, to protect consumers, protect lenders, and so on. They're basically showing by what they've been saying, they're not able to be regulated. They're not even responsive to this monitor who's been appointed to oversee them.

There's a lot of trench warfare, but also assaults and tank assaults, and we do have to warn our viewers, what you are about to see could be disturbing.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PLEITGEN (voice-over): All out warfare in unforgiving terrain. Forest battles in eastern Ukraine mean facing a near constant Russian onslaught. Vladimir Putin's army trying to break through Ukrainian defenses. Dmytro is one of those holding them up. The situation is very active and very tense, he says, because the enemy has much more equipment and manpower. Basically, every day they try to storm the positions. A dead Russian soldier and a destroyed tank showed just how close the Russians have come. It's a fight for survival and against the elements. The trench cold and soggy, the only heat coming from candles the soldiers cower around, gathering strength to face overwhelming Russian firepower. They shoot direct fire. Planes are flying. Basically, they have it all, he says. But probably the worst are tanks. When they fire, you don't even hear it. You hear an airplane when it comes over. With a tank, you're in God's hands. Artillery fire, another threat here, as we found out when we came under fire trying to make it to the area.",

PLEITGEN (voice-over): We believe a Russian drone spotted us and directed the artillery fire, but two can play that game. Naziriiy is a Ukrainian drone pilot. He guides Kyiv's artillery guns, targeting Russian infantry, but also armored assault formations, including main battle tanks. He says, ammo shortages mean he has to be extremely precise. It's no secret we're starved of artillery shells, he says. We try to work as efficiently and accurately as possible to hit the enemy's firepower. Trying to fight back any way they can on one of the toughest battlefields of this war. (END VIDEO CLIP) PLEITGEN (on camera): So, there you can see just how hard those battles are in the east of the country, John. But one of the things that the Ukrainians point out is they say, by and large, they are able to hold the line there. They say, within the span of just a couple of days, they managed to destroy around 40 Russian tanks and armored vehicles.

They're going to point to that and say, well, we need someone properly advising the president who isn't distracted. I think they're also going to say, perhaps the president's response isn't strategic enough. You've seen Senator Lindsey Graham say, we should bomb the heck out of them. That sounds great, Sara.

No one wants a wider escalation with Iran. We want to try and end this as peacefully as possible. But President Biden's, response to Iran just to say, don't, that's not a foreign policy strategy with a country and a force like Iran that is engaging their proxy partners in killing Americans. Whether or not we think we're at war with Iran, Iran is at war with America after they killed three American soldiers.
