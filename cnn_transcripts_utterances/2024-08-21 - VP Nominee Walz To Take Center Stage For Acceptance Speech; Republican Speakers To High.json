I'm Brianna Keilar and my colleague and good friend Boris Sanchez is in Washington.The DNC is entering day three with vice presidential nominee, Tim Walz, as the headliner. He's going to try to keep the energy flowing after last night's fiery speeches from Barack and Michelle Obama. Before Walz introduces himself to the nation tonight, prominent Democrats like Bill Clinton, Nancy Pelosi and Pete Buttigieg will also take the stage. And we have learned that parts of tonight - the part of tonight's programming will focus on protecting democracy. It's going to focus heavily on the January 6th insurrection and Trump's role in trying to overturn the 2020 election results. CNN's Eva McKend is with us now. Eva, what are the stakes for Gov. Walz tonight?",

The campaign telling us that he will uplift his small town values, that he will detail his career starting with a teacher and then becoming a congressman, governor and now running to be vice president of the United States.We'll also hear him talk about the importance of protecting fundamental freedoms. Freedom, of course, has become the battle cry of this campaign last night during that Milwaukee rally. All peppered throughout the arena, you saw banners that said freedom - replacing the banners that typically say Harris-Walz. That is because they are really confident in the strength of this argument, talking about reproductive freedom, talking about the significance of being able to live in your community free from gun violence. And then I'll end with this, Brianna: We're also going to hear a lot about January 6th, that horrific day. They're going to use that to argue that the former president is a threat to democracy, and they're going to have Republicans offer that message. And that is just an indication that they're not trying to leave any part of the electorate on the table. They want this speech to appeal to a broad base of Americans. Brianna?",

Their game plan is character assassination.No, I'm not worried about any of this stuff. Twenty-four years in service to your country as a National Guardsman is good service. They can try to nitpick something you said at one point or another. The bottom line is when he was talking about weapons of war, he was talking about how weapons of war don't belong on our streets and that we need to stop the mass shootings. That's the point. So I just asked my friends in the media to, you know, don't get distracted by every shiny thing that Republicans throw out there. I mean, the point about the weapons of war is about mass shootings. The point about his service is 24 years of it. I mean, the point about anything that he has mentioned is to the greater good of the public interest.

We can't have these kind of conflicts crop up every two years, as we have been for about the last 12, 13, 14 years.So they're working on not just a ceasefire, but a durable peace moving into the future. And I think that there's a lot of room around that. I think a lot of people want to see that. I also - and I can't speak for the Harris or Biden now, but I think that, you know, it's important to recognize that there is no diplomatic presence for Palestinians in America today.

And usually a convention is the end of a process. They've gone through an entire six months, a year of a presidential campaign, New Hampshire, Iowa, all the primaries. This one is the beginning of a process in a sense. And so to me, it feels more like a romance where you're in the first month. It's very intoxicating. You really like the person, but you haven't fallen in love yet and that's what I feel missing from this convention. They really want her to win. They really want to beat Donald Trump. But is the personal connection to Kamala Harris that there is normally to a new nominee of a party? No, I don't think so. And in fact, to be brutally honest about it, six months ago, there were a lot of delegates that are here and a lot of Democratic officials who were thinking, geez, maybe we could get rid of Kamala Harris and we'd have somebody else as a backup to Joe Biden.",

I have real questions as to whether, you know, hearing from Adam Kinzinger or some of the other people is going to is going to get those disaffected Republicans who aren't crazy about Donald Trump, but are conservative and are very concerned about how liberal Kamala Harris is. She has not even begun to address that yet. You know, the position she took in 2019 on Medicare for All, on mandatory gun buybacks, on the Green New Deal.

And today, in America, the bottom 50 percent of Americans have less wealth than they did when Ronald Reagan was president. They control 2 percent of the nation's wealth. The top 10 percent of Americans control 75 percent of Americans' wealth.So this is an important debate to have about inflation and whose policies are driving inflation, not driving inflation. The reality is that we are facing profound - a profound lack of economic mobility in our country. Donald Trump proposes to continue the trickle-down economics that got here, that gives benefits to the wealthiest people and imagines they're going to trickle down to everybody else. Kamala Harris leading with things like the child tax credit, which Sherrod Brown and I wrote, are about giving 90 percent of the American children a tax benefit to build the economy from the bottom up. So there's a lot of talk in here about Donald Trump being a threat to our democracy, and he is in my view, but I think he's a symptom of our problems. The real threat to our democracy is a lack of economic mobility. We didn't dig ourselves into this hole in the last four years. We dug ourselves in this hole in the last 40 years. It's going to take us, I think, time to dig us out, but we need to be focused on it and I think we can make a very persuasive case that what we're proposing is going to help a lot more families than what Donald Trump is proposing.",
