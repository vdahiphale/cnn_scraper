In a few court filing they say the deal they made with federal prosecutors to resolve a felony gun charge is still, quote, valid and binding. That's separate from the tax charges involved. It comes just two days after Trump appointed U.S. attorney David Weiss was appointed as a special counsel following the breakdown of those new talks.Just minutes ago the White House declined to weigh in on a special counsel appointment, repeating that President Biden wants the DOJ to be free from political interference and the president loves his son and he is proud that he is now working to rebuild his life. CNN's Kara Scannell is covering this story for us. So Kara, on this plea deal -- of course there are two pieces, one relating to taxes, the other to felony gun charges here. Attempting to resurrect one piece, what would that do exactly, if they were able to do that?",

They're known officially as runway incursions. This is the seventh such case involving a commercial airliner at a major airport we have seen since the start of this year.This one is interesting because it involves this private jet as it was coming in to land on runway 27 at San Diego International as this Southwest Airlines flight, a 737, was told to pull on the runway and wait there and stand by for takeoff clearance. What's so interesting is the FAA now tells us the air traffic controller in the tower cab heard alarms sound warning them of this potential collision and told that private jet to go around. To abort its landing and to climb back up and then come back into land later on. But now we're finding out from air traffic control audio, from live data tracker ATC.net where the private jet pilot actually noticed that this collision was imminent as well. You can listen here.

Was there some sort of atrophy of pilot or air traffic control skill over the pandemic when there was a downturn in flying. There is still no real common thread here. And the FAA has really tried to push pilots to sort of up their game, and air traffic controllers as well. And the Department of Transportation is putting in extra money in the system to try and avoid these things in the future. So we'll see, although these clearly keep happening.",

But he didn't like threaten him with an action.On the other hand, some say, look, he's clearly dissuading someone from testifying before a grand jury.

The court ruled that young people in the state have a constitutional right to a healthy environment. And that the state's failure to consider climate change when evaluating new projects was causing harm. The case could have legal reverberations for other climate litigation.

That could potentially contribute to some of this potential health risk we're seeing here. And with wildfires, they're seeing that, of course, they're becoming more frequent and more destructive and the way that they burn is just in this completely uncontrolled manner. So you're burning a lot of different chemicals. And that fine particulate manner we know can have a lot of troublesome health effects. And this is really concerning because according to the World Health Organization, 99 percent of the global population breathes air that exceeds the quality limits that the W.H.O. has set.
