A temporary pause in fighting is now in its final day, although there's a possibility it could be extended again. Hamas says it's in constant contact with Qatar and Egypt, who helped broker the deal.The militant group released 10 Israelis and two Thai nationals on Tuesday, and they promised to free ten additional hostages for every day of the truce. Israel released another 30 Palestinian women and children from its prisons as part of the agreement. Many of the prisoners Israel has been holding were never charged. Now dozens of newly released hostages and their families are also celebrating their freedom. CNN's Matthew Chance takes a look at their loving reunions. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The tears are of joy and of sadness. This is the moment Sharon Avigdori and her 12-year-old daughter Noam, kidnapped on October the 7th are reunited with their family. But they know friends and neighbors were murdered and that others remain hostages. Relief here is bittersweet. Israel is releasing this emotional footage of hostages freed by Hamas, traumatized women and children returning to shattered lives. Like eight-year-old Naveh and his sister Yahel, just three, now freed with their mother and grandma after weeks in Gaza, but their dad, Tal, remains a hostage. Little Emily Hand, who turned nine in captivity, is reunited with her family, but seems shell-shocked by her trauma. In an interview with CNN, her father spoke of his joy and pain.",

Along with the applause, Israel says he and other foreigners get a lifelong stipend for their ordeal. At times, news of a release has been overwhelming.

This comes after a senior U.S. State Department official said it's not expected that Russia's president is looking to make meaningful peace with Ukraine until he finds out who wins the U.S. presidential election next year. The U.S. Senate could begin considering a multibillion-dollar aid package for Ukraine. The Biden administration has laid out details of a $105 billion funding bill, $61 billion or more of more than half of the money will go to providing training, equipment and weapons to Ukraine. Most of the remainder will be used to provide security support to Israel. CNN's Clare Sebastian joins us now.

And this is the first meeting that we're going to see today at the foreign Minister level of the NATO Ukraine Council, which is supposed to be Ukraine and NATO meeting as equals. This was something that was set up out of the NATO meeting that happened in July. Obviously, NATO foreign ministers are trying to send a message herethat despite what's happening in the Middle East, despite the fact that Ukraine has fallen out of the headlines for the past couple of months, they are still a laser focused on doing this. But obviously Ukraine is extremely worried. This is why I think you see Dmytro Kuleba, the foreign Minister, saying today that Europe cannot defend itself without Ukraine. Trying to reinforce the point that this also matters domestically within Europe because they're worried. We've seen, you know, the far-right leader in the Netherlands win the most votes. We've seen Slovakia's government already cancelling military aid. They're worried about fatigue. They're worried that Congress has now spent the best part of several months discussing Ukraine aid with barely any progress.

It's an area where Russia currently dominates. Ukraine has admitted that, and this is electronic warfare. Take a look.

SEBASTIAN (voice-over): For Russia, electronic warfare and invisible battleground where electromagnetic waves are used to jam or even alter enemy GPS signals, as well as disrupting radio waves, radar and even cell signals has provided an unexpected advantage over Ukraine's more sophisticated weapons.

And certainly, we're seeing that even relying on their allies isn't providing that in Ukraine. So, technology is going to be crucial, and it's increasingly urgent.

They say a public hearing would ensure greater transparency and prevent information from being distorted as an impeachment inquiry into President Biden takes place. But Republicans have shot down that idea as Manu Raju explains.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MANU RAJU, CNN CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: House Republicans for months have been demanding testimony from Hunter Biden as part of their investigation into the Biden family, and now the impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden. Last month, issuing the subpoena for his testimony, calling for him to come behind closed doors and be deposed as they ask him questions about him and his father. But Hunter Biden's attorneys responded. Saying that, yes, Hunter Biden would appear on Capitol Hill. But here's the catch -- in public. They argue that behind closed doors, testimony would allow Republicans to distort his testimony, saying this in the in a statement. We have seen you use closed door sessions to manipulate, even distort the facts and misinform the public. We therefore propose opening the door. If you, as you claim, your efforts are important and involve issues that Americans should know about, then let the light shine on these proceedings. Now House Republicans, James Comer, who leads House Oversight committee, as well as Jim Jordan, the House Judiciary Committee chairman say that is not OK. In fact, they want him to come behind closed doors and then they say there could be a public hearing. They said that was the proper way that they have with these investigations. This is what Colmer said in a statement. He said: Hunter Biden is trying to play by his own rules instead of following the rules required of everyone else. That won't stand with House Republicans. Our lawfully issued subpoena to Hunter. Biden requires him to appear for a deposition on December 13th. We expect full cooperation with our subpoena for a deposition. But also agree that Hunter Biden should have the opportunity to testify in a public setting at a future date. So it remains to been seen ultimately, how this will play out. The Republicans are hoping that Hunter Biden reveals some new information that will allow them to draw a connection between Hunter Biden's foreign business dealings and Joe Biden, particularly his acts as vice president. They have not been able to drive that -- draw that connection yet as they try to move for any impeachment vote as part of these proceedings in the days, months and weeks ahead. So whether they ultimately agreed to some accommodation or whether the standoff will persist, remains to be seen. Manu Raju, CNN, Capitol Hill. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

These were his own words telling people at his audience.Now, this morning he did arrive at his audience.

This just hours really after they cancelled his trip to Dubai. You've got to think, though, that he really wanted to go to Dubai. Because the way it was framed by the Vatican press office is really that his doctors told him he can't go and that's it. And even yesterday, the Vatican briefed that the journalists would be travelling with him and everything. So, you know, it seemed to be a very last-minute decision. But he was - his breath was labored this morning when he spoke. He didn't look particularly chipper. Let's say, you know, he looked a little bit tired.
