      "sentences": "New this morning, the Wagner military group is threatening to leave the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut. This is in the eastern part of the country where we've seen some of the fiercest fighting. Wagner's leader Yevgeny Prigozhin says his troops are running out of ammunition. So this private military group has played key role in Russia's war in Ukraine, but they've also been engaged in this backroom bickering with the Russian Defense Ministry.With me now is Retired U.S. Army Brigadier General Steve Anderson. General, thanks so much for being with us. Two questions about this claims from the Wagner group here. Number one, and I'm not sure we believe him, first of all, but if Wagner did pull out of Bakhmut, what would that mean for the military situation there? But two, and perhaps more importantly, what does this bickering tell us about discipline and coordination inside the Russian military? BRIG. GEN. STEVE ANDERSON, U.S. ARMY (RET.): Well, thank you, John. What it tells us is that it's a really bad army and they've got a lot of issues. I mean, mercenaries make great security guards. They don't make good soldiers. And we're seeing that play out right here. I mean, obviously, this would be a terrible blow to the Russian military. They're trying to fight for that city of Bakhmut. Can imagine if General Patton in the middle of his assault on Germany in 1944 and said, hey, you know, I'm not getting all the ammo I need. I'm pulling the third army out of this fight here. I mean, it's ridiculous. It just shows how poorly led, how poorly equipped, how poorly trained, and what a bad army that the Russian army is. They're 10 years away from being a competent fighting force.",

This is the artillery rocket system that the U.S. has been providing to the Ukrainians that has shown some success on the ground. How significant would that be?",

I mean, if they're going to conduct a counteroffensive, they're going to have to achieve a breakthrough somewhere and they're going to have to use their superior maneuver, their ability to integrate indirect fire, direct fire, and aviation.And of course, HIMARS is a very key component of this indirect fire capability. My big concern with the HIMARS is the maintenance requirements. I mean, my understanding is that many of them, perhaps as much as 50 percent, are not operational. We don't have the maintenance capability and the repair parts to keep those things operational. The jamming, though, of course, is an issue. We just need more HIMARS systems and we need to use those HIMARS systems effectively, and that means maintaining them appropriately.",

They've got to find one place, a weakness in that front and they need to penetrate. And then they've got to be conducting an envelopment that gets around them because they're not going to be able to go toe to toe with the Russians.I mean, the Russians are too strong. They've probably got a couple of hundred thousand troops in there now and they're dug in. They've been there for a year. They're preparing great defensive operations and defensive mechanisms in each area. So they've got to be able to find a weakness in the wall, they got to penetrate it, and then they got to use their superior maneuver, their ability to integrate aviation, ground, direct fire and indirect fire. All of that in a synergistic effect to defeat and envelop the Russian army.",

Officials believe that Dominguez is behind these stabbings that we've been talking about that took place over just the course of five days.

Police describing him as someone who was very reserved. Of course, what's interesting here is that he was a third year student at U.C. Davis, and the university said he'd been separated for the university for academic reasons just days before these stabbings. And so, of course, a lot of the students, members of the community, they were just terrified.

Police say the 21-year-old opened fire on three villages about 30 miles south of the capital, killing eight people and injuring 10 others. This comes just one day after a 13-year-old boy killed nine people at a school in Belgrade.Until this week, mass shootings in Serbia were extremely rare. This last one was the last one, was a decade ago when a veteran killed 13 people in a central Serbian village. So this is despite the country's high rate of gun ownership, a remnant of the wars in the 1990s, Serbia has the highest level of civilian gun ownership in Europe and the fifth highest in the world.

The school shooting on Wednesday for this country and then this latest shooting overnight was something on an entirely different level of shock for this country. And you're right, it was a huge manhunt. Some 600 officers spawned out across a very large swath of the country.We saw heavily, heavily armed police officers in full tactical gears, balaclavas, heavily armed, manning checkpoints and searching even along the side of highways in lines. It was a very tense situation for hours and hours, and very terrifying for the people, especially those who lived around the villages or in the villages that were actually affected by the shots that were fired. And what is especially concerning is that when this suspect was actually found in the early hours of this morning, he had four hand grenades with him and an automatic weapon, something that is impossible for ordinary civilians to obtain legally in this country. Even after the school shooting on Wednesday, the government was already promising, John, to really crack down and to really strengthen the existing gun control system. They wanted to put a moratorium in place for two years on issuing new gun licenses. And after this latest shooting, the President went on TV, President Aleksandar Vucic, and he promised to do even more. He also promised to put a school -- an armed police officer inside of every school. He says that great nations have managed to find solutions after tragedies, and he believes that Serbia will be no exception, John. BERMAN: And it is certainly a great tragedy. Two of them now.

We know that name goes back to the 1700s when fishermen noticed that the fishing went horrible around Christmas time. They called it the child El Nino after Christmas there.La Nina is the inverse, the colder pattern. That's what we've had the last couple of years. Looks like that's over and El Nino is moving in. But another culprit could be what you see behind me. We're in the shipping yards of Jersey City right now. And a couple of years ago, there was a global change in the kind of fuel that these massive containerships could use as they cross the oceans. As a result, there's less sulfur coming out of these big boys as they cross the Pacific and the Atlantic. They're making a different kind of ship trail in the sky. And as a result of that, that could have been that old pollution, a sunscreen, all these years masking the effects of global warming. We know the oceans have been absorbing about 90 percent of the excess heat since the Industrial Revolution, sort of hiding the real damage that's being done right now. And so they're worried, could this be a dangerous new tipping point? Could it be seasonal? Could it be the result of a change like this? We really don't understand fully what's happening in the stratosphere, weighed twice as high as our Flights to Grandmother's. Just a couple of months ago, NOAA sent the first flights up there to kind of test the upper stratosphere to see what volcanic ash and wildfire smoke and shipping pollution and all of these things, even space junk that's disintegrating is having an effect on the reflectivity of infrared light coming in and heating up the planet.
