But normally, you would go to keyless around the world and, you know, France, America, those sorts of countries. It's interesting they've spoke to Zelenskyy.

Can he keep up those budgets when there are going to be cuts across the border? It looks like to try to balance those books. Also, just heard that he's spoken to President Biden tonight.

So, all he can really do, I guess, as we honest about it in the way he's use it in the past is to say, you know, my wife's father came from nothing, created this empire. That's actually a very conservative entrepreneurial thing to do, so it's not completely out of character.
