The answer is the Louvre Museum in Paris. It covers more than 780,000 square feet and is home to about 38,000 pieces of art. And this next report, we`re going to take you to a museum where you can actually touch the art. That`s right. Mercer Labs Museum of Art and Technology in New York City is not your typical museum with velvet ropes and strict security guards. Nope. At this museum, the visitors are actually encouraged to come in and interact with the exhibits. That is because the Mercer Museum houses what is called experiential or immersive art. And as you`ll see in this report, it is easy to get lost in all the magic of it. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I try to create a space that you`re standing there and you don`t know where is the ceiling, you know, where is the sky and where is the floor.
