But first, the Israeli military preparing for a possible ground incursion in Lebanon. The Israeli National Security Cabinet approving the, quote, \"next phase\" of its war with Hezbollah. Israel has already begun raids over the border and Israeli artillery units are firing into Southern Lebanon. World leaders, meanwhile, are calling for de-escalation.

What they are doing is they are, quote, \"softening the ground.\" That's the term that's typically used when you fire artillery into enemy territory in preparation for those ground troops to move in. And of course, it is not the only thing that we are hearing that's leading us to believe that a ground offensive is likely very much imminent. In addition to that, that an area along the border, just north of us, has been shut down, declared a closed military zone. And so, we are also seeing tanks, armored personnel carriers, about 100 vehicles alongside the highway leading north towards the Lebanese border. And so, as you hear those artillery shells continuously being fired into Southern Lebanon, it is just a reminder, not only of the fact that Israel is clearly ramping up its operations in this area, but of course, also of the impact that this war is having already on civilians inside of Lebanon. About a million Lebanese civilians have been displaced from their home so far, according to Lebanon's prime minister. We are seeing, of course, as hundreds of thousands of Lebanese have been fleeing from Southern Lebanon, as well as from the eastern Beqaa Valley. But also, of course, even just within the Lebanese capital of Beirut, the Dahiya, as it is known, as people are fleeing from that area to other parts of that city. Tonight, the Israeli military once again calling on Lebanese residents in parts of Southern Beirut to leave their homes as they continue to carry out more airstrikes in that area. But now, of course, the question is will they actually carry out that ground offensive? And how quickly could we actually see it? Today, we heard the Israeli defense minister, Yoav Gallant, saying that Israel will employ all of its capabilities. And he was speaking to infantry ground troops, and he said, that includes you.

And the prime minister, after his meeting, with the speaker of the house, came out with this very positive message about the willingness of the Lebanese government, and that includes Hezbollah, because when the message is coming from the speaker of the house, that means that he has been in discussions with Hezbollah.

I mean, that has been demonstrated by maps, that has been demonstrated by the way they were targeting everything. So, a ground invasion, nobody can predict really what the expectations would be. But there has been, I would say, in the past 48 hours, hundreds of messages from the Israeli side that it will be very limited.

So, the war added another layer of challenge, added another layer of desperation and difficulty on the economy, on the GDP, on people's lives, on employment. We have tens of villages, we have hundreds of thousands of people today on the streets unemployed. There's going to be short-term and long-term negative implications for sure on the economy. And early on, I set the alarm, early on, a year ago when the war started in Gaza that the Lebanese economy cannot bear a war and cannot bear now an escalation. So, you know, the name of the game today is a regional deal, which we hope Lebanon would be part of. Today, even we got more support from the State of Qatar that they are working, as well with other Arab countries, to reach a ceasefire. So, we need to capitalize on that diplomatic approach with the positive messages we're getting from the United States and make it happen.

We're asking for time to help all the displaced people, because pushing further into an escalation will definitely, again, I repeat that, will take Lebanon to the unknown and will make -- will take us probably to the point of no return, a very difficult place on all fronts on the economy, on the people on the diplomatic channels, because the window is very, very tight to get to a solution.

It dumped a lot of rain in the Philippines and some of the area - and especially the northern islands, picked up over a half of a meter.

But look at this thing, this is the actual computer model of what the radar may look like and it runs right over the top of Taipei Now, it isn't going to be a super typhoon when it gets there. It will be much, much less, maybe only a 150, maybe, kilometers per hour with gusts more likely closer to 100, because a lot of the mountain areas here are going to take the storm itself out of the storm.

Now, 25 years after Macao's handover from Portugal to China, there you go, young entrepreneurs are finding new ways to reinvent the classic sweet treat. Marc Stewart has Ma as part of our next Stop Series. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MARC STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  This is a Portuguese egg tart, with its flaky pastry shell and rich custard filling, it's one of Macao's most beloved sweet treats. And now, 28-year-old Crystal Kwok has turned it into beer. This is Macao's very first craft beer company called Funny Eye. Founded six years ago while Crystal was still a university student. The business has stood the test of time. CRYSTAL KWOK, FOUNDER, FUNNY EYE BREWERY (through translator):  Forget about the rules. People think savory flavors cannot be made into beer, that food cannot be made into beer, but we are here to rewrite the rules. STEWART (voice-over):  The young entrepreneur first experimented with fermentation in her own home, and selling out of a wooden cart at weekend markets with friends. After years of fine tuning her brewing process, with fermentation tanks and brewing equipment tailored to fit inside her 12th floor warehouse brewery, Crystal is proud to say her beer is 100 percent made in Macao. KWOK (through translator):  In every aspect, people wonder why we base our operations in Macao. We have to source everything externally. But to us, Macao is our root. We hope that visitors can understand that Macao has its own thriving culture. STEWART (voice-over):  Her brand is now expanding into Mainland China and Hong Kong along the side of new nonalcoholic drinks. Young talent working to ensure a future of made in Macao. KWOK (through translator):  I think this type of thinking is becoming more popular. They have a growing desire to build something new to try. I think Macao is seeing the next generation who want to do their own thing. (END VIDEOTAPE) STEWART (voice-over):  And in today's Money Move, U.S. stocks closing out a September to remember. And from Shanghai to Beijing, the China stock rally is truly a thing. Beginning in the United States, Wall Street wrapping up the month of September and the third quarter in the green after a late day rally. The S&amp;P and Dow both finishing again at fresh record highs, despite some more cautious comments from Fed Chair Jay Powell on the size of future rate cuts. The S&amp;P having its best September in more than a decade, in fact, for a quarterly gain of 5.5 percent. The Dow doing even better, rising more than 8 percent in the third quarter. And in Asia, you can perhaps call it a Tokyo tumble, the Nikkei falling almost five percent on fears that the nation's incoming prime minister will to raise corporate taxes and support higher interest rates. The new prime minister takes office on Tuesday. He's calling for snap elections for late October. And an entirely different market picture over in China, where stocks rallied for a ninth straight session on stimulus optimism. It was the biggest one-day rally Monday for Chinese markets in 16 years. Kristie Lu Stout has more from Hong Kong. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
