And these words do even carry more weight from the vice president, herself, given that she is an attorney, a former prosecutor, talking about what they've seen and the evidence behind here, pointing to specific instances that they do say now constitute war crimes, that Russia has committed.And I think the big part of this is also the legal accountability, because yes, now, they are saying formally that this has been committed. That is what they have been determined through the investigation that they've done, but they also said they want there to be accountability for those who committed these crimes against humanity, as Harris was praising them there. So, I think that's a big part of it. It's not just now that they are making the formal conclusion, but also what comes next and if they will stay with down the road.",

He came about a month after that invasion. It happened last year. He is going to give a speech here in Warsaw, where he gave that speech last year. Remember when he said he raised questions about Putin remaining in power, became this huge moment on the world stage for President Biden. He is also going to meet with the leaders of the Bucharest Nine, those leaders on the eastern flank of NATO, those countries that are involved, of course, closer to the front line than anyone else. So that will be a big focus and also the USAID, talking about what they have done so far, talking about their commitment to continuing to a Ukraine. But, Abby, as you noted in the opening, that comes as real questions are happening in Washington about how long that age will continue.

So, will there be another one? It's not just about the billions of dollars, but the types of weapons that are also being committed. Ukraine, for months, has been calling for a longer range missiles to hit Russian targets farther away in Crimea, for example. They've been calling for fighter jets. Neither of those systems have been committed so far by the United States. This is a pivotal, moments because in the coming weeks we expect with Ukraine and Russia to mount new offensives. We are the sting that from the Russian side. It's not going very well for them. They have not been taking back much territory. Ukraine is expected to mount their own counteroffensive in the south with newly trained troops by the U.S. New weapon systems committed by the U.S. And, of course, NATO countries hoping that in the second year of the war, using that, Ukraine can claw back some territory from Russia -- Abby.",

And there is pressure to -- from staff and from those members to show resiliency and a quick comeback. And that doesn't seem to happen with John Fetterman. You know, we have all become aware of the post stroke depression when our colleague Blake (INAUDIBLE), you know, had severe depression after his stroke. And so -- and it's interesting watching John Fetterman walk around the halls of Congress and there every single day. And there's -- you know, he isn't able to really engage with anyone. Reporters still really aren't able to talk to him. And in a very social job where Democrats have lunch together several times a week, not being able to really engage can I'm sure be very, very difficult. It's something that one of Fetterman's senior aides also said was that at times it was difficult to differentiate the stroke conditions and the depression conditions that he was able to get help for himself.",

It's good that he is setting the precedent that our elected leaders will be fully transparent with their voters both before and after elections ab their condition. To the extend that it can affect their diligence to do their job, voters at least deserve to know that information. PHILLIP: Yes. I mean this is also -- just to switch gears real quick -- this is coming during a week in which President Biden had his physical. He went to the doctor. I just want to show you this because I think it's kind of interesting. This is Ronald Reagan's physical in 1985. His physician said \"He continues to enjoy good health. His overall physical and mental condition is excellent. I mean especially impressed with the fact that his blood pressure is lower than it was a year ago.
