That includes the biggest prize of all, California, which has 54 of the 78 electoral votes at stake this hour.We have a projection for you now. CNN can project that Kamala Harris will win the state of California. With those 54 electoral votes, not unexpected, Harris will win California. CNN is also projecting the Donald Trump will win the state of Idaho with its four electoral votes. So, what does that mean for the electoral -- too early to call. We have Washington State with 12 electoral votes and Oregon with eight electoral votes. Two electoral. Too early to go. Let's go to the electoral map right now. Donald Trump with 211 electoral votes at this hour. Kamala Harris cracks 100, now has 145 electoral votes. Two hundred and seventy electoral votes are needed to win. Donald Trump is 59 electoral votes away from that. Let's look at these battleground states now. Arizona, Donald Trump in the lead there, 49.6%. Kamala Harris right behind him with 49.5%. Donald Trump has a 2,356 vote-lead with 51% of the estimated vote in from Arizona. Wisconsin, Donald Trump in the lead there too, 49.9% of the vote. Kamala Harris is 48.4%. Donald Trump has a 28,576 vote-lead with an estimated 59% of the estimated vote in from the Badger State. In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Donald Trump maintaining his lead. He's at 50.7% of the vote. Kamala Harris with 48.2% of the vote. Donald Trump with a 119,411 vote-lead with 68% of the estimated vote in from Pennsylvania. In Georgia, Donald Trump is still in the lead there, 51% of the vote. Kamala Harris with 48.2% of the vote. Donald Trump with a 136,328 vote-lead. That is with 88% of the estimated vote in from the state of Georgia. In North Carolina, another battleground where Donald Trump leads 50.8% of the vote. Kamala Harris has 47.8% of the vote. Donald Trump has a 145,388 vote-lead over Kamala Harris right now with an estimated 85% of the vote in from the Tar Heel State. In battleground Michigan, Kamala Harris in the lead. She has 51.3% of the vote. Donald Trump has 46.9%. Kamala Harris is 74,838 votes ahead of Donald Trump, but that's less than a third of the vote counted there. Thirty percent of the estimated vote in from the state of Michigan. In the Commonwealth of Virginia, Kamala Harris in the lead there still, but narrowly so, 50.1% of the vote. Donald Trump has 48% of the vote. Kamala Harris with a 73,375 vote-lead. That is with 78% of the estimated vote in from the Commonwealth of Virginia. In New Mexico, Harris leads there, too, 52.6% of the vote. Donald Trump with 45.5% of the vote. That is with an estimated 69% of the vote in. Harris with a roughly 45 -- 43,000 vote lead.

So, that release was 60,673. And by 1 a.m., I'm told they'll see more results from the precincts of today's in-person votes. You have to remember they have to take the memory card, drive it in, it's a large county. Now, total ballots counted so far, like, this is the universe, right? It is 151,950, and then I should note the ballots cast in person today there in this key coller county is 91,277, per this official. Let's go over to Bucks County. This is another critical collar county, as John King has been talking about all night. I'm told results will trickle in as these data cards are being driven from the polling places. An official I was just in touch with, texting with there, in Bucks, says, so far, over 90,000 mail-in ballots are accounted for and the results out of a possible total of 151,000. And I also want to note this, that the state will be required to report the outstanding early votes by midnight.

Two things to say about this. Number one, it's only half the vote. So, if you just think, we have about 200,000 more votes, right? This is 51%. It is 103 to 102. Got roughly 200,000 votes still to come in. Bucks County is the most competitive the collar counties.She's at 50%, the vice president, if you round up. Again, President Biden was at 52, if you round him up. You say that's not a huge difference but, Jake, you know the Commonwealth very well. In the competitive swing counties, a half a point or a point can matter. And right now, that number is not good for the vice president. TAPPER: Indeed. CNN can bring you a projection now, folks at home. CNN projects that the state of Oregon will go to Kamala Harris, as expected. Oregon with its eight electoral votes will go to the Democrat, Kamala Harris. Let's take a look at the electoral map. Right now, Donald Trump has 211 electoral votes. Kamala Harris has 153 electoral votes. Two hundred and seventy are needed to win. Let's take a look at the key races now. Arizona, Donald Trump in the lead there, 49.6% of the vote. Kamala Harris right behind him with 49.5% of the vote. Donald Trump with a roughly 3,000 vote-lead. That's with 51% of the estimated vote in from the state of Arizona. In battleground Wisconsin, Donald Trump maintaining his lead, 50.4% of the vote. Kamala Harris has 48% of the vote. Donald Trump with a more than 50,000 vote lead right now with 63% of the estimated vote in from the Badger State. In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Donald Trump maintaining his lead, 51% of the vote. Kamala Harris has 47.9% of the vote. Donald Trump with more than 165,000 more votes than Kamala Harris with more than three quarters, 76% of the estimated vote in from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. In Battleground, Georgia, Donald Trump in the lead, 50.9% of the vote. Kamala Harris has 48.3% of the vote. Donald Trump has a more than 131,000 vote-lead over Kamala Harris. That's with 90% of the estimated vote in. So, they got 10% to go there in Georgia, but Donald Trump in the lead. In North Carolina, another battleground, Donald Trump still in the lead there with 50.7% of the vote. Kamala Harris with 47.9% of the vote. Donald Trump has a more than 138,000 vote-lead over Kamala Harris with an estimated 87% of the vote in. In Battleground, Michigan, Kamala Harris is in the lead, 50.2% of the vote.

They're not encountering any issues with machines, etc. This is just a process of getting the work done.We've also been in touch with Macomb County where we were outside of Detroit earlier today. They are also expecting, they say, another batch of votes to be reported quite soon. And here where we are in Detroit, this is the location where they've been counting the absentee ballots. Just in the last hour, another 2,500 or so absentee ballots came in. That brings us pretty much to the end of the 100,000 that they've expected. At some point in the next hour, we'll see another U-Haul truck come in with the remaining absentee ballots that they've collected from drop boxes around the city here. And they've been counting as they've been going. Remember, they started counting last Monday. They didn't have to wait till Election Day. So those numbers will be done soon. I will say the secretary of state told me earlier this evening that she's moving up her expectation that by midday tomorrow, they could report final unofficial results, saying -- she believes they might be able to do that tonight, perhaps after midnight, in the next couple of hours but, of course, they'll have to get those Wayne County numbers done first.

The party goers gathered at the convention center here in West Palm Beach cheering as your call is coming on the screen. They have been glued to CNN for the last several moments watching John King at the map going over each of these numbers.But North Carolina is an important benchmark for the Trump campaign because they were watching it to get a gut check for how they believed the rest of the evening could go. And I can tell you that what I'm hearing from Trump campaign sources is they are increasingly confident as the night is going on. Still not certain, of course, watching those very important blue wall states and to see what they look like. And so that is going to be the big question here as they continue to keep an eye on Pennsylvania, on Michigan, on Wisconsin as this is moving forward. Jake, I will tell you that we're seeing more people from the Mar-a- Lago party come over here to the Trump headquarters where this party is going to be held. But also, some Republicans are flying into Palm Beach. We just heard from House Speaker Mike Johnson, who is watching the results come in with his constituents back in Shreveport. He is now headed here tonight because he is predicting a bigger Republican margin in the House, a Republican takeover of the Senate, and he says he believes the Republican is going to win the White House.
