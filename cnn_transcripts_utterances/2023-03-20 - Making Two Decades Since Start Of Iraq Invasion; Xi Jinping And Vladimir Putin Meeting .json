China's leader visits his counterpart in Moscow. UBS buys beleaguered Credit Suisse. And later this hour, Mikaela Shiffrin caps her season with a record victory. Well, it's been 20 years since the U.S. and its allies launch one of the largest and most consequential military operations in modern history. The 2003 invasion of Iraq. Well, this is how it began with a barrage of airstrikes pummeling military targets on March the 20th. In the weeks that followed, U.S.-led ground forces would sweep through the country with the goal of toppling its ruler. But the wall would rage on for years, leaving tens of thousands dead, millions in chaos. Throughout the next two hours, we will be reflecting on the repercussions of the conflict still felt to this day with a number of journalists who lived through this story. Our own Ben Wedeman. The editor of The National, Mina Al-Oraibi and former CNN journalist, Princess Rym al-Ali. Well, this anniversary happening on the same day as what could be a high stakes meeting of world leaders in Moscow where they might decide where the conflict in Ukraine goes next. Chinese President Xi Jinping is speaking with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Both country's official news agency saying there is talk of promoting peace. But hope for progress is being met with widespread skepticism by Ukraine and its Western allies. Matthew Chance is in Moscow. Matthew, Beijing painting this visit as a journey of peace. And what are the expectations here?",

It was put out there about, you know, a few weeks ago last month and it's got 12 points on it, one of which is for the parties to start negotiations to end the conflicts in Ukraine. But it stopped short of calling on Russia to withdraw from the territory in the Concorde -- its Concorde. And so, it's met this very lukewarm, warm response in Ukraine and amongst Ukraine's Western backers as well. Nevertheless, the Kremlin says and the two leaders there sitting in Moscow face to face for the -- for the first time this visit, saying that that's one of the issues they're going to be discussing the -- for the possibility of a diplomatic process to bring the crisis as they call it in Ukraine to a close. It's interesting, though, because this is -- there's been more than 40 occasions in the past decade since Xi Jinping has met Vladimir Putin face to face. That's according to a count being carried by the Russian official media. But he hasn't had a single conversation so far with Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine. And so, there's an obvious imbalance there as well. There's a possibility, of course, that could -- that could change. And so, that's been watched very closely. The other issue that's being watched closely is whether or not China, even though -- it says it's trying to promote peace, will take the step of providing Russia with much needed military assistance. It's short of ammunition on the battlefield, technology for the military sphere and things like that. So far, it stopped short of giving Russia that kind of assistance. But there's a lot of speculation that that's what Russia wants out of this state visit. This kind of firm sort of military backing, not just political backing from Beijing for its conflict in Ukraine, Becky.",

And clearlyCredit Suisse couldn't just muddle on through on the basis of its very long-awaited restructuring plan. So, this felt like one of the last options really. And it's been interesting seeing how this is impacting all the various players in the market. The ramifications of this deal and emergency rescue really in terms of UBS taking over its biggest rival. There are lots of losers, particularly of course, Credit Suisse shareholders because this value is Credit Suisse at a 60 percent discount of the price it closed on Friday. You're actually looking at Credit Suisse shares though trading at about that level today. Also, Becky, and this is actually having far broader ramifications, I think, is what happened to certain bondholders of Credit Suisse. The 81 bonds. These are convertible bonds that on the riskier end of the bond scale in terms of banks. They usually convert to equity in this sort of situation. But in this case, they were just wiped out. So, $17 billion worth of bonds wiped out. And that's going to do something for investor confidence when it comes to banking bonds more generally. Looking at UBS, though, I'd like to show you the share price there. It opened sharply lower. I think as investors sort of absorb this deal on what it was going to mean for UBS. They are higher right now. I am looking at UBS share price about five percent higher, six percent higher, we're showing you there. There are some sort of positives here. This will be great for UBS wealth management business. It will probably be good for its domestic banking business, although you do question what sort of competition they'll be in Switzerland at this stage. It's a big deal. They are looking to create savings of $8 billion a year by 2027. And so, the bad news in all of this, of course is jobs. And as the days and the weeks go on, and as takeovers actually completed. We'll find out I'm sure a lot more about those cost savings. Becky?",

But by and large, it does seem to be calm at the moment. But in Iraq, there's always a calm before the storm. And if you look at the fundamental problems left behind from the war and the occupation, basically, the civil war among the Iraqis is that the country's economy is still in shambles. Iraq is floating on a sea of oil. But for instance, you have youth unemployment that's running at about 25 percent. Now for all the sins of Saddam Hussein's regime, for instance, he invested huge amounts of money and things like education. The educational system in Iraq at the moment is barely functioning. In 1982, UNESCO actually awarded Iraq a prize for eradicating illiteracy. At the moment, nothing really seems to function in Iraq, whether it's the power system, water, electric -- education, you name it. It is a dysfunctional country. And what we've seen is that, despite the wealth that does exist in Iraq, for instance, a month ago, a ship -- shipwrecked off of the coast of Italy. And there were Iraqis onboard. Iraqis coming from a country which in theory should be wealthy.

Mina Al-Oraibi joins me now. It's good to have you on. The podcast is excellent. You describe it as examining the era that shaped a generation. Explain. MINA AL-ORAIBI, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, THE NATIONAL: You know, Becky, it's hard to believe 20 years have passed because in some ways we used to think no matter how difficult 2003 was, it will take a year to five and we'll be in a better shape. And yet a generation then that was coming of age was faced with complete chaos. And I think we have to be careful not to make it sound like pre-2003 it was all rosy, absolutely not. Terrible states in the country between dictatorship sanctions and so forth. Still, there was a state, there was general security. And suddenly that was all thrown up in the air. And in some ways, there were so many hopes for -- again, people coming of age at that era. And now they they've passed that time. And now 20 years on, there's a whole new generation that never knew what life was before 2003. But also, is facing a country where the state itself was dismantled and it's trying to pull itself back in together. And the same time, you know, we think about all the losses that people went through personal losses. And that's what I was really showing the podcast, but their individual stories, you know, the Lancet in 2006 set 660,000 people were estimated to have been killed because of the war. Now not t just through direct killing but also, you know, the failure of infrastructure and so forth. That's just in the first three years. So, imagining people's lives have been destroyed. Then we look at things like climate change when Iraq today is one of the most challenged countries in the world when it comes to climate change. No serious policies to combat climate and so forth. And so, when I talk about an entire generation, it was that generation that came of age in 2003, and today, the generation that inherits this country.",

So, how does that happen? To your mind what does the government need to do next, at this point? AL-ORAIBI: It's a long list, a laundry list of things that needs to happen. But the number one thing is corruption. Corruption has become endemic throughout all walks of life, be it through state organizations, even the private sector. Life in general is bent on workarounds for a system that is so dysfunctional. And so, without rooting out corruption, it's impossible to see the state really reviving and taking care of ordinary people. And through that you get better basic services. Who can believe 20 years after the war, Iraq does not have day to day electricity? People rely on private companies and generators. And if you can't afford it, you're sitting in the dark, you're sitting in the heat of Iraq, which reaches 50 degrees Celsius in the summer months and more without air conditioning, a country that produces 4.3 million barrels of oil a day, one of the top producers globally, one of the richest countries of the world and basic things like electricity are still a problem 20 years on.",

And what do you believe the lasting legacy of the last 20 years is for the country, the region and the wider world? AL-ORAIBI: The political system is set up in a way where it's devolution of power so that everybody tries to take a bit of power for themselves rather than thinking what's the greater good. So, we need reforms to the Constitution to the political system. Are the people themselves capable? It's a mixed bag, but I think if the political will was there, it's totally doable. In terms of legacy, the legacy is a broken political system that needs reform. Everybody agrees on it but nobody will actually do it because there are too many vested interests. Lasting legacy is really of missed opportunities. Country, you know, even the removal of Saddam Hussein didn't have to bring us where we are now. It's the lost opportunity of a country that's as rich and its people, its natural resources, agriculture, that could have been in a completely different place 20 years on.

But it's a strong enough statement in either way to tell the government of the day, Cyril Ramaphosa and the ANC that the people have had enough, the crisis at Eskom, the national power utility has been going on for a long time. And South Africans are now used to what is called loadshedding. This is regular blackouts, they have stages of it sometimes up to stage six load shedding which means for many hours of the day, they don't have power. That's the trigger for what EFF has called for. But there's lots of other economic challenges that South Africans are facing that have found kind of credence in this call by the opposition party to march to have this big -- a show of disapproval in the government of President Cyril Ramaphosa.
