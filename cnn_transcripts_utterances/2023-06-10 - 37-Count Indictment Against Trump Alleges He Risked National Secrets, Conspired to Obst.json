And a historic game on the court between the Denver Nuggets and the Miami Heat. CNN Sports Andy Scholes joins me live to break down the NBA playoffs. Donald Trump is hitting the campaign trail today with stops in Georgia and North Carolina. The former president is forging ahead with his reelection bid despite the damning new details in 37 count criminal indictment that's now public. Trump is accused of storing and hiding sensitive and highly classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago resort and home, allegedly conspiring with an aid to defy a subpoena for the material. Prosecutors say he kept secret information in bathroom, shower, bedroom and ballroom. The former commander-in-chief allegedly showed off classified materials on two occasions including a document that Trump is said to have described as a plan of attack. The indictment warns that Trump risks exposing military and nuclear secrets of the U.S. and its allies. Special Counsel Jack Smith says protecting such information is critical to the nation's safety and security. Here he is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And the indictment even includes a photo where you can see documents, sensitive secrets meant only for a handful of our closest allies strewn about the floor of a storage room. And prosecutors also say that on two occasions, former President Trump shared classified information with people who did not have proper clearances. The first incident is actually something that was first reported by CNN. It was a meeting at his Bedminster, New Jersey golf club in 2021 where he showed people information that he said was highly secretive and that he could not declassify it because he was no longer president. He also allegedly shared a classified map with a representative from his political action committee. The prosecutors also lay out how they allege he was trying to press his lawyer about possibly lying to the FBI after the government subpoenaed Trump to get its record back. They also lay out a series of damning incidents and conversations with one of his aides, Walt Nauta, where it appears that he is pressuring Nauta to move boxes containing classified materials, not only to keep them from Trump's lawyers, but also to keep them for investigators. Now, we heard from Jack Smith for the first time Friday, and he insisted that he wants this trial to move along as quickly as possible. Likely mindful of an upcoming election next year.

Thanks so much for being here with us. So the indictment is finally out. Your thoughts now that we've seen the charges?JOSEPH KOTRIE-MONSON, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Kim, where do we start? This must be the most dangerous of all Trump's legal battles. And, by jove (ph), has he kept both journalists and lawyers busy over the last few years. Don't forget we have the criminal, ongoing criminal case regarding the alleged Stormy Daniels hush payments. Not the fact they were made, but the fact they were misrepresented. And also those election meddling charges that investigation by a special prosecutor still rumbling on. But here we have, Kim, 31 counts of willful return mention of national defense information under the Espionage Act. That's a legal statute to strike fear into a defendant, isn't it? Ten years maximum there. Also counts of conspiracy more serious to withhold or conceal documents for the maximum of 20 years. This case is worrying, Kim, for three fundamental reasons. First of all, the evidence already in this long indictment document that's now been unsealed. We are told of audio evidence that exists. And we're provided with transcripts in which Donald Trump appears to not only confirm that these documents are classified, but also in real time attempts to show them. There is even disturbingly evidence suggesting, presumably also from an audio transcript, because that's how it's laid out, that he asked an attorney to pluck out damaging documents, making a plucking motion with his hand, apparently, as he did it. Now, none of this has been tested beyond the grand jury stage. And the grand jury stages a much lesser standard than the standard of proof required in a Miami criminal trial Florida court. But this is concerning those mega sentences also of concern and this unlike his impeachment proceedings, which were judged on a partisan basis, according to a two-thirds majority, that he was never going to be found guilty of or found against in regard of, because of the even split between Democrats and Republicans. This is a jury trial. It will be on the basis of non-political, presumably individuals. Of course, you may have, as I've heard today, you know, one strong Trump supporter, and you do require a unanimous verdict, but he cannot be saved by politics here, Kim.",

I really appreciate your insights on this criminal defense attorney Joseph Kotrie-Monson in Manchester, England. Thank you so much.Well, Trump is facing the indictment as a growing number of Republicans are challenging him for president. Many of those candidates have weighed in on the charges with reactions ranging from condemnation against the Justice Department to criticism of the former president's handling of classified material. Listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ASA HUTCHINSON, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This is unprecedented that we have a former president criminally charged for mishandling classified information, for obstruction of justice. This obviously will be an issue during the campaign, but for the sake of the country, he doesn't need this distraction. The country doesn't need this distraction as well. GOVERNOR RON DESANTIS, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: When I was in Congress, I remember, you know, Hillary had the emails with the classified, and my view was, well, gee, as a naval officer, if I would have taken classified to my apartment, I would have been court martialed in a New York minute. And yet they seem to not care about that. And is there a different standard for a Democrat Secretary of State versus a former Republican president? I think there needs to be one standard of justice in this country. CHRIS CHRISTIE, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Tried to get them to lie on his behalf, and when he knew they wouldn't -- and his own lawyer had to make recordings to protect himself when he knew they wouldn't, he directed his folks to hide boxes from his own lawyer in order not to turn these documents over to the government.

And then all of a sudden, on Friday, the air cleared up, the wind came through and really cleared things out where the numbers were down into the 50 range. So that is some good news.Now, this is a model, a computer model of where the wildfire smoke is right now. Most of it has been pushed offshore. That's why it's gone. That's why those pictures were so much better. There's still going to be smoke in the air, don't get me wrong, but our numbers will not get to that hazardous category. Probably unhealthy for sensitive groups all through the weekend in some spots. But we have relief on the way. Not only relief from the smoke, real relief with a low-pressure system that's going to rotate around the Great Lakes with wind and rain, but some relief for the firefighting effort as well. There will be many areas here. In Ontario and Quebec that will pick up more than an inch of rain over the next three days. That will certainly do quite a bit to help those firefighting efforts out.

Now, Denver fans holding their breath in the first quarter as Jokic rolled his ankle right here. He would actually go back to the locker room, but he would come back, end up scoring 23 points, grab 12 rebounds. Denver had a 13-point lead heading into the fourth quarter. The Heat were able to cut that lead all the way down to five, but that would be as close as they would get. Denver ends up winning this one rather easily, 108 to 95, and are now a win away from their first ever NBA title. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
