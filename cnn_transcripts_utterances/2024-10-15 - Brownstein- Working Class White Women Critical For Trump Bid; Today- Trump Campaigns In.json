Brownstein writes this. \"Because these women are especially plentiful in the three former 'blue wall' states that still constitute Harris' most likely path to an Electoral College victory: Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. To win those states Harris doesn't have to win most of those women -- Democrats almost never do -- but she does need to remain competitive with them.\" Of course, we have seen Harris has an edge among likely female voters.

They have focused a lot of their media and messaging on reassuring voters that she is ready to be president and, in particular, that she's tough enough to keep them safe on crime and the border.The price of that is that in the last few weeks their message about Trump -- the potential risks of a second Trump term -- has really been sublimated. And when you look at that big flurry of podcasts and network and cable media interviews that she did -- the Univision town hall, \"THE VIEW,\" Howard Stern -- there wasn't really a clear message about Trump. It was more about I have lived your life. I understand your life. I know I'd make your life better. I think we see her recalibrating that I think very urgently last night really striking the way she played the clips of Trump talking about the enemy within and threatening to use the military against people he deems as his opponents inside the U.S. on the Roland Martin interview yesterday and I'm sure on Charlamagne tha God today talking more explicitly again about the history of actions by Trump that can be viewed as racist with the Central Park Five, his comments about Obama. You know, Trump's retrospective job approval has been steadily rising. It reached a high point in that NBC poll on Sunday that was higher than at any point during his actual presidency. And I think the message of that is that voters are primarily looking at Trump through the lens of what they don't like about Biden, particularly inflation and the border. And Democrats -- I think there are a wide variety of Democrats who fear that the Harris campaign has let the other elements of what electing Trump would mean kind of recede too much, and I think you're going to see her beginning to emphasize that on many fronts between now and the finish. Whether Americans really want to go back, as she puts it, to all of the other elements that come with electing Trump other than the thought that eggs might be cheaper at the grocery store.",

What are you hearing from your friends, from your neighbors, especially as we see these national polls tighten in a way that suggests that Trump is in a position, potentially, to win this election, or at least is as likely to as Harris is? GEOFF DUNCAN, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, (R) FORMER GEORGIA LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR (via Webex by Cisco):  Yeah, no doubt this is going to be a close election. I think obviously we've all predicted that and I'm certain to see that come out. Voter intensity in the urban areas is going to be strong and in the rural areas. I think this is going to come down to the suburbs and what type of intensity do they show up and vote. Where I'm sitting here today is about two miles as the crow flies from where Donald Trump's going to be later today for his town hall. There's a lot of attention being paid. And look, I think -- what I hear is this whisper caucus of Republicans -- lifelong Republicans like myself that are just sick and tired of making excuses for Donald Trump. If they decide to just simply make a point and not vote for Donald Trump at the top of the ballot, then there's a high likelihood that Donald Trump probably wins. If they end up showing up and voting for Harris against the grain, I think there's a strong chance that she wins.
