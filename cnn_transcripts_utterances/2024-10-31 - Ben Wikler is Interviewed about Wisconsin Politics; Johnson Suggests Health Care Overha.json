Do they vote for Harris? Do they vote at all? We know that there are also people who disagree with Vice President Harris over - over a number of policies but absolutely want to stop Trump. And our message to them is that if you want to ensure that Trump can't come into the office, write an absolutely blank check to Netanyahu, which would be bad for both Israel and for Palestinians, if you want to make sure that we don't wind up with a dictatorship on day one using U.S. troops to crush dissent in the United States, then Harris is your candidate. But when you include the third-party voters in the electorate as the Marquette University Law School did, it finds that Harris' lead in Wisconsin grows. The third-party factor is worse for Trump.

All polls right now find Baldwin ahead. Often, you know, it's by a couple of points. It's not a big margin. And Harris, in the polling averages, is tied and slightly ahead if you look across most of the polling averages in our state. That means this could be a narrow, classic Wisconsin nail-biter election. But it's an election where we have a chance to elect both Harris and Baldwin in the final stretch.And I will also note, Harris is also reaching out to Republican voters.

MOLLY BALL, SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Yes, I mean, it's generally the case that that third party vote share is higher in the polls than it is in the final vote because, at the end of the day, most people decide that they don't want to throw their vote away. But I think that the scenario that Matt raises is important because, you know, I've spoken to a lot of RFK voters who struggle with this - with him endorsing Trump, who are not necessarily on board with getting behind Trump, even though RFK has. And so the fact that he's still on the ballot gives them somewhere else to go instead of getting behind Trump.

Let's talk about this Supreme Court ruling and the election - and lawsuits that are popping up that may be similar. In this case it's focused on non-citizens voting, which is, of course, something that many Republicans have focused on. But we do know there are instances where these are simply mistakes, like the case of a woman in - in this case Ohio, a mother of two in Columbus got a notice that she could face a potential felony charge if she voted. Although she's a registered voters, documents at the state's motor vehicle department indicated she was not a U.S. citizen. But Hilaria (ph), who immigrated from the Philippines, was naturalized in 2022, she just had not renewed her driver's license since 2021. What are the potential issues here? JESSICA HUSEMAN, EDITORIAL DIRECTOR, \"VOTEBEAT\": You know, these databases are not perfect. \"VoteBeat\" has covered the case of a couple of people in Texas who were given notifications that they were potentially non-citizens in the mail. How often do you check your mail? Probably not often. These people missed the letters, and so were marked as non-citizens. We just profiled a Trump voter in Texas who was removed from the polls - from the rolls for being a non-citizen, even though she was born in the United States and raised here. And that was because she didn't respond to a mailer. So, this is - this is all human activity. These databases are maintained by humans. The checking that happens to make sure that the databases are correct, also done by humans. They make mistakes. When we're talking about a number that's so small in the entire state of Virginia 1,600 people. That's actually not a huge number at all. And hundreds of those people are likely to be legitimate citizen.",

So, fortunately, you found somebody who is satisfied with voting early.There are going to be a lot people that choose not to vote at all because they don't believe that the system is secure. And I think one of the most unfortunate things that we've seen is that people tend to trust their elections, but they don't trust the elections elsewhere. So, if you ask somebody why they think the elections are insecure, they're going to say, because they're insecure in Philly, because they're insecure in Detroit, but they believe that there are local elections are doing just fine.

The RFK's and Tulsi Gabbards of the world. But - but - but, you know, so much of the point of the Harris campaign has been about this message to Republicans, former Republicans, conservative leaning independents that she is a leader who will represent them, well bring the country together, will work in a bipartisan way in an effort to, you know, rebut the accusation from the Trump camp that she's a far left liberal or a communist, as he's called her, and trying to position herself, you know, more in the center. And, you know, she needs that, frankly, in order to win. She needs some of that crossover vote. She needs - and this is the erosion that the Republican Party has experienced since Donald Trump has been the nominee. Since 2016 we have seen more and more of, again, these particularly upper income, college educated suburbanites leaving the Republican Party and increasingly voted for Democrats. And what you see with the Trump campaign strategy of aiming at, you know, disenchanted, politically disenchanted young men is that they've largely given up on that vote.
