But really what they did focus on, in my view, is trying to prevent what I'll call a very volatile scenario, where potentially if Trump won in November, you could imagine that members of the House and Senate might try to keep him out of office, arguing that he had engaged in insurrection.

One, of course, is that the humanitarian crisis continues to pose serious concerns for the United States, so much so that, as you saw over the weekend, the U.S. has started airdropping aid, including food to the people that are in Gaza right now who are suffering immensely.We are also seeing, of course, the growing calls for a ceasefire, including from the President himself, who has started saying that there needs to be an immediate six week temporary ceasefire as a part of that hostages deal that U.S. officials have been working on for weeks. And then there is the Biden-Netanyahu relationship that has been fraught and complicated at times and has been out in the open for the public to see over the course of this war, just how complicated and fraught that relationship has been. And we know for a fact that the Gantz's visit to Washington was not exactly endorsed by Prime Minister Netanyahu and has ruffled feathers within that government. So it has the potential to further inflame some of those tensions that exist between the Biden administration and the Netanyahu government. The Vice President's comments that we saw over the weekend were so stark and probably some of the starkest that we had seen from a senior U.S. official, both in terms of calling for that immediate temporary ceasefire, but also because it went into just such graphic detail about the suffering that we are currently seeing in Gaza.
