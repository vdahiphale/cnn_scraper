Training, maintaining and sustaining Ukraine's (sic) remains key for Ukraine to prevail. Throughout this war, Ukraine has shown incredible resourcefulness and how they integrate varied capabilities to adapt the changing dynamics of this battlefield. Ukrainians have combined unbreakable will with innovative tactics and empowered their leaders to liberate their own country. Russia, on contrast, is waging a very costly war of attrition while Ukraine is effectively leveraging their asymmetric advantages in order to defend itself. And the most important asymmetric advantage they have is courage, resilience and tactical skill. This war is extremely dynamic and Ukraine today is fighting while training and evolving for future operations. Ukraine will integrate recent commitments of armored vehicles, infantry fighting vehicles and tanks with fires to achieve the effects of synchronized ground maneuver. While Russia has waged this war for far too long, they will not outlast the Ukrainian people nor the group of allies and partners that met today. The purpose for the United States and allies, as set by our political leadership, is very simple:  it's to uphold rules-based international order, an order that rejects the idea that big, strong, powerful nations can attack other smaller countries; that borders shall not change just by the use of aggressive military force. This is the very underlying founding principle of the United Nations at the end of World War II. Ukraine does not stand alone; 54 countries met today to ensure that Ukraine can defend itself and the principles that guide international conduct -- and those principles will be upheld. We will remain a unified coalition, we will continue to uphold the values of sovereignty and freedom and we will continue to support Ukraine. Thank you and I welcome your questions.

What are you seeing from Russia that makes this moment different? And the NATO secretary general has already warned that Ukraine is burning through the munitions faster than the rate the allies can supply it. Will you, at some, point need to ask Ukraine to do more with less? And then, for Chairman Milley, did one of the missiles fired at the Lake Huron object miss and, if so, what happened to that missile? And if so, does that change your risk calculus for shooting down objects over U.S. soil? Are you starting to develop alternatives, if and when you detect the next object?",

We are going to do everything we can, working with our international partners, to ensure that we give them as much ammunition as quickly as possible. And that we will do everything we can to sustain our efforts there as well. We are working to -- with the Ukrainian soldiers and various places throughout Europe to emphasize additional training on maneuver. So that as they place more emphasis on maneuver and shaping the battlefield with fires and then maneuvering, there is a good chance that they will require less artillery munitions. But that is left to be seen. So we're going to do everything we can to make sure they have what they need to be successful. And that is what we continue to emphasize here in the Ukraine Defense Contact Group. And we think the training will pay additional dividends as well.",

The second one, over Alaska, on the north coast of Alaska, that's one hit. The third one in -- that landed in the Yukon, that one hit. On the fourth one over Lake Huron, first shot missed; second shot hit. So the most important thing for the American military is to protect the American people. So we evaluate the risk. We evaluate the risk of the balloons themselves. Are they a kinetic threat or not, yes/no? Are they an intelligence threat? Are they a threat to civil aviation? All of those things we go through very, very carefully. We determine what the debris field is likely to be with one of these platforms, landing on the Earth's surface or the water. So we go through great lengths to make sure that the airspace is clear and the backdrop is clear, to the max effective range of the missile. An in this case, the missiles -- or the l landed harmlessly in the water of Lake Huron. We tracked it all the way down. and we made sure the airspace was clear of any commercial, civilian or recreational traffic. We do the same thing for the maritime space. So we are very, very deliberate in our planning. NORTHCOM does that, along with the pilots themselves. So we are very, very careful to make sure that those shots are, in fact, safe.

The security from the Polish border or any other border, Romanian border, anywhere, that security is a part of the security plan for the Ukrainian armed forces.

That's why we've emphasized that we need to do everything that we can to get Ukraine as much air defense capability as we possibly can. Recently, you've seen us step up and offer Patriots; you've seen other countries come forward, with SLMT (ph) and IRIS-T. But it's not enough and we're going to keep pushing until we get more because that threat is out there. But again, we -- many countries have stepped up to the plate thus far. Our effort, currently, is to get these capabilities into country as quickly as we can. And then integrate those capabilities so we have truly have an integrated air and missile defense capability. And I will add that Ukraine has done an incredible job of intercepting a lot of the rockets and missiles that have been launched by Russia in those recent attacks. But again, we want to make sure that they have the ability to protect themselves going forward, in the event that Russia tries to introduce its air force into this fight. They haven't done so thus far, because Ukraine's air defenses have been pretty gosh darn effective, as you know.",

Do you encourage countries to do so if they want to? Or do you assess the risk is too high? So what is the U.S. position on other countries delivering fighter jets? And to Chairman Milley, the Russian offensive we are seeing, what do you see so far? Is this very serious? Is it different from what we saw in the past?

Most of the dynamic movement back and forth is in -- generally in the vicinity of Bakhmut. The Ukrainians are holding, they're fighting the defense; the Russians, primarily the Wagner group, are attacking. But there's a -- what I would describe it as, is a really, a very significant grinding battle of attrition with very high casualties, especially on the Russian side. There's no fancy arts of maneuver going on here. This is frontal attacks, wave attacks, lots of artillery, with extremely high levels of casualties in that particular area. And how long that will last? It's difficult to say, actually. It's been going on for weeks. And I think it will continue to go on until the -- until the Russians culminate. I don't think the Ukrainians will just collapse or fold. I think they will continue to fight. So that's a battle worth, that we're paying attention to very closely and making sure the Ukrainians have the capability to continue to defend. As far as Kyiv, I'm not going to go into what intelligence we have or don't have. I'll just say that, right now, there's always a potential threat. There's clearly air threats, missile attack threats; Kyiv is the capital. And that was a significant objective early in the war. So I would never discount Russian capabilities to attack Kyiv.

So these are the things I think that are emerging here, bringing everything together, bringing complex training programs and agendas to achieve complex and difficult aims on the battlefield, bringing all of that together.
