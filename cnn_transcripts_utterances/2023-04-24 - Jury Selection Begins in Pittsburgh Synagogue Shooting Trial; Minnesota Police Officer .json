Good to have you on, sir. They say it's fast and clean, but this is not an easy operation. They were on the ground for less than an hour. There's a reason for that. There's also a reason why they sent members of SEAL Team Six. They wanted the most experienced. What are the dangers in operation like this? BRIG. GEN. MARK KIMMITT (RET.), FORMER U.S. CENTRAL COMMAND DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR PLANS AND STRATEGY:  Well, first of all, the key issue is, you don't know what's going to happen in the air. Both parties said they would not give up airspace to allow any kind of operations. So there's that risk. You can get the helicopters shot down. Second, you don't know what's going to happen on the ground. Even if these are not forces that belong to the RSF, you could just have a couple of knuckleheads out there with weapons.

Julie Chavez Rodriguez, this close White House adviser, a senior adviser here at the White House, is expected to become the campaign manager for the nascent campaign. Other personnel decisions are in the works as well. And it's all driving towards the possibility of the president officially making it official on Tuesday morning via a campaign-style video. It'll be a pretty low-key, kind of slow burn start to a campaign that they know will be ramping up significantly over the course of the next 19 months. The usual caveat, Brianna, as you know quite well, applies here. If the president hasn't officially signed off, it doesn't mean officially that it's going to happen. But that is certainly where everything has been leading up to this point. And it's a critical moment for this White House, for the president, for his political team. While it has long been a foregone conclusion that the president was going to run for reelection, the realities of this moment, the challenges this president faces, his low approval ratings, the fact he's the oldest president in American history, the very real challenges that he entered office in his first term to try and calm down, to try and move away from, most notably, his predecessor, and the fact he's still leading the polls for the 2024 Republican nomination, are still very palpable, are still very present. And all of those things combined underscore that this is not going to be an easy run for reelection. It's something White House advisers are critically aware of going into this moment, and it's something that's driving fund-raising plans, messaging, how the president's strategy will play out over the course of the next several months. There's also the reality of, he's the incumbent president. You mentioned that weekend in Camp David. And, yes, it was scheduled to be an intensive weekend about the structure of his campaign, decisions that still needed to be made. But he was also focused on what you guys were talking about in the lead of the show, Sudan and ordering the emergency evacuation of the embassy. Those will always be issues the president will be balancing throughout the course of the campaign, whether he launches tomorrow or some other time. White House officials know that. The president is very aware of that as well. And this will all be part of the drive towards 2024. Expect to see, message-wise, much of what you have seen in these first couple of months in the weeks and months ahead. White House officials acknowledge, they know they will have to be full go come the start of next year. They know the campaign will be extremely intense and difficult, Brianna.",

And then jury selection will resume again this afternoon. And I just got to say, it's been a very emotional day already in court. We saw potential jurors in tears just weighing the possibility of having to rule on the death penalty. And, of course, there are also members of family -- or other family members of victims of the synagogue shooting from four-and-a-half years ago who were in the courtroom today. So let's remind viewers exactly what we're talking about. Again, four-and-a-half years ago is October 27, 2018, where prosecutors say Robert Bowers arrived at the Tree of Life Synagogue armed with multiple guns. And, remember, there are members of multiple different, three different Jewish congregations at the synagogue at the time. And the criminal complaint says that Robert Bowers came in, started firing on the outside, and then firing indiscriminately on the inside. And part of those court documents say that Mr. Bowers said things like he wants to kill Jews while he was going on this shooting rampage. And, also, prosecutors said that they found antisemitic postings online that have been attributed to Mr. Bowers as well. That brings us to today. Mr. Bowers, of course, is accused of killing 11 people, injuring many others. And he's facing 63 felony counts, including 22 potentially death penalty-related counts. And prosecutors in this case are seeking the death penalty. In fact, earlier today, the judge said to some of these potential jurors, you should be prepared to rule on a death -- on whether or not to give this man the death penalty if we get to that sentencing process, if he is determined guilty as well. But I will say that Mr. Bowers, his defense attorney, one of his defense attorneys is actually a high-profile attorney who has defended other federal death penalty defendants in the past. Her name is Judy Clarke. She's defended folks like the Unabomber and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev from the Boston Marathon bombings. They actually tried to present to course -- to court, rather, an offer of a guilty plea with life in prison, as long as they took the death penalty off the table. But, at this point, federal prosecutors are not budging on that death penalty ruling. So, again, like I said, jurors have been told they should expect to rule on the death penalty if they continue on with this case. Jury selection is expected to pick up in the next couple hours, back when people get back from recess -- Brianna.",
