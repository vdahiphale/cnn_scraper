But first. America's top diplomat sits down with CNN in China, the U.S. secretary of state providing a remarkably candid assessment of everything from Middle East relations, Beijing's relations with Moscow, through to claims of election interference. Antony Blinken says the U.S. has already seen evidence of Beijing attempting to influence the upcoming U.S. election. Something, of course, China has consistently denied. It follows meetings with Beijing's top brass, in which Blinken also warned of potential U.S. action over China's support for Russia. Now, Kylie Atwood conducted that interview and is traveling with Blinken in China, and she joins us now from Beijing. Kylie, fantastic to have you with us and great to be able to sit down with the secretary of state there. It's a very different relationship. I think we can say that to where we were, what, 12 months ago, which does allow thorny issues to be discussed and debated. It was the conversation though about potential election interference that certainly caught my attention. What more did he have to say about the evidence for that and what they're saying about China tackling it, stopping it ultimately? KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Yes. Well, listen, the secretary said that China is arguably already attempting to interfere in U.S. elections. And the context here is that late last year, President Biden and President Xi met in the U.S. And CNN has reported that Xi made a commitment to Biden that China would not interfere in the upcoming presidential elections. And so, it's noteworthy that it appears that China is not heeding the warning calls from the United States not to do it. Also, not upholding that commitment that President Xi made. Listen to what the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, told me about what the U.S. is seeing here. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  What I can tell you is this, President Biden was very clear about that with President Xi, and I repeated that today in my meetings.",

He also said that Europeans are in a position where they are also ready to come out and apply costs against China here.

An Egyptian delegation was in Israel earlier today, a working level delegation, trying to work out the finer points of a framework agreement that would then be presented to Hamas, including to Hamas' leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, over the coming days to see if there is a way of moving forward. And one of the key elements of pressure that is being brought to bear on all of this is the fact that Israeli officials have been telegraphing a coming military ground offensive in that southernmost City of Rafah, which is right on the border with Egypt. And so, there's no question that Egypt's concerns about the possibility of that operation on which they have been engaging in security consultations with Israeli officials over the course of the last week, there's no questions that Egypt's concerns about that operation are playing a huge part here in this effort by the Egyptians. And while there isn't any kind of certainty or any sense that there is a breakthrough on the immediate horizon, we did get a sense of optimism earlier today from the U.S. national security adviser, Jake Sullivan. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAKE SULLIVAN, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER:  If you would ask me a week ago, I would have said I felt we were in a deadlock, not that this was hopeless because we will get this done, but that we were at a bit of an impasse. Today, I believe that there is a renewed effort underway involving Qatar and Egypt as well as Israel to try to find a way forward. Can I guarantee that will happen in the near term? I cannot. But do I think that there is new momentum, new life in these hostage talks? I believe there is, and it is our job to try to take that new life, push it forward, and get to an end game where every one of those hostages, including the American hostages, is home safe with their family.

That's what the prosecution is setting out to prove. And they started that process by calling their first witness, David Pecker. We heard a lot from him this week. He's the so-called tabloid king. He is somebody who testified about his history with Donald Trump. And specifically, his history of a relationship where he, Donald Trump, and Michael Cohen, Trump's longtime fixer, had this process called catch and kill, where Pecker would pay for stories before they came out in the media and that he would have essentially make sure that those stories, that are potentially embarrassing to Donald Trump, never came out. And specifically, he testified that his understanding of this relationship was that it was specifically to help Donald Trump's presidential campaign. Now, it's important to note that where Pecker's first-hand testimony left off is he recommended to Michael Cohen that Michael Cohen should buy Stormy Daniels' story. That's where the indictment really focuses, is on Stormy Daniels and efforts to keep her story from coming out. So, leaving the door open and setting the stage for other witnesses, and Michael Cohen himself to take the stand sort of fill in those gaps. And then as you mentioned, the second and third witnesses also taking the stand today. The first was Trump's longtime personal assistant, somebody who sat outside his office in Trump Tower for over 30 years. She was sort of a vehicle for prosecutors to introduce documentary evidence. And prosecutors also made very clear and elicited this testament from her that Donald Trump is paying for her and other Trump organization employees legal fees. So, that was something the prosecution wanted the jury to hear. The second witness today, in addition to Rhona Graff was this man named Gary Farro. And Gary Farro is a banker who testified that he worked with Michael Cohen and helped him set up these accounts that were allegedly used to pay Stormy Daniels for -- to keep her story quiet. You know, the prosecution has a long way to go. They have to link Donald Trump to these payments. They have not done that yet. But they are establishing sort of the context and the circumstances around this case. The jury has to know in order to hear Michael Cohen's story and testimony and ultimately, determine whether or not they find it credible.",

So, it's some political puffing of the chest from a man who's been a little bit cagey and unwilling to debate his primary opponents in the past. But as you said, this is the first time we've heard Joe Biden unequivocally say that he too would be willing to meet Trump in a debate. It's interesting as well, because both men have faced some criticism and their campaigns have attacked each other over this idea that they're both too old or perhaps too, you know, incapable or worn down of serving as president. That's something that has really come to the forefront as Trump specifically has sat in this courtroom for hours and hours every single day. So, we'll see if it ultimately happens. Debates don't usually occur until a little bit further in the presidential campaign cycle, but both men committing today, Trump again for like the multiple -- like 100th time that they would debate each other.

Last December, the Treasury Department creates a new sanctions regime. They don't use it. And then going into Blinken's visit, they steadily start to bleed out the specifics of their concerns. The fact that machine tools, microelectronics, nitrocellulose, which is a component of rocket propellants, these are all flowing from China to Russia. So, they start to signal that they will use sanctions if it continues. And I think what they're trying to do is to affect the behavior of Chinese firms and authorities to dial back on those shipments. But if it doesn't work, I think we'll see sanctions. And that's basically what Blinken said.",

The Finnish telecoms company is teaming up with the U.S. Space Agency to install a first ever 4G network on the moon. They hope to carry out a test later this year with the ultimate aim of providing astronauts with cell service by the time they return to the moon later this decade. Currently, astronauts communicate by radio, so it was a big shift. 4G would allow them to send things like high resolution video and data back to Earth. Now, for years, science fiction has dreamed about what talking with someone in space might be like. As you can see with this clip from 2001 \"A Space Odyssey.\" Not so easy. All this might sound a little high flying, but it also has some big implications closer to home. If they succeed in a hostile space environment, the lessons might carry over to tough climates and locations back here on Earth. I'm excited to say I'm joined now by Bernie Edwards of NASA's Space Technology Mission Directorate and Thierry Klein, the president of Solutions Research at Nokia Bell Labs. Gentlemen, fantastic to have you on the show. Thierry, I'm going to come to you first. Just give us your lunar economy mission because mission -- vision because, obviously, communications is key to that. THIERRY E. KLEIN, PRESIDENT, NOKIA BELL LABS SOLUTIONS RESEARCH:  Yes, absolutely. Thank you, Julia. We absolutely believe that advanced communication capabilities are critical for any future space exploration. The Artemis program could bring astronauts and humans back to the lunar surface as well as the future lunar economy. When you think about human presence on the moon, the astronauts need voice, video, data communication. We think about robotic applications, whether it's for transportation, mining and so forth. And all of these applications really require the advanced communication technology that we have developed as a telecom industry. And so, we're excited to partner with NASA to demonstrate that we can take these technologies that you and I use every day, that we use to make phone calls on our smartphones, connect to the internet, download videos, images, and so forth, that we can take those technologies into space and support NASA's future missions.",

So, you know, there's a lot of smart people, expertise out in the commercial world. There's a lot of investments made. And so, we're trying to go back to the moon and do it in a way that can be sustained over a long period and eventually support sustained human presence and industrialization. So, as Thierry mentioned, you know, think of mining and things like that on the moon. And the best way to do that is with commercial technology where we can basically buy what we can and only design and invent something new if we have to. So -- and this is a perfect example where we want to use commercial communications technology to further our goals.",

We have proposals from companies to do a technology demonstration, and we're -- I'm hoping that that'll be chosen by NASA. So, it -- sometimes it does come down to what needs to be done on the mission. There's only so much mass and power available. There's only so much time with the astronauts. And of course, there's only so much money. So, we need to figure all that out. But if you look at our long-term plans, again, where we want to have eventually a base on the moon, and they didn't do -- I'll say, a lot of commercial operations, you're going to need communications. You're going to need power, and you're going to need communications, and you're going to need navigation and timing to do anything. And I think this is a great first step.
