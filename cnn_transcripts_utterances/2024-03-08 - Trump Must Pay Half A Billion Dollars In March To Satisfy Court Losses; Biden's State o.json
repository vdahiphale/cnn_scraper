March 11 -- that's this upcoming Monday. That's when Donald Trump is going to have to post $83.3 million in his defamation case that he lost against E. Jean Carroll. There is also a deadline upcoming for him to post $454 million. That's in the New York attorney general's civil fraud lawsuit against him that he lost. That is due March 25, the same day that he goes on criminal trial for falsifying business records in New York. Those deadlines are approaching so fast, even while Donald Trump is appealing. Because the way the system works, Kate, is that even when you're appealing you have to put the money up as bond. And so, not only is he going to be having to put those -- that amount of money up pretty soon, by those deadlines, there also could be additional amounts added to it because of percentages extra you have to put up when you're posting bond, as well as interest.",

Two of their main arguments yesterday in court filings to Judge Aileen Cannon, overseeing that classified documents case, is that prosecutors say do not let Donald Trump be above the law.His argument is that because he took these records out of the White House and took them to Mar-a-Lago they should be able to be his. And the Justice Department says he should be able to be held accountable for taking national security records that should not have been at Mar- a-Lago after the presidency. They also are arguing that in one of his arguments where he says he should be immune because he was president when he took those documents after the White House, the Justice Department says that is a frivolous argument. And while he has appealed issues about presidential immunity in his other case related to January 6, this is so frivolous in this Mar-a- Lago case. He should not be able to stop the clock if he continues appeals questions about presidential immunity in this Mar-a-Lago case. Everyone should be headed to trial. That's the Justice Department's position. But we're going to see everybody in court next Thursday to start arguing some of these things in a little bit more detail with Judge Cannon.",
