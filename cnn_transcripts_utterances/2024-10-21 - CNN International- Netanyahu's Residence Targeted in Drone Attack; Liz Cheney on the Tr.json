Just ahead, Israel ramps up its attacks in Lebanon and vows to keep pounding Hezbollah until it collapses. And the U.S. Defense Secretary makes a surprise visit to Kyiv, amid warnings, North Korea is planning on sending thousands of troops to fight for Russia in Ukraine. And the Turkish Muslim Preacher Fethullah Gulen, blamed by Turkey for an attempted coup against the president, dies at the age of 83.Israel is intensifying military operations in Lebanon and Northern Gaza even further. Across Lebanon, the IDF says it is broadening its attacks to include financial institutions linked to Hezbollah. The Israeli military says the Iranian backed group fired about 200 projectiles into Israel on Sunday. At the same time, the United Nations is warning that Israel may be destroying the Palestinian population in Northern Gaza. And as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza deepens, some Palestinians are now describing air drops of aid as both dangerous and humiliating. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

CNN's Matthew Chance has more from Tel Aviv, and we warn you, some of the images in his report are difficult to watch.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Israeli forces patrolling the labyrinth of narrow streets in the Central Gaza Strip. These latest images from the Israeli military, what they say is their continued activity amid the devastation to dismantle Hamas. To the south in Rafah, where the Hamas Leader was recently killed, drone footage of strikes and what Israel says are more Hamas fighters and infrastructure, while across Gaza, civilians are paying a heavy price. At this hospital in the north of the Gaza Strip an influx of casualties from a new Israeli strike at Bet Lahia, where Palestinian health officials say dozens of people, including women and children, were killed. Among the shrouded bodies of her family this woman calls her father to grieve their loss. I swear, dad, nobody is left. She sobs. Israel says the casualty figures are exaggerated and that they operate against Hamas in a precise and targeted manner that eye witnesses at the scene say the Israeli air strikes felt like an earthquake. It was just Wednesday when an Israeli drone captured the final moments of the Hamas Leader Yahya Sinwar's life. His killing fuelling hopes of a hostage release, even a ceasefire in Gaza and beyond. In fact, the region seems to be plunging further into chaos, with Israel stepping up strikes and pressing deeper into neighboring Lebanon, hitting what it says are strongholds of Iranian backed Hezbollah, like here, the town of Nabatiyeh in Southern Lebanon. Back in Israel, Hezbollah rockets have been striking the country's north. One drone even hitting near the Israeli Prime Minister's private house in the coastal town of Caesarea. He called it an assassination attempt by agents of Iran, vowing to press ahead with military action. Iran denies involvement, and Hezbollah has not claimed responsibility.",

So overnight, there were more strikes on Lebanon, specifically, as you mentioned there in Baalbek and in Tyre now, there were still rescue workers trying to dig through the rubble, trying to find survivors this morning.And it comes as Israel says that it issued what it called evacuation orders just right before these attacks and it's part of this wider push that we have seen. Israel says it's targeting financial institutions that belong to Hezbollah but those financial institutions, which Israel says provide payment to Hezbollah fighters, provides its ability to buy weapons, allows it to evade sanctions, those same financial institutions are also a lifeline for the Shia community in Lebanon. They provide interest free loans to the poor. They pay out salaries. And Israel says that this is part of the objective, not just to destroy the brick and mortar of these financial institutions, but to actually evade erode the trust between Hezbollah and the Shia community in Lebanon, and the consequences of this, of course, have been dire, as we see them play out on the ground, but Israel is only doubling down. Yoav Gallant the country's Defense Minister was on the border with Lebanon just the other day, speaking to Israeli troops, saying that the operation intends to quote clear that area in Southern Lebanon, in Southern Beirut, essentially to destroy Hezbollah and make it safe, in the words of Gallant, for Israelis to return to their homes in Northern Israel. But that operation is very much still ongoing, and the death toll continues to climb. Some 1800 people killed in Lebanon since the start of this latest uptick, with more than 9000 wounded. And the firepower is still flying in towards Israel. Israel says that some 200 rockets over the weekend were fired towards Israel. And you have to remember that any attempts at peace, negotiations, at ceasefires, talks, all of those have stalled. There have been some backdoor channels. The Intelligence Chief of Egypt met with Israel's Intelligence Chief, but these are still very nascent attempts, especially when we know that the temperature is only going to rise, that this is only going to escalate, because Prime Minister Netanyahu is preparing his response to Iran's ballistic missile barrage from just a couple of weeks ago.",

You have to remember President Biden has absolutely been pushing to see some sort of ceasefire, some sort of deal, take place before he leaves office. He's been pushing Prime Minister Netanyahu on this as well. There was hope among those White House officials that Yahya Sinwar's death was that prize that Prime Minister Netanyahu was seeking in order for this war to at least have the temperature come down, to some extent.U.S. officials were also hoping that Yahya Sinwar's death would open the way to Hamas being more lenient in negotiations, potentially no indication that any of that is happening. Of course, Yahya Sinwar will likely be replaced with a figure that would only carry out those tough negotiation stances that he had insisted on, Hamas has insisted on those stances since his death as well, which is the withdrawal of all Israeli troops before the release of hostages. And for Palestinians, absolutely, there is no hope on the ground that the death of Yahya Sinwar will change anything when it comes to the daily bloodletting that they are suffering through every single day Amara.",

The Ukrainians will be looking for reassurance that aid is locked in for at least a period of time, as we've seen, the Biden Administration tried to sort of run down the allocated congressional funding, and like we saw today, for the third time in a month, announce a funding sort of military aid package worth 400 million that's the third of a similar size in the last month.So, they are really trying to front load this aid ahead of the election. It includes things like artillery ammunition, anti-tank weapons, all the kinds of things that Ukraine needs to sustain its defense on the front lines. But obviously, as you say, this is less -- is just over two weeks out from an election which is existential for Ukraine. That's how the Ukrainians see it. They are following this extremely closely, and they have experienced life in the not too -- not too distant past without U.S. aid, when Congress delayed that supplemental aid package for six months, and Ukraine paid the price quite heavily in territory, so they are very nervous about that happening again. And of course, that's what we're going to see, I think, dominate the conversations during this visit. They're going to continue to lobby, I think, for more aid. Air defenses will be top of the agenda, daily, almost daily, attacks by Russian drones is what Ukraine is experiencing right now. Just overnight into this morning, as Lloyd Austin was heading into Ukraine, Russia fired 116 drones, of which just over half Ukraine managed to shoot down. So, they are really up against it. In terms of this aerial war, it has increased exponentially. And I think another key topic on the agenda will be the issue of restrictions on those long-range Western missiles. The U.S. is a sort of critical element when it comes to the unanimity between the countries that have provided those missiles and whether or not they would consider lifting those restrictions. We're not seeing any sign of that as of yet Erica.",

We haven't seen evidence of North Korean troops on the battlefield in Ukraine yet, but this is a video that was provided to CNN by the Ukrainian government, which purports to show North Korean soldiers at a training camp in Russia, far eastern Russia, near the Chinese border. Another video has surfaced on social media, which CNN has geo located to that same training camp South Korea says that they think about 1500 North Korean troops are already training in Russia, and that eventually they are preparing to send around 12,000 which is not a big number, if you think this is a war where at any given time, Russia has about several 100,000 deployed in Ukraine. But it's unnerving for the West. It's unnerving for South Korea because it speaks to a potential pipeline that Russia could tap North Korea to replenish its ranks, avoiding a controversial mobilization at home, and continuing with this strategy of attrition, trying to outlast Ukraine, exhaust it, and out lost its allies, so it is a real concern, both for Ukraine and the West.",

Let's turn it over to Alayna now, who has been tracking Trump, as we know he was in Pennsylvania this weekend, and talk about sharpening attacks Trump taking it to another level with some vulgar language when he was describing Vice President Harris, but today he will also be in North Carolina, another battleground state. ALAYNA TREENE, CNN REPORTERHowever, Amara, I will say what we heard him do this weekend, and really what we've heard over the last couple weeks now from Donald Trump is that his speeches are getting more meandering. They're kind of all over the place. They're getting more vulgar. He's using profanity. Over the weekend, when he was in Latrobe, Pennsylvania on Saturday, just after Jason Miller had given that talk about this being his closing pitch, he went on a nearly 15-minute -- you know story. He told a nearly 15-minute story about Arnold Palmer and described his genitals. So, some of these speeches are a bit odd. They're getting darker with his rhetoric. All of that to say, though some of those speeches as well, though you are getting glimmers of what that closing pitch will be when he reads the teleprompter, he read something about wanting to return American dominance, pride, all of that to America. It will be the return of the Golden Age if he wins that one 100 years from now, when people look back on this election, they will see it as the greatest American victory. That is what the closing argument is. However, he is having difficulty, I think, really pinpointing it and making it very clear throughout these remarks. But I will say, you know, I do want to transition to what he is doing today, because we are seeing Donald Trump really aggressively hit these battleground states in a way that we haven't seen him campaign really up until recently, right? Like, remember, I've been covering Donald Trump's campaign for about two years now. He used to do only one or two rallies a week. He has been doing multiple stops a day, and you'll see that when he goes to North Carolina. He's going to be in North Carolina this afternoon. He's going to start in Asheville, where he'll survey some of the hurricane damage, will also later do a rally in Greensboro, and then also meet with a faith leaders roundtable. Now, one thing about North Carolina that I actually I find fascinating. We just learned this yesterday, that as of yesterday afternoon, by 04:00 p.m. more than 100 excuse me, more than 1 million people have already voted early in the state. About 900,000 of those votes have been cast early in person. So, I'd keep that in mind, but it's actually been pretty remarkable to see, especially when you look at the first day of early voting in 2020 this has completely beat that turnout, even as we know that the state has been really ravaged by Hurricane Helene and so Trump will be there today. He's going to be delivering that pitch. I'd also remind you that, of course, both campaigns are going after North Carolina aggressively, but Trump won it both in 2016 and 2020, really. You know, it used to be thought of as a Democratic state that would normally go for the Democratic Nominee, but Donald Trump has proven that to be different. So, I'd keep an eye on that today, Amara.",

But I want to be very clear before we get into the nitty gritty, I'm not saying Elon Musk is going to be locked up or put on trial anytime soon.What we're saying is that some very respected scholars who study election law for a living saw what Musk did and immediately raised legal objections. So, you just heard that clip of Musk saying that the prize, the million-dollar prize, will be given to people who sign his petition, which, as you mentioned, was affirming your support for the First Amendment, and the Second Amendment sounds harmless, but that's actually not all you need to do to win the money. If you look at the fine print on Musk's Super PAC Website, it says you must be a registered voter in order to sign the petition, and that you can only win the million dollars if you live in one of the battleground states, like Pennsylvania and North Carolina, et cetera, that's the problem Amara. We spoke to a bunch of experts, and they said that federal law makes it a crime for to pay people to register to vote. You can't give them money or a chance to win money through a lottery. Here's what the law says, I will read it to you specifically quote, whoever knowingly or wilfully pays or offers to pay or accepts payment, either for registration to vote or to vote, can face up to five years in prison. That's the law, and legal experts said Musk could be crossing the line, especially for anyone who hears about the cash prize and then registers to vote. We reached out for comment to Musk's Super PAC. They did not respond, and like I said, this does not mean that Musk is getting indicted. If the Justice Department has a problem with what he's doing, the logical next step would be something like a cease-and-desist letter, but there is at least one former prosecutor who is calling this out in very strong terms, and that's Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro. He's a Democrat, and he was the state attorney general before becoming governor. He slammed Elon Musk yesterday on \"Meet the Press\" listen to what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. JOSH SHAPIRO (D-PA): I think there are real questions with how he is spending money in this race? How the dark money is flowing, not just into Pennsylvania, but apparently now into the pockets of Pennsylvanians. That is deeply concerning.

The man who Turkey blamed for trying to overthrow its president in a deadly coup in 2016 has died at the age of 83. The Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen was a bitter rival of the Turkish President. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh has more.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): To his followers, he was a peaceful man of God, preaching inter faith dialog, but to many in Turkey, Fethullah Gulen was a man who spent years building an opaque and vengeful movement to take over the Turkish state. And eventually the force behind a failed coup attempt that claimed the lives of more than 240 people in July of 2016. Turkey's President condemned Him and compared him to ISIS, Gulen always maintained he had done nothing wrong, saying, in a 2016 statement, quote, I have repeatedly condemned the coup attempt in Turkey and denied any knowledge or involvement. Born in 1941 to modest circumstance, Gulen climbed the ranks of Turkey's religious bureaucracy to become an influential Imam. Over decades, he built a fervent and loyal base of followers. Gulen's work was represented in all facets of Turkish life, including business associations, media outlets and financial institutions. But the linchpin of his movement was a vast network of schools that spanned across more than 100 countries. The schools in Turkey served as the main recruitment and placement tool for the movement. Many of its members were lower middle class, pious Muslims, disenfranchised by Turkey's staunch secularist power circles. Many of them took jobs in the public sector. In 1999, Gulen moved to the United States, settling in the State of Pennsylvania. His supporters say he left Turkey for medical treatment, but critics say he went into self-imposed exile, as he had come under scrutiny, accused of trying to undermine the secular government and replacing it with a religious one. They were allegations he denied. In 2002, when a religiously Conservative government was elected, Gulen found an ally in Turkey's New Prime Minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. It was a match made through political expediency.",

And at the end of the day, nearly 10 percent of the active generals of the Turkish Armed Forces, a NATO member country, were put in jail.KARADSHEH (voice-over): In 2013, prosecutors launched a corruption probe targeting Erdogan's inner circle. It was a break in the alliance, and perhaps the first public sign of a power struggle between the two men. Erdogan later outlawed Gulen's movement and branded it terror group. But it was the events of July 15, 2016 that would change the country for years to come. F-16 bombed parliament in the capital city, and armor tanks rolled into positions on the main bridge connecting Asia to Europe and Istanbul. Erdogan quickly blamed Gulen for that failed coup, and his government began a major crackdown. Thousands of people suspected of having links to Gulen were fired from their jobs and arrested. Gulen, meanwhile, lived a quiet life in Pennsylvania, despite multiple requests to the United States to extradite him back to Turkey, leaving behind a devout following and a controversial legacy that made him one of the most influential men in Turkey's modern history.
