Also happening over the next two hours of this show, we're tracking hurricane Beryl after leaving destruction in the Windward Islands, the powerful storm now heading for Jamaica. And is Britain ready for change in 24 hours, voters will go to the polls there to decide between British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Opposition Leader Kier Starmer. Well, stock markets in New York will open about 30 minutes from now at 9:30 local time. We are looking at a mostly lower picture as far as the futures are concerned. Investors breathed a sigh of relief on Tuesday after the Federal Reserve Chairman said inflation is moving lower. Again that's the picture as things stand back there in half an hour. The hurricane Beryl is fast approaching Jamaica as a powerful Category 4 storm. The latest forecast shows the storm center may just miss direct landfall but it is still expected to bring life threatening winds and a storm surge of six to nine feet. The small island nation of around 3 million people is now under curfew after residents scramble to stock up on essential supplies. CNN's Rafael Romo is standing by in Kingston, Rafael.",

We also had rain earlier. But make no mistake, a major hurricane is coming our way and it's expected to be here in the next few hours. As a matter of fact, Jamaica's Prime Minister Andrew Holness said that people here in Jamaica, the entire population of 3 million. They need to take this hurricane very, very seriously. A top government official told CNN that one of our main concerns was warning people who live in the low lying areas so they would move to safer ground. I'm talking about Senator Andrew Masuda who also told us that the government has made available 780 shelters across the island in case people need them. And the reality is that there's a lot of anxiety, people that we have talked to hear because they have seen what happened in Barbados. They have seen what happened in Grenada and they know that it may happen here again, let's remember, this island was very hardly hit by hurricane Gilbert in 1988 again, hurricane Ivan in 2004. They both cause great devastation, and people have that concern that it's going to happen again today. Let's listen to what the Prime Minister Holness have to say warning people to seek shelter.

We'reseeing it lose some of its organization on the north side, but it's still maintaining that major strength and Jamaica hasn't seen something like this in 40 years. I mean, we had a couple of hurricanes make a pass around it as a major hurricane. But Gilbert is the only one that only major hurricane that made landfall if we can get to that next graphic to show you where Gilbert made landfall with a major category of a hurricane. And in that was 1988. That was more than 40 years ago. So just they haven't seen something like this and such an incredibly long time it has been decades the island is small, we're talking about a direct hit possible, we need to watch that I closely what it looks like could happen is it could scrape the southern edge of the island. You know whether that eye goes directly overland or not, you're still looking at storm surge up to nine feet possible that's two to three meters, we're still looking at rain up to 300 millimeters. So with this island also being mountainous that could also cause flash flooding and mudslides. So that could be a problem as well as something that we'll need to watch after Jamaica, you have hurricane warnings in effect for the Cayman Islands. And that's where we can find those impacts going into Thursday in the Cayman Islands as well as something that we'll need to watch. Something that we also need to watch very closely is the intensity. Right now with maintaining major category for strength and it will maintain that major strength as it passes by Jamaica. But as it gets past Jamaica, there are a couple of ingredients in its way where it could knock down that intensity just a little bit. So we'll need to watch that closely. Because we have some of those ingredients that can knock it down like dust and maybe some wind energy. But we also have record warm ocean temperatures that we've been talking about as well. That's what let it intensify so many times and really devastate the Windward Islands a couple of days ago. So we'll have to watch these things incredibly closely as it continue to track through the Caribbean Sea, eventually making it towards the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico by the end of the week watching that closely, that area has already gotten too much rain from the tropical systems in the last couple of weeks, Becky.",

But it comes at a time when the Biden campaign and the President himself are really engaging in these private and public pushes to try to reassure voters that he is up for a second term. The President has started placing phone calls to top Democrats on Capitol Hill, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, as well as a top ally of his Former Senators Chris Coons of Delaware. The president is expected to continue those calls today, as well as hosting a meeting with Democratic governors this evening. Some governors will be here in person and others attending virtually but it comes after a group of Democratic governors held a phone call on Monday. Sources tell us with some expressing concerns about President standing in the 2024 race. But you are starting to see some cracks in the Democratic coalition in support of President Biden pointing to that comment that you heard from Congressman Lloyd Doggett. There are other Democrats who have openly said that they believe President Biden would lose in November if he remains at the top of the Democratic ticket. Now, in addition to the President's campaign from here at the White House to try to reassure allies, his campaign team is also preparing to get him out on the road. He'll be traveling to Wisconsin on Friday and to Philadelphia on Sunday to meet with voters. The President also will be sitting down for a high stakes interview with ABC News on Friday, something that many of his allies have encouraged him to do face tougher questions in the days after his debate performance. But certainly there are many questions going forward about whether President Biden will remain in this race for the time being. His team insists that he will, at the same time the President is also facing some questions about his own personal health and mental acuity. The White House has said that they've been transparent when it relates to the health of the President as well as batting down any suggestions that he potentially conduct a cognitive test. These are all some of the questions facing President Biden in as he continues to weigh his standing in the race.",

But one longtime democratic adviser told CNN in recent days that they believe that likely the only way President Biden would step aside in this race is if he saw polling, real data that showed that Democrats in House and Senate races would be negatively impacted by keeping him at the top of the ticket. One lawmaker yesterday said that he is the President needs to think about what this could mean, not just for next year's congressional makeup, but also the impact that potentially a Republican Congress with control of both chambers could have on policy and legislation in the years to come. So we're still waiting to hear if that's having any impact on the President's thinking at this moment. But so far, what the campaign has been pointing to is the fact that this public polling has shown that the race has really remained stagnant between Biden and Trump in the aftermath of that debate, of course, that could change in the coming days and weeks ahead as well.",
