The market is now closed for the day. Well, that wasn't a strong -- that was a wimpy gavel. A wimpy gavel, but a strong market. The markets and the main events of the day, Michael Cohen says he was knee-deep into the cult of Donald Trump when he worked as a fixer the former president. The White House is raising tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles to 100 percent. And US Secretary of State says, the US will seize Russian assets that will fund Ukraine's reconstruction. We are live in New York on Tuesday, May the 14th. I'm Richard Quest. I mean business. A very good day to you. Two stories, major stories that we are following for you. In Washington President Biden has announced a quadrupling of US tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles. The new rate, 100 percent, and up the road in New York, Donald Trump's defense team is now laying into the prosecution's star witness, Michael Cohen. It is a fiery cross-examination and that is where we will start our coverage tonight with the trial. Donald Trump's lawyers are hammering Michael Cohen in an effort to hurt his credibility. They've trotted out some of his past statements about the former president and asked them about one TikTok video where he called Donald Trump \"a dictator,\" and said he belongs in a cage. Cohen stood by his comments. He responded at one point saying that sounds like something I would say. Jessica Schneider is in Washington, DC. Jessica, there is only so many ways you can say you're a liar, you're a cheat, you're a dishonest no good and far worse, and Michael Cohen basically says, yep, but I am still telling the truth here.",

So they've asked about everything from his social media posts against Trump. They're talking about but the fact that Cohen made money off of his podcast where he talks mostly about Trump. They are harping on this fact that Michael Cohen, they believe just has an ax to grind since he was essentially cut off from the former president once Trump entered the White House. Even just a few minutes ago, the defense team talked to Michael Cohen about, hey, you know, while you were in prison, you started talking to the DA's office and there was a chance that you would get a reduced sentence, sort of giving that as the motivation why Michael Cohen has been cooperating and helping out prosecutors. But despite this, Michael Cohen, he hasn't been staying relatively calm in what has been at this point about two hours of cross-examination. The defense's aim here is to really try to knock Michael Cohen from every angle and do all they can to erode his credibility and that is especially because we saw the prosecution. They spent about eight hours questioning Cohen on direct. And in it, Richard, I mean, they elicited several examples from Michael Cohen of Donald Trump being very involved in this hush money deal. He promised Michael Cohen he would get repaid and he seemed to also be very involved in the repayment scheme, and that is where those 34 criminal counts stem from, you know, the falsification of business records.",

And the tariff on Chinese EVs will rise to 100 percent. Those EVs have been mostly cut out of the US market and the White House wants to keep it that way. It has seen the EU experience, the tariff is 10 percent and according to one policy group, Chinese brands will account for one in ten -- 10 percent of EVs sold in Europe this year. It is a market share likely to reach 20 percent by 2027, and the reason of course, Chinese EVs cell for a much lower price.

I think the impact on consumers is potentially very speculative. This is a very targeted tariff action on a narrow set of products and you could really analyze either way when you think about the effect on consumers. But when you talk about the impact on businesses and in the investments that they're making here in the United States as a part of the Inflation Reduction Act, for example, I think the impact is meaningful and what it really does is it gives those companies certainty that those investments that they're making today will not be overrun by imports of Chinese vehicles in the future.",

But, but on trade, and when Trump introduced quite high tariffs during his administration, there were some in Washington, Democrats and Republicans who said he is going too far. Now, the parties are united on this. Biden renewing Trump tariffs and adding to them, that's one point. Two, when you look at the categories of these tariffs, semiconductors, EVs, solar panels, steel, aluminum -- there is a national security piece to them which is how the Biden administration has pushed a lot of their trade restrictions to say high-tech goods, dual- use goods, et cetera. This is a national security issue. These are clearly trade issues as well. They're worried about competition, about EVs, cheaper Chinese EVs flooding the market, hurting US EV manufacturers; same on solar panels, steel, and aluminum.

But I would say another thing that with EVs, not having tariffs can sometimes be sticky, too, right? It is harder to put something on in place after a product has already flooded the markets. We saw that in solar. We really already felt the impacts in that industry. Here it is about getting ahead of the curve in what may be coming down the pike on EVs in the future.",

And the trick with respect to this, the sort of one of the interesting things with respect to this statute is that the prosecutors are not required to prove that the underlying crime was actually committed. And so because of that, and in particular in the beginning, you know, they named a few things. It seems pretty clear now that they have their sort of sights pointed on New York election law, violation of New York election law, and that that's what they're going to bring to the jurors.",

On has been picking up speed aided by people like the tennis star Roger Federer who became a major investor in 2019. Anna Stewart spoke with the company's co-CEOs about where On is headed next.

So what we're meaning by that is we're a pretty much sportswear brand so we want to give you a premium experience when you shop. Now, if you're a runner, you might shop at the On specialty channel or a Dick's sporting goods. If you're more lifestyle consumer, you might go to JD and, you know, where you find everything is our own D to C engine and our e-comm and our stores. And so we're just trying to have the right product in the right channel. And this should overall lead to an increase in the direct-to-consumer share over time. But we don't have a specific target where we wanted to land because it's all about the consumer and that the experience that you have when you experience us.",

And the momentum in the stores is incredible. So we feel that over the two years, China will become 10 percent of our business, an important part, at the same time, we are starting from such a small position so we can shape our own destiny there.
