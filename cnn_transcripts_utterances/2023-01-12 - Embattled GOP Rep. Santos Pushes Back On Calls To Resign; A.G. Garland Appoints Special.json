Not this person.We don't know some basic things about his background and resume other than things like the check fraud in Brazil and the fact that he's under dueling investigations. This is something I think Kevin McCarthy has to keep on lock. To Jessica's point, he can't afford to lose votes. But it would require a super majority of the House, so Democrats and a large number of Republicans to expel him from the conference. Of course, that would trigger a special election. This is a district that Biden won. And there's a fear with a lot of Republicans that it would flip that seat and make them lose that very slim majority.",

      "sentences": "Now, that's very important to understand, what exactly is a special counsel?The most important thing that a special counsel has is the same powers that any federal prosecutor has. You can issue subpoenas, you can investigate, you can do search warrants, you can indict, you can try cases, all the way through. What makes a special counsel different is that special counsel has a bit more distance, separation, independence, from the attorney general. That's why you go with a special counsel. For example, the regulations say that special counsel is not subject to the day-to-day supervision of the attorney general. The regulations say that a decision whether to charge a case or not starts with the special counsel. Ultimately, has to go to the A.G.. But the A.G. has to give great weight to whatever the special counsel wants to do. And if the attorney general overrules the special counsel, disagrees with him, then a report has to be filed with Congress. And the last thing that really distinguishes a special counsel is, at the end, special counsel has to file some sort of written report, which we remember from the Mueller report. So it's a federal prosecutor with a bit more independence.",

      "sentences": "John Miller, you have new information about the investigation. So just tell us what you've learned about the decision- making here.JOHN MILLER, CNN CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp; INTELLIGENCE ANALYST: Well, the decision-making process unfolded with -- as Elie says, it starts with the U.S. attorney in Chicago, Lausch, who was a holdover for the Trump administration, specifically to continue an investigation he was conducting into political corruption in Illinois. And he got this moved very quickly to look into it. And on January 5th, in his conversations with the attorney general, recommends that there should be a special counsel. A, he's leaving the Department of Justice. B, there's more to be done. And he said that's the appropriate way to go. So essentially, the decision to have a special counsel, something that's been batted back and forth over the last couple of days on the air waves and in the political discussion, was made on January 5th. The hard part was figuring out who that person would be. The regulations, as Elie said, have two key components among the many regulations about a special counsel. Number one is, does the thing merit investigation? How did classified documents get into the president's garage, into an off-site office, the vice president, at a time when he wasn't serving in office merits investigation. The second component that's critical is, are there extraordinary circumstances that would make it difficult for a regular prosecutor to do that case? [14:40:01] And in this case, the extraordinary circumstances that the target of the investigation would be the sitting president of the United States, which brings other complications. So those were the components where the Justice Department had to decide, do we keep this in-house, because we already have a preliminary job done by a U.S. attorney? Or do we have to go through too many ways to explain why we didn't go with a special counsel. A tough decision, but they made the call even before this announcement today.",

      "sentences": "Well, of course, the Biden White House was preparing for a ton of congressional oversight so they have staffed up with attorneys and with communications teams internally to be able to respond to oversight requests.I imagine, right now, the press secretary is working with White House counsel and the president's team to basically not offer any new information. That would be my recommendation as a comms professional who dealt with many crises in the former White House. Keeping it tight to what they said and not introducing any few facts. I think you'll hear a lot referring to the Department of Justice and not commenting on an open investigation. There's a lot of open questions. I want to note, when we're talking about investigations into classified information, we keep kind of hearing we need to know what's in these documents or know more about them. The public never know in all likelihood what's in the documents other than the classification. And that is to protect national security. So it's going to rely on this prosecutor and the officials doing the review to determine what level of threat was posed, what intent potentially was. But we're really as the general public not going to know much other than what is determined by the DOJ.",

Some Republicans point out, that was before the midterms. I don't know anybody on either side of the aisle who would voluntarily disclose this before the midterms. However, there were also key moments after the midterms. November 9th, 14th, 20th where they could have said something.

But they're also trying to in recent statements just make clear that they are cooperating in every manner possible. There was a statement released by the White House counsel a few moments ago where he said that they have been complying with the National Archives. They have complied with the Justice Department. And that ultimately they believe this review will show that these documents were, quote, \"inadvertently misplaced.\" But they're trying to stress that they understand the importance of classified information and certainly the president understands that. But look, this is a huge headache from the White House. They are now facing this special counsel probe. It's opening up a line of attack for Republicans. And there are questions about why they haven't released more information as this all played out behind the scenes and the type of communication or information that they have been sharing. Yesterday, at the White House press briefing, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was very limited in what she said. She referred back to the Justice Department but really wasn't sharing much more. As Alyssa noted, it's likely that they will hue very closely to the statements that have been released by the counsel. President Biden himself stayed very close to that, except when he made mention of the Corvette. This will be the first time we'll be hearing from the White House press secretary in just a few moments.",
