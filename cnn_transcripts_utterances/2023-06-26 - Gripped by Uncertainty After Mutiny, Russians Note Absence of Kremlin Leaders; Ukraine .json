CNN's Matthew Chance reports are from Moscow.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): To the Kremlin, these are some of the most disturbing scenes from a weekend of shocking images. On the streets of a major Russian city, Rostov-on-Don in the south, residents cheered Wagner fighters as they withdrew. Many Russians see them as heroes. Not as the traitors the Kremlin paints. And Wagner's leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin has become a celebrity to watch his supporters hailed down his car, just to shake hands. The Kremlin says he's now moving to Belarus next door, but it's unclear if this is the last we'll see again. What is definite, though, is a sense of relief, at least here in the Russian capital. CHANCE (on camera): It's calm now. But in the mayhem of the weekend, Moscow was on high alert military checkpoints on the outskirts of the city, residents bracing for Wagner fighters to enter and for the confrontation that never came. CHANCE (voiceover): It was really uneasy yesterday, says Andre. But look now people are walking in the streets and it's all good. Let's hope it will stay peaceful, he adds. But even here, this sympathy for Prigozhin's unprecedented challenge is to raids against the conduct of the war in Ukraine appears to have struck a popular chord. I think it was an expression of an opinion, says Oleg, another resident of Moscow, an opinion of a powerful person who wants some justice and clarity, the belief Prigozhin should be listened to. He's widely shared. But that's not what the Kremlin wants to hear. Vladimir Putin hasn't appeared in public since making his angry pledge on Saturday film behind the scenes by state television to punish those responsible for what he called an armed mutiny, the biggest challenge to his authority in 23 years of power. But now that challenge has been made. There are growing concerns about what a defensive President Putin stung by the events of this weekend will do next to stay in power. Matthew Chance, CNN Moscow.

Briefly, many Ukrainians entertained the hope that civil war or chaos in Russia would lead to an early end to the war, but Prigozhin sudden about face dash to those hopes. Sunday, Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said in an interview, he was hoping for something more concrete, perhaps a civil war in Russia.

Sunday, Ukrainian officials claimed their forces had seized a kilometer a kilometer stretch of trenches near Bakhmut. They said they killed wounded or captured an entire battalion.

He did speak with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy saying that the U.S. has unwavering support towards Ukraine and its people.

Now there is no doubt, Russian President Vladimir Putin has had a rain for 23 years through four American presidents. But the Biden administration this week, President Biden faces a new challenge for President Biden. They are not trying to be publicly seen being involved in this in any way at all, do not want to be blamed or accused of trying to tip the scales. But there is no doubt a weaker Vladimir Putin raises concerns and worries here in the U.S. and indeed in other Western capitals about the potential danger for that. So President Biden not scheduled to speak about this as the week begins, but he will have an event on Monday morning here at the White House.

One of the things of course, that we have heard from the Kremlin is that they say that the fighters for Wagner, because of their military achievements on the battlefield, will be able to apply to join the Russian military.That's something that's been in the cards for a while. It was a decree by the Russian defense minister a couple of weeks ago where he said that all of the private military companies needed to have contracts with the Russian army if they wanted to operate in the future. Now, Yevgeny Prigozhin of the Wagner private military company had always said that they were not going to do that. That was of course, also one of the things that escalated the feud between Prigozhin and the Russian military leadership. But all this is about a lot more than that. The private military company, Wagner, is one thing. But Yevgeny Prigozhin owns a lot more than that. He has media holdings. Like for instance, the Internet research agency which the U.S. says meddled heavily in the 2016 presidential election. Prigozhin was indicted for that. What happens to his media empire? Then of course there's all his dealings in the Middle East -- oil fields in Syria, in Africa exploiting things like gold and diamonds, also training local forces there. So there are definitely still a lot of questions about whether or not Yevgeny Prigozhin when he goes to exile in Belarus will retain any sort of control over that or if other solutions will be found by the Russian leadership.

And what it will allow is for the Coast Guard to leverage all of its resources including working with International partners. Now this is a multi step process, and right now they're in the first phase which is to gather evidence.They have had the Odysseus 6000 out at the bottom of the ocean looking for pieces of the vessel, looking to recover more pieces of evidence. Once that's completed they will hold a public hearing, collect more testimony and more evidence and then they will continue this investigation. I want you to listen from public officials talking about what's next in the process. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CAPT. JASON NEUBAUER, U.S. COAST GUARD: During the course of the MBI, the board will first and primarily work to determine the cause of this marine casualty and the five associated deaths. The MBI however is also responsible for accountability aspects of the incident and it can make recommendations to the proper authorities to pursue civil or criminal sanctions as necessary.

And just another important note here is that the Marine Board of Investigation is working with the U.S., the U.K. and France, and that of course reflects the nationalities of the five people who were on board of the vessel. So you can see this sort of multinational effort to try and bring some closure to these families.In fact, the rear admiral of the Coast Guard mentioned he had visited St. John's, where we are right now, to meet with some of the family members that arrived back to port yesterday. Now after this investigation is concluded, they will submit a report. And the idea here is to understand what happened, but also to make sure that safety protocols for deep sea submersible expeditions are improved so that nothing like this happens again.

Meantime, Russia's defense ministry now says the defense minister Sergei Shoigu has visited Russian troops fighting in Ukraine. Neither the ministry nor state media said when the visit took place.
