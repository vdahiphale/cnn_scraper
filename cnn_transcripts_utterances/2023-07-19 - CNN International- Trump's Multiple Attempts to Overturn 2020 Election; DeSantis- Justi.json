If you are just joining us, let me bring you up to date with our top stories this hour.A U.S. soldier is believed to be in North Korean custody after Pentagon officials say he willfully crossed the border at the Korean demilitarized zone. Donald Trump says he is now the target of the special counsel's criminal investigation into efforts to overturn the 2020 election. It's a sign Jack Smith is now zeroing in on Trump. If charged it would be the third indictment for the former president. And Michigan's Attorney General has charged 16 people in the state's 2020 fake elector scheme. These are the first criminal charges for current and former officials who tried to overturn the election for Donald Trump. Our CNN's Tom Foreman breaks down the multiple efforts by Donald Trump and his supporters to overturn the 2020 election. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "Up in Michigan, state officials have now charged 16 people as false electors posing as if they were the official electors from that state in the election. That fits in very well with the litany of accusations, suspicions that the special counsel has been scrutinizing, false electors, legislative nullification, pressure calls in at least seven different states -- that's calls to state officials saying that they should overturn the election in Trump's favor.What else did team Trump tried to do to overturn the selection? 62 court filings around the country. They lost all but one -- all but one. They lost virtually everything. But when the Supreme Court turned one down, Trump went online and again said the Supreme Court really let us down, no wisdom, no courage. [04:35:00] What else did they try? There's been scrutiny of an oval office discussion from December of 2020 when there was allegedly talk about seizing voting machines, declaring martial law, anything rather than accept the fact that Trump actually lost the election. There was all that pressure on Vice President -- then Vice President Mike Pence to block certifications, something that we know legally he could not do. And of course we all saw what happened on January 6 when then President Donald Trump rallied supporters, told them to go to the Capitol and said to them at one point, you need to fight like hell to defend your election here. What he called his victory in all of this. All of that we saw, all of that testifies to the fact that there was a concerted effort by team Trump in many places to try to overturn this legal fair election that he lost. And yet Trump's response to all of this in the latest news is: I have a right to protest an election that I'm fully convinced was rigged and stolen. Only question for many legal analysts here is, when did he go and did he go beyond merely protesting into something much more serious? (END VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "So, here's the problem. This country is going down the road of criminalizing political differences. And I think that's wrong.Alvin Bragg stretched the statute in Manhattan to be able to try to target Donald Trump. Most people -- even people on the left acknowledge, if that wasn't Trump, that case would not have likely been brought against a normal civilian. And so, you have a situation where the Department of Justice, the FBI, have been weaponized against people they don't like and the number one example of that happened to be against Donald Trump with the Russia collusion. That was not a legitimate investigation. That was being done to try to drive Trump out of office. And so, what I've said as president, my job is to restore a single standard of justice to end weaponization of these agencies. We're going to have a new FBI director on day one. We're going to have big changes at the Department of Justice. Americans across the political spectrum need to have confidence that what is going on is based on the rule of law, not based on what political tribe you're in. And then the second thing I would say is, this country needs to have a debate about the country's future. If I'm the nominee, we'll be able to focus on President Biden's failures, and I'll be able to articulate a positive vision for the future. I don't think it serves us good to have a presidential election focused on what happened four years ago in January. And so, I want to focus on looking forward. I don't want to look back. I do not want to see him, I hope he doesn't get charged, I don't think it will be good for the country, but at the same time, I've got to focus on looking forward, and that's what we're going to do.

They have to pass funding legislation in the House and Senate. Some of them urging for them to pair back spending for the Department of Justice in the aftermath of news of this investigation and of the past Trump indictment.Now, how that remains to be seen. The Speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy, has not yet indicated a plan to take action against the special counsel. But one person he did speak with in the news of all of these legal problems with Donald Trump was Trump himself, Speaker and Trump connected and tried to urge his colleagues to rush to his side and rush to his defense.

U.S. retail sales were up in June for the third consecutive month. But they did carry a warning sign. The June increase was less than in previous months. Economists say people are running down their savings they have built up during the COVID pandemic and job growth is slowing.And with student loan payments coming due again, they say it wouldn't be surprising if consumer spending continues to moderate. And stronger than expected second quarter earnings are pushing U.S. stock markets higher. This is a look at futures right now for the Dow, Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500. U.S. markets open in a little less than five hours. And they are coming off another very strong Tuesday on Wall Street. The Dow surged 366 points or more than 1 percent while the Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 both rose about three quarters of 1 percent. Earnings from Netflix, Tesla and United Airlines are due out on Wednesday. And new figures from the U.K. are showing a sharp slowdown in inflation. The rate fell to 7.9 percent in June, lower than expected and down from 8.7 percent earlier -- a month earlier. Lower fuel prices and food prices are the main reason. And it could take some of the pressure off the Bank of England when it comes to raising interest rates. And here's a look at the markets in Europe are looking. As you can see, all four indices there up in the green. Now Kenyan opposition leaders have called for three days of anti- government protests beginning today. Schools in Nairobi and two other major cities will be closed amid fears that the protests could turn violent. Demonstrators are protesting a slew of unpopular tax hikes the government claims will generate jobs and domestic revenue. Our CNN correspondent Larry Madowo is live for us from Nairobi from those protests. Larry, tell us what you're seeing and the message these protestors are wanting to send.",

What you see back here is some of officers kind of involved. They're trying to pull back some of the protestors. And some of these young people have been actively trying to provoke them into using tear gas, which they eventually did.So what you see is that smoke and some of those fires, is that police finally using tear gas to try and hold them back. But they keep throwing rocks back at the cops. And as they moved back -- I can say, so far, we've seen a lot of restrain from these officers, as they keep throwing a lot of rocks at them, but they're trying not to -- so far, we haven't seen any use of live ammunition. So far, they're just trying to make sure that they're protected. But I think it gets increasingly difficult to do so when so many people from so many corners are throwing rocks at them, throwing pieces of shoes and everything that they can get. They've lit a couple fires on the street right now. This is one of the tactics these demonstrators are using to try to block the road from people accessing it. But the officers have instructions to make sure that the roads are usable. Because the government said they did not get any notice about these demonstrations from the opposition and they will not allow them to take place. So they are taking place. We've driven around the city of Nairobi so far and it's mostly deserted. That's something that the government is trying to avoid. But it's inevitable it's happening here. These began as cost of living protests that devolved in to full-on antigovernment protests from so many people who feel that the cost of living has become so expensive for them, fuel, food and just about everything else. But that eventually comes into something like this. So many young people on the streets, some of them younger than 18, probably 13, 14, Christina, just battling the cops here. And I think you are about to see one of them using tear gas as they move forward to try and pull them back in their homes, but this running battle -- the whole day until night fall and the opposition promised three days of protests. So we might see tomorrow and the day after more of this.",
