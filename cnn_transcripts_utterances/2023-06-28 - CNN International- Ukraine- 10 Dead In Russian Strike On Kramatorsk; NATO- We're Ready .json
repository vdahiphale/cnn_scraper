More from the ground in just a moment. French President Macron calls the fatal shooting of a teenager during a police traffic stop unjustified as the boy's death prompts unrest near Paris. We're live on this developing story. And Kevin Spacey appears in a London court as his trial on sexual offense charges gets underway. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy calls the strike on an eastern city, quote, \"a manifestation of terror\". At least 10 people were killed when two Russian missiles slammed into Kramatorsk on Tuesday. One hitting a busy city center, the other a village nearby. Dozens of people are injured. A popular restaurant was hit. Among the victims, a baby and these teenage twin sisters who had just graduated from 8th grade. CNN's Ben Wedeman joins us live from Eastern Ukraine with the very latest developments. And that is the restaurant, I believe, Ben?",

They're still trying to dig out.Now, the latest numbers, according to the local authorities, are 10 dead. As you mentioned, those twin 14-year-old sisters, a 17-year-old girl, 61 wounded, among them an eight-month-old baby. Now, this is a -- was a very popular restaurant with soldiers, with civilians. In fact, we ate there day before yesterday, but this operation is continuing. Now, according to President Zelenskyy, in his nightly address last night, he had said that it was hit by an S-300 surface to air missile. Now, the Ukrainians are saying it was an Iskander missile, which is a hypersonic ballistic missile, very difficult to detect by air defenses, even harder to bring down, and it's a much more precise weapon than the S-300. And given the level of damage here, which is extensive, it's not just the restaurant itself, but the buildings around it and on the other side of the buildings on the main street as well. So it looks like, in fact, it was an Iskander missile which is capable of causing this level of destruction, death and damage. Max?",

That's the word from Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg at a meeting in The Hague. He adds, NATO is fortifying its eastern front after Wagner leader Yevgeny Prigozhin and perhaps some of his troops were said to be in Belarus following this weekend's failed insurrection.

We must make a path forward for that. And that was one of the things Stoltenberg was saying, we will be at this coming NATO leader summit in two weeks in Vilnius, Lithuania.We will be upgrading, he said, Ukraine's political ties to NATO, with a view on the path, obviously, to fully inclusive membership. This is what he's saying. But when he was talking about the threat from Russia and NATO being ready for it, you know, there's a bolstering of the forces along the border, along the eastern flank of NATO, a greater air readiness, a readiness to switch from air policing to air defense. Not just planes, fighter jets patrol in that area, but air defense systems put in place along there. NATO is definitely on a footing that Stoltenberg says it will be ready for any threat from Russia. But here was the kicker today that I found interesting. We're so used to Stoltenberg talking about being ready for any threat from Moscow. Today, he said Moscow and Minsk, the capital of Belarus. The message is very clear. There's an assessment that Belarus is a much more of a wild card player in this and perhaps potentially a greater threat to NATO at the moment than previously perceived.",

It was 350 policemen that were mobilized yesterday in that Nanterre part of Paris, just on the outskirts of the city, to the northwest of the French capital, to try and put down that anger that erupted really very suddenly.The police stop that you just saw on that video and the shooting that followed within a few seconds of it happened yesterday morning, just after 08:00 a.m. Paris time. The young man was pronounced dead an hour later. It was as that video emerged that the anger really began to spread. By the evening, of course, people down the street calling for justice. Now, it isn't the first time that here in France, French police have faced these sorts of allegations before. It's happened very often when it comes to either traffic stops or identity checks and often in some of the less well-off neighborhoods of Paris. It's something that we've been looking at for years here in the French capital and in other French cities as well. And I think that has contributed further, as has the existence of this video, which appears to contradict what the police initially said about the incident in their defense. All of those factors have really helped whip up the anger and the controversy around this particular incident of yesterday morning. Here's what the French president had to say just a short while ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) EMMANUEL MACRON, FRENCH PRESIDENT (through translator): I would like to express the emotion of the entire nation at the death of young Nael and give his family our solidarity and the affection of the nation.

The mother of young Nael. Bear in mind, Max, that he was just 17 years old who's called for a march in the name of his -- her son and the justice he hopes he's going to get.

He has long denied the charges against him, insisted that they are false, and insisted that he wants his day in court to prove his innocence. And that began today.Important to note here that this is a four-week trial. The court has already adjourned for the day. It was only in session for about two hours. Only procedural things took place today. The jurors were sworn in, a dozen jurors and then the charges were read out. But you have to remember, Max, these are very serious charges. Despite the very relaxed Kevin Spacey that you're seeing there, he has 12 charges of sexual assault filed against him, including indecent assault and causing a person -- a person rather, to engage in sexual activity without consent. The incidences taking place allegedly between 2001 to 2013. The charges brought forward by four separate individuals, four men, all of them, most of them take place during the period in time when Kevin Spacey called London home, when he was the artistic director of the Old Vic Theater. Again, this is going to take several weeks, this trial, but today, or beginning today, really, this process starts. The Crown prosecution, of course, over the coming weeks, will present its reasoning for bringing these charges forward and Kevin Spacey's lawyers will have their work cut out for them defending him.",

This is a live look at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and you can see just very, very thick smoke.You remember very recently we had all the smoke in the Northeast. It even caused some airports to delay flights and cancel flights. And so it is a serious issue. You can see the smoke just settling in across the Midwest. As you mentioned, Chicago had some of the worst air quality in the world and still does. It still makes it on that list. It still has very unhealthy air quality alerts out there for portions of Chicago, St. Louis, Detroit, all across the Midwest, even into the Ohio Valley and portions of interior sections of the Northeast, all dealing with poor air quality. We have these air quality alerts and stretching as far South as North Carolina. So the smoke is getting farther south than the Midwest in the Ohio Valley and so it is going to continue on that track down to the south at these northerly winds that are just pushing it down. However, today should be the last really bad day across the Midwest and then we're supposed to see improvement, especially by tomorrow. You can see these shades of blue returning that indicates that the air quality will improve. But it is interesting, as you mentioned, some of these darker colors on the satellite imagery showing that smoke actually reaching Europe. And so it's going very far all across the Atlantic and even making it to the Europe coast and even interior sections of Europe. So Max, it is interesting. It's something we're going to be dealing with throughout the summer, most likely because the Canadian fire season is still early on. It's only June. It should last several more months. And so far, we've already burned more land than ever before for any fire season on record. And it's just getting started, which is wild to think.",
