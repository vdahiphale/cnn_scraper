      "sentences": "Hello and welcome to all of you watching us here in the United States, Canada, and all around the world. I'm Kim Brunhuber. This is CNN NEWSROOM.Pressure is mounting on U.S. President Joe Biden to step aside in his bid for re-election as more and more Democrats in Congress are calling for him to drop out. That as Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump holds his first campaign rally with his new running mate, J.D. Vance. Vance has been an outspoken critic of U.S. support for Ukraine, while in the Senate. We'll look at how that could impact the war. We are now just 107 days away from the U.S. presidential election, and the race looks very different for the two leading parties. Uncertainty hangs over the Democrats as pressure builds on President Biden to drop his re-election bid. That's in stark contrast to the Republican Party, where the Trump-Vance campaign is in full swing. The former president held his first rally on Saturday since surviving an assassination attempt a week earlier. It was also Trump's first campaign rally, with running mate J.D. Vance, who told the crowd in Michigan, it's still a little bit weird to see his name on the signs alongside Trump's. Now, in contrast, Biden spent another day in isolation, recovering from COVID in Delaware. At least 35 Democratic lawmakers are now publicly urging him to drop out of the race. But more than three weeks after his disastrous debate performance, the president's campaign says he is standing firm. They say he's the only Democrat who beat Trump before, and they'll do it again.

      "sentences": "President Biden is facing a fresh wave of Democratic lawmakers who say that he should step aside and allow someone else to be the Democratic candidate and nominee. They remain unconvinced that the president is up to the task of taking on former President Donald Trump this election year and continue to pour out letters asking for him to drop out of the race.But over the course of all of this happening, the president is behind closed doors as he is trying to recover from COVID and has been self- isolating at his residence in Delaware. Sources telling CNN that the president remains in touch with his close advisers as they grapple with what has become an increasingly challenging moment for this campaign, not only hearing from Democratic lawmakers, but also donors, allies, and, in a letter obtained by CNN, former national security officials and high ranking foreign policy experts who say that it's too risky for the president to stay in the race, particularly because it could allow former President Donald Trump to take a second term and, in turn, potentially have a toll on national security. So, the campaign, however, is remaining firm. They say that the president is going to stay in the race and that there are no plans for that to change. They also say that once the president recovers from COVID that he will hit the campaign trail again. Now, the vice president was on the trail. She had a fundraiser in Massachusetts where she raised more than $2 million. Aides tell me that the vice president and the president remain close, that there's no daylight between the two, despite some lawmakers floating her name as a replacement to lead the party's ticket, but the campaign saying that this is the Biden-Harris ticket that they remain on course, even as it becomes even more challenging for them to stay afloat as Democratic lawmakers continue to ask the president to withdraw from the race.

He seemed very much in his element in this crowd that was thousands of people cheering for him.Now, he did touch on some issues that would affect people in Michigan, this critical battleground state that he won in 2016, lost in 2020, and, really, both Republicans and Democrats believe is crucial to winning back the White House. He talked about getting rid of electric vehicles. He talked about boosting up auto workers, bringing more jobs to Michigan. And he also talked about ending this kind of flood of immigration, quote/unquote, sealing the border was what he used. Now, the other thing I want to point out is this is the first campaign rally with his new vice presidential nominee, J.D. Vance. And it is important to note that it was in Michigan, because part of the appeal of J.D. Vance was that he could possibly reach voters in places like Michigan, Wisconsin, obviously Ohio, which is now more of a red state. So, votes aren't super needed. But in Pennsylvania, these are all critical swing states because of his working class background. We did hear from J.D. Vance. We saw them interact on the stage. Now, the other portion I want to actually show you or have you listen to is when he talked about Project 2025. They believe him, they being Donald Trump and his team, that Project 2025 is an actual liability to him, this, of course, being the think tank Heritage Foundation's transition approach, which has really come under fire for a lot of its controversial and far right policies. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Like some. on the right, severe right, came up with this Project '25, and I don't even know. I mean, some of them, I know who they are, but they're very, very conservative, just like you have, they're sort of the opposite of the radical left, okay? You have the radical left, and you have the radical right, and they come up with this -- I don't know what the hell it is. It's Project '25. He's involved in Project -- and then they read some of the things, and they are extreme. I mean, they're seriously extreme. I but I don't know anything about it. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Many of them are still current advisers, are still currently friendly with Donald Trump and a lot of them are suspected to be part of a second administration. However, he has said that those policies, or some of them at least, are too far, too extreme.Again, it's not just Donald Trump's team who believes this is a vulnerability for Donald Trump. Joe Biden's team has also been seizing on this, running ads, attacking Trump, and Project 2025. Kristen Holmes, CNN, Grand Rapids, Michigan.",

It also shows that he still has the ear of Israel's most important ally.No doubt he will be thanking the U.S. for his continued support in Israel's war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip in the wake of the terrorist attacks of October the 7th. He will also be, again, no doubt calling for the release of all of the Israeli hostages still being held in the Gaza Strip, around 120, about a third of whom are believed to be dead. One imagines that for Netanyahu as well, he will also be perhaps looking ahead to the future when perhaps he hopes to be able to rekindle his bromance with former President Donald Trump, if, of course, Donald Trump wins in November's elections.

I just want to remind you Speaker Johnson also was one of those who are not supporting, are not voting for Ukraine's support in U.S. Congress. But after he became a speaker, he clearly changed his mind, and now he is one of the strongest supporters.I think that support of Ukraine is in the best interest of the United States of America. And whoever will be the president of the United States or vice president, they will realize it. That's what I think. Definitely, some of the rhetorics of Mr. Vance and Mr. Trump is concerning, but at the same time, I remember that it was the administration of Donald Trump which first sent lethal weapons to Ukraine, Javelins, when we were fighting with Russians. And so he was the first to do this. So, I hope that if Mr. Trump will be elected together with Mr. Vance, they will change their mind and they will support Ukraine understanding that Ukraine is probably today the most valuable ally of the United States in Europe and a very needed one.",

We're even looking at temperatures from 105 to 110 degrees for places like Spokane and Boise. These places don't typically see heat. This is hot. It doesn't get that extreme this far north. These temperatures are much more typical and much more average for a place like Phoenix, a desert city. So, something to watch very closely, especially considering where you're seeing a lot of this major and extreme heat risk. It's that risk for heat sickness. This is an area again doesn't have too much access to air conditioning. This is the Pacific Northwest. It doesn't usually get this hot even in summer, so something to watch pretty closely. You see the moderate and major risk for heat sickness does continue to stay out west through Monday and Tuesday, as that heat also just stays kind of parked.",
