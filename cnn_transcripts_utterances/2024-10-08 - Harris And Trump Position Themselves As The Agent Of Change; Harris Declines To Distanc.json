Let's get right to what America is talking about. Which candidate can make your life better? Well, Kamala Harris is in the middle of a media tour, and today she got a question that speaks to what's on your mind, the direction of the country and what it's headed for, and how it might look different if she had led the country through the last four years and not Joe Biden. Well, her answer singled out that she was a little surprised by the question. Just listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
