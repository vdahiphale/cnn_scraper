They don't want to re-litigate this whole thing.And for Biden, you don't have to win them all. You just have to win a handful of them to make a difference in a state that was as close as Arizona or Wisconsin or Georgia. And I suspect this is going to be a recurring theme, even though Republicans hated it when he did it in the midterm, there is some empirical evidence that it worked, that there's enough center-right Independents and soft Republican voters that are taken in by this. Now, what has happened since then? Trump's been indicted several times.",
