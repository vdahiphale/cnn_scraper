And Alex Murdaugh told the prosecutor there was nobody else around that they didn't know. No one else around for them to sense. Those are direct quotes. So, that was really interesting because, in a way, depending on what the jury believes, he could have been telling the prosecutor that there was nobody else with my family at the time of the murders except me.

Jobs are surge, corporate layoffs in some industries in particular are mounting. Red-hot inflation has cooled a bit, but not nearly enough. Mortgage rates continue to inch higher.

And when you look at this NABE forecast, this poll of these business economists, you can see that they're all struggling to kind of come up with a consensus for what could happen here.And here's a good example. I looked at their GDP forecast for Q4 to Q4 for this year. The range is so wide. There's either a recession -- that's a real recession, minus 1.3 percent, or a pretty, you know, fine, charitable 1.9 percent. You look out for next year, either a stall in the economy, barely positive growth, all the way up to a very strong 2.6 percent economy. So it just shows you sort of how all over the map these economists are. For all of the reasons that you just mentioned, all of these different statistics, we have a strong, underlying economy. Eight interest rate hikes by the Fed meant to cool it, but inflation still too high here. So, there's a lot of kind of hand-wringing about where we're going and what happens next. I think where you can find a consensus is nearly 60 percent of these respondents, these economists, say there's a 50/50 chance of a recession this year. So, you know, still worried about all of that medicine from the Fed and whether it will slow an underlying strong economy. And one of the words that the NAB used is diffused. All of these estimates are very diffused. Meaning, there's just all over the place, because really smart people are looking at a lot of different factors.",

Of course, the FDA does not want any sort of injunction. They're saying that, look, this would have a dangerous precedent. And a group of Democratic attorneys general has also supported them, noting the impact that this would have on abortion access nationwide. Specifically, the availability of this drug has been particularly critical in providing access to abortion in low income, underserved, and rural communities where procedural abortion may be unavailable.
