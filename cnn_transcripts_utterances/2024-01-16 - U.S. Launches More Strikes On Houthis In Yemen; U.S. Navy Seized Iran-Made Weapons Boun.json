This is the third round of U.S.-led strikes since Thursday night. CNN's Oren Liebermann is at the Pentagon and has been tracking all this. Oren, what are you learning about this latest round of strikes?",

As you point out, this is the third time we have seen the U.S. strike Yemen over the course of the past several days. Thursday night, D.C. time, Friday night, and then the news coming just a short time ago about this latest round of strikes. U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan warning there could be more if the Houthis continue to launch against international shipping lanes. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAKE SULLIVAN, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: We did not say when we launched our attacks that they would end once and for all. That the Houthis would be fully deterred. We anticipated the Houthis would continue to try to hold this critical artery at risk. And we continue to reserve the right to take further action. This needs to be an all-hands-on-deck effort.

In both cases, it was minor damage. The ships were able to continue on their way. But, first, Alex, you see the threat that continues to one of the world's most critical waterways. Second, I think you easily see the possibility of further U.S. strikes there.",

      "sentences": "That's right. Listen, there are a couple of things that happened in court today that I want to get through.But the main point here is what the district attorney said, is that this now concludes the investigation into the killings of the women who are known as the Gilgo Four. Yes, the charges of killing Maureen Brainard-Barnes, and what investigators are saying, this new superseding indictment, is that there was DNA evidence linking, a hair found on Barnes, which was basically on a belt that was used to bind her up. That matches the DNA profile of Rex Heuermann's wipe. So that is critical DNA evidence. They said they used advanced DNA technology to make that connection. But what also happened in court today, guys, while that is significant, is that investigators said they found even more evidence to connect Heuermann to the murders of all four women. So the three other women that he's already facing charges with. So they said there's the DNA evidence that not only connects Heuermann because his hair was found on the bodies that linked to his wife, his daughter, himself. But that there was also digital evidence connecting him to the women, including cell phone activity, communications through computers, they said has connected him as well. But also very significant that we learn today in court is we saw the daughter and family members of Maureen Brainard-Barnes. She disappeared in 2007. She's from Connecticut. A 25-year-old woman who was a sex worker. This is really some of the first time that they have spoken out. Her daughter saying that she has not seen her mother. You know, she was seven years old when she disappeared. I also want you to hear from her sister. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MELISSA CANN, SISTER OF MAUREEN BRAINARD-BARNES: It has been 16 years since the last time I saw my sister, 16 years since I heard her voice because 16 years ago she was silenced. Losing Maureen has become a wound that has never truly heals. It remains a part of me. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

She received a phone call from the killer after her sister went missing.That is something that has of course haunted her throughout this entire time. So there's certainly an element of justice to this. They were inside the court when Rex Heuermann appeared in court. He had a dark suit on with his hands tied behind his back in handcuffs. He is expected back in court next month, and we expect more evidence to sort of be turned over in the process. The district attorney essentially says, guys, that there is still more investigating that will be done. Can he be linked to other murders, bodies that were found in the same area as Gilgo Beach?

      "sentences": "Great to be on your show. Thanks for having me.It's a great question because it's key for the defense to say -- to start to take apart the DNA evidence. You already heard him swinging when he came out of the court because it was the first time that the prosecutors said that there's genetic material tying Rex Heuermann to all of the victims. Not just one, we've heard for, but all. So of course, the defense attorneys coming forward and is going to say there's this new testing called nuclear DNA. We heard about mitochondrial DNA, which is in the cytoplasm of the genes, of the genetic material. But now we're talking about nuclear DNA and it shouldn't be a surprise because with each year that passes, the technology gets better and better. So, they're going to attack several things. One, they're going to attack the testing itself. The gathering of the evidence, the decomposition of the body, is, obviously, if there's decomposition, the genetic material. It's going to be the argument that the defense will make is that it's unreliable to make any sort of conclusions as to whether there's a link between Rex Heuermann and the victims.",

They have to go into the jury's mind because you look at Rex Heuermann, he was a successful architect. He was a father. He was a husband. There's no indication whatsoever that he had sociopathic tendencies leading to murder. So, that's why the prosecution has to take so many steps to get to the very final conclusion that he was the murderer. And to your point, any juror in their common sense are going to say, they have nothing to hide, you can look at my computer, I do searches every day, I have searches every day, I don't have the sophisticated software to scrub my searches. Now, they were able -- there was -- at least it's been reported that there are searches that were found on his computers, on his cell that demonstrates fascination with the case, with the investigation, with the victims, with the families, with prostitution and these very graphic types of violent deaths. So, we will have to see. I think that's how the prosecution will certainly get to that final conclusion that he is, in fact, the murder of these four women.",
