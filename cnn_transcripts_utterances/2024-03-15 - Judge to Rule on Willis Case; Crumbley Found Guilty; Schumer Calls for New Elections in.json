It's 6In the next few hours here, Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee is expected to announce whether District Attorney Fani Willis will remain as the prosecutor in the Georgia election subversion case. The defense is seeking to disqualify Willis for having a romantic relationship with her lead prosecutor, Nathan Wade. Judge McAfee, who is up for re- election, thank CNN affiliate WSB that the ruling won't be based on politics. CNN's Katelyn Polantz joins us live now from Fort Pierce, Florida. Katelyn, good morning. Always wonderful to see you. So, there's this claim that the ruling won't be political. It's sure to receive political reaction. How do you expect this to go today?",

      "sentences": "Well, we are just waiting to see what Judge Scott McAfee in Fulton County is going to do. He held so many hearings that we were able to see publicly about this issue that originally bubbled up as something like a little bit of a sideshow, having Fani Willis on the stand testifying, having Nathan Wade, the top prosecutor in that case, also testifying.But there is a real issue here that Judge McAfee is looking at, and it is this question of some sort of ethical impropriety. Was there a benefit to Fani Willis because of her relationship with Nathan Wade? She hired him. Her office was paying him to take on the prosecution of Donald Trump, and all of these other defendants, to bring that case. And she did have a relationship with him in her testimony and his after he started in that office. And so there is a lot of questions about how Judge McAfee is going to look at the facts here and if he thinks that it is enough to remove her from the case. The big picture is that legally Judge McAfee says he is basing it on the facts. He says these kinds of orders take time to write. We've been waiting two weeks for a decision here. Today he says is the day -- or the last day in that two-week period that he could rule. He needs to make sure he says exactly what's - what he wants and he says, I plan to stick to the timeline I gave everyone. And also that no ruling of his is going to be based on politics. He said that in a radio interview last week. But, of course, there's always politics involved in these cases against Donald Trump, Kasie. And one of the issues here is, how do damaging, if Fani Willis remains on this case, how damaging is it to the prosecution team for people to have seen all of this testimony about her personal life. And then separately, if she is removed from the case, does that derail the entire Trump case and its ability to go to trial. If it gets reassigned to a different prosecutor in Fulton County, Georgia, to lead it, does that mean that the case against Donald Trump is months, if not years away from going to trial, if an even survives a prosecutor change like that.

All right, now this, a Michigan jury last night found James Crumbley guilty of four counts of involuntary manslaughter over his failure to prevent his son, Ethan Crumbley, from killing four students and injuring seven others in the state's deadliest school shooting. The verdict makes Mr. Crumbley and his wife, Jennifer, the first parents to be convicted for a mass shooting carried out by their child, raising serious questions about who can be held responsible for such crimes as our country continues to struggle with a gun violence crisis. Listen to how some of the parents of Crumbley's victims responded to the verdict last night. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And, number two, how other people ought to raise their kids, right? Everybody's emotional about all that - that - it's just sort of not relevant here. And there's a very simple legal question, it's what happens and when is someone responsible for something that can be reasonably foreseen from their actions.And there's one big piece of evidence in here that the parents could not get around. They went to a meeting the morning of the shooting. They were shown drawings that their child had done that show blood everywhere, people going to die and so on, and the parents sort of brushed it off, as did the school, and we'll talk about that in a second, and let - you know, it effect let him go ahead and commit this act. The simple fact is, they were put on notice that something bad was going to happen, and they did nothing about it. Now, under the law, that's negligence. Whether you're a parent, whether you are a friend or whatever else. And the simple fact is, if you are going to be made aware of possible violent criminal activity and don't do anything about it, you ought to be held responsible regardless of the parenting questions. Now, how people raise their kids and all this stuff -- should guns be locked up? That's a fight for another day. But the legal question here, I think, with respect to at least that one piece of evidence is pretty straightforward. And then, on top of that, when you consider there were the diaries and the statements and all of the above, there actually was some serious failures on the part of the parents here to prevent something that they could have.",

BARRON-LOPEZ: Yes, they are. I mean President Biden has said, despite his campaign and himself being on TikTok, has said that they would sign this bill that potentially bans it if - if they don't sell the company. I'm not sure that that argument totally flies, especially with the majority of lawmakers in Congress. I mean we saw this got -- got bipartisan support. There are some Democrats, though, even some that are on President Biden's campaign co-chair re-election team, Maxwell Frost, who is a gen z Congress member who has said that they -- he thinks that it would be a mistake for the president to sign this bill. In part because of the fact that -- that he just thinks that social media writ large, social media apps, social media companies should be regulated in the U.S. rather than just outright bans, and that also the president may be cutting off a big channel that he has to reach young voters ahead of the election.",

So, how do you physically separate it is the question.And, by the way, if you're Steve Mnuchin, you might be trying to gather a bid for $100 billion. Is it worth $100 billion if it doesn't have the secret sauce, right? If you can't actually pull the algorithm out. One of the other things being debated is, well, can you just move all of the U.S. data to data centers that are overseen by U.S. companies. That's something they've already done. So, Oracle oversees all of the U.S. data for TikTok and clearly it's just not enough, which is why we are going through this ban process. I just want to go through one thing that you had talked about, which is sort of the principles of the quid pro quo. The thing to understand is that China blocking U.S. apps, that's because that is what their society is, communist party full control. We are a democracy. We are an open capitalistic society. We allow businesses in the U.S. to accept capital from China. We allow Chinese apps and foreign apps to flourish in our economy here.
