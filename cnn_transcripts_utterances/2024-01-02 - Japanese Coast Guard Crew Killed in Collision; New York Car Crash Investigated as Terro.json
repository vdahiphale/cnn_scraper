A Japan airlines plane bursts into flames after it collided with a Japanese coast guard aircraft on the runway in Tokyo. This new video shows the moment of impact after the passenger jet landed at the airport just hours ago.And you can see in the video the Japan Airlines plane bursting into flames as it goes down the runway there. Crew members on the coast guard plane were killed. The captain is in critical condition. The crew were preparing to fly to western Japan to try to help with earthquake relief. Nearly 400 passengers and crew were on the Japan Airlines flight. They were able to escape. Seventeen people reportedly were hurt. Let's bring in CNN's Will Ripley. He joins us live from Tokyo.

We'll get to that in a second.Japan Airlines Flight 516. This was an Airbus A-350. Only two years old. Came into land on Runday 34 right there at Haneda. What is interesting here is that we know from the track of the plane that this plane was coming into land the plane behind it had to go around. We do not know the track specifically because there's no data available from that Japan coast guard Dash-8 airplane. Six people on board, five of them are dead. We know that the captain of that flight is in critical condition. What is really striking to me is the communication and the coordination by the crew that made this evacuation so successful. Not just the pilots, but all of the crew, the flight attendants especially. Japan prides itself on efficiency. They got these people out in a very short period of time. There you can see the two airplanes. And this big size difference here. A Dash-8 is a much smaller airplane, although it clearly did a lot of damage to the front of that Airbus A-350. This is the first time a Airbus A-350 has ever experienced a hull loss. Meaning the airplane is completely destroyed. What is clear right now is that there was a huge safety failure here in a culture that is incredibly safety conscious. The Japanese airlines had a spate of accidents in the '80s and '90s. They really cleaned up their act. But is also clear is that this was something where there was an airplane in the wrong place at the wrong time. And now the question is where the confusion took place. Was it confusion on the part of air traffic control, or was it confusion by one of the crews involved in that Japan coast guard flight or in that Japan Airlines flight. So, this is something that investigators really need to look at. And of course they will listen to the air traffic control tapes and the communication there to see if anything was garbled. What is really interesting here in the United States is that there has been incident after incident of airplanes in the wrong place at the wrong time on the surface of an airport. They are known officially as a runway incursion. An we have seen seven of these incidents get so serious that the National Transportation Safety Board has been involved. JFK, Austin, Boston, Burbank, the list goes on. This incident really immediately reminds me of the Austin incident where a FedEx flight was coming in to land at Austin-Bergstrom last February. A Southwest Airlines flight was lined up on the runway ready to take off. It was in bad weather conditions. It was dark. It was before dawn. And the FedEx crew caught the error and went around. In this case, of course, it was dark. It was about 5:47 p.m. local time. Although the weather was pretty good. And now the question is whether or not this Japan Airlines flight crew was able to see this plane in front of them and why it was there. So, a lot of big questions here and investigators really have their work cut out for them, John.",

He's a CNN aviation and aerospace analyst.Miles, good to see you today, unfortunately certainly a dark day for Japan. But just your initial read. I mean what do you think happened here? MILES O'BRIEN, CNN AVIATION ANALYST: Well, Rahel, you know, there are many, many layers of safety build into the system. And we got down to the absolute last layer here in this one, which was the possibility of an orderly evacuation. And I don't want to - I think we can't underscore enough how successful that evacuations was. The crew did a great job getting them off. And if any group of people collectively would listen to a flight crew and do what they're told and follow the rules, it is the people of Japan, anybody who's lived there and knows the culture there, they do, in fact, listen to rules and follow rules. So, that was really fantastic. And there was a great demonstration of the possibilities there. The other thing to think about here, Rahel, is, there have been decades of work on the part of the FAA and other organizations to reduce the flammability of the materials that are inside the cabin of an aircraft. And this is an example here, I think, of the success there, that it holds off potential danger from the toxic fumes and the flames. Enough time to get passengers off if they listen to the rules. So, we can take that aways as a half full look at it. But clearly there's some dramatic failure in the system here, which will have to be identified and worked on.",

You've got the flight crew aboard the Airbus A-350. You have apparently the surviving pilot, the coast guard pilot on the Dash-8, the smaller aircraft  And you have the air traffic controllers up there in the control tower. And each of them will have a story to tell. They'll be interviewed separately. And, of course, on top of that what you have are lots of recordings. Recordings of the air traffic control communications and the cockpit voice record on the Airbus A-350. I'm not sure if that Japanese coast guard craft was similarly equipped. We'll have to see about that. But the parties involved, the people who made the decisions in this case are all present and with us still to sort of sort out what happened. Where the confusion happened. As Pete pointed out, it was good weather, but it was nighttime. It's the busiest airport in the Pacific Rim, in the middle of a terrible disaster. A lot of adrenaline going, I'm sure, with that coast guard crew trying to get needed relief supplies up to the stricken region. So, there are a lot of subtle human factors here that need to be addressed.",

We know it's premeditated just given the suicide note, but also earlier reporting of talk of - this is potentially a rental car. And so that is an attribute used by terrorists, domestic or international. And then, of course, the explosives or the gas tanks in the car that would have been -- resulted in a mass casualty event had he been successful. So, you're going to start there. And then this is where we're careful. And there will be a press conference. We know who he is. We know he has a suicide note. And we know there's a reason why he committed suicide and also tried to kill others.

But sort of these spectacular suicides, so to speak, in other words this performative suicide, they're rare. And so  you want to find out, what is it about his mental state that led him to do this. And that would be, who was he following on social media, what was he following, who was he communicating with, and what would be the motivation to commit suicide and to leave a suicide note behind in this fashion.So, we - I - you know, the press conference is in about 45 minutes. We'll have a sense of - and what I'm looking at is, why does this continue to be a Joint Terrorism Task Force investigation and is that because there is something in the suicide note, or his family knew something about what that motivation would be. That motivation, once again, could be a number of things. But particular to terrorism would be whether there's an international terror nexus, as we've been reporting on in terms of concerns about the war in the Middle East or, of course, a domestic terror nexus related to radicalization on the home front. So, lots to wait for. But this is - John, I will say, this is rare to have an - you know, a series of planning for a suicide attack that would then result in a mass casualty event without some particular motivation that maybe extends beyond personal, a mental depression or something else.",
