I think it is the best approach. And that's the honest balancing assessment.Look, there's this huge pile of stuff against Kevin McCarthy being a speaker. And literally, the only thing that guy's got going for him is the situation could possibly be even worse without him. And that's what we need to think about is what are the exact implications. And like I said, substance matters here. Passed the appropriations bills. Give us a vote on the Ukraine supplemental. That's substantively what matters. Whatever personality conflicts Matt Gaetz and Kevin McCarthy have going on, that may be fascinating for television. But we Democrats are interested in governing the country and governing it effectively. And that's what we're going to be focused on",

We're going to try to move it in the right direction, you know. As we go through this, it motivates me more and more to try to make sure that Democrats retake the House next year, so that the House can actually function. I mean, regardless of where you're at on the ideological spectrum, a minimum that I think we would all like is to have a functioning House.And Speaker McCarthy and more broadly, the entire Republican Caucus, this is not just on McCarthy, they picked him. They have allowed Matt Gaetz to influence the process to the degree that they have. We need different leadership in the House and you need Democratic leadership in the House if we're going to get back to any sort of sensible governance.",

The former president is accused of falsely inflating the value of his business -- value of his business empire, his net worth by billions of dollars in order to get better business deals, more favorable interest rates, and more favorable loans. The New York Attorney General is asking for him to pay $250 million in penalties amongst other things.What video you're looking at right there is Donald Trump making a statement to the cameras before he went inside the courtroom. And we've just learned more from what's happened since this hearing and this trial has gotten underway. CNN's Brynn Gingras is standing by for us once again.

And it does look almost like they're setting up for the -- for Donald Trump himself to be walking out soon as well. We're going to keep our eye on this, Brynn.One thing that I'm seeing from our colleagues in the courtroom, also reporting that for the attorney general's office in their opening statement, they asked the judge to bar Donald Trump from doing business in New York. That's one of -- that's on top of financial penalties that they already have clearly already sought. That would be such a blow to Donald Trump, the business, the organization, the Empire, and the brand.",

      "sentences": "Sorry. Yes. So no, that is -- that's one of the things that we also don't know what's going to happen next after the judge's ruling last week. As I said, the business certifications from Trump, his sons, and the Trump Organization were stripped and it's -- the -- last week during a hearing, the judge gave Trump's attorneys another 30 days to figure out exactly what that would look like. So, that's very unclear where that stands right now.But yes, just before they finished those opening statements, they said that they do want to bar the Trumps from doing business in New York, and this is where his empire, you know, started. So, it's very unclear as to what the future of the Trump Organization and the wealth of the Trumps will look like after this trial is finished. You remember it's a very significant trial. And like you said, the Attorney General is asking for $250 million, which doesn't seem much to the Trumps. But the judge is the one who makes the discretion of how much he's going to penalize for finding whichever way he chooses on these issues at hand in this trial. So, it's going to be significant. And it's so interesting, as we watch the beginning of this, before opening statements even started about how Trump made all these comments, attacking James as he hasn't been shy about doing, attacking the judge, which again, he hasn't been shy about doing, not even addressing Letitia James when he walked into the courtroom today. And you know the judge is the one who's going to make those decisions, not a jury. So, we're going to certainly see how that all plays out. Another thing. When we talk about him testifying, we also could hear from his sons as well. His attorneys saying that they're going to be bringing people to the stand that are going to show that the way he did, they filled out all these financial statements that they are just everyday things that happened in the state of New York, that they were completely OK, and there was nothing wrong about them. So, it's going to be a lot of interesting testimony, although it's very confusing, right, because it has to do with all these financial statements. But at the heart of the case here is did they commit fraud, they knowingly commit fraud, the judge making that huge ruling last week saying that they did. So, we'll see how it continues to play out.",

      "sentences": "Yes, the judge doesn't have to get up to speed on anything. You know, to your -- to your point, Kate, this first sort of landmark decision in the summary judgment that the judge ruled on last week, it's kind of a unique statute in that the pervasive fraud, typically in fraud charges. The hallmark of a fraud charge would be some sort of intent to defraud would be the victim. This is more of what we call sort of a strict liability charge.And that really, the judge was able just to look at the facts, he's already the -- you know, is going to be ruling on the law. But for this bench trial, he's also the finder of fact. He looked at the you know the receipts as it were, and said, no. This is -- this is fraud, as a matter of law. And as a matter of fact, this is fraud, and we don't need to move forward with that count. Now, for the, you know, issue of intent on these other issues. I think, you know, there are five individual defendants here on top of all of the entities, you know. I don't anticipate it, but we definitely could see sort of a blame game going on sort of a finger pointing specifically maybe with Allen Weisselberg. I expect there to be some sort of advice of accountant defense you know saying, look I just -- I signed papers, there was no intent on my part. I was just doing what people told me to do. But it'll be interesting to see if there are any antagonistic defenses here, pointing the finger. It wasn't me it was him.",

They all tried to distance themselves from who was the preparer of the statements of financial condition. And then he played a deposition from Donald Trump, who specifically pointed out that Weisselberg oversaw the statements preparations, and Donald Trump said, I would say yes. And at the end, he said, Look. The defendants are left to answer the question, are you lying then or are you lying now? How do you defend against that?",

He then walked it back. But you know, certainly, I would advise against it, because it is a civil trial, he does have the ability to plead the fifth, however, we can -- the judge can take what's called a negative inference from that, in a -- in a criminal case, he wouldn't be allowed to do that. But because it's a civil trial, he can basically assume the worst. So, if Trump says, I'm not answering that to you know, protect my fifth amendment right against self-incrimination because there are -- lord knows there are pending criminal investigations, which he has every right to do. The judge can then think that you know, and use that as part of his decision in this trial that the answer would have been bad so. You know, it's a loss really,",
