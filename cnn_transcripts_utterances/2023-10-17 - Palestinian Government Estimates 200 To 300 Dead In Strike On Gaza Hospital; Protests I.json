We warn you, some of the pictures we're about to show you are graphic scenes of utter destruction. The Palestinian Health Ministry estimates 200 to 300 people were killed. It says many are still trapped beneath the rubble. And these are new videos coming into CNN, paramedics on the scenes trying to help survivors. Palestinian officials say the hospital sheltered thousands of people displaced by the war. The Israel Defense Forces say it is looking into these reports. And news of the strikes sparking a protest in the West Bank, too. This footage taken in the last hour in Ramallah. Hundreds of Palestinians are voicing their anger and then are marching in the streets. As we await more details, let's get to Nic Robertson who's in Sderot for as at this moment. Nic, a horrific attack, whatever the details and of course, we need more information. What facts do we have about what happened at this stage?",

      "sentences": "Well, what we know from the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza is they believe there are about200 to 300 people killed at the hospital. They say that the strike was within the hospital grounds where they say thousands of Palestinians were sheltering, sheltering from the possibility of missile strike when this impact occurred. They say that they are still going through the rubble, that they don't have an accurate tally of the number of dead, that they don't have an accurate tally yet of the number of wounded and casualties there. This is obviously impacting right at the hospital, right where the medical services are located. They just cannot, because of the magnitude of it at the moment, get accurate figures. They are saying that they had been told in the past few days by the Israeli Defense Forces that they needed to evacuate the hospital and they had very publicly, they say said that they weren't going to evacuate. We know that's the case for a number of hospitals in Northern Gaza that they said that they wouldn't evacuate when the IDF said that they should, partly because of the 3,000 hospital beds in total in the Gaza Strip, more than half of them were in the north and the concern was that some elderly patients couldn't leave, that they believe -- the doctors believe they have a duty of care to the citizens in their health districts, and that's why they weren't going to leave. So at the moment, the details are unclear, as we wait further information from Palestinian health authorities, and obviously, try to seek clarity from the Israeli Defense Force. I have to say that through the day-to-day, there has perhaps been less missile strikes on Gaza than we have witnessed recently. That said, we've been able to watch with our own eyes impacts, smoke coming up from some of the built up areas within Gaza, following those strikes. So absolutely, they have been ongoing through the day. We're just looking for more details at the moment on this particular strike.",

They're holding their shields there, as you can see, that's increasingly contentious as well. Nic, I want to get back to what you were saying about the challenges here and the efforts of the Israelis in light of what happened on October 7th and the decision to confront Hamas, but the increasing difficulty and we know it well, of doing that, to your point about the differing and conflicting challenges here, even went up to Netanyahu and the Israeli government here. Do you think what we've seen in the last few hours, changes the calculus for them in terms of their decision to confront Hamas? There is still challenge with getting those hostages back, of course, Netanyahu faces the challenge of restoring confidence among the Israeli people here too, but does what we're seeing now, and look, we're seeing this getting increasingly concerning in the West Bank, change the calculus of what Netanyahu does, whether it's a ground offensive or not.",

As we await more details of just what happened at that hospital in Gaza City, it's highly likely health care workers too, are among the dead. Tragically, casualties among medical staff are piling up, too.

I want to bring in Dr. Ahmed Al-Mandhari, who is in Cairo, Egypt. He is the World Health Organization's Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean. Doctor, thank you so much for your time. I appreciate it. You're incredibly busy at this moment. Can I ask first, if you have any more information for us about that hospital attack in Gaza City? DR.

And in fact, I'm very sorry now to see that one of the biggest hospitals in the north of Gaza have been attacked and as we have seen in the reports, you know, there are hundreds of people's there, healthcare workers, patients, relatives, and as well as families who have been, you know, sheltering themselves in what you know, they were thinking it is a safe place. And to us, as you know, I mean, whomever has done that sort of barbaric action, it is a very clear violation of the international humanitarian principles, values, law -- you name it.

You know, they are going into the field, they are seeing the destruction, the killing of the people, you know, by direct attacks, seeing hospitals overloading, seeing people, you know, sheltering in a very crowded places, schools, health care facilities, with very severe shortage of water and food in these very crowded places.

Now the Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, we have just learned according to Palestinian officials, telling my colleague, Abeer Salman, that he has told the United States that he is canceling his plans meeting with President Biden tomorrow. So we are already seeing the diplomatic fallout of this strike on this hospital. President Abbas was in Amman, Jordan meeting with Secretary of State Tony Blinken today and he was set to meet with President Biden there tomorrow. President Biden is also set to travel to Tel Aviv tomorrow to meet with the Israeli prime minister and then he was going to go to Amman, Jordan to meet not only with the Palestinian Authority President but also with the Egyptian and the Jordanian leaders as well. We will see whether those meetings still hold indeed. As of yet, we've reached out to the IDF for comment to see if they are taking responsibility for this strike at this hospital. As of yet I spoke with an IDF spokesman who said they don't have any clear information yet. It is something that they are looking into. They insist that they are taking this matter very seriously. We also heard from a spokesman for the prime minister's office who says that, quote, the IDF does not target hospitals. We only target Hamas strongholds, arms depots and terror targets.

A violent protest erupted in the West Bank following that attack. And Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has canceled his meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden to return to Ramallah.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN REPORTER (voice-over): This city should be the way out of the war zone. But it too was caught in the crosshairs of Israel's relentless aerosol. You are looking at the aftermath of airstrikes on Rafah. Thousands have flocked here in recent days, seeking safe passage, only to find more death. My children, oh God, please find my children, this man pleads. They are under the rubble. Oh God, please pull them out. It is unclear if his children survived. Israeli bombardment has killed dozens here in recent days, according to Palestinian officials. The city which sits on the Egyptian border is home to Gaza's only possible humanitarian corridor, a corridor that is now inoperable and unsafe, the WHO says, because of Israeli bombardment. And at the border crossing, footage shows smoke billowing from multiple air strikes nearby on Tuesday. Desperate families gather here for hours a day. Praying authorities will allow their exit. So far a diplomatic standoff keeping this crucial corridor shut. Cairo is reluctant to take in refugees. It says it wants to see aid allowed into the Enclave. Israel's government has imposed a complete siege of Gaza after Hamas terror attacks killed some 1,400 people. It says it aims to wipe out Hamas. LT. COL. JONATHAN CONRICUS, IDF SPOKESPERSON: we continue to operate and strike Hamas targets as we have defined before.

I think that the public display of support for Israel in the form of two big carrier with a carrier group and a Marine Expeditionary Unit being sent to the coast of Israel sending signals to countries like Iran to Hezbollah, and non-state actors, they call it, the Iran-backed militia in South Lebanon, and others in the region that might be tempted to use this opportunity of pressure already on Israel to escalate. That is intended to reassure the Israelis and threaten Israel's enemies. But I think behind closed doors, I think there's a degree of indication coming particularly from the Israeli media, that there will be a slight a sense in which the Biden administration is also shifting slightly into reassuring oversight in terms of what happens next in Gaza, because they really do not want to see mass casualties there.
