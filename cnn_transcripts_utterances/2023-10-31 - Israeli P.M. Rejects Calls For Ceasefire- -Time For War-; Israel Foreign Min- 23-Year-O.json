But he said that even though civilians have been asked to evacuate 800,000 of them have done so that there will be strikes not just in the northern part, but anywhere that the IDF sees that there are Hamas operatives or infrastructure that continues to be their primary goal as for the bombardment that we're going to continuing to see. Hospitals in the firing line again at the Palestinian Red Crescent Society saying overnight that the Al Quds hospital, the neighborhood where that hospital is in the southern part of Gaza City was seeing intense bombardment. They said that the building was trembling and there's a lot of fear and panic in that hospital. Separately, we heard late on Monday from the director of the leading cancer hospital in Gaza, in the northeastern part of the enclave that that hospital had been hit. No injuries, but some damage there. Israel of course, has been heavily criticized over the damage not only -- the damage to hospitals, but also the cost to evacuate them which the World Health Organization has described as basically impossible. Now obviously, the rescue -- emphasis on rescue not release of that Israeli soldier from Hamas captivity, a rare positive sign for Israel and all of this Israeli officials continuing to emphasize. This shows they say that they can continue their ground offensive, that it serves the purpose of getting those hostages home. Obviously, there were major fears that the ground offensive might endanger the lives of those hostages. But of course, the idea of saying that 238 of those still remain and Hamas did release a second video showing three women hostages.

And much of that is fueled by inaccurate information online.PROF. CYNTHIA MILLER-IDRISS, EXPERT ON EXTREMISM, AMERICAN UNIVERSITY: Social media, like chat rooms and forums and gaming rooms are a really a toxic mess of hate right now. And there's so much misinformation being fueled about this war. (END VIDEOTAPE) TODD (on camera):  President Biden told reporters on Monday that he is very concerned about the rise of antisemitism, and the White House has announced new actions it's taking to combat incidents on college campuses in the U.S. The Biden administration recruiting officials from Homeland Security, Justice, and the Department of Education to coordinate the response with law enforcement officials at the colleges.

      "sentences": "Let's look at Cornell as a microcosm, I have a son over there. A professor name Rickford talked about the Hamas attacks earlier this month as being energizing and exhilarating, at a rally on campus. And then just a short time later, this kind of heat got normalized.First of all, threats are always criminally prosecutable in the United States. And the FBI is looking into this. But what we have seen time and time again is when leaders speak of tolerance, it has an ameliorated effect. So, six days after 9/11 when President Bush spoke of tolerance towards Muslims, hate crimes dropped the next day and into the next year. Similarly, though, when candidate Trump talked about a Muslim ban proposal, five days after the San Bernardino terror attack, hate crimes against Muslims went up another 23 percent above the spike we saw from the terror attack. So, bottom line is civic leaders, including campus leaders, have to set a tone where certainly people can rally under the First Amendment, but threats, those are illegal. More over for a community, we have to say that antisemitic stereotypes are glorifying the weapons that were used in terror attacks, that should be communally off limits. We make a safe space for everybody on campus, so people can discuss these things as opposed to threaten each other. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
