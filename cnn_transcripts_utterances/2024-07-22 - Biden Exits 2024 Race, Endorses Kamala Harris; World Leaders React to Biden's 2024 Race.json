      "sentences": "President Joe Biden on Sunday announcing that he is dropping out of the presidential race in what has been a remarkable development that will shake up the 2024 presidential election. The president up until this point, along with his top brass, had remained defiant. He was going to stay in the race despite multiple calls from Democratic lawmakers, allies and donors that he should drop out of the race.But while self-isolating at his Delaware residence as he was recovering from COVID, he was also reflecting and deliberating. On Saturday evening, he summoned his top advisors to his Rehoboth home where they assessed the polling and discussed among themselves what Democratic lawmakers and allies had been saying. And the president also consulted his family, who have always been influential in any decision that he makes over the course of his political career. Then on Sunday, the president deciding to step out of the race and notifying his senior White House and campaign teams of the decision only minutes before putting out a letter to the public saying that while he was proud of his record and will continue to fulfill his duties as president, he will not seek reelection. Only moments after that, the president endorsing his vice president, Kamala Harris, to be the Democratic nominee and urging the party to come together. Now, sources tell CNN that the vice president did not know about the president's decision until Sunday. Then the two spoke multiple times over the course of the day. And now it has been a moment for the vice president to try to gain momentum as she called multiple Democratic lawmakers, governors, civil rights leaders, among others, to get their endorsements, oftentimes telling them in their phone calls that she wants to earn the nomination and wants their support. Now, the outstanding questions remain as to what this will look like and what the process will look like over the next few weeks when we're only on the cusps of the Democratic National Convention. And then, too, when the president will address the nation. He has been recovering from Covid and the White House doctor said his symptoms are improving significantly. In his letter, he said he would address the public, but when he will do that remains to be seen. Priscilla Alvarez, CNN, traveling with the president. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

That's certainly a concern. We've heard that from NATO leaders in the past.Trump has expressed his concerns around NATO, has suggested leaving the NATO alliance. That is something that Ukraine is deeply reliant on when it comes to military aid. And of course, we've heard from Democrat leaders, not only just President Biden, but also from other key figures who've repeatedly expressed support not only for Ukraine, but for the NATO alliance, the military support that that offers to key allies and partners, including Ukraine. So for leaders, including President Zelenskyy, there will be a key focus on that, on ensuring that that partnership, whoever does take the presidency, remains and continues.",

But both of these nations, both strong U.S. allies in the region, they emphasize the need to continue working with the United States. Now, in a statement, this is what we heard from South Korea's presidential office. Let's bring it up for you.It says this, that the office will continue to work closely with the U.S. to further develop the South Korea-U.S. Global Comprehensive Strategic Alliance. And this is what we heard from Fumio Kishida, the prime minister of Japan. He says this, quote: I recognize that President Biden's decision is based on his desire to make the best possible political decision. The Japan-U.S. alliance is the cornerstone of our nation's diplomatic security, and we will continue to monitor it closely. Now, in contrast, the president of the Philippines directly responded to Biden's announcement, saying that it's, quote: a demonstration of genuine statesmanship. And he took to the social media platform X to add this, this coming from Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos, Jr. He says, quote: We thank him for his constant and unwavering support for the Philippines in this delicate and difficult time. Now, he's making reference to the ongoing tensions between the Philippines and China over China's assertions of sovereignty in the South China Sea, over its claims in that area. The United States continues to say that it stands with the Philippines. I also have to mention China's stance on all this. At today's MOFA briefing in Beijing, we heard from the spokesperson who said that the U.S. election is America's own internal affairs. So bottom line, China has no comment. Back to you guys.",

Now there may be opportunity for the Democrats to put more focus on Trump's fitness for office.So yes, this will be something the Trump campaign will probably have to be concerned about. I think you'll see them draw more concern. His handlers may be more concerned about how he rambles at his rallies, for instance.

And you know, look, there's real potential here to rally Democrats, especially young women, Democrat voters that otherwise were, you know, disaffected and disappointed in rallying behind an 81 year old male nominee.So I think you'll see Democrats lean into Dobbs.
