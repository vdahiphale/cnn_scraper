But some Republicans say, that compromise is still too costly and could bankrupt the country.

KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), U.S. HOUSE SPEAKER:  After weeks of negotiations, we have come to an agreement in principle. We still have a lot of work to do but I believe it is an agreement in principle that's worthy of the American people. It has historic reductions in spending, consequential reforms that will lift people out of poverty into the workforce, reign in government overreach.

Republicans aren't going to be happy because there weren't enough cuts and the progressive wing of the Democratic Party is also going to -- not be happy because there was too much cuts. You know, they tried to curb government spending and create work requirement for government aid and limits on food stamps, and also limits in terms of what the IRS can do in terms of its enforcement by cutting that by 10 billion.And so, it's going to lead to a lot of unhappy people on both sides. But if you look at recent polling about government spending, it's -- majority of Americans that do want government spending to get under control. And I think this is an opportunity to really look at that. I am very concerned about what's going to happen later in the House and the Senate, of course. But, you know, the U.S. has been on the path of a lot of spending over the past century. We see that since 1917, they raised the debt ceiling 78 times, 49 times under Republicans. So, it's something that's commonly taking place in U.S. politics. But given how polarizing politics is, I really think it's very dangerous to engage in this constant game of chicken.",

But there are pill versions that companies are working on. And in data, we saw just this past week, it looks like the efficacy is about similar to what we see with the injectable versions of the drugs.Novo Nordisk which makes both Ozempic and Wegovy has a tablet version of the drug where it showed in a trial that it could lead to 15 percent weight loss. There are also some drugs in development from Pfizer and Eli Lilly. We saw some Pfizer data this week, these are all in clinical trials right now. They'll have to go through more study. And for the Novo Nordisk, they say they'll potentially file for FDA approval this year. So, these could be coming within the next year or two if they are successful. However, we do see that they have a similar side effect profile as the injectable drugs. Things like nausea and vomiting. We've heard from doctors that this can be intolerable for about five to 10 percent of patients. There is some hope that with pill versions of the drug, you could, sort of. change the way that you take the drug. You start at lower doses and you gradually move up over time. If you had a pill, maybe you could modulate that in a way where you could cut back on some of those side effects. So, that is a hope. There is also a huge number of drugs in development that aim to improve on the amount of weight loss that we are seeing with the current medicines. Right now, there's a drug call Mounjaro that's already on the market with type 2 diabetes. It's expected to get approval for weight loss by the end of this year or early next year. That -- with called tirzepatide, as the chemical name, it leads to weight loss of about 22 percent that we saw on clinical trials. But there are drugs that are coming along even behind that. One known as triple G because it goes after three different targets that doctors say, it could lead to 25 to 30 percent weight loss. The question, of course, is going to be safety. Are these drugs tolerable? And then, of course, can they be paid for? These drugs are quite expensive, more than $1,000 a month. And insurance is still getting worked out in many cases.

And so, the goal of this is to have a long-term plan and a way to have the drug help you lose weight. And also, find a way to, you know, see how things go on the other end.Once you've lost the weight, how do we find a way to taper off? Because medically, people think that, you know, you can take it -- lose four or five pounds and then stop taking it, you will, first of all, get a rebound and second of all the goal here is really to improve your health in the long run, right. This is a battle to prevent disease in your -- in the rest of -- for the rest of your life. This is not to really improve cosmetics.",

Red Bull's Max Verstappen took his first Monaco pole position on Saturday. Now, his qualifying lap denied Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso the top slot. At 41 years old, think about this, Alonso is the eldest driver on the grid. Alonso's last win was a decade ago. Now, in the 107-year history of the Indy 500, only nine female drivers have ever raced at the brickyard. But later today, British driver Katherine Legge will compete as the fastest woman to ever qualify. But when she spoke to our Don Riddell, Legge said, you know, the car doesn't know I'm a woman. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KATHERINE LEGGE, COMPETING IN THE INDY 500:  I don't necessarily want to be the fastest woman driver, right. I want to be the fastest overall drive. And what's really awesome is in the 10 years since I've raced here before, I've noticed that there's so many more women banned (ph) here. And there's many more women in the padding (ph). And like, it was mostly men, I would say, 10 years ago. And now, I think it's close to 50-50. And the women have come up to me and they said, you know, you're racing for every woman out there and the little girls have been really supportive. And so, it's been really, really neat to see that aspect of it. But at the end of the day, when I'm in my car and I've got my helmet on, the car doesn't know the difference and I'm just another racecar driver. So, rather than being the fastest woman, I just want to be the fastest driver, and hopefully we will get there.",

And then at some point comes the realization that you are a role model and with that comes responsibility.So, while I don't set out to do that, I do appreciate that that's what happens. And a lot of young girls look up to me. But I think more importantly, they look up to me because then they believe that they can be anything they want to be, right? You know, when you're a kid you want to be a fighter pilot or a fireman or a racecar driver, or something like that. And so, traditionally, a very male-dominated. And if you can see it, you can be it. So, I think if they see women running countries, women running companies, women doing traditionally man things then they believe in their heart they can be anything that they want to be.

This is good. You're not nervous. All you have to do is hit your mark. You know how to drive these cars. You know what you're doing. Just do what you do. Don't let any of those stuff in. And then I got -- sat on the grid down there. Sat in line and I'm six cars back, and I have my helmet on and everything. And my heart, OK. I'm pretty nervous. No, don't be nervous. You got to think about this. And on the other end, I'm like, yes, but I'm nervous and all eyes are on you. And I thought, I wouldn't get nervous. So, I've gone into this Indy 500 thinking I'm not going to be nervous and I'm going to take it all in because I have an Indy in the past because I've been struggling (ph) because I'm thinking about all the things that I need to do. And I thought, oh, this year I'm older and I'm more mature and I'm more likely to be able to handle. Taking I all in, you know. And racing back (INAUDIBLE) and everything's going on. I'm like, I'm going to really enjoy it this year. I'm going to make my memories instead of blacking it all out. And then yesterday happened and then I'm, like, maybe I weren't. Maybe I'll have to put my blinkers back on. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
