KUSTER: I mean, look, this is what's challenging for all of us. And I'm just being very honest with you and with the viewers. This is what was difficult for us, particularly over the last three weeks since the debate. I spent time myself with President Biden back in the spring. I had the opportunity to fly with him on Air Force One. And I could tell that he was aging. It's not - I think he has acuity in his thought process. I'm not worried about that. It's not about his memory. I think it was the burden of campaigning and governing at the same time. And so there was never any doubt, nor is there doubt now, about his ability to continue his term, finish his term. But, you know, she was being very loyal to the ticket. I'm not concerned about that criticism. I think that's going to be gone within the - within the week in terms of moving on, the excitement of having her at the top of the ticket, and just where we go from here. Frankly, the Republicans are going to throw a lot up. They have a flawed candidate. You know, which would you rather have, a prosecutor or a felon? And they're very, very nervous about how strong this blue wave is going to be. We've got fantastic battleground candidates now, members that are going to win their seats. We've got recruits that I've been out campaigning for and raising funds for all across the country. We're going to win the House. They'll hold the Senate. And that means the Supreme Court for an entire generation. And we've got a great shot now at the White House. And I think we're going to get it done.",

If it comes down to the question of, do you want Donald Trump to be president, yes or no, then those voters and those groups presumably will move toward Harris.
