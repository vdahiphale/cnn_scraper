Walter Isaacson asked Alexander Vindman, the former NationalSecurity Council official whose testimony helped impeach Trump. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in New York. Despite killing Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar last week, Israel is stepping up its military campaign in Gaza. Over the weekend, strikes on a residential building in the north killed dozens of people. And in Lebanon, Israel's campaign appears to be straying further away from military targets, attacking branches of a Hezbollah financial center, which is used by many civilians as a bank. Meanwhile, a Hezbollah drone has hit the private residence of the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who was not there. No injuries have been reported. All this against a backdrop of public statements by President Biden to use this moment as an opportunity to turn the page. Joining me now is the former U.S. ambassador to Lebanon, Iraq, Syria, and posts across the region. He's the veteran diplomat, Ryan Crocker. Welcome Ryan Crocker, ambassador from Britain, where no doubt you're being able to absorb the international sentiment about the elections and about what's happening in the Middle East. So, let's just get going with the first question. Is this a moment, do you think, where Israel and the region can step off the road to war or not? RYAN CROCKER, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO LEBANON AND DISTINGUISHED CHAIR IN DIPLOMACY AND SECURITY, RAND:  I think there is a moment, provided both sides and outside parties such as the United States think small and think realistically. The death of Sinwar clearly was a major blow to Hamas and a major achievement for Israel, but it doesn't fundamentally alter the terms of the conflict. And similarly, the decapitation of the Hezbollah leadership in Lebanon, as we have seen very dramatically with that drone strike that hit the prime minister's residence, has not curtailed their ability to fire missiles across the border. So, I would urge all parties to think small, think in terms of a ceasefire that can save lives in Lebanon, and among Palestinians in Gaza, and of supreme importance, give the chance to get the hostages back alive. But this is not the moment in which we see a fundamental shift in the dynamics of the Middle East.",

So, I guess Israel wouldsay the same thing, that, you know, yes, we've killed him, but the war continues. And it's really -- they're going at it in an extremely, you know, sort of stepped up way. And likewise, in Lebanon, we heard today, Israel saying, we will strike Lebanon until Hezbollah collapses. Do you think it's possible for Israel to achieve those maximalist goal? You were ambassador to Lebanon when Hezbollah was formed, I think.",

And you know that Hezbollah started to fire on October 8th in support of Hamas. So, what would you advise, having known so much and, you know, absorbed so much, not just in Lebanon, but, you know, we mentioned Iraq after the invasion, Afghanistan, all these places that have dealt with the attempt to change regimes and to stamp out militantism?",

      "sentences": "Well, the harder one stamps, the more militants one seems to engender. So, again, I think the imperative has to be every effort possibleto get a ceasefire in the north, in Lebanon, and a ceasefire in Gaza. That is not going to be easy, but it is, I think, just possible. And I commend the Biden administration and Secretary Blinken in particular for making the effort at this delicate juncture. There are two different conflicts, obviously. In Lebanon, there is the architecture for a cessation of hostilities that rests in U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701 that was passed after the Hezbollah, Israeli conflict of 2006 that would call for a deployment of the Lebanese army throughout the south. The cessation of any armed action by any party that the Lebanese government assisted by the United Nations, interim force in Lebanon would have the sole monopoly of power and that Israel would withdraw its forces. It might be that Israel, because, again, the decapitation of the Hezbollah leadership has not stopped the rocket fire, that Israel might be interested right now in a cessation of hostilities in which they could claim at least a victory of sorts by eliminating the command of their adversary. And it might be that Hezbollah and Iran behind them would also welcome a ceasefire, at this point, to regroup and reorganize. But again, there should be no illusion on the part of anyone that the killing of Nasrallah and so many of his other commanders fundamentally alters the will or the ability of Hezbollah to prosecute this military campaign.",

Strikes into Beirut throughout the south, at Palestinian targets, at civilian infrastructure, at financial centers. It eliminated the PLO as a military threat to Israel, but as we've already discussed, it engendered Hezbollah, a far more lethal, more potent adversary than the PLO ever dreamed of being.

And yet, I think all sides, including observers, you tell me whether you agree, it just was never implemented, and the U.N. was unable to, it doesn't have force as its mandate, and it just apparently wasn't implemented.

Israel has a huge problem with continued fire across its borders, it prevents 60,000 Israelis from returning home. So, it may be that all parties would have an interest now that they did not have in 2006 in first a ceasefire, and then an effort to implement 1701. The Lebanese government, such as it is, has announced that it is prepared to send the Lebanese army to the south. UNIFIL would strengthen its presence, and we would have to see if there are the makings of at least an indefinite calm in this region, because the course that Israel is on now is simply not producing the results it seeks. The 60,000 Israelis are no closer to going home than they were on October 8th.",

At the same time, we've heard, whether it's leaked or whether it's fact. that Israel says that it will hit military targets rather than oil and nuclear sites. What do you think is going to happen and what will the result be? What can Israel expect by striking Iran?",

We've heard, as you say, that they have taken the nuclear and oilfacilities off the target list, but whatever they do strike, assuming it is a hard hitting one, I think it's going to push the conversation in Tehran even more sharply toward the development of a nuclear weapons capability. Because what we have seen, what they have seen, certainly, is that their conventional weapons against Israel, their ballistic missiles, intermediate and medium-range missiles, have been singularly ineffective. So, that leaves them, I can imagine the argument again Tehran, with one viable option for regime survival and security, and that is the nuclear option. So, the longer this conflict pursues between Israel and Iran directly, and the more it intensifies, I think the more likely it is that Iran will go into overdrive in the effort to produce a nuclear weapon.",

But I think, in the case of the Gaza conflict, they have played a dubious hand exceptionally well. I think the Biden administration was right to come down immediately and wholeheartedly in support of Israel. Because as I look at the events of the last year, there has been -- the word genocide has been tossed around a lot. There was only one genocidal action, in my estimation, and that was on October 7th itself. Not in its scope, but in its intent. And the effect of that massacre on October 7th of last year on the Israeli psyche is impossible to overestimate. That that -- to think that we could or should have stopped weapons deliveries or taken other punitive steps against Israel would have been, I think, morally wrong, but it also would have been strategically wrong. It would have pushed Israeli public opinion farther into a corner that is them against the world, that they can count on no one, including the United States. So, the administration has taken a lot of grief for its solid support of Israel. I think that was the right thing to do, but I also think that the Israeli government and the Israeli people have to recognize where their own interests lie. And they do not lie. There is nothing that they're going to gain by continuing operations indefinitely in Gaza. You cannot kill them all.",

The Japanese leaders that we met with all said, we're prepared to work with anybody. This is incredibly important. We'll work with Trump. We'll work with Harris. The other thing that really came out in spades though, was that the deep disappointment across both sides of the aisle with what America has to offer when it comes to economic policy, market access. They understand, I think, that this could be much more difficult, disruptive with a Trump administration, that we'll see a return to the tariff wars, that the instability, that the rhetoric, that the language, the style of diplomacy would be difficult.

She's got a new set of challenges that Biden, and it's going to be a very different administration. I think that one of the reasons I'm a little bit more optimistic about some of the things that we've discussed is that, President Harris, who I've known for 20 years, comes out of Northern California, Silicon Valley, the booming economy, she's talking a lot about entrepreneurship and small businesses, and it's a very different language, I think than what -- how President Biden often talked about the economy. I think we should expect her to have -- to be drawing more from the experience she had as being in one of the economic dynamos of the world in Northern California and understanding innovation, entrepreneurship as a more central theme of her administration if she wins, and I think she will win. I mean, her rhetoric around the economy is very different from Biden's, and I think it's much more tied to her optimism, upward mobility, you know, this line she has about how she wants people not to just get by, but get ahead is very in sync with where the Democratic Party has been over the last 30, 40 years.",

We've got a country that spends, what, $900 billion a year on its defense budget. A lot of that goes overseas. There is a need for access to the American economy.

That means NATO minus the U.S., which has been already investing in massive resources to bolster its defense. 23 nations now meet that threshold of 2 percent spending. They're already doubling down on what they need to do to defend themselves, worn off adversaries. But the U.S. is really the backbone. It's the arsenal of democracy. So, what you have is a much more kind of evenly weighted struggle between authoritarianism and democracies absent the U.S., which is in a much, much more ambiguous place. Europe will have to be a lot more aggressive in defending its own interests. But seemingly with the opportunity for Russia to win, to exploit opportunities, to exploit divisions and fractures between Eastern and Western Europe. So, you have a mix, where I forecast it's actually a mix for a spillover in the conflict. Europeans will have to be more aggressive. They'll pour resources into Russia -- into Ukraine, and Russia will do the same in reverse. And it's much more -- we don't like fair fights. We want to be -- we want to have the upper hand.

We can't be short-sighted and look at these ideas of -- and each situation, minimizing risk because it actually doesn't work. When those -- when you do that consistently, you actually invite opportunism, aggression, build a sense of impunity and adversaries. You actually have to consistently defend your own interests. And in this case, that means fulsome support to Ukraine, being a good ally to our allies around the world, not withdrawing because that invites the kinds of aggression that is most dangerous to U.S. national security. That builds us to a confrontation in which China is more aggressive towards Taiwan, in which Iran is much more adventurous in the Middle East, in which our adversaries, again, cross thresholds that eventually we'll have to defend. So, it's better to be on a team like we are with democracies and NATO than to go at it alone, let our friends be picked off one at a time, and then be a very easy target for our adversaries that coalesce against our interests.",

They wanted -- and they try to poke and prod to see where the Russians were vulnerable and they spread their forces too far apart. So, you need something called mass. You need to focus all your resources on the main effort. They didn't really do that, nor could they synchronize operations between battalions within a brigade or brigades within a larger footprint. These are organizations of 5,000, 10,000, 15,000. They cut -- they're not equipped to do that. They've shown success in being able to do smaller operations, like the Kursk incursion with their elite units, but as a whole, they weren't able to do that. That's one. The other thing is that they were under equipped. The U.S. western equipment came in too late. It didn't -- we promised -- over promised and under delivered. That's another issue. I think the fact is that, you know, we under invested in Ukraine being able to build out the critical components of its own offensive capabilities. Ukraine was 25 percent of the entire Soviet industrial base. That's languished. The Ukrainians themselves have invested in there. Mobilization, this is another thing that I push for.

Right now, they -- without a viable theory of victory people don't want to sign up. They don't want to be cannon fodder. They don't want to -- their lives squandered. But if you propose a vision for success and resource it with the ways and means to implement it, you can get people to sign up like you did in the beginning of the war, when people were very, very you know, in mass numbers joining in.

In some place -- in some ways that's a current for the Republican Party, but a lot of it is this charismatic leader that's dragging him in that direction. So, once Trump is out of the picture, you have a portion of the Republican Party returned to its roots.

The House, which is far more kind of under the sway -- you know, the rapture of MAGA and Trumpism and the extreme right wing tends to be more fluid. And we -- in this moment, they're not supportive of Ukraine, although they were compelled to move on that issue after nine months. Why? Because it wasn't the speaker that moved him on that issue, it was individuals. It was the fact that you would have Republicans peel away and support aid to Ukraine. I think it's harder now, nine months on, it's going to be harder to get another round of appropriation. But with a theory and victory, with a vision where Ukraine -- where the war could potentially wind down in the -- in 2025, deeper into 2025, you could get at least one more push and support. What you want to do is you want to communicate resolve, though, and you don't want to say that this is finite because that encourages Putin, for instance, to continue on, continue to wage the war for another year or two years. But he's also -- Putin doesn't have unlimited resources. The Russians have lost vast quantities of troops, the vast quantities of resources. They're running -- starting to run thin.
