In Georgia, you got prosecutors asking a judge to now jail one of Trump's co- defendants, his name, Harrison Floyd, over his alleged effort to intimidate co-defendants and apparently witnesses, including Georgia election worker Ruby Freeman, and the judge says that he's going to bar the public release of sensitive evidence like the Jenna Ellis proffer video that we saw.

      "sentences": "Well, as in a bunch of Donald Trump's cases, there are a lot of issues of first impression by which we mean things that courts are dealing with for the first time. It doesn't mean that they're saying Donald Trump didn't engage in insurrection, but they're parsing different parts of Section 3 of the 14th Amendment.So, in Michigan, the court ruled that this was a political question, non-justiciable, which means that it's not up to the court to decide, it's up to Congress to decide. For that ruling, they really based it on the final sentence of Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which says that Congress can remove the disability of having participated in insurrection by a two-thirds vote. That seemed to imply to that court anyway that it's really within the province of the legislative branch to be making these decisions. Now, other courts have gone in another direction. In Minnesota, the court seemed to stumble on to a different solution which struck me as kind of strange, which is that it might be an issue that could block a candidate for being a candidate for president of the United States or Congress or Senate in the general election, but not in the primary, which to me is like saying if a 14-year-old tried to run for Congress or for president, they could be on the primary ballot but not on the general election ballot, that that's just up to the party to decide, which I think cuts against nearly a century of Supreme Court rulings that the primary process is part of the electoral machinery that belongs to the state. That was decided in really the 1930s and 40s, in some cases called the white primary line of authority, Smith versus Allwright, Terry versus Adams. And so, that struck me as a strange way of thinking about the case. But, obviously, the courts are all over the map here because as with so much Trump litigation, it's all new and nobody has dealt with this for more than a century.",

Should it be based on equal production within the Constitution or should we just allow the voters to decide?And there are some things that we commit to the Constitution, and then we follow the Constitution. It seems to me really strange to say, when someone tries to overthrow the democratic process, as Donald Trump did, that the Constitution shouldn't apply to him. He agrees with that. He has said repeatedly, we don't need the Constitution. So, I think what we need is a judicial determination of whether or not an impeachment by the House and a 57 to 43 vote in the Senate is enough to establish as a civil proposition that he has engaged in insurrection or whether you need additional adjudicative fact-finding by the court, but nowhere does it say you need to have a criminal conviction in order to make Section 3 of the 14th Amendment apply.",

The potential juror now has heard testimony from key people that would not be admissible in trial, but it's out there. So, that's one of the reasons this should remain confidential. Usually, for everything out, everything -- you know, let it all hang out. But in this particular case, it's very sensitive.

He has gone out into the hallway for the New York civil fraud trial time and time again to give his own summation of what's happening. He wants to have cameras in the courtroom, even in the federal court. Georgia, it's allowed. Not there. But when you look at that, does that have the potential for good transparency or media circus?

I realized as I was writing this book, Trump was de- platformed. He was shamed out of the public square three years ago. But he was brought back to the center by these conspiracies about January 6th. That's why the federal trial, it's one of the many reasons why it's so important to put on under the scene what really happened and why, and to get away from all this nonsense about feds and false flags and government agents.

I think that this is, you know, very -- people can get their arms wrapped, their arms around this. I called for President Trump's impeachment on the 7th day of January 2021. The day after January 6th, I said he deserved to be impeached. He was impeached by the House of Representatives, but then he was acquitted by the United States Senate. You know, I would have convicted him. The Senate acquitted him.Doesn't Jack Smith's efforts in a way smack of double jeopardy? I mean, isn't the impeachment process the way we punish errant presidents, people who violate the oath of their office? It just seems to me that a lot of these various lawsuits against Trump as outrageous as his behavior has been, and it really has been, in many cases, low down and dirty. But still, he went before the United States Senate or he didn't physically show up, but his case was litigated. The Senate acquitted him. You know, you needed two-thirds vote. He didn't get anywhere near two-thirds vote for conviction. You know, that's the Constitution. And I saw your earlier segment of the lawsuit to keep him off the ballot in Colorado. It's really -- you know, it's not for a state to determine who's on the ballot for the presidential election. I think it's really going ad hominem. They're going after him in ways that generate sympathy for him, you know, exactly what you shouldn't be.",
