Russian troops have apparently gained some ground near the city of Bakhmut where Ukraine is evacuating some civilians. But recent social media video suggests Russians are also taking major losses.One video shows dead Russian troops littering the countryside in the area. Some independent military analysts say Russian gains are relatively small compared to the price they're paying. Now down south, Ukraine says Russian troops have pulled out of at least three settlements near Zaporizhzhia. Some pro-Russian civilian governments are reportedly preparing to follow suit. That's happening after Ukrainian strikes on Russian supply lines and ammunition warehouses in the region. So, for more on all this Salma Abdelaziz joins us from London. Salma, let's start with the latest on that battle near Bakhmut. What more can you tell us there?",

Residents who are still there endure almost daily shelling by Russian forces and now Ukrainian officials saying that Russian troops are making small gains, taking control of a few settlements in that region.But I'm going to emphasize that word small gains, Kim, because Ukrainian officials also saying that Russian troops are expending a great deal of resources of effort losing a great deal of manpower to gain a city Bakhmut that is not very strategically important. And that leads me to where might be the next stage in this battle, and that is further south in the Zaporizhzhia region. They're also reports that Russian troops are actually withdrawing from some parts. Ukraine intensifying -- intensifying its counter offensive. Excuse me. Ukrainian -- Zaporizhzhia is extremely important. Its home to Europe's largest nuclear power plant that is still Russian occupied, and we're seeing the same methodology that Ukrainian forces have used in the past trying to cut off Russian supply lines, cutting off bridges as well, hitting Moscow's forces, even behind the front lines. And if you take a look at the map, you can begin to understand why this might be the next stage in the battle. What Ukrainian troops appear to be doing is trying to fortify their positions along the Dnipro River, the Western Bank, preparing to push across that river to the eastern bank where Russian troops are fortifying their positions. In particular, I want to bring up these latest reports again, out of Russian occupied areas in the Zaporizhzhia region that Russian backed officials are preparing for a vote of some kind, a referendum of some kind, taking a census there as well. One Ukrainian official saying that Russian troops have taken essentially almost all of the local hospitals there and turned them into military hospitals to try to treat Moscow's own troops. So, a real indication that Russia's hunkering down for a fight. But you're also getting very clear signs of the strategy here from Kyiv, which is to sort of drain Russian forces all along that very long frontline while focusing on the southern front and continuing to push on that counter offensive. But very important to remember here, Kim, these are the winter months. This is when fighting slows down, so don't expect anything to change too quickly.",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over):  Mercenaries for Russia's Wagner private military company are fighting on some of the toughest battlefields in Ukraine. A social media channel affiliated with a group recently posted this video allegedly showing a severely wounded Wagner fighter trying to shoot himself rather than fall into Ukrainian hands. Now the group has acknowledged a man from the Southern African nation of Zambia has been killed, fighting on the front lines in Ukraine. This is 23-year-old Lemekhani Nathan Nyirenda. Wagner's founder Yevgeny Prigozhin known as Putin's chef, admits he recruited Nyirenda from a Russian jail and says he died a hero. I talked to him in the (Inaudible) region, Prigozhin wrote in a statement, why do you need this war? After all, the chance of dying is quite high. And he answered what I expected. You Russians helped us Africans gain independence for many years. The Wagner group saves thousands of Africans, and if I go to war with you, this is probably a very small way in which I can pay our debts. Zambian authorities say Nyirenda was studying nuclear engineering in Russia, but was thrown in jail for more than nine years for what his father told Reuters was a drug offense.

The most widespread display of dissent the country has seen in a generation. Protestors are pushing back against the crushing lockdowns and restrictions of the government's zero COVID policy. But Chinese state media never showed any of these images. Instead on Thursday, offering scenes of very different crowds, somber people lining the streets of Shanghai. Honoring former Chinese leader Jiang Zemin. He died Wednesday at the age of 96. Jiang is being given the country's highest honors. His open casket met at the airport in Beijing by current Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Jiang was president of China from 1993 to 2003. Famous for his trademark spectacles and for periodically bursting into song. His death has triggered a wave of nostalgia on the heavily censored Chinese internet. Who would've thought that movies, books, and even World Cup live streams have all been censored? One person wrote in a post that appears to have since been deleted by censors.

Now, of course, as you laid out, that the police and the authorities have denied any responsibility predictably as they have done with all the deaths that we've seen over the course of this protest movement. But a Norway based human rights organization, Iran HR, as well as other rights groups on the ground say they believe that Mehran Samak was killed by the security forces. Now, according to Tasnim, a state aligned news outlet, several people have been arrested by the authorities in connection with Mehran Samak's death. At this stage the regime and authorities and police officials in the area continue to deny any responsibility and say an investigation is ongoing. But of course, human rights groups maintain that this is just another example of the regime of the security forces in Iran targeting peaceful protestors. We've seen that death toll rising according to human rights groups Iran HR, pegging that figure at more than 400 deaths since protests began in September. And we're also seeing international pressure mounting. The E.U. is set to propose further sanctions, a third packet of sanctions that is set to be put before European Union foreign ministers in December.
