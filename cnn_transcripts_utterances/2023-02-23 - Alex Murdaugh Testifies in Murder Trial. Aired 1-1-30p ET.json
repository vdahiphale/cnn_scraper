Today is the first time in more than a year-and-a-half, nearly two years, since Maggie and Paul Murdaugh were killed that Alex Murdaugh has admitted he was with them just moments before they were murdered, Abby.",

They didn't find that video on Paul's phone until early 2022. And so it wasn't something that was initially known about when they were presenting evidence to Alex Murdaugh in the month after those murders, and listening to every single person identify it as his voice. I think the bigger question was going to be, what's he going to say? He has to address this. Are they going to have some reason for it? Or what is his reasoning going to be that his voice was there? So I think it was more trying to just listen for what his excuse was, essentially, rather than surprise. I will say, my producer Wesley Brewer (ph) was inside at the time, and he said that the jury has been listening intently to Alex Murdaugh. And he noted that, when the attorney Jim Griffin asked Murdaugh the questions, Abby, that the jury looks at him, but Alex Murdaugh then turns to the jury and answers all the questions looking directly at them, in an attempt to engage the jury with him. He said, with the exception of one juror sitting in the front row, they do appear to be listening to him by looking at him and being intently engaged. He said that one woman on the front row of that jury seems to kind of have her back to Murdaugh during these discussions. And, again, we talked about high risk, high reward potentially for the defense. That risk, though, is there. And Alex Murdaugh has already been proven through this testimony of many people in this particular trial to be a liar, to be a thief and to be a cheat. And that's something that state has pointed out. Whether or not they trust him under oath on the stand is going to be another story.",
