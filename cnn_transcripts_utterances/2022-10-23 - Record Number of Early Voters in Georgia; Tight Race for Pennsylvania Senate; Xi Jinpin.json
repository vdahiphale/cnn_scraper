Among them, President Biden, who will visit south Florida on Tuesday to take part in a rally for the Democratic National Committee. In the state of Georgia, voters have been casting early ballots in record numbers. So far about 660,000 people have shown up to vote in person with more than 140,000 going to the polls on Friday alone. Officials say the numbers have shattered previous turnout records.

That's what it takes at some of these polling locations; 4,000 people, workers told us, have been here, early voting, since Monday. Take a look at those numbers. Look at early voting all throughout Georgia from Monday through Friday, more than 660,000 Georgians have already participated in the voting process. You compare that to our last midterm election in 2018, just about 398,000. So you can see that number so much larger this time around. People tell me it's all about the key races.

And also abandoned are age norms, collective leadership, meritocracy as well as anything that we had thought long to be institutionalized in the party's power structure when it comes to leadership succession and promotion of senior officials. When you look at this lineup, the number two official in the party, Li Qiang, standing behind him when they walked out earlier, he is extremely unpopular as the party chief because of his handling of the two-month long, very brutal lockdown in the city because of COVID. There are a lot of videos online of angry residents shouting at him and blaming him for mishandling and asking him how can we residents of the biggest and most wealthiest city in China, starving. But still despite that he's now very much all but certain to be the next premier of China in charge of the whole country's economy, despite lacking national policymaking experience. But what he does have and along with three new additions of the powerful committee are all these four men have worked closely with Xi Jinping, either in the provinces or in Beijing. And three of them including Li Qiang have served as Xi Jinping's chief of staff or secretary. So those are the men that Xi feels closest to, that he can trust the most.

I think it's unlikely even though Sunak was the chancellor under Boris Johnson, the job he wants is prime minister. And Boris Johnson has already had the top job so it's hard to see him in any other role, particularly in a government run by the man who was his chancellor and whose resignation was one of the final pivotal moments in his own downfall. So I think that's unlikely. Perhaps, though, at this stage, Boris Johnson doesn't have the votes he needs from within the party. Each candidate needs 100 MPs to back them before 2:00 pm in London tomorrow time. At that stage, anyone with over 100 MP support will go through to the members of the Conservative Party for a vote. As you say, at this stage, people question whether, in the interest of unity, when it becomes clear who has the support of the MPs, perhaps the other members will back out and we can get back to business or some sort of level of functioning government and business in the U.K.",

It says Donald Trump enacted a wide-ranging pressure campaign across the government, from the Department of Justice to state officials, to even his former vice president Mike Pence, to get help in this scheme. It says that Donald Trump oversaw the fake elector plot where states submitted fake batches of electors to Congress on his behalf. And it says Trump summoned the mob to the Capitol on January 6 because he knew that some protesters in the crowd were armed and yet he did not call off the violence on January 6 for hours as he was watching it on TV. So in addition to laying all of that out, the committee is asking Trump for a wide range of documents to turn over. That's including all his conversations he's had on January 6 and whether or not he spoke to any of the other witnesses who contacted the committee. So all those documents are due by November 4th.
