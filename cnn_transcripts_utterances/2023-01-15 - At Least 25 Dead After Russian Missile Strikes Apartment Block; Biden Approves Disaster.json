      "sentences": "Hello, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me, I'm Fredricka Whitfield, on what would have been Martin Luther King's 94th birthday. President Joe Biden will deliver a sermon at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta to honor the legacy of the slain civil rights leader. Biden will be the first sitting president to speak at a Sunday service at Georgia church where King served as pastor.Biden is expected to talk about King's life and legacy, as well as democracy and voting rights on the eve of the MLK federal holiday. And this comes as Biden is facing a growing controversy and new questions. You're seeing live pictures right now of the president walking into Ebenezer Baptist with its pastor, who is also the senator, Warnock. And you are seeing these pictures live and people standing in his presence. CNN White House Correspondent Arlette Saenz is outside Ebenezer Baptist Church. And, Arlette, I was mentioning, I mean, this comes as the president is being hit with a lot of questions about documents that have been found in his personal residence, in Delaware, as well as at his former office. So, what do we expect his message will be largely staying away from the controversy and answering some of those questions and more specifically addressing the legacy of Dr. King?",

      "sentences": "Well, Fred, President Biden's is hoping to keep the focus on what he will deliver in this sermon today at Ebenezer Baptist Church, where Dr. Martin Luther King -- Reverend Martin Luther King was the pastor at the time of his assassination. And officials at the White House have said that the president wants to talk about the legacy of Dr. King, as well as the path forward for the nation.Now, this all comes ahead of that Martin Luther King holiday tomorrow. And the president is coming to this historic church at the invitation of Senator Raphael Warnock, who just run reelection to the Senate is actually the pastor here in Ebenezer Baptist Church. Now, you hear that the service is starting to get underway there. Of course, this all comes at a very interesting time, as conversation about those classified documents found at both the president's residence in Wilmington, Delaware, and a former private office. Those conversations about the classified documents have really dominated so much of the news in the days leading into this. Another interesting point, of course, is the fact that President Biden himself is weighing whether he wants to launch another bid for reelection. Of course, Georgia would be pivotal to a 2024 campaign. This is a state that helped Biden win when he flipped it from red to blue back in 2022. But today, the focus of his message is expected to be honoring the legacy of Dr. King.",

We'll take you there again in a moment.In other news right now, a heartbreaking scene in Dnipro, Ukraine, after an apartment block was hit in a deadly Russian missile strike. A young girl seen cleaning up, right there, in the rubble of that aftermath. Ukraine says at least 25 people were killed, including a child, and at least 73 people were injured.

Emergency power cuts are now ongoing, as they have been for a while.There was a bit of reprieve over the last two weeks where there was not a whole lot of missile strikes, which allowed crews to do some repair work and some upgrades on the system.

And right now, about 8 million Californians are under flood watches, as a new wave of powerful storms pushes in.The risk of potentially dangerous flooding and mudslides are much higher because the ground in many areas are just so saturated to absorb anymore water.
