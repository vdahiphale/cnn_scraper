Granderson, we also have Kristen Soltis Anderson, oh Granderson and Anderson, Kristen Soltis Anderson, no relation to you guys. We also have Natasha Alford and Dr. Devi Nampiaparampil of NYU School of Medicine. Guys, thanks so much for being here. Let's begin with a very serious business of these health issues, so Senator John Fetterman and get to Actor Bruce Willis. Let's talk about Senator Fetterman, because he has checked himself in after going to the attending physician of the U.S. Congress for his depression and the attending physician suggested that he go to Walter Reed. So, can you just tell us -- I mean, there's something like -- I think I have the stats here, something like 20 percent, 22 percent of Americans at this moment are suffering from depression. 60 percent of them do not seek help. So, what is the factor that would lead a doctor to say, actually you need inpatient help right now? DR. DEVI NAMPIAPARAMPIL, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR REHABILITATION MEDICINE, NYU SCHOOL OF MEDICINE: Well, inpatient is so hard to get for many reasons because of insurance and other factors. So, right now, doctors will probably say if the person poses harm to themselves or harm to others, but that's not necessarily how we decide if a person needs treatment. So, typically, in terms of treatment, you could think about non- pharmacologic treatment, pharmacologic treatment. In this case too, if a person has medical conditions, like if they have a stroke, then they also could have depression or they could have something else that looks like depression. So, for example, a person could have an infection or something else that needs to be treated as well.",

      "speaker": "NAMPIAPARAMPIL",
      "sentences": "Exactly. Well, first, so a person could have fatigue, they could have a depressed mood. What happens with depression? People can have like a feeling like they don't want to eat, they don't want to move, they feel really tired. These are usually nonspecific symptoms.Now, there can be other things that can really point you towards depression but you really want to get checked out first. Especially anybody who has had a history of stroke, they can be more at risk for depression because of the area of the brain that might be affected. They can be more at risk of depression because, you know, probably they're having trouble sleeping because of the stroke itself. They also can have trouble just functioning. So, depending on how your stroke has affected you, you may have trouble communicating, right? That going to make you more isolated from other people. You may have trouble with weakness, maybe on one side of your body, so that can affect how you could brush your teeth, how you could get dressed, how you get out, how you interact with the community, et cetera. So, if it's affecting you in all aspects of your life, you also may get situational depression as well. So, all of these things could affect you. So, he may have actual depression that needs to be treated, but in terms of inpatient access, he may actually have an advantage compared to the average person who may want to get checked in and be hospitalized. The average person may have a harder time.",

But there was a time in the not too distant past when depression had such a stigma that it was sort of seen as disqualifying for elected officials.L.Z. GRANDERSON, OP-ED COLUMNIST, LOS ANGELES TIMES:  Well, if you look at the campaign trail, some people still think it's disqualifying the way it was used during the primary as well as during the general election. It's a heartbreaking story because he worked so hard obviously to get to this place in life and I wonder if part of the depression is knowing that he can't be the person that he wanted to be in this moment and that perhaps he's letting people down. There's also could be depression linked to the fact that his families are very concerned about him but he doesn't want let his country down. Remember what the environment was like when he was running and how critical it was that when he won that seat unexpectedly that there was a sigh of relief for one side of the party recognizing that they have power. Maybe he's feeling guilt knowing that if he bows out, perhaps that power becomes in doubt. It's heartbreaking because there's more than just his own health I'm sure he's processing during all of this.",

You've got to be out there meeting people, being vigorous, being vibrant, giving speeches, answering questions. That's frankly why Republicans gave Biden so much grief after the 2020 or during the 2020 election alleging, oh, he's campaigning from his basement due to the pandemic, he didn't have to be as out there as vigorous, as public as he may have been under other circumstances. But, hopefully, we are not dealing with another pandemic in the 2024 election.And should President Biden choose to run again, he will be expected to answer tough questions, to be out on the trail, to meet and greet people, especially if he's running against a Republican who, well, it might be a rematch of Biden versus Trump, but it could be Biden versus a number of Republicans who are in their 40s and 50s and will very much want to draw that contrast.",
