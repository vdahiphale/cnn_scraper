At 100 years old, Jimmy Carter, the longest living president in U.S. history, died Dec. 29 surrounded by family. His grandson says the timing was fitting since the family always gathered over the New Year. JASON CARTER, JIMMY CARTER'S GRANDSON: So this was sort of one of his last gifts to us, is that the entire family is all going to get together this week again and be there with each other and to, of course, celebrate this remarkable life that he had. ABEL (voice-over): With that remarkable life comes reverential moments in his passing.

And at the end of his presidency, as he faces crises like the Iran hostage crisis, the Democrats are deeply divided. They're not particularly enthused about him. And it's not simply that he's a one term president.

Well, after this opinion, President-elect Trump is still a convicted felon, but there is certainly some good news here for him and that the judge is signaling that he does not intend impose any penalties against Trump. And the judge had the option to impose even a jail sentence after Trump was convicted of 34 counts of falsifying business records last year. But the judge said that he does not intend to do that.He says, quote, it seems proper at this juncture to make known the court's inclination to not impose any sentence of incarceration. So this really means that next Friday's sentencing will be mostly performative. It's also notable that the judge is really conceding to the demands on Trump's time right now. Judge Juan Merchan throughout this case has been pretty dismissive of a lot of the arguments the Trump team has made when they invoke his status as a former president or now president-elect. But here he says, quote, to assuage the defendant's concerns regarding the mental and physical demands during the transition period, the court will permit defendant to exercise his right to appear virtually for this proceeding. So he's essentially saying, yes, we know you have a lot going on. You're president elect, so you should not be burdened with traveling up to New York for this. You can appear virtually. The Trump team was pushing to get this entire case tossed out. They were not successful in doing that, but they can continue to appeal the conviction itself even after the sentencing. But it appears the Trump team is not fully satisfied with this opinion. Steven Cheung, Trump's communication director, said in a statement there should be no sentencing and President Trump will continue fighting against these hoaxes until they are all dead. The hoaxes, of course, being the four criminal cases Trump has faced. The two federal cases filed by the special counsel are effectively dead. They were both dismissed. The Georgia State case is on life support after a court disqualified the district attorney, Fani Willis, and Then the New York case, of course, the trial went last year. The sentencing will be next Friday. And while Trump was convicted, it appears he will not face any penalties. Danny, Amara. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

But two holdouts, Representatives Ralph Norman and Keith Self, briefly stood between Johnson and the gavel. That is, until President-elect Trump picked up the phone.Sources tell CNN that Trump argued Republicans needed unity and voters would not tolerate the dysfunction that would ensue if they could not rally together for this speaker fight. And with several members of the GOP expected to join Trump's administration, the House majority is set to drop to 215. That means house Republicans really can't afford even one defection if legislation passes along party lines. For more on this, we have Axios congressional reporter Stephen Neukam. He joins us now.

Obviously something that others had failed to do last year, former Speaker Kevin McCarthy losing the job ultimately. And it's also fair to point out that this was a formality two yearsago. I mean, when parties went in to vote for speakers, it usually wasn't this dramatic.

So all it took was one member to trigger that motion.Obviously, that is ultimately what ended up losing his job. Speaker Johnson has managed to raise that to nine. I think House Republicans, from leadership to the bottom, were frustrated with sort of the circus that ensued when they got rid of Kevin McCarthy. And they don't want it to be that easy to plunge the conference into chaos. But still, nine is a low threshold and there were 11 plus members who signed a letter yesterday to the speaker outlining their concerns before the session has really even started.

I mean, they've gotten some votes that they've wanted on the House floor, but that hasn't really translated into policy.They're still, you know, a relative minority within House Republicans.

Crews have also recovered one engine and plan to retrieve the second engine today.Investigators will also examine the plane's tail and landing gear. Meanwhile, the Transport Ministry has ordered safety checks of all Boeing 737s in Korean Airline fleets. Now, weeks before their re- sentencing hearing, the L.A. District Attorney says he has not made a decision on the Menendez Brothers case after meeting with Lyle and Erik Menendez's family. Nathan Hochman says he is still reading thousands of pages of records. The brothers were convicted in 1996 of killing their parents. They confessed to the murders but claimed self-defense, alleging abuse by their father, a claim disputed by prosecutors. A recent letter from Erik has renewed family support for the release, though at least one relative is against it. The brothers are set to appear in court later this month. New York's governor is set to announce the revival of congestion pricing. It is the nation's first toll program, charging vehicles entering midtown and lower Manhattan during peak hours. Sources tell CNN, the revised plan reduces the proposed toll from $15 to $9. The governor paused the program last year, citing inflation and rising prices as the reason. Now, Governor Kathy Hochul faces pressure from environmentalists and some lawmakers to act before President-elect Donald Trump, a vocal critic takes office. Danny?",
