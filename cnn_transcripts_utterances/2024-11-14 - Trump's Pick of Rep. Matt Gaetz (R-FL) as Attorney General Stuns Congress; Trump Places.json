He is chosen exactly for that reason to be a provocateur.I just want to say that within the Department of Justice, within the ranks, former members of the Department of Justice, Democrat, Republican, very wide, there is absolute distress and horror at the selection and real doubt, about whether the Department of Justice can withstand what will obviously be an assault delivered by Gaetz. And, look, Trump wants to be sure of loyalty for the slim possibility of being indicted or gone after himself. That is 0.01 percent of what the Department of Justice does.

But just the fact that with 53 people in the Senate, his A.G. nominee is someone whom he may have to bypass the Senate for to keep the American people from airing the dirty laundry and the great unpopularity that Gaetz has on the Hill tells you volumes about the nature of the choice.

He has a long history of saying he was going to prosecute people and then it not happening, but is that different now?

More than 90 U.S. attorney's offices have career prosecutors going into court every day prosecuting regular Americans for federal crimes. And this is something that with Gaetz having so little experience as a lawyer, not just that, no experience as a prosecutor, no experience trying cases. There are judges and there are ethics that lawyers have to follow. And we have seen in the past when prosecutors lose faith in what their political leadership is doing at the Justice Department, people refuse to do what they're told. They go into court and will resign from cases. We saw that at the end of the bar years. And judges do get mad at the Justice Department.

He says we're going to defund the FBI and ATF. I'm not sure even knows what those -- I assume he knows that the FBI is, but I don't know that he even knows what the ATF is. You're going to defund these agencies?And another important thing when people think of the attorney general of the United States, they think of the guy or woman sitting over all of what I was, all the federal prosecutors. There's so much more to it. You are in charge of all those law enforcement agencies, DEA, ATF, FBI, the marshals, the prison system, the solicitor general who decides what the government does in the Supreme Court.
