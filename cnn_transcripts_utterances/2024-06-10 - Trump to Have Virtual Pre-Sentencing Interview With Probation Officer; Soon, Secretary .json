This interview will be part of the report the probation department will submit to Judge Juan Merchan ahead of Trump's sentencing on July 11th. And for normal defendants, it could be a significant factor in determining whether there will be prison time.

It's, what is your home situation? Do you live in a stable environment? Do you have employment? Can you get employment? Are you suffering from any drug addiction? What is your criminal background?Is it violent? In this case, Donald Trump is going to be different from a lot of defendants, in fact, the vast majority. He lives in a triplex at the top of a building with his name on it. He has no criminal record, and yet, like many other defendants, he does have multiple other open felony cases. But as far as employment, drugs, and so on, the question that they're trying to resolve at the probation department is a couple of things, but key to it is, is he a good candidate for the community corrections environment? In English, that means the prison correction environment or being on probation without going to jail, but having to accept the conditions of probation.",

Parole is when you go to jail and they let you out early and they check on you after the fact.So, this is an interesting thing. You know, the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg, went to a lot of trouble to bring this case and to get this conviction. And he said in his controversial day one memo that he wants less people to go to jail, especially in non-violent crimes. But he did single out white collar crimes.

But before the trial, they said in some of their court filings that one of the things that they would want him to tell the jury if he decided to testify in his own defense was that, He has been clean, sober and law-abiding since 2019. Kate, the jury has heard so much testimony about his rampant drug abuse, really painting him in a very struggling and negative light. They said if he did testify, he would want to convey to the jurors directly that he's been clean for several years now. But, of course, if he did testify, the prosecutors could grill him. And they said in filings that the They would probably want to bring up his discharge from the Navy ten years ago after a positive drug test and that they might try to attack his credibility by bringing up that, in their view, he not only lied on this gun for him, but he's also lied on his taxes. So, a huge decision, it would be a risky move, and we should find out in about one hour.

Both sides will be able to give their final push to the jury on why they think they should get a conviction or an acquittal. Then there's jury instructions as well from the judge educating the jurors, instructing them on the laws in this case, the elements of the alleged crimes, and how they should conduct their deliberations.Now, one of the things that the defense wants the judge to instruct the jury about today, during those instructions, is what they call their theory of the case, the simplest, most straightforward reason why, in their view, this trial should end with three not guilty verdicts. And they told the judge that she should instruct the jury that Hunter Biden, quote, did not believe that he was either a drug user or addict at that time, when he bought the gun and when he possessed the gun. They've said all along that if he did not know he was a drug addict, if he did not know he was a user, then he cannot be convicted of these crimes. So, it could happen today, Kate.

He called on Hamas to accept the ceasefire that's on the table right now. JAKE SULLIVAN, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER:  And the best way to end this war is for Hamas to say yes to the deal President Biden announced and that Israel has accepted. (END VIDEOTAPE) LIEBERMANN (on camera):  What's unclear now is how easy it is to accept this deal from Israel's side with Gantz quitting the government. Netanyahu has even more pressure from his far right coalition partners who have threatened to dissolve the government if he accepts the ceasefire deal.
