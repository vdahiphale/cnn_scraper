She insisted that they all had lunch together after oral arguments because she felt that that kind of bond over food and other socializing really helped smooth relations.

That's according to a report in \"The Athletic,\" who says that Green has begun counseling for his on-the-court issues that prompted last week's suspension. In the game, he hit a Phoenix Suns player in the face, the latest of several altercations that Green has been playing for over the years. CNN has reached out to the NBA and the Warriors for comment. Also, the owner of some popular apparel companies are now scrambling to contain a cyberattack amid the holiday shopping rush. V.F. Corp, the parent company of Vans, North Face and Timberland, said that they detected unauthorized activity last week disrupting its business shopping operations. Online shoppers will notice a message apologizing for disruptions impacting delivery dates. And the rocket launch of Blue Horizon's new Shepard tourism rocket was (INAUDIBLE). The company said the mission was called off because of a ground system issue. The launch would have marked the rocket's return to flight after more than a year.
