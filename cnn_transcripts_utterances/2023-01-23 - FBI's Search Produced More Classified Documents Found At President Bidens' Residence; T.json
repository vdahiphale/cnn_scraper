It's worth noting that as this is going back and forth, White House says they will maintain complete cooperation throughout this process going forward. It's also worth noting that the special counsel, Robert Hur, isn't technically up and running yet.

He was President Biden's COVID response coordinator when he first came into office when the pandemic was still raging throughout the country. He was the co-chair of his transition team as well. Before that, he served in a number of high-ranking positions inside the Obama administration.And look, Ron Klain is obviously a very powerful chief of staff, really has his hands in just about everything that comes across the president's desk, across the administration. His departure is significant, somebody who has known and worked with the president for decades and has been so integral to the operations in the building over the first two years. But it was also something that was largely telegraphed. Klain telling people internally for several months he expected to leave at the start of the year. Now, Zients will take over that portfolio, and while he might not be the political operator that Klain is, when we talked to White House officials, they made clear it's his operations ability and what he's known for in terms of keeping the trains running on time that they view is so critical in this moment, a moment where President Biden will be dealing with House Republicans now in the majority, but also dealing with the implementation of all of those cornerstone legislative achievements of his first two years. In part, as this investigation with a special counsel is ongoing, this is deliberate, trying to keep the White House separate from that investigation, keep things running on time, very much in line in the West Wing, as the investigation and the president's legal team keep handling what is still a very uncertain timeline going forward, Jake.",

But we did see the FBI goa and search his property on Saturday -- onFriday for that 13-hour search. Remarkable, it did happen with a search warrant. It was in coordination with Biden's attorneys, but still, there were FBI agents searching the president's home. And what was so fascinating there to me about Attorney General Garland when he said was invoking Ed Levi, who was this first attorney general after Watergate. He was credited with restoring order to the Justice Department, bringing it back to normal after what happened during Watergate. People said they didn't really know what his political affiliations were. And for Garland to be viewing his job through that lens of what he's doing now, dealing with these two massive investigations and the FBI search, you know, underscores the seriousness of the investigation into Biden.",

But there are real questions about this. Clearly, the Justice Department has real questions about what documents he took. And we don't know what is in these documents. You know, the White House has said they don't even know what it looks like. And it definitely is different in terms of the cooperation and what they're saying about it. But it still underscores the fact that he did take classified information. It was unknowingly to him, he says, sitting in his garage, I mean, and these other locations. I mean, it raises real concerns. The other thing I'm hearing and I was talking to John Bolton, Trump's national security adviser, earlier today. He is no fan of the former president anymore. He goes on, openly criticizes him. He thinks this is going to help absolve Trump from being prosecuted in this situation because of what the Justice Department is now facing, this question of how they handle two presidents who took classified information when they left office.

And so, they have cautioned or told them to use caution on this and to make sure it does look like a legitimate investigation. Because the other thing Dick Durbin said earlier is, you know, when he was asked is it going to be reasonable investigation, he referenced Benghazi, essentially implying no that it won't.

It benefited her politically to the point that was just made. She ended up becoming, you know, a senior leader in the Republican Party. But at the same time, this is someone who I think -- at the same time that she is transitioning herself, she's also trying to transition the party.

I can't help but wonder if she saw George Santos as this young man of color who was gay, openly gay, who was, you know, a potential new face for the Republican Party which may have blinder. This is someone, Elise Stefanik, who's done a lot of advocacy for bringing and broadening the scope of the Republican Party, trying to get more women elected in the party for example.
