But the polls show it not just in Wisconsin, also in Michigan. In Wisconsin tonight, in our poll, Harris is up six points, 51 to 45, margin of error five, but still a six-point margin there. In Michigan, Harris is also leading Trump. That if five zero point margin 48, 43. Now, obviously, those were very good for Harris. And if that's the world we're looking at, it could be very significant. It's still though can all come down to Pennsylvania, and in that state, our poll has the two candidates tied, Harris and Trump tied at 48. It is considered to be a must-win state certainly for Trump, probably for Harris. They know it. Trump already stoking fears of voter fraud in the state, today posting on social media: Pennsylvania's cheating and getting caught at large scale levels, rarely seen before. Now, of course, there is no evidence to support that. There's just been no evidence of any large-scale cheating, and they have been looking into allegation after allegation after allegation, there are investigations in two counties of potential issues with voter registration applications. One county saying they're looking at 2,500 registration forms. Pennsylvania Republican secretary of state told me he looked into that and they're getting to the bottom of it and they know exactly the extent of it. There's nothing more there, and he said this today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) AL SCHMIDT (R), PENNSYLVANIA SECRETARY OF STATE: There is no evidence of anything indicating any sort of widespread voter fraud or if at all.

It's also a concert.This is a get out, the vote rally, but the Harris campaign is more focused on the people who are not in this room and here's why: Wisconsin has until Sunday to cast early ballots. There's some concern from Democrats that some of their levels from four years ago have not been reached even though 1 million voters here, more than 1 million have already cast their ballots. But this is a get out the vote rally in deep-blue Dane County. That, of course, is home to Madison, home to the University of Wisconsin at Madison. And Harris is trying to run up her margins in these areas where she knows she needs them for all the controversy over the garbage comments for all the back-and-forth over what president Biden said, what vice president Harris is responds was. The reality is most voters we talked to you here or not following that. This is a base of election at this point to a large degree. So the Harris campaign is trying to execute on their ground game, trying to get out their voters and particularly focusing on voters. Here in the blue areas, but also in the suburbs around the state. This is something that the were closing message and I'm told she will be trying to extend that rant, saying she will be the president for all people, whether they voted for her or not he will need many votes here and Wisconsin.

Do you think that that is a problem this year at all? ANDERSON: I think it is a possibility. I don't think it is definite, but it's the case that every time Donald Trump has been on the ballot, polls have underestimated his vote share in part because he's really good at turning out unlikely voters and polls are really good at capturing likely voters. At the same time, pollsters really want to get it right. There's nothing you want more than to be the pollster that nailed the election and says, ha, ha, I saw it coming. And so pollsters have done everything they can to try to solve for this problem. But in the 2022 midterms, of course, to the extent there was polling here, it ran in the other direction. Now, Donald Trump wasn't on the ballot, and that's the thing that makes me a little bit nervous about the polls this time around, they could be missing those unlikely Trump voters again.",

Look, millennials and Gen Z are now the biggest voting bloc in America, but they've also been the most, the most, the least likely voters.
