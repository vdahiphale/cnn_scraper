A closer look at what's happening on the ground there. Also, furious parents in Iran demand answers from the government over the suspected poisoning of school girls across the country in recent months.Our Chief International Investigator Correspondent with us with the latest developments and to an alarming scene in the air. Smoke fills the cabin of the Southwest plane after collides with birds more on that coming up. While the intense battle for the small town of Bakhmut in Eastern Ukraine rages on as the evacuation residents there slows to a trickle. Analysts tell CNN that Russian troops continue to make gradual gains as they attempt to encircle the area. As you can see, Russian forces now have the city surrounded on three sides. And one Russian Reporter claims that some Ukrainian troops have begun withdrawing from the battered city, but for now the fighting continues. A City Officials tell CNN the Ukrainian Military has put in a temporary grid to replace the key supply line, the Russians destroyed last week. Melissa Bell joins us in Kyiv with the latest. Its difficult getting the information, but the Russians, the Ukrainians rather still appear to have a supply route in from the west.",

That was certainly what was happening towards the end of last week. But they're keeping according to one military commander of at least one of the major highways in and out and therefore their ability to resupply their troops and the important signal that they're sending. I mean, we've just been hearing from the American Defense Secretary Austin Lloyd, who's been speaking from Amman, Jordan to this, Max and saying that it would not be any significant strategic sign of a full back for the Ukrainians should they retreat west. This would not be a sign that the tide had turned in favor of Russian troops after the last many months of Ukrainian gains on the field rather than losses. This would be a symbolic defeat, he explained, but to the Ukrainians as you can see by the amount of men and resources that they've put into this, the amount of Ukrainian blood that's been spilled already. It is an important symbolic hold for them how much longer they can do so of course, no one can tell but they are determined for the time being to stay even as the plight of the civilians of course, continues to worsen. You're talking about more than 4000 civilians at the moment trapped in there. They're only managing, Max to get 5 to 10 hours a day, because of the severity of the ferocity of the fighting. They have no water, no electricity, it's pretty chilly and they're living on Woodward reserves. They've managed to stockpile since before the last major shipment of humanitarian aid, aid got in and that was about three weeks ago, Max.",

      "sentences": "Yes, certainly, Max and look, it is pretty rare. Russian Military Officials certainly the top of Russian Military Officials, like the Ministry of Defense have visited Russian held territory inside of Ukraine pretty sparingly since the outset of the war. So this was a rare visit for sure.It's not entirely clear when exactly this visit took place, or if Sergei Shoigu the Minister may actually still be inside of Ukrainian territory, Russian Ukrainian territory, but you can see in the video that he's visiting there in Mariupol, a medical facility a newly rebuilt medical facility there inside of Mariupol. You also see him arrived by helicopter at the airport. Mariupol was once really the epicenter of the fighting in this war the Russians. I took it after really painstaking battles for months and months. It has since become a hub for the Russian Military. Though there's no danger there's not. There is still plenty of danger there. The Ukrainians have claimed to successfully hit Russian Military positions in the town ammunition depots, things like that. There was also a second video released this one you see here where Shoigu is presenting metals to a small group of Russian soldiers. And in the video, you can hear him say that these medals are richly deserved, that he hopes that these troops will continue to serve loyally, and he hopes that they will come back alive. Now, this Max, as you mentioned, is perhaps a chance for the Russians to show off the rebuilding of Mariupol. Perhaps also a chance for Shoigu to show himself to the Russian people considering that he's taken plenty of criticism for his handling of the war. And one of his chief critics has actually been the Head of the Wagner private military company. Yevgeny Prigozhin who actually just a few weeks ago accused Shoigu of high treason for failing to equip Wagner with enough ammunition to get the job done on the front lines.",
