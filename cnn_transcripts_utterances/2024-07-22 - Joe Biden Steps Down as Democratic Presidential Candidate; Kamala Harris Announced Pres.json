But, you know, I think he ultimately looked at the -- the lay of the land and said, I accept that I can't win. And I think, actually, the fact that he didn't want to make the decision, in some ways, means he should get more credit for it, that he put country ahead of self, that he said, I'm not the best standard bearer to -- to defeat somebody who I think poses an existential threat to our country. And so, I'm going to do something I don't want to do, and I'm going to step aside. And there aren't that many moments, at least in modern political history, where a candidate, you know, a political figure says, I am -- I don't believe that I am the solution. That's a really rare -- that is a really rare thing. And so, I just, you know, as somebody who worked for him for a long time, cares about him personally, knows how hard this decision is and also just how hard the last three-and-a-half weeks have been. I mean, this is somebody who, you know, as Alex was saying, has been a loyal Democrat his entire life and has had to watch, as you know, a lot of people that he's worked very closely with have been very critical in a really, sometimes personally humiliating way over the last three-and- a-half weeks.

So, I think we should just stipulate that at the top. You know, I do think she has done a really good job in this last 24 hours of showing that she is. You know, reaching out, that she's, you know, trying to earn support, that she's not sort of sitting back and saying, well, you know, it has to be me. And so therefore, it will be.
