But one of Trump's staunchest allies, former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, didn't just help spread those conspiracies, he turned them into profit.

CNN political correspondent Sara Murray has details on new efforts by the RNC that's sparking concern about actions taken at the polls. But first, let's start with CNN's national security reporter Zach Cohen who helped break the story on Flynn. Zach, how was Flynn able to cement this election denialism into the Republican Party and then also turn a profit?",

And look, that goes into things like the draft executive orders that you may remember. Flynn was instrumental in putting those documents together and ultimately presenting them to Donald Trump.But look, even despite admitting this under oath, being forced to admit this under oath, Flynn has continued to publicly claim without any evidence that, broadly speaking, that the 2020 election was rigged. Take a listen to an interview he did just a month after admitting this under oath during his deposition. He said something very different in the interview.

A lot of those folks are potentially signing up to be the ones who are observing elections. And so people just don't really know how it's going to go, if there could be, you know, just more misinformation, if there could be more confrontations, that kind of thing. And election workers, the election officials who are in charge of running these elections are really walking a line between doing everything they can to be prepared, to make sure they have safety measures in place in case something does go awry, and also trying to assure people we are doing everything in our power to make sure you can vote safely, vote quickly, vote smoothly.

CBS denies that and last night CBS sent a letter to Trump basically swatting away his threats to sue the network but that's the curious context for this story about Trump's recent appearance on Fox. He visited a barbershop in the Bronx and when he was there Fox camera crews tagged along. I was able to watch a fuller version of the experience, the interaction, via Instagram because one of the attendees filmed it and put it on Instagram. And what I noticed were all of these moments where Trump was either lying or exaggerating or rambling or going off script and Fox cut those out of the broadcast. Here's an example. Here's a clip that Fox actually did air. Notice how he seems to answer the question from the attendee right away. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
