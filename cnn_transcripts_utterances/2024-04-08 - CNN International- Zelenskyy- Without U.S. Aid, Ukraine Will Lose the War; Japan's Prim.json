Zelenskyy's warning comes as House Speaker Mike Johnson faces mounting pressure to decide whether to move forward with an aid bill.Joining me now from Vienna is Franz-Stefan Gady, an Associate Fellow of the International Institute for Strategic Studies. I mean, it was very clear language, wasn't it, from President Zelenskyy? But it's the sort of argument that's been made in Washington for some time for all of those who feel that Ukraine needs that money from the U.S. FRANZ-STEFAN GADY, ASSOCIATE FELLOW, INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR STRATEGIC STUDIES: Well, I think it's fair to assume that we are currently in a transitional phase when it comes to the war in Ukraine. Russia is conducting probing attacks along the front line. It is trying to advance where it can. And it is preparing what seems to be a future offensive down the road. And this is, of course, very, very worrying because Ukraine currently is also already losing territory, men. And the biggest handicap that Ukraine currently has in its war against Russia is manpower. It is, of course, related to ammunition, but it's not exclusively the lack of Western support. I do want to emphasize this here.",

I think overall, yes, it is true that there are certain negative trends that are ongoing in 2024 for Ukraine.But I also think at the same time, this war is far from over or, you know, far from lost for Ukraine. The major issue here is manpower, ammunition, and Ukraine needs both in order to at least hold on to what they are currently, you know, holding on along the front line. And so I think what we need to or should perhaps expect down the road is some tactical withdrawals, some Russian advances along parts of the front line, perhaps even down the road, a partial collapse of certain sectors of the Ukrainian front line. But this doesn't mean that Ukraine is going to lose this war. It just means that we probably need to be ready for some bad news down the road. But it's not indicative of Ukraine losing the struggle in the long term.",

There are certain weapons systems, certain logistical support, which the European countries simply cannot provide to Ukraine. So U.S. aid remains crucial, particularly when it comes to ammunition, when it comes to other weapons systems, such as infantry fighting vehicles, long-range air defense systems in particular. Because if you've been following the news, the last couple of weeks have seen an uptick in so-called glide bomb attacks, which are really terrible and are really causing a lot of havoc along the front line.And Ukraine desperately needs long-range air defense systems. And the United States is the only country that can really supply those, for example.",

For the moment, there is no substitute for U.S. military aid, unfortunately.I also want to emphasize, though, that we need to decouple the discussion about European, Western, American military aid to Ukraine and the duration of this war, because the Ukrainians would continue to fight even without any Western aid, because they simply have no choice but to resist Russian aggression.",

Ahead of a trip to Washington, Fumio Kishida will be meeting with the U.S. President Joe Biden as he looks to bolster Japan's defenses amid spiraling global tensions in Europe, the Middle East and Asia. He says the world is at an historic turning point. But after decades of pacifism, this move is not without controversy. The Prime Minister spoke with our correspondent in Tokyo, Hanako Montgomery, who is joining us right now. So what did he say? What's he going to get out of this trip?",

Now, during our interview with the Prime Minister, I asked him about his relationship with North Korea, and he told me that he is still seeking a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, despite receiving a lot of mixed messages from the leadership. Now, in the backdrop of all of this and the state visit, of course, is Japan's changing defense posture. Under Kishida's leadership, we've seen Japan agree to boost its defense spending from 1 percent of its GDP to about 2 percent. We've also seen Japan agree to buy Tomahawk cruise missiles made in the United States, the first time that Japan is acquiring counter- strike capabilities in decades. But this will be key to help deter a potential invasion of Japan, according to the Japanese government, as will a very strong U.S.-Japan alliance, which Kishida is aiming to achieve and will work on during his state visit with Biden -- Max.",

Human rights workers say at least one in five people may have been falsely accused. The government pursued a policy of unity and reconciliation, which often sees perpetrators and victims living side by side, as I witnessed when I returned to Rwanda years later.

The new document, called the Dignitas Intifada, will be presented by Cardinal Victor Manuel Fernandez. He's the Pope's doctrinal czar, appointed late last year. It comes after a declaration last year from the Pope authorizing blessings for same-sex couples. Pope Francis has openly tried to make the Catholic Church more accepting of LGBTQ plus individuals, but he remains the vocal minority within the Church, which holds to the belief in traditional gender identity and roles and only recognizes marriage between a man and a woman.CNN Vatican correspondent Christopher Lamb joins me now.

This document, I expect, to reaffirm the Catholic teaching and the Catholic position on these sensitive and contested areas. It points to the Pope's broader approach. The Pope, on the one hand, has tried to do a balancing act between being open to people from the LGBTQ plus community, he's helped and supported trans Catholics at a parish outside of Rome. But on the other hand, he's been very critical of gender ideology. So it's this balancing act that the Pope has tried to do, to be open and pastoral, but also maintain Church teaching and doctrine. So it'll be very interesting to see later how he approaches it, how the Vatican approaches it with this document.",
