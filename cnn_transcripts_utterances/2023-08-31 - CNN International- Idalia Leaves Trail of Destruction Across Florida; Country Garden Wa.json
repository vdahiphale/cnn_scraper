The fire has been put out and authorities are now conducting recovery efforts. A tropical storm, Idalia is now making its way along the U.S. Southeast coast and is currently over North Carolina. The storm caused significant flooding across South Carolina's coastal cities.",

      "sentences": "Late Wednesday, Governor Ron DeSantis delivered some much-needed good news for residents of Florida. He said the Cedar Key Bridge leading to the community of Cedar Key, which was cut off during the storm. That bridge was reopened late Wednesday. That's going to be a crucial development because in the coming hours and days, officials are going to need to get a read on how many people might have been unaccounted for in Cedar Key.That place was isolated. One resident told us the whole area didn't look very much like it used to look and they were really worried about elderly residents in isolated areas not being accounted for. So the opening of the Cedar Key Bridge was a very important development. Also the governor saying that by late Wednesday the number of customers without power had dropped, but they're still frantically working to get hundreds of thousands of people back online. [04:35:00] Not only in Florida but also in Georgia, there were reports of at least two weather related deaths in Florida, two car accidents, not related to each other, involving two men being killed. At least 10 hospitals had to be evacuated during the storm, according to Governor Ron DeSantis. Out of those 10 hospitals in Florida. And had to be evacuated. At least nine of them will probably have gotten back online by late Wednesday night. Here in Leon County -- this is the city of Tallahassee, the capital of Florida. They're still digging out. They're still assessing damage. Still 10s of thousands of customers without power. And look at some of the violence that occurred courtesy of Hurricane Idalia. This is the house on Big Oak Street in Tallahassee and look at it. This is a large pine tree and look, just the force of the storm. And look at the root system here. It uprooted the entire root system of the tree, pop of the tree. And in the process, look at what it did to this fence. It just uprooted the entire fence, slammed across the yard. Broke the other part of the fence over there and then was stretching all the way across the street. Luckily, crews got here and cleared the street of that part of the tree. But again, and also what I should tell you is that in this area in Tallahassee, there's a lot of Spanish Moss and other growth on these trees, which makes them much heavier. You come over here. And you see just how close it came to landing on this house just a few feet from this house. We talked to the homeowners. Everybody there is OK, but they were pretty shaken by this event. In places here like Tallahassee, this is still not a safe area. It's not safe to navigate around here. A lot of downed power lines like that one hanging down right there that you see. And there were several downed power lines down on the street. Again, they're telling people don't try to navigate these streets in a car or on foot because these power lines, some of them could be live. They could kill you if you step on them. Also, people a lot of people on the street running generators to get just to just to function at their homes, a lot of the generator related deaths are often reported in the aftermath of these hurricanes. So just in the process of recovering and navigating your streets or running your generator, you may not be out of danger. Brian Todd, CNN, Tallahassee, Florida. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And they were just picked up and carried into the Gulf. So that was heartbreaking to see.Before I moved here, I used to stay in this very cottage, number one down here. So it was, and it was hard to see. Because they got some new owners here, they knew that that this property floods, but it's just a real trial by fire. And if you look down by the water all along the ocean are their chairs, and microwaves and hair dryers. It's a pretty surreal experience. And when the wind was kicking in the middle of the night and when the water was coming toward us there from all three sides, it looked like a Leviathan trying to reach out of the water to devour us whole.

      "sentences": "Well, it's a good point, Bianca, because clearly, drone warfare, the use of these drones is happening with increasing regularity. And it's increasingly showing it's going to be shaping the conflicts to come.And it's worth mentioning here, that these drones, if they are Ukrainian drones, they are very likely to be homemade, made in Ukraine. Because the agreements that Ukraine has with its Western allies, it gets military equipment, among those drones is that it is not to be used in Russian territory. And so if these are Ukrainian, if they are the ones deploying these with increasing regularity, it is likely they are manufactured in Ukraine, which hints to a domestic manufacturing capability increasing, which could really change where the war is going. And as you pointed out there in that lead in, there is an increasing number of ranges in these drone attacks. This is not just the frontline anymore. This is close to Moscow. This is in the north. This is in the South as well. And I think that really speaks to the sort of intention here as well. To create a sense of angst, a sense of anxiety. Because let's not forget, these drone attacks are not having serious damage as far as we know, there are no casualties, there's no serious damage to buildings as far as we know. But clearly it the intention here is to bring the war back to the Russian people. Make the Russian people feel the impact of this war in the way that the Ukrainian people are clearly feeling it. The same night that the most serious drone attack happened, there was also a drone attack and a missile attack on Kyiv. Two people dead as well, others injured as well. So clearly this is happening at the same time Ukraine is feeling it back home. And we saw yesterday from Ukraine special adviser to the president. He said that this war is increasingly moving to Russia's territory and it cannot be stopped. So although he's not claiming credibility and responsibility for this attack, that is clearly the intention here that Ukraine is telling Russia here that the war is going to be felt on their own front.",

Who had ruled for 14 years and was going for his third term. The military's takeover actually happened soon after the announcement of results that he had won a controversial election. And don't forget, his father ruled for nearly 42 years before him. So the people of Gabon simply had had enough. And they were just saying, it's time to put a stop to these democratic dictators who conduct sham elections and hide under the guise of democracy.
