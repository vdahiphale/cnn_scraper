It comes as the Biden administration marks the second anniversary of the Supreme Court overturning Roe versus Wade with this new campaign ad, putting the blame squarely on Donald Trump for the state of reproductive rights in this country.And this morning we've learned the Biden campaign, as you heard John say, preparing to face two different people, a very disciplined version of Donald Trump on the debate stage perhaps on Thursday. Trump, meanwhile, holding what his team is calling policy discussions with allies. And the Trump campaign has recently taken a step back from questioning the president's cognitive capacities. CNN's Arlette Saenz and Alayna Treene are joining us now to discuss this. Arlette, I'm going to begin with you. What's the Biden campaign doing exactly to prepare for what they're calling a disciplined, potentially Donald Trump on the stage? ARLETTE SAENZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Sara, President Biden remains at Camp David where he has hunkered down for a few days with his senior advisers to prepare for his first in-person showdown with Trump since those 2020 debates. And campaign advisers say that the president is preparing for all scenarios of the different types of Trump that could appear on the debate stage, with one senior adviser saying there's a real possibility there could be a disciplined Trump at - in that Atlanta studio as they prepare to debate on Thursday. Now, Biden is well aware of a lot of Trump's tactics when it comes to debating, having been there in the room with him in 2022 two times with that first debate being quite contentious and chaotic. So, part of the president's focus heading into Thursday is preparing for all of the scenarios. But the Biden campaign is also using today to engage in an all-out push to warn that abortion rights remained under attack in this country. This - today marks the second anniversary of the Supreme Court's ruling in the Dobbs case, which overturned Roe versus Wade. And in a few hours, Vice President Kamala Harris will hit the trail in Maryland, as well as Arizona, to warn of some of the stakes. In an interview that aired this morning, she talked about many of the states that I've placed abortion bans in their state, including some that do not include any exceptions for those survivors of rape and incest. Take a listen to the vice president's warning earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Someone who they would argue couldn't even stand on stage for the 90 minutes allotted for this debate.Now we're seeing them change their tune. And Donald Trump himself really - even himself last week in an - in a podcast interview argued that he thinks that Joe Biden is a worthy debater. We saw several of his vice presidential contenders, including North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum on Sunday argue that perhaps Biden will be up to the challenge. This is all them trying to raise the bar for Joe Biden. The problem with their criticisms of Joe Biden's mental and physical fitness is that it was - they're setting a low bar for him on the debate stage. And so we're kind of seeing them try to change that rhetoric and tell America that this is going to be a worthy fight between the two. Now, I also just want to draw your attention to some comments we heard Donald Trump make over the weekend when he was in Philadelphia for a political rally. He was talking about his anticipated announcement on who was going to be his running mate. Take a listen to what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

However, from my conversations with Donald Trump's team, they're still not completely - or they haven't come to a formal decision yet on who he is going to select as his running mate.What I do know is that he has really narrowed his list of three top contenders. That is Doug Burgum, JD Vance, and Marco Rubio. All people that they believe currently are at the top of his list. But, of course, this is Donald Trump we're talking about. Whenever we try to predict who a candidate will pick for VP, it's always a difficult task. It's even harder with Donald Trump. And again, when I talk to his team, they say he is someone who changes his mind every day based on who he sees on TV, who he speaks with over the phone.

We have this brand new reporting that Donald Trump's team is telling him maybe they should - he should go out and be more disciplined in this debate. Let Joe Biden, President Biden, talk. You buy it? BAKARI SELLERS, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: I do buy it. I do buy it, if that's what Jason Miller, who is a noble advisor, is telling him, as well as Susie (ph). I know that he has a great team around him, which is kind of contrary to what people would imagine being around Donald Trump or in his orbit, but he has a really good campaign team. And I'm sure the advice they're giving him is to be disciplined, stay on message and be brief and then allow Joe Biden to talk. Now, the problem with that is Donald Trump. He is somebody who has never proven to been - be disciplined and does not stay on message. And if I were advising Joe Biden, I would ask him to, at certain points in time, particularly early on within the first 30 minutes, do what you can do to get under Donald Trump's skin. Referred to him as a convicted felon. Make a - make a joke and say, you know, when you went through those 32, 33, I can't recall how many guilty vote - verdicts were there, Mr. Trump? Say things like that to get him riled up, to get him off his game. And I think you'll be able to see Donald Trump unravel easily.

Law enforcement agencies telling state media on Sunday evening that they thought that this was adherence to foreign Islamist terror organizations. We then heard from another Russia member of parliament for Dagestan saying that he thought that the security services of Ukraine and NATO were behind this. Obviously, I think we should take that with a pinch of salt.What we do have now, it's not a claim of responsibility, not even close, but we do have one of the telegram channels used by the Islamic State Khorasan Province, ISIS-K, praising this attack, praising the shootings. But as I said, not claiming responsibility. Significant though because ISIS-K did claim responsibility for that very deadly terror attack back in March at the Crocus City concert hall in Moscow. But we don't know as of yet. We also don't know if authorities have caught or killed all of those responsible. They have said that five militants were killed during the counterterror operation, but efforts are ongoing we think to find more accomplices. What we do know though is that they believed that these were very coordinated, ambitious attacks taking place in these two cities more than 80 or so miles apart. And that clearly there's a pattern in that these houses of worship were specifically targeted, churches, synagogues. All of this coming when Dagestan, which is a predominantly Muslim region, is seeing increased tensions on top of what we've already seen as decades of sporadic violence, Russian efforts to put down a sort of ongoing Islamic insurgency there. All of this has been found by the war in Ukraine. This region has seen a sort of disproportionate level of mobilization. And then more recently by the war in Gaza there's a Jewish population as well in this region, and we did see an anti- Jewish mob storm the airport in Makhachkala back in October. A very scary scenes there as well. So, the fact that synagogues targeted here, raising questions about this interethnic tension on top of obviously the security questions that the Russian state is now going to face. SIDNER: I'm curious how likely it is that Russian citizens start asking question. You had these two terror attacks that you mentioned.
