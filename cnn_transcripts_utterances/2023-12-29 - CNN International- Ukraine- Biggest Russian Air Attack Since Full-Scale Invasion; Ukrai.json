And meet the company that wants to -- want socks to spread joy. The CEO of Happy Socks joins me live. Live from CNN Center, it's Friday, December 29th. I'm Paula Newton, and this is CNN NEWSROOM. Good evening, and we begin with what Ukraine is calling the largest Russian air attack since Moscow's full-scale invasion began. At least 31 people have been killed in a wave of airstrikes. That's according to officials, with dozens more wounded. These are some of the horrifying scenes from Dnipro. As you can see, there were attacks right across the entire country. I mean, just look at that map. As far west as Lviv, which many had considered to be a relative safe haven in this war. Now, Ukraine's president made a surprise visit meantime to the frontlines. That was earlier. He accused Moscow of using nearly every type of weapon available. Now, as blasts shook buildings right in the capital, Kyiv, as you can see there, Ukraine 's foreign minister said, quote, \"These sounds are what Russia really has to say. Only greater firepower can silence Russian terror.\" Now, welcome news then perhaps that the UK has just announced it is sending hundreds of air defense missiles to Kyiv in the wake of these latest attacks. Our International Diplomatic Editor, Nic Robertson, is monitoring all of this from London for us. Nic, good to have you on this story. I mean, we've seen the destruction from those airstrikes. Why are they so significant? And do you believe it will help focus minds in the West? I mean, Zelenskyy was just saying in the last few hours that the West must respond to this attack?",

And there is still growing pressure on international aid agencies to get aid into the Gaza Strip.The amount of aid crossing the border at this current point in time is simply a drop in the bucket in comparison to what is actually needed. But, of course, there is also mounting concern around the security situation facing these aid agencies. The UN's own secretary-general has previously accused Israel of placing massive obstacles in the way of aid agency distributing that much needed aid to civilians in Gaza. And now, of course, we are seeing more worrying developments. The UN's Agency for Palestinian Refugees on Friday reporting that a UN convoy of seven vehicles of (inaudible) were clearly labeled was reportedly fired at by Israeli troops as it made its way from northern Gaza into southern Gaza in route designated by the Israeli military. And no one is said to have been injured, but the UN has reiterated that aid workers should never be a target. The Israeli military, for its part. has said that it is looking into the incident. But, of course, this has raised concern over the security situation and brought into question the security guarantees that aid agencies and UN agencies alike have repeatedly sought from the Israeli military. And, of course, the need to get aid into Gaza is growing more desperate by the day. Just on Friday, we have seen that dramatic video circulating, showing desperate crowds clamoring around eight trucks desperate to grab whatever food aid has made it into the Gaza Strip. And, of course, as we know, the UN has reported some 2.2 million people in Gaza are now facing an acute hunger crisis with the imminent risk of famine. And, of course, we are also seeing a massive displacement crisis inside of Gaza. Some 150,000 people, according to the UN simply have nowhere to go following Israel's evacuation orders targeting central Gaza. We have seen now, of course, the vast majority of Gaza's 2.3 million population now internally displaced, many of them taking shelter around the south. But there are fears that people in the south now could also become a target. We have seen the Israeli military expanding its operations both in the air and on the ground. The Israeli military says it is targeting Hamas and has accused Hamas of embedding itself amongst civilians. But we have seen the targeting of residential areas and, of course, airstrikes near hospitals, near schools, and, of course, near aid centers as well. There are fears for the millions of Palestinians now sheltering in southern Gaza thought to be a safe zone, they will now no longer find any place of safety there. The UN, of course, repeatedly calling for humanitarian ceasefire, but this is something that the Israeli government has outrightly rejected. Nada Bashir, CNN, in London.",

You have these 50 states in the country, right, in the United States of America. And every state, Paula, has a governor and a state legislature. The relevance of that is that states are independent sovereigns. They can make rules, regulations, proceedings. The way Maine does things, right, to your question is that, no, she is the secretary of state, Ms. Bellows. She is not a court. And so, you have the secretary of state being delegated the responsibility by the legislature. Just to be clear, the state legislatures pass laws, governors sign them, they become the laws of the state -- each of the states having their own. And here, what happens is, in Maine, they have a statute, a law that requires the secretary of state to determine the eligibility for office. And in doing so, she wrote, the secretary of state did a 34-page memorandum pretty much enunciating and detailing what she views as his disqualification, his being former President Trump. In doing so, she had to assess what may have disqualified him. And so, there's an amendment. It's Amendment 14, Section 3, which says if you've engaged in insurrection, you are thereby disqualified. So in that opinion, right, to conclude, she concluded, that because he engaged in an insurrection on January 6 -- that is former President Trump -- will be disqualified.

Former Navy Commander Dong Jun will now serve as the face of China's military.Now, unlike many other countries, China's defense minister actually does not have command power and plays an incredibly important role in military diplomacy. To explain it all, we get the latest now from CNN's Marc Stewart. He's live for us in Beijing. And, Marc, good to see you. What does this appointment tell us about China's posture going into 2024, especially at a time when we're still seeing such heated rhetoric about Taiwan? MARC STEWART, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Hi there, Paula, always good to see you. Look, I think the question that you are asking is the right one. I think it's the question that many governments around the world are going to be asking, as well as China's scholars. The bottom line is this, this is not a government that operates with a lot of transparency. Many of Xi Jinping's moves are very opaque and, at times, surprising. But he did have this opening to fill. It's been two months since former Defense Minister Li Shangfu was in office, last seen in public in August, but removed from the job about two months ago. So that certainly had to take place, adding this new position oradding this replacement, that being Dong Jun to the job. Now, as you mentioned, this is not a job that is necessarily based on military strategy, but is very much a diplomatic role. And as you alluded to, there are a lot of diplomatic issues not only Taiwan, but also US-China relations. In fact, as we have seen in just the past week for the first time really, Chinese and American generals actually have been speaking for the first time after a lot of strain between these two nations. So perhaps he is seen as the appropriate figure head to kind of set the tone for those kind of talks. As far as Dong Jun's past, he spent a lot of time with the Chinese Navy, the People's Navy, the PLA Navy, spent a lot of time in the South China Sea, which is a very contentious body of water. So perhaps, he is going to be the right person to guide those talks. I should also point out, Paula, that this all broke late in the afternoon on Friday here in Beijing. We also have learned that nine other military leaders had been removed from their position during a big government meeting that had been taking place. No reason was given, but again, it is adding to this bigger story about this intrigue as to what's happening behind the scenes within the Chinese government.",
