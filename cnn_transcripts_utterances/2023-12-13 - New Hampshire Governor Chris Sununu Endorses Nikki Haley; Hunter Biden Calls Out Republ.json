We expect that process to play out over a matter of several weeks. So, this could be punted into next year, as Hunter Biden defies a subpoena. Now, I also caught up with a number of Republicans on the Senate side of the Capitol, including several of them who have been involved in the Hunter Biden matter, some of them investigating Hunter Biden's alleged ties with his father over his business dealings and the like. And they made clear that they believe that Hunter Biden has a right to make a statement, but they also believe that he should say it under oath. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So we do expect that vote to happen this evening, but actually getting to the point of impeaching the president a completely separate matter. A lot of those vulnerable Republicans, in particular, ones from swing districts, are uncertain about whether or not they will go to that length to impeach the president, making him just the fourth in American history to go down that route. But at the moment, at least the investigation wants to go ahead, as they weigh the next steps with Hunter Biden's defiance of the subpoena as well.",

Now, of course, he's against the Department of Justice and the FBI investigating Donald Trump. He's for the sanctity of the subpoena by the U.S. Congress until he's the one that gets subpoenaed by U.S. Congress. And he also votes against enforcing subpoenas against people like Steve Bannon and against people like Mark Meadows. I mean, this is -- the hypocrisy is mind-numbing. I -- like, I am less concerned with what people's view is on positions and what their idea is on policy as much as I am with, there is just open and blatant and unashamed hypocrisy, where it's all about winning, it's all about power, and truth and justice really has no role in what they're doing. If you have evidence that Joe Biden, not Hunter Biden, but that Joe Biden broke the law, bring it forward, and if it's impeachable, impeach him. You don't have that evidence. So you go on a fishing expedition, and, all of a sudden, you raise the flame of justice in Congress, like you're so concerned with the congressional subpoena, when you are the one that ignored it the whole time.",

You think, if you give the MAGA base a little bit, they're going to kind of lay off you and then you can go on other news channels and look reasonable, like, oh, I'm not sure we need to impeach. No, you are enabling the inevitable impeachment of Joe Biden potentially based on nothing. If you come up with evidence, fine. But, right now, you don't have that evidence.

The big question, one of the big questions for the two of them is going to be how their connection -- and they really do appear to have a connection -- is going to play with voters, when the New Hampshire primary is coming very, very soon. Everybody was vying for Chris Sununu's endorsement. The question, of course, is, how is she going to catch up with the former president, who is still far and away the front-runner here in New Hampshire? In an interview that she did earlier this week with ABC News, she said that she actually believes, even though she doesn't think Donald Trump should be president, she thinks he is fit to be president.
