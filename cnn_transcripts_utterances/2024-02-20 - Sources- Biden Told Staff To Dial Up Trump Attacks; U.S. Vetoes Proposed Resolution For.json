This could have a major impact on people who are struggling to start a family.We're following these major developing stories and many more all coming in right here to CNN NEWS CENTRAL. President Biden is raring for a fight with Donald Trump. CNN has learned that Biden personally directed his staff to do more to call out recent inflammatory Trump comments, not using those words, clearly looking to draw a contrast ahead of a possible 2024 rematch. To help get that message out, Biden has stockpiled a record amount of campaign cash, and he's on his way to get more in California right now to see fundraisers to pad those coffers. Former President Trump, meantime, is also on the trail today. He and his last remaining Republican rival, Nikki Haley, are holding dual events in South Carolina with four more days to go before that state's primary. Haley today vowed to keep fighting well past Saturday. Let's start you off at the White House with CNN's MJ Lee. MJ, walk us through your reporting detailing what Biden is telling aides about wanting to signal to voters that Donald Trump is unhinged.",

What we have learned is that President Biden recently personally instructed some of his top campaign aides to be more aggressive in highlighting some of the more inflammatory comments from former President Donald Trump. What sources told us is that the thrust of Biden's direction to his campaign staff was to significantly ramp up the campaign's efforts to highlight the \"crazy shit that Trump says in public.\"Now, of course, we've been seeing for a while now already the Biden campaign trying to draw that contrast that they say is black and white between President Biden and the former president on everything from the two men's temperament to their world views, to their policies. And we've seen the Biden campaign and the President trying to do that more, I think, in the recent weeks, whether it is repeatedly hitting on Donald Trump for his comments about NATO or going after him for - when he appeared to be mocking Nikki Haley's husband, who's currently abroad serving the country. And when we reached out to the Biden campaign for comment for the story, this is what the director of the rapid response for the campaign said in a comment. They said, \"Donald Trump is the polar opposite of everything President Biden stands for and has accomplished since he took office, and the campaign's top priority over the next nine months will be laying out that stark choice for voters.\" One thing that the Biden campaign, Boris, is concerned about and has been concerned about for a while is this idea that so many voters, according to their vantage point, have sort of forgotten what the first four years of the Trump presidency looked like, and particularly the aspects of the presidency that they found so unacceptable. So this is a strategy that I think we're going to see more on full display going forward. As they say, they are fully preparing to face off against Donald Trump come November.",

And obviously, when you have this kind of money and the funds, that does translate into the resources and the freedom and flexibility to run the kind of campaign that you want to run.And obviously, we are at a moment where the campaign, as I said before, is making that full pivot to the general election. And we're seeing the Biden campaign not take its foot off the gas pedal when it comes to fundraising. The President just left the White House a few hours ago to go on a several day West Coast swing where he is going to be participating in some high dollar fundraisers.

And of course, we have also looked at this math. It is a very difficult path, if there is one at all, for Nikki Haley.Now, part of this was also a level setting conversation she took on Donald Trump, clearly making it apparent that she was not going to back down to the former president, like so many of her Republican colleagues have, saying that she was not afraid of his retribution, take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIKKI HALEY, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Many of the same politicians who now publicly embrace Trump privately dread him.

It is a CBS News poll that shows 65 percent of GOP voters backing Donald Trump, compared to 30 percent when it comes to Nikki Haley. So clearly here, an uphill battle for Donald - for Nikki Haley. But despite that, she is continuing on. And I will note that what we have seen on Donald Trump's end is a far less extensive campaign on the ground in South Carolina, clearly going to how confident they are in that state.",

SANCHEZToday, the future of that country is at a critical crossroads as Ukraine desperately waits for much-needed funding from the United States, its most important ally. We're joined now by Congressman Mike Lawler, a Republican from New York who sits on the Foreign Affairs Committee. Congressman, thank you so much for being with us. I want to get to the legislation that you co-sponsored that was introduced last week. You were part of this bipartisan group, three Republicans, three Democrats. This bill is partly a response to the two failed Senate bills. It sort of is a pared-down version of one of those, pairing changes to border policy with billions in funding for Ukraine and other U.S. partners. Do you have any indication that Speaker Johnson would give this bill a shot on the House floor? What's your plan if he doesn't? REP. MIKE LAWLER (R-NY): Well, look, I think there is broad consensus among members of Congress in both parties about the need to support our allies, no more so than after this weekend when Alexey Navalny was murdered by Vladimir Putin and the Russian government. And so, from my vantage point, when you look at the crisis before us, we are in the most precarious place since World War II. China, Russia and Iran are not our friends. They are not our allies. And they have sought to undermine and destabilize the free world, the United States, and our allies. And it is incumbent upon us as the leader of the free world to support our allies in this moment. It's why, along with Brian Fitzpatrick, Don Bacon, Jared Golden, Ed Case, we introduced this bill to ensure that not only do our allies have the military support that they need and the lethal aid that they need, but that we are addressing the crisis on our southern border. And the Defending Borders, Defending Democracies Act should get an up or down vote. And I hope that Speaker Johnson will bring it to the floor. We are in conversation with leadership about this bill. We need to act and I think the time for partisanship, the time for politics has ended. When you look at the crisis that we're facing, there's plenty of blame that can go around and the White House, frankly, should not be pointing many fingers at anyone. The failure to secure our border squares solely on their shoulders and I think they need to take responsibility for that. When you talk about Ukraine, many of my colleagues have asked serious, substantive questions of the administration for months that have not been answered, which has been part of the delay in actually getting aid and support to Ukraine. So there's plenty of finger pointing that can occur here. But we need to act and that is why I introduced this bill along with my colleagues.",

That policy is obviously controversial. There are human rights groups that say that it leads to kidnappings and violence against these migrants.

There's not a dime in humanitarian aid for Ukraine or Gaza, where as of last month more than 10,000 children had been reportedly killed, kids that you know are not responsible for Hamas' brutal attacks on October 7th.

Israel has a right to defend itself.Obviously, with respect to humanitarian aid, we want to ensure that the people who need it are getting humanitarian aid. But when you see what is happening in Gaza, when you see some of this aid being siphoned off, when you see questions with respect to UNRWA, for instance, I think there are serious questions about how this humanitarian aid is being used. I would also say, as we've seen with the EU, they need to take a responsibility here as well. If they're not going to provide military assistance or lethal aid, then obviously they can help pick up the cost for humanitarian aid. They just passed $50 billion to help do that, and they should continue to do that.",

So this is connected to that ruling. In fact, the Supreme Court decision here cites that ruling. It also cites the Dobbs decision.
