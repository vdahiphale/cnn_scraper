      "sentences": "Hello again, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me this Sunday, I'm Fredricka Whitfield. And we are following tense exchanges across American college campuses over the war in Gaza.Right now, a pair of dueling protests happening at UCLA, the school official says a security barrier was breached. That was intended to separate two groups of protesters. One side calling for an end to the war and for the establishment of a Palestinian state, the other is asking Americans to stand with Israel in the wake of Hamas' attack on October 7th. It is the latest example of nationwide protests that have swept through colleges. Overnight, the University of Southern California said it was temporarily closing campus to everyone except for residents following disruptions and reports of vandalism. And at Arizona State, university officials say a majority of the 72 arrested there for trespassing on Friday were not students. CNN's Camila Bernal is live for us at the UCLA protest where these dueling demonstrations are underway. What is happening?",

So behind here, you see a lot of the Jewish student supporters, and so the problem is when these areas essentially combine and then you have each other just shouting and screaming and pushing, and all it takes is just walking around a few minutes before you see these confrontations and before you start seeing people yelling and screaming at each other.You know, just a few minutes ago, I saw a girl who told me she dropped her Israeli flag, tried to pick it up from the ground and was kicked, so she was bleeding. You know, there are these confrontations that are unfortunately are not safe for that become very violent, and that is part of what the university is trying to address. I spoke to people on both sides of this issue who say they are trying for this to be peaceful, but obviously, it is not necessarily succeeding.

This conversation coming as US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken is headed right now to the Middle East for a new round of meetings aimed at ending the deadlock between Israel and Hamas.

      "sentences": "Well Fredricka, we are learning that the two leaders spoke on multiple issues, including some of the recent events, but also forward-looking on that hostage deal.So for example, the president according to this readout: \"Reaffirmed his ironclad commitment to Israel's security following the successful defense against Iran's unprecedented missile and drone attack earlier this month.\" Recall that that was following Iran's strikes against Israel. Israel struck back and over the course of that time, the White House was quite tight lipped, and so was Israel as they were concerned about any tensions rising in the region. They had not talked since then, so this is the first time the two leaders were able to discuss that. They all also talked about the ongoing hostage talks that includes, for example, a six-week temporary ceasefire in exchange for the release of hostages, but also allowing an opportunity to surge more humanitarian aid into Gaza, which has been in desperate need of it. So that was another topic of conversation, of course, that is one that has been a top priority for this White House and for US officials across government, as you mentioned there, Secretary of State Antony Blinken will be in the region as these talks are ongoing and they try to get this deal finalized, something that has been quite difficult to reach over the last a few months. But they also talked about Rafah, that has been an operation, a potential operation that Israel would carry out in that region and that is where over a million Palestinians are displaced. And for that reason, it has been concerning for the White House because they want to contain civilian casualties in Gaza and they have said before that they don't see an operation there, an Israeli operation into Rafah as tenable. It would be untenable simply because there are so many people who have fled to that region. And in this readout it says: \"The leaders discussed Rafah and the president reiterated his clear position.\" The position being the they don't see that that can be an operation that Israel can carry out without the deaths of multiple civilians, given how many have fled to that region. But of course this also comes after Congress passed that 26 billion in additional funding for Israel, among other priorities, like Ukraine. That was a big moment for the White House which had been pushing for these additional funds since last October, and finally it got across the finish line over the last week and the president signed that and that aid is now being able to be sent to these countries, including Israel. So there were certainly a lot of issues for the two leaders to discuss in their phone call today, but what we will be watching for now is what are the results that we begin to see on the ground as a result of this phone call.",

So, it is no small thing, essentially, for the president to get on the phone with a world leader. So when they do, we can expect that it is coming at an important moment, an inflection point perhaps. So while the readout does not explain why the two were on the phone today on Sunday, we can just by knowing the way that the White House has carried these conversations before and when the president decides to get on the phone with a world leader, that it is coming at an important point and especially knowing that those hostage talks are ongoing, and the Secretary of State is in the region, and that they do want to see a breakthrough on this. You can imagine that all of that would have influenced the timing of this phone call.",

And earlier, he toured the damage in hard-hit Sulphur, right now, more than 60,000 customers are without power across Texas and Oklahoma. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV.

But I mean incredibly busy two days. Look at all of the tornado warnings just in the last 48 hours. In Omaha on Friday, they had their busiest day at their weather service office with 42 warnings issued in a day; yesterday, Norman, Oklahoma did just that, too. Their busiest day with 59 warnings from that office yesterday, just countless warnings that have really just saved some lives. We've got the storms that are really kind of almost stretching border to border. We do have some showers and thunderstorms over hard-hit, Omaha. People there are trying to clean up and now they are dealing with some lightning and some downpours. What we are watching for today is this area here in Eastern Texas. We do have a severe thunderstorm warning there as to the south of Dallas, this area could refuel -- the atmosphere, could regain its strength, refuel, and prompt that next severe risk. This could be our area that we are watching our next tornado watch for additional storms that can blow up and spin. Here is a look at that risk. It is stretched from Des Moines down to Houston, that orange area there, that enhanced risk level three out of five, that's where that bulls-eye for additional tornadoes can be as you go into the afternoon and evening, so something that we will have to watch closely again.",

For me, that is such an important role for universities and colleges around the country.We don't want to suppress that free speech. We don't want to keep people separate from each other. If they are just yelling at each other, I am not sure if that moves the needle, but if folks can actually talk and learn to disagree in a nonviolent way, that for me is hugely important. But if we don't learn that on our college campuses, I don't know when we have a chance to learn that later in life. So for me, it is a complicated time.

The White House has the option of potentially extending that timeframe by 90 days.Now, there are going to be some serious challenges if it tries to take that approach. Of course, ByteDance is indicating that it would not be willing to sell the app. The Chinese government has also said that it would not allow TikTok to be sold without its algorithm, which is really the special sauce that makes TikTok so valuable and so powerful. If TikTok doesn't find a new owner within that timeframe, then app stores would be forced to ban the app in the United States. So that is essentially option two for the platform, and then option three is for the company to file a lawsuit challenging this law in court, which is exactly what the company is indicating it plans to do, although we haven't seen that filing come down the pike just yet.",

There are seven million small businesses using the app, which is another figure that TikTok has touted here.And this is an app that really has so much influence on culture. People have built their livelihoods on this platform. I talked with one creator who is 23 years old, who said that within three months of posting on this platform, starting last year, she was able to support herself and move out of her parents' house. So this is an app that really has a lot of economic influence and potential in this country. I think there are also serious political ramifications from this law. I have talked with creators who said that they think that the passage of this law could potentially impact the way that they plan to vote in November. So serious potential political consequences here as well.",

And so it is unlikely that they would be able to make a bid to buy this platform, but surely you'll see others who are interested -- Fredricka.",
