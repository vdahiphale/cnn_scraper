That's the word on Capitol Hill today as the White House and House Republicans tried to reach a deal to raise America's debt limit. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy saying he feels closer to a deal today than he has before. But not everyone in his party is as optimistic.One top Republican negotiator warning that the deal is still teetering on the brink and could fall apart entirely. Meanwhile, the national deficit continues to soar to new heights. And Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen says there are only eight days remaining to pay America's bills. CNN's Alayna Treene and Priscilla Alvarez are covering all the angles for us. Alayna, you first. Speaker McCarthy sounding pretty confident. But is everyone on board with him?",

He came in to the Capitol this morning and told reporters that he's feeling optimistic and that he's feeling like -- he feels better than he has for several days. Now he thinks progress has been made. And that really, they're just focused on a few remaining sticking points for this deal. Now I am told, according to sources involved in these talks that the goal is to have a deal announced by the end of today.We'll see if they can get there. We have some new reporting as well about really what the outstanding issue -- the issues are. One of them is a provision to impose new work requirements on some social safety net programs. I'm told that they made some progress on that and negotiations last night. Another sticking point is on domestic spending cuts. That's remained a big issue that both sides have tried to work out. And we're going to see today whether they, you know, really close in on that and can find a way to compromise there. And then another issue that they're still working on as well is permitting reform. Garret Graves, he is a Republican congressman and a key negotiator in these talks. It's something that he cares a lot about. And I'm told that that's another thing that they're continuing to work out. So, we're going to see these talks continue. And also, I spoke with Kevin McCarthy this morning, and I was asking you about the timeline for what we should -- when we should expect this deal. He said that he wants to give members 72 hours to review bill tax once the deal is in place. And then potentially vote as soon as Tuesday on a bell. He also said that he thinks he could get the majority of his Republican members behind. Let's listen to what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): I feel closer to an agreement now than I did a long time before. I -- because I see progress. But listen, this is not easy in any shape or form.

But there's also a lot of speculation about whether or not that counter offensive by the Ukrainians could be inching somewhat closer. And I think that video that you were just showing there certainly is something that a lot of people are talking about here in Ukraine.I was talking about internationally as well, because you have what seems to be those Ukrainian soldiers gearing up there for battle saying we need to take back or we will start taking back what is ours. Showcasing some of that Western military equipment that they've gotten including the U.S.-supplied HIMARS, including U.S.-supplied Howitzers, German-supplied main battle tanks. And because that video was posted by Ukraine's top general Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, there are questions about whether or not that counteroffensive might be inching closer. Also, in light of the fact that you have had these strikes. And, you know, one of the things that we need to make clear is that those two places that continue to be hit, Berdiansk and Mariupol are extremely important for the Russian logistics in their war in Ukraine. Both of them have substantial ports, and both of them are substantial staging areas for the Russian military here in Ukraine. There have been the strikes on Berdiansk, long-distance strikes are some who say it could be those Storm Shadow cruise missiles that have been supplied by the Brits that are doing that damage. And today, we're hearing reports about more possible strikes and explosions in the town of Mariupol. That also an extremely important logistics hub for the Russians as well. So, it certainly seems as though still unclear whether that counteroffensive could be in the works, whether these are shaping operations, but certainly seems to be the case that the Russians are under pressure in their rear echelon and those very important logistics hubs for them, Fedricka.",

You, of course, had that raid that took place this past week by those anti- Putin Russian groups that went on to Russian territory and see some of that territory for a little while.The Ukrainian saying that had nothing to do with that. The Russians blaming that on Kyiv. But it certainly just show that the Russians seem to be vulnerable there. And it's certainly also seems to show now that the Russians are having difficulty coming to terms with the situation that they also feel under pressure in that region of Russia as well. You have that shelling today, you had some UAV, some drones that were hovering over that area dropping munitions as well over this past week. So certainly, an uneasy time for the Russians in that area. It could also be a distraction. It could be part of that counter offensive looming. It could be the Ukrainians probing the Russian -- probing the Russian defenses, making the Russians possibly also put more forces into that area. Really unclear. But right now, there seems to be a lot of movement in those frontline areas in those border areas. And certainly, there, like in Mariupol and Berdiansk, not an easy time for the Russians right now and it certainly seems that right now they are really on the backfoot in those areas, Fredricka.",

The memo doesn't give more detail than that. And it's not clear what kind of follow up there was. It's also important to keep in mind that this memo was marked \"priority\" rather than \"immediate,\" which would have been taken much more seriously. Also, by the time it actually gets to the FBI, this is now fifth-hand information. But the bureau was not wrong to be concerned, especially considering, in 1979, Louis Mountbatten was killed when a bomb planted on his fishing boat exploded. And of course, the IRA was keen to target anything associated with the British state. The documents also showed that even more benign protests were followed closely by the FBI, which had informants inside some of the local protest groups. One memo describes an Irish diaspora group, which was planning to distribute free beer at a protest of the state dinner, something they said could have added a dangerous dimension to the events planned. Now, that same memo also makes it clear that the FBI wasn't just worried about the safety of the queen, it was also worried about any potential incidents that could have been embarrassing to the queen or then-President Ronald Reagan.

Yet, despite the demands of the course, an investigation into the entire training course after the death of a SEAL candidate last year found there was improper, inadequate medical oversight, as the candidates are going through this exhausted and often ill. In fact, the investigation, which was released late this week, found there was medical oversight that was poorly organized, poorly integrated and poorly led. This all came about after the death of 24-year-old SEAL candidate, Kyle Mullen, after he had completed \"Hell Week\" in February of last year. He had gotten through the most difficult phase of the course, again, known as \"Hell Week.\" He even had a final medical checkup. He died eight hours after the conclusion of the course because of improper medical oversight. He had been suffering from respiratory difficulties. He had taken oxygen a few times during \"Hell Week.\" None of that information went to those who checked him out for that final medical check. Beyond that, in addition, the personnel who were assigned to check on him in the hours after \"Hell Week\" didn't have the proper training and didn't have the authority or the knowledge to know what to look for or the authority to do anything about it. It was because of that, that a bacterial pneumonia infection he was suffering from wasn't identified and wasn't cared for. In fact, according to the Navy investigation, he was coughing up a red/orange fluid. He was bloated. His skin was turning blue, according to that investigation. And he didn't get the medical care he needed. Following the investigation and following his death, the Navy has revamped some of the medical procedures in this course. During \"Hell Week,\" there are now evaluations every 24 hours, including after the conclusion of \"Hell Week.\" [13:49:59] The recovery facility is now right next to the medical clinic there after \"Hell Week,\" so there's a much closer examination there. And there are more qualified medical staff on hand throughout \"Hell Week\" and beyond. In addition, there is a greater screening for performance-enhancing drugs. The investigation found there was a concern about that. So they've enhanced the efforts there -- Victor and Amara? (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Joining us right now, Nancy Ancrum, the editorial page editor for \"The Miami Herald.\" Nancy, so great to see you. So these are early fundraising numbers. And I wanted to know, is $8 million a lot in the last 24 hours? And if you look at some of the recent reports involving some of his competition, Trump's fundraising, $4.1 million online, within weeks of his announcement, according to an online donation processer, which is often used by the GOP. And then Nikki Haley, she has raised some $11 million over six weeks, according to her campaign. So is this pretty impressive for Ron DeSantis, $8 million in 24 hours? NANCY ANCRUM, EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, \"THE MIAMI HERALD\": Well, a couple of things. That number would have been much higher had they not had the technical difficulties. You have to remember that the first part of his Twitter announcement, which flamed out, there were 600,000 listeners. By the time they returned and had worked out the glitches, there were only 150,000. So I would say that the $8 million is impressive. We also have to remember that he has at least $110,000 stashed from his re-election campaign and from fundraising from earlier this year. So he is sitting on quite a large pot of campaign fuel.",
