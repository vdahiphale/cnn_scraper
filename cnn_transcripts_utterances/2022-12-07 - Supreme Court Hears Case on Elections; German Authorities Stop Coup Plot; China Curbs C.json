The National Republican Senatorial Committee decided not to get involved in those primaries.

But it turns out, weeks later, when the FBI went to Mar-a-Lago, they found hundreds of other pages of classified documents, documents marked as classified. So, that present -- that has presented a problem for the former president and his legal team, because they know, technically, he's in violation or he was in violation of a grand jury subpoena. So, this idea came up, which is, we want to do additional searches just in case these documents are in one of the other properties. According to a source who talked to Kaitlan Collins, they offered the Justice Department a chance to come in and observe the search at Bedminster. DOJ declined.

For example, the government says that no longer will people need to be required to get negative PCR tests to go into public places like shopping malls, for example. Previously, a lot of cities required people to line up and get tests every 48 hours just to do things like travel on public transport or to go to public places. Asymptomatic COVID cases, people with mild symptoms, and close contacts of COVID cases, are no longer going to be bundled off to government quarantine, where there have been reports of kind of poor accommodations, poor food, poor sanitary conditions. They can now do home quarantine. And another big change is the lifting of restrictions on travel between regions and provinces. So, I spoke with a friend in Shanghai and told her about this for the first time. And she said: \"This is wonderful. I can go travel to see my parents, who I haven't seen in another province in months now.\" There is a flip side to some of this excitement, and that is that the Chinese government has been warning about the fears, the dangers of COVID for years now. And now, suddenly, the narrative is changing. And it's saying, hey, this new variant is milder, you can live with it. There are still prominent fears in the population. There is a run on over-the-counter medicines for fever and respiratory illnesses, for example, at pharmacies. But there are some real threats as well. Epidemiologists are warning that there are large numbers of Chinese that are very vulnerable to COVID. For example, 23 percent of citizens over 80 are completely unvaccinated.
