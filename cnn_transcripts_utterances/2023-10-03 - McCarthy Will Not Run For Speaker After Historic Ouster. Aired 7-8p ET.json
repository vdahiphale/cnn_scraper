I'm Erin Burnett, along with Wolf Blitzer tonight.And welcome to a special edition of OUTFRONT because we are following the breaking news, and a major development at this hour because we are just learning that Kevin McCarthy will not run for speaker of the House again -- will not run. A major decision coming after he made history, the first speaker in American history to lose his job, as just only eight members of his own party sealed his fate. His firing has plunged the House into complete chaos, all work grinding to a halt, the party bewildered and uncertain what to do. No clear successor is in sight at this hour. But we do know that house Republicans, as Wolf and I are sitting here, are behind closed doors in a pivotal meeting, one that is sure to be heated, Wolf, if what we've heard about recent meetings before all of this is any indication of where we are right now.",

That makes his term the third shortest in U.S. history.We have a lot to cover over the next hour. And I want to start with CNN's Manu Raju. He's OUTFRONT live here in Washington. Manu, first of all, tell us more about what McCarthy is now saying to his fellow Republicans.",

He said that the members did not expect that, and the meeting abruptly ended. He said that the speaker wished everybody well. He did not endorse a successor, but indicating that he will not run for the speakership again, really, a fall for the speaker who had planned -- Kevin McCarthy had planned to fight this out. He had indicated that if he were to be ousted from the speakership, as he was today, that he would fight this or potentially go to the floor, be ready to grind it out. He had suggested that. But in recent days, he has not said explicitly, and coming to the realization that there is virtually no path for him to win, as long as those holdouts within his conference decide to vote against him. Democrats are expected to vote for Hakeem Jeffries to be the next speaker. Republicans can only afford to lose four Republicans in order to be re-elected speaker. Eight Republicans today voted against him. The math simply was not there for Kevin McCarthy. We will hear more about his thinking in just a matter of minutes. He will speak to reporters. But this meeting that members were trying to figure out what was next was a very brief one, as the speaker came in, said he is not running. McCarthy came in and said he is not running to become speaker again. And now Republicans have to figure out what's next. They have to get behind a speaker. Otherwise, the House will remain in a state of paralysis. No legislation, the committees can't move forward on their investigations, nothing can happen until this badly divided Republican conference can come behind a consensus candidate. We'll see how quickly that emerges here, Wolf. But a momentous decision during a historic day of Kevin McCarthy being the first-ever speaker pushed out of office by the House, and now saying he will no longer be a candidate for speaker as this party tries to figure out where to go from here, Wolf.",

Manu, thank you very much. As Manu continues to talk to congresspeople walking by in the hall, and we are anticipating a press conference from former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, I'm joined now by Republican Congressman Warren Davidson from Ohio. He agreed to move forward with the vote to oust McCarthy, but then he did vote to keep him as speaker. Congressman, I want to ask you about that decision in a moment given what's happened in just these past few hours. But you just came out of the meeting with the speaker. Were you as stunned as others have described themselves by how abruptly he ended it, announcing that he will not run again? REP. WARREN DAVIDSON (R-OH): No. I expected that if he did not succeed in the motion to vacate, if he came up short of the votes, that that would probably be his reaction to it. I consider Kevin a friend. I'm very thankful. I think he did make a very good faith effort to unite the conference. And I nominated him in January. I voted for him on the floor today. And, as I've said, I will fight alongside Republicans to do anything. But I'm not going to surrender the agenda, you know, go alongside anyone. And, frankly, that's how Kevin went out. He said -- you know, Democrats approached me about cutting a deal. I'm not cutting a deal. I'm not cutting a deal with the far extreme people that just moved this. That was his words or a description of it. And I think he said, look, he went out on his terms. I think his point is the agenda has to be bigger than one person. So, surely, there is somebody in our conference that can unite 218 people and say -- and that's where it goes. It's more important than who the person is. It's what is it that we are committing to work together to accomplish.",

There's a whole kind of sense of loss and grieving. And I think the challenge, part of what I said to colleagues -- I tried to broker a compromise between Matt Gaetz and Kevin McCarthy Sunday and Monday. And unfortunately that didn't work out. Because I really feel like we do risk our agenda, because if there's a deal cut with Democrats, our agenda is gone to the wind. So we have to come together as Republicans.

But that vote wouldn't have happened if you had not also wanted to move forward with the resolution to oust McCarthy.Do you regret that?

Frankly, in the conference rules going into November, December time frame, we had a debate about making it so that the conference could move to vacate, but only with a majority of the conference.

And I think probably the right call, as I sit there and processed it, I was surprised by it.

And my mom only fills her car up once a week at Costco on Wednesdays and then calls me because the price -- she still lives in California. The price of gas is so high. She asks me what I'm going to do about it. But, look... (LAUGHTER) ... I think this job is always harder on your loved ones than you yourself. So they'll be OK. (CROSSTALK)",

      "sentences": "Unequivocally, no.Oh, well, if you want to -- if you want to categorize this, let me -- because people think some big side deal. I did tell -- when we were doing the -- the stopgap measure, there was a concern in there, does it have transferability on money? I believed and my staff believed it did. But what I did say to the White House, if it does not, if you think some way it doesn't do it the way -- I will fix that. I did say that, and I did say I'd do it. Look, I support arming Ukraine. That doesn't mean sending them cash, but arming Ukraine. But I have been on the White House -- even before they sent this supplemental, I said, \"You guys are doing it all wrong by just sending it as a supplemental.\" And I think the president is failing here because he's not telling the American public what is the mission. Now, I have a -- we have a lot of members who are Navy SEALS, who have been in theater, and F-18 pilots, and they're frustrated. They want to support, but they don't want to support an ever-ending war. They want to see what's going on here. And I've really been on the White House, \"You've got to come down and talk to everybody, but you should listen to them and the prospects.\" I'm really concerned, though, long-term, what's happening around looks a lot like the 1930s. A lot of actions that Putin takes is very similar to Hitler. If you -- if you are history buffs, you'll know, Hitler served in the World War I army, right? He hated that his country collapsed. And they signed the Treaty of Versailles. And what did he do? He ran and create a new party and ran in democracy again and again and again until he won. And when he won, what did he do? He took the freedoms away. And then he rebuilt his military. And even though it went against the Treaty of Versailles, the world power said nothing. And then what did he do? He took part of Czechoslovakia. He took Austria. And then he told the entire world, he's going to take the rest of it on a given day. So now the world power could not sit back, so in come Neville Chamberlain. What did happened? Well, Hitler loved it because he was equal now to the world power. But he saw a weakness. Neville Chamberlain made him sign a piece of paper and told us peace for our time. And then he invaded Poland the next year. And World War II began. If you study Putin, Putin didn't serve in the Soviet Union Army, but he served in the KGB. He hated that his country collapsed to the west. He hated it so much when Gorbachev died, he still didn't attend the funeral. What did he do? He rebuilt his military. But he learned something, a military makes you strong. But dependency makes you weak. He rebuilt it by selling his natural gas to Europe. But when his pipeline went through Ukraine, when they change power, he didn't want to pay. So he proposed a new pipeline, Nord Stream 2. Everybody loved it. America, at least, sanctioned it. Merkel said great. But what did he do when we rebuilt his military? Invaded Georgia, took part of the Donbas, took Crimea. And the world powers really didn't say much. But then when he parked 100,000 troops on the border of Ukraine and after he watched Afghanistan collapse, that's going to give us challenges for the next two decades. He got his meeting with the world power. So in comes Biden. And what is Biden do? He lifts the sanctions off Nord Stream 2 but ask nothing for it. Putin misreads that and invade Ukraine, thinking it would collapse in two weeks based upon Afghanistan. But now we have something even worse that's happened in the 1930s. Before Hitler moved, he created an axis of power, right? With Italy and Japan, all countries who want to expand their sphere of influence. Before Putin invaded Afghanistan, what did he do? Create an axis of power with China, North Korea, and Iran, all countries who want to expand their sphere of influence. So what we do here is very important. We can't sit there and just collapse it, because it looked from Afghanistan. We can't just throw money at it. If we provide the weapons to be successful, but why it's so much personal to me, in 20 -- it was in 2014 or 2015, when Putin invaded the first time, I went to Ukraine, and then I came back. And I took a bipartisan group. And we went to the White House. And we sat in the Situation Room with then, the Vice President, who was in charge of Ukraine, Joe Biden. And we advocated let's sell them javelins, so they can stop tanks. So they wouldn't invade. He said no. They said, Europeans would want. I said, well, why don't we sell them to them now and keep them in Poland? Didn't think that was right. And I fear of making the same mistake twice. And sending the wrong messages. But the thing I would tell everybody is, more Americans are dying on the southern border than are dying in Ukraine. Each and every day, a plane of Americans crash from fentanyl. And I don't understand how the White House continues to ignore it. My whole plan, and I've been upfront from the very beginning what I would say, if you want anything on Ukraine, we got to do something with the border. (CROSSTALK)",
