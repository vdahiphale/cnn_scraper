      "sentences": "Welcome to THE LEAD. I'm Jake Tapper.And we start this hour with breaking news. At any moment, we expect President Biden to deliver the first major speech of this campaign year, 2024. He intends to warn the American people of what he says are the dangers of another Trump presidency. The speech comes ahead of tomorrow's somber anniversary. It will be three years since that horrific and deadly insurrection at the U.S. Capitol fueled by then- President Donald Trump's myriad lies about a stolen election that was not actually stolen. The location of today's speech is in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, which is near the historic Revolutionary War site of Valley Forge, Pennsylvania. That's, of course, where Gen. George Washington and his forces survived a brutal winter to train and prepare to fight the British. The British, who, of course, wanted to deny the birth of American democracy. Before his speech, President Biden did lay a wreath at the site's memorial arch, and he did visit the former headquarters of then- General Washington, soon to be President Washington. The location and the words of the nation's first president are expected to be a central part of today's speech by President Biden. Now, for his part, Donald Trump is on his way back to Iowa, where he will conduct two events. He's trying to convince Republicans, in the Hawkeye State, to hand him a commanding victory when they caucus and cast the first ballots, essentially, in the Presidential primary election, in the caucus election. The caucus is in just 10 days, the very first contest of the 2024 presidential election year. We'll have more on that ahead. But we are going to start right now with CNN's Arlette Saenz traveling with the President at the site of President Biden's address in Blue Bell. Arlette, you've gotten some excerpts from President Biden's prepared remarks. What is he expected to say?",

      "sentences": "Well, Jake, President Biden's advisors tell me they really view this speech as a chance for him to lay out the foundational argument of his re-election campaign. The President will warn that a threat to democracy does exist and that former President Donald Trump is a major reason why.They have chosen the anniversary of January 6th to deliver this message because they believe that this is a potent political issue, but also want to make sure that Americans don't forget what had happened on that day three years ago. The President will speak in very stark terms about what transpired as well as what he see as the former president's role in that event being. The President is also expected to draw on the symbolism of Valley Forge, where, as you mentioned, George Washington commanded his troops during a very long winter. The President will borrow from a phrase George Washington used to describe the mission of his team, saying that it was a sacred cause to defend democracy. And the President in these excerpts says, \"Today we are here to answer the most important of questions: Is democracy still America's sacred cause? This isn't rhetorical, academic or hypothetical. Whether democracy is still America's sacred cause is the most urgent question of our time. It is what the 2024 election is all about.\" The Biden campaign has been quite eager to start drawing these contrasts with the former president, and they really believe that issue of democracy, the issue of January 6th, will be a moment of reckoning heading into the 2024 election. Of course, one of the challenges for President Biden is whether they can actually make this sink into the American psyche at a time when there are a host of other issues, including concerns about the economy, at the top of many voters' lists.",

It is there where nine black commissioner - parishioners were shot in a mass shooting back in 2015.That's another opportunity for the President to talk about political violence in a way that he's also talking about here today, ahead of the January 6th anniversary. The Biden team says that they will steadily ramp up the President's travel over the course of the next few months. They haven't outlined exactly how frequently he will be out on the trail, but they do anticipate that both he and Vice President Harris are really starting to pick up that campaign activity now that the 2024 year is getting underway, and as these Republican primary contests are also about to kick off.",

One, as Arlette said, obviously they're going to draw a contrast with Trump, that's where they believe their whole, like, is the key component of a successful Biden election effort in 2024.In talking to senior campaign officials, I will note, Jake, one of the things that surprised me that I heard from them was that they believe in their universe of targeted voters that they think will determine the election, like three-fourths of them in their internal research don't believe Donald Trump is really, like, back on the scene and is likely to be the nominee. So we all pay attention to this and, like, he seems like he is going to be the likely nominee. But for a large swath of their targeted voters, they have not dialed in, in any way to think Donald Trump is really back on the scene. And so part of what he's doing is not only marking this anniversary, dealing with this issue frame around democracy and freedom that will be central to his argument. He's trying to force the contrast before even Donald Trump is clearly the nominee to start reminding these folks, no, no, no, he's really back, and he really has a chance at being back in the Oval Office and we've got to start fortifying against that to his people.",

      "sentences": "I think - well, I think that's some of it, but I actually think at an even, sort of higher level, it's just that voters are not dialed in to politics right now. They're just not. Not - certainly not in the way we are, not in the way most of the CNN audience probably is. Most everyday voters are just not thinking about the presidential election right now.So some of it, I think, is that Trump is not campaigning in a really robust way where he's speaking to a mass audience. But most of it is just - voters are not - they're thinking about their own lives. They're not really thinking about campaigning. So for President Biden and for the Biden campaign, they kind of have two key pieces of this message today. One is the fierce intensity with which President Biden feels this personally. I was somebody who was there with him when he launched his campaign in 2019. He was motivated by what he saw in Charlottesville in 2017. The notion of Trump's stoking political violence is something that he feels really intensely about. And your candidate is always going to be a better candidate when they're talking about something that they're motivated by and that they feel strongly about. And then secondly, this is an argument that does appeal. Certainly appeals to the Democratic base, fires them up, but also appeals to independent voters. I mean, there was a poll, I think, in The Washington Post a couple weeks ago that 80 percent of voters are concerned about political violence in this country. So it is a message that has really broad-based appeal.",

I mean, there are a lot of logistical reasons that we could talk about why he's not - hit a threshold that would trigger a debate.But also it's unfortunate to see somebody who claims to be himself an advocate for democracy using this opportunity to essentially try to tear down the President in order to promote himself. We'll just call it what it is. I think Joe Biden has been very clear about the, the need for us to protect democracy. It's been a core central message for him. He's running, presumably, I guess we'll see what happens in a couple of weeks, but presumably he's running against Donald Trump, who has been somebody who has tried to effectively, violently overturn the outcome of an election. I don't think anybody has been more direct about the need to protect democracy than Joe Biden.

He's going to put people around him that defend him.I mean, this is what happens. He has such low self-esteem that he has to have his cup filled with praise every day.

This is what Donald Trump is promising to do again as president, making it about this campaign, not just reflecting on January 6th, but about the very choice before voters here, and that he's promising to do many of these things again. That's going to be a constant theme throughout. And then I thought it was interesting, Jake, in the contrast, he said, Donald Trump wants all-out war, not the peaceful process of self- government and electing a president. And I was just thinking that moment, and now that's going to force Joe Biden into an all-out war, because that is how Donald Trump plays on terrain here, and we're about to enter this election season. And I think he's right. Donald Trump does prefer all-out war when it comes to this. And I guess my question about the Biden candidacy going forward is, is he going to meet him on that battlefield in every twist and turn of it? Because you can't ignore somebody who's inviting you into an all- out war. And while this is a big thought speech and connects to the fundamental values that Biden believes about the country and is selling to the country, it is going to require that hand-to-hand combat from now through November through a whole host of issues, not just this one.",

He was trying to steal history, that, you know, he's all about revenge and grievance, and what a sick blank, as he called him.And, you know, as you've all said, I mean, you could tell Joe Biden feels this in his bones, and maybe this is the reason he's running again. But I found it to be more personal about Donald Trump than I've ever heard him in the past.",
