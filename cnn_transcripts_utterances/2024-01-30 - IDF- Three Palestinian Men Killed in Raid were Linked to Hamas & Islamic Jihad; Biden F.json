Hamas studying a new proposal for a truce in Gaza but says its position on a complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza has not changed. And new details on the three American service members killed in a drone strike on a U.S. base in Jordan. Well, we start with what the official Palestinian news agency calls an assassination inside a hospital in the occupied West Bank. The video that you are watching now shows undercover Israeli forces infiltrating the hidden center hospital disguised as medical staff and Palestinian civilians, including as women. Israel's far right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir shared this clip on social media congratulating the forces on a quote, impressive operation against what he called terrorists. Well, officials on both sides confirm that the IDF killed three young Palestinian men. Hamas said the men were Jenin Brigades Fighters an Umbrella Group of armed Palestinian factions within the Israel occupied City of Jenin. And that one was a member of Hamas's military wing. Hospital officials there say the men were sleeping at the time of the attack. CNN's Senior International Correspondent Ben Wedeman was inside that very hospital just a few months ago. Ben, what do you make of what we've seen?",

Now, this new framework for a possible truce along with three more hostages and Palestinian prisoners came out of international meetings in Paris this weekend.

These arebroad ideas of what could be implemented and everybody from the Qatari Prime Minister to the U.S. Secretary of State and others have cautioned that there is still a lot to figure out in terms of the details. But broadly speaking, what we have learned this would look like according to a source who is familiar with these discussions is that once implemented, there would be a pause in the fighting initially for around six weeks, and Becky during that time, that is when the remaining civilian hostages would be released by Hamas and the other groups who hold them. There are more than 100 Israeli hostages and other nationalities still being held. But initially, the focus would be on those civilians at the same time, three Palestinian prisoners for every civilian hostage would be released that same three to one ratio that we saw in the first hostage release. And then we would start to see second and third rounds of releases. The IDF soldiers both the men and the women, who would then be exchanged. There would be a longer pause in the fighting. We believe that Hamas would then demand a higher ratio more prisoners are being released in exchange for those soldiers. Israel also looking to get back the bodies of hostages who have been killed, either on October 7th, or since then, during the war during these four months of fighting. But Becky you're absolutely right, the Qatari Prime Minister, the Israelis, the Secretary of State Antony Blinken, they're all talking about progress that was made in Paris. I asked Secretary Blinken about this yesterday, he called it a strong and compelling proposal. He said that there's some real hope going forward. But Becky, so many questions remaining. The biggest sticking point is whether this would mean an end to the war Hamas demanding an end to the war, while Israel is not committing to that. There are also questions about Palestinian government -- governance about security, about aid. But there is in the words of the source who briefed me on this deal, a real sense of optimism. But there's still a lot of work to be done, Becky.",

And let's just be quite clear viewers. You've heard about the parameters of the deal with regard hostages, Palestinian prisoners and a potential ceasefire down the road. These phases also include opening up those borders to ensure that more critical aid and we've been talking about this now for more than 100 days critical aid gets into Gaza for those who need it most. Well, the European Union says it will continue funding the UN agency in Gaza responsible for Palestinian refugees. That is despite serious allegations that some of its staff members took part in those October 7th attacks on Israel. While the EU says that future funding decisions will be made pending an investigation into the allegations. Well, several U.S. states including France, Italy, Germany, Romania and the Netherlands have all temporarily suspended their individual funding to UNWRA as its known and those funding cuts won't just affect refugees in Gaza. Nearly 6 million Palestinian refugees receive support from the UN across Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon that could put a lot more pressure on those countries already facing a number of crises internally. Well, there are new details today about the drone attack that killed three U.S. troops and wounded dozens more in Jordan. Two U.S. officials tell CNN the drone approached the U.S. military outposts around the same time that an American drone was returning to that base causing confusion and a delayed U.S. response. U.S. President Joe Biden blames Iranian-backed militant groups for the attack and he is vowing retaliation. Iran itself denies any involvement.

A number of options on the table, including striking these groups in Iraq and Syria as the U.S. have done before. But one option that is very unlikely at this point is striking inside Iran directly. The U.S. does not want to start a war with Iran and if anything wants to de-escalate tensions in the region. Secretary of State Antony Blinken though he said that the U.S. response is likely to be multileveled common stages and will be sustained over time. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BERTRAND (voice over): A powerful response from President Biden is expected after a drone attack in Jordan killed three U.S. service members and injured dozens more. ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: This is an incredibly volatile time in the Middle East. I would argue that we've not seen a situation as dangerous as the one we're facing now across the region since at least 1973.

That is according to his political party, which is known as PTI. The case was heard in special court established under the Official Secrets Act. Well, the Former Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi also got 10 years. The sentencing comes just over a week before parliamentary elections. PTI is calling the case a sham and says it will challenge the sentences in a higher court. Let's bring in CNN's Sophia Saifi. She joins us from Islamabad in Pakistan.

This is his second conviction in less than a year; he was previously convicted for three years on charges of corruption. Now this specific case had to do with a diplomatic cable, which has -- the jury has said that it is because that he has mishandled the secret cables that Imran Khan and his party has said that this was a cable that was sent to Washington D.C. and that the political and military establishment with Washington had collided had gotten together to get rid of him and ousted him back at April 22. Obviously, that has been rejected by the government and by D.C. by the United States. Now, this is not unexpected. He has been behind bars for quite a while and there have been many cases pending against him. But again, this just seems to be another part of the cycle when it comes to the current scenario here.

But the IMF also says there is a risk from Red Sea shipping attacks. As you can see, these U.S. markets at least are off but not significantly. The European markets up, but not necessarily significantly apart from Madrid -- seems to be doing its own thing today. Europe's economy struggles to maintain any momentum going into 2020 for the content -- the continent narrowly avoiding ending 2023 in recession. Gross domestic product or GDP in the Eurozone stagnated in the final quarter of the year, while Germany's GDP shrank three tenths of 1 percent. That's according to euros that data released earlier on today. Market shrugging it off to a certain extent, sell on the rumor, buy on the fact as it were, I don't think those numbers are necessarily shocking anybody.
