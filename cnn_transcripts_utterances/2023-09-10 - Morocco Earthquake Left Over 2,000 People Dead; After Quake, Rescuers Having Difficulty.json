And of course, it goes back decades. Moscow has long been an arms supplier to Vietnam. And they aren't necessarily surprised that Vietnam would continue looking for weapons from Russia.[04:10:00] They do note that the timing of this report is interesting, they say. That it's coming just as President Biden is heading to Hanoi. But I am told by a senior administration official that as part of the announcements that President Biden will make there, one of them will be these efforts to help Vietnam diversify its arms supplies. Essentially, trying to help it detach from Russia when it comes to purchasing weapons. Of course, President Biden is in the country to really elevate the U.S. relationship with Vietnam. Currently, the U.S. is kind of on the lowest rung of diplomatic relations. They are moving up two steps to the top rung. And it is interesting, the other two countries on that top rung are China and Russia. And President Biden certainly looking to expand American influence in that country, provide an alternative to those countries. Now, we should note, one other thing that the president did while he was here, he did speak on the phone with the U.S. Open champion, Coco Gauff.

And I think the reason why these elections are being taken so seriously by Vladimir Putin and why he commented on the fact that he believes people should have trust in online voting as well is because the Russians are trying to portray that normalcy is heading into Eastern Ukraine. That the people there can now essentially go and vote and have a fairly regular life.I mean, one of the things that we have to keep in mind is that Vladimir Putin started this war. Claiming that there was a genocide going on against the Russians in the eastern part of Ukraine. Back then, it was Donbas, it was Luhansk, and the Donetsk People's Republic that, of course then were recognized by Russia. But he was claiming that there was a genocide going on there, and that these people urgently needed help from the Russian federation. Now, as we know, the war for Russia has not been going as certainly many of their commanders would have planned, even though the Russian government still claims that everything is going according to plan. But the Russians simply had a -- haven't had any real victories on the battlefield for about a year now. And so, one of the things that it seems as though Moscow is trying to portray is, look, the people that we set out to save in the first place are doing better. They're able to vote in these elections. They're getting elected officials. Of course, the Ukrainians are saying, all of this is a complete sham. They say that the people on the ground there are essentially being coerced to vote. The ones that are actually going to the polling stations are being made to go to the polling stations, even though Russian officials claim that this vote is very important and are urging people to come out. So, the Ukrainians are saying that this is not only, as they put it, a violation of their territorial integrity, but that this is also a violation of the rights of the people who are living in those occupied areas. And the Ukrainians are saying many are being coerced to go to the polling stations. Of course, we heard from international organizations also calling these elections a sham. Saying it's a flagrant violation of international law. Again, the Russians, more and more really, and I have to say I've seen this over the past year and a half, since the war started, trying to make it more and more normal to have these eastern parts of Ukraine be part of the Russian Federation, and at least in Russia, treat them as regular parts of the Russian Federation. While at the same time, the Ukrainians are saying, obviously, this is an integral part of Ukraine. Kim.",

That has to work in parallel. Some of those injuries are very serious. A lot of broken bones and head trauma, internal injuries and lacerations, and so on, and some not.

They know where to go. They know what to do and they guide us. And the best investment is helping quickly give them the supplies they need.
