Jurors now on track to start deliberations as soon as tomorrow. Trump taking to Truth Social to air a pretty familiar set of grievances, writing this. \"Can you imagine a President of the United States who got more votes than any sitting president in the history of our country and who is also the Republican nominee for president in the upcoming 2024 election, and leading in all polls against the Democrat nominee Joe Biden, is tomorrow going before a corrupt and conflicted Democrat-appointed acting New York judge to see whether or not he will become a common criminal?\" All right. Well, we've got some fact-checking issues in that statement. But let's bring in criminal defense attorney Lexie Rigdon to talk a little bit more about it. Lexie, good morning. It's wonderful to see you. Can you talk a little bit about what we're going to see today? Trump is also complaining about the fact that the defense team is apparently going to make these closing arguments first. Is that unusual? Does he have a legit complaint there?",

They're reporting on -- and we're still working on this here at CNN -- but they report that the Trump team is really focused on a guy that they call juror number two, who is in financial services and who they have interpreted via body language and some eye contact, and some others things is he might be the person that could potentially mean that Donald Trump is acquitted or that there is a hung jury in this case.As a defense attorney -- I mean, how much time do you spend thinking about that? Like, which person in this box might be my client's savior and so I'm going to -- I mean, do you talk directly to people like that?

And so with jury selection that's essentially what you're doing and that's what they had to do weeks ago is they had to judge a book by its cover and they had to look at people and based on where they're from and what type of news they're consuming and how they get their news. Try to make some type of prediction about where the opinions of these people will lie.And that's no different in terms of looking at this juror and the person's eye contact. But as you'll remember, harkening back to the Alex Murdaugh trial, there was a lot of reporting about one juror who was apparently crying during Alex Murdaugh's testimony, and it ended up turning out that the juror was actually just reaching for a tissue because they might have been blowing their nose. And so, I think it's -- I think it's not necessarily worthy of anyone's time to sort of speculate about anybody's body language or eye contact because you don't know what's going on in that person's head. And then there's the very human peer pressure element of being back in a jury room and have potentially 11 other people saying we want to get out of here. You're wrong. We don't agree with you. He either did do it or he didn't do it. We want to convict him. We want to acquit him. And if there's going to be somebody that hangs this jury it's going to have to be somebody that has some -- hangs it either way, it's going to have to be somebody that has some intestinal fortitude to stand up and disagree with 11 other people.

You've also had the International Court at the Hague threatening to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his defense minister.But from the Israeli point of view, it took the U.N. five months to recognize that there was violence against women perpetrated in the attacks of October 7. The U.N. has just revised downward its estimate of Gaza civilian casualties after finally saying that perhaps the Hamas numbers are overblown. So those kind of announcements from the Israeli point of view -- they say see, the world is against us and they don't understand what happened on October 7. They don't seem to acknowledge that Hamas has vowed daily to commit more October 7ths and that this action is necessary from their perspective to root out Hamas from Rafah. And just today, in Israeli announcements from the IDF, you've got fighting going in all parts -- north, central, and south Gaza. So the fight against Hamas is continuing. And despite that, over the weekend, Hamas, in Rafah, was able to launch up to eight rockets at Tel Aviv -- the first time they've been able to do that in months.

So Egypt got accused of bad faith negotiating there. From the Egyptian point of view, this is just the horse trading that goes back and forth.But we watched either Qatar being on the outs or Israel -- or Egypt being on the outs, depending on what's happening internally within the Israeli government.

Walton was one of the most dominant centers the game of basketball has ever seen, winning two NCAA titles at UCLA and two NBA titles -- one with the Blazers and then one with the Celtics. Unfortunately, injuries derailed his career, but he was still named tothe NBA's top 50 and 75 anniversary teams. Walton was always a joy to meet in person. He greeted everyone with that legendary smile. And I'll never forget how much fun he was when he was calling games and how much he made them to watch. \"Throw it down, big man.\" Such a legendary line. Bill Walton was 71 years old. All right, on the ice last night, the Stars and Oilers -- they played game three of the Western Conference Finals. A great start for Edmonton in this one. They went up 2-0 in the first thanks to this goal from Connor McDavid. But the Stars -- they then scored three goals in a span of three minutes and 33 seconds to take the lead in the second period. And Jason Robertson had himself a night. He hadn't scored in 10 games, but he would complete a hat trick in the third period. The Stars end up winning 5-3 to take a 2-1 series lead.

And yeah, I told -- I told you before, Kasie, sometimes I don't get into these gimmicky boxing matches. I'm into this one. I want to see Tyson versus Paul. I'm just hoping that he's healthy enough to get in the ring and actually fight after what happened over the weekend.",
