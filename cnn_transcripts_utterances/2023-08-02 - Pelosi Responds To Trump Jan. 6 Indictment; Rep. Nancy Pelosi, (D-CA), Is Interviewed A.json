Would they be able to craft a media narrative around this if they did this via Zoom? And it seems what we expect is that Donald Trump is going to do this in person. And that, of course, is because they are going to continue to use this footage, to use these indictments, these arraignments, as fodder for the political campaign.Donald Trump is saying that this is all political, that this is because he is the front runner of a GOP primary, that is because he is likely to run against Joe Biden. And in order to continue that narrative, they want the images out there of him showing up to a courthouse, of him getting arraigned. As we know, even from the first arraignment, they brought their own videographer and then used the images of that in campaign ads. So that's what we expect to see again tomorrow, potentially remarks as well. All of this, again, as they try to spin their own narrative around his third indictment.",

That was the end of -- that was in December of the end of last year, 2022, and we didn't know what we couldn't know, it wasn't our role to know what the Justice Department would do, if anything.

I'm so proud of them, their courage, their bravery, and the courage, really, of all of those who are making the case now.

A, I've had a security concern about China.China had been proliferating weapons of technology for weapons of mass destruction as well as delivery systems for them. They got away with it because the corporate interest in America had so much influence here that we couldn't upset that apple cart while they were blocking trade going in, pirating our intellectual property. So human rights, trade, security in terms of the weapons. Just think of Iran. Do you think that Iran had an indigenous nuclear program? Most of the technology, the scientists, the delivery system that was needed for such a thing came from China. The only thing indigenous to Iran was if they had the intent to use it. But everything else came from elsewhere. And I've visited right across in Bahrain and seen the silkworm boats and ships there, you know, that's a right to arm and to buy weapons and the rest of that. But when it comes to the next step, which is the weapons of mass destruction, we have to show the price that is paid. And I can give you chapter and verse on ring magnets for centrifuge to enrich, and you know, we can have a longer session on this.

Because once you start down that road, once a president, no less, starts down that road of falsely saying and trying to support steps in support of that which result in an incorrect answer to the question of who won, then we're in a lot of trouble. And that is not what the First Amendment protects.It protects the widest range of speech and as I said, it would fully protect, and that there's been no effort to suppress him saying, you know, I really won this election.
