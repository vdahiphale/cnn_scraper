I have covered Romney for more than two decades, he ran for president twice, when he warned Republican voters against making Trump their nominee in 2016, and through his time in the U.S. Senate, his bipartisan work, his historic impeachment votes, January 6. So, as Senator Romney prepares to leave Washington, we wanted to talk to him about all of it, where he thinks his party and the country go from here, what he's proudest of over a long life of public service, what keeps him up at night now. We're going to get into it all on a special edition of CNN's STATE OF THE UNION. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

He won, all right? I would like to revisit that and win, but I didn't get that chance. And so these are the kind of people he wants to run. And he's entitled to that. Now, the Senate has a responsibility to make sure that these people are legitimate, that there's no skeleton that could be an embarrassment to them or the country, and to also determine if they're qualified for the position that they've been nominated to.

But -- but, also, I think it's a fair warning, which is that personality is important. And character, in my view, is actually perhaps the most critical thing we choose in our leaders, whether in a state, in a university, in a church or in a White House. Policy, bad policy, we can live with. The country's overcome bad policy in the past, and it will in the future. Bad character is something we haven't had to live with. And so it's important in our leaders of all kinds that we have people who are honest and virtuous and direct in a way that is not based upon personal interest, but is based instead on the national interest. So that's what I hope we find in the next administration. I'm, as you know, not a supporter of President Trump's. I didn't support him in this election, didn't last time he ran either, largely for matters of character. And I hope we see better in the coming years.",

And so those are, importantly, part of who I am and what I brought to the public sector. And -- and my passion has been to preserve the union, preserve freedom and to help people in our country in doing that. You know, so, for instance, when Benjamin Franklin was reported to say, you know, a republic, if you can keep it, my purpose has been trying to make sure that we keep it and to do the things that would allow us to keep it. And so things I'm proudest of are things that have made it more likely for America to succeed, so things that made our economy work better, when I was a governor, things that made our state work better. When I was at the Olympics, it was making sure that the character of the country was able to be demonstrated to people around the world. And then there are things that actually are more attuned to helping individuals. So, our health care plan that got everybody in the state of Massachusetts insured, I'm very proud of that. Our education policies. I mean, Massachusetts ranks number one in the nation in K-12 education. That's in part because of policies not just I put in place, but my predecessors did. These are things that I'm extraordinarily proud of. And, in Washington, it was going after some of the challenges we face globally, how we stand up to the China, how we support freedom fighters like those in Ukraine, those in Israel, a lot of different voices and perspectives.

It was weak economically. China is strong, even potentially stronger than us down the road economically. So it's a different kind of threat. And I keep on pushing for us to develop a national strategy to confront China and to get them to be diverted towards a course of collaboration or cooperation or competition, as opposed to warfare eventually.
