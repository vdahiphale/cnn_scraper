They voted, 190 of them, to overturn the martial law and that included 18 lawmakers from the president's own party.And then before dawn this morning, the president backtracked and lifted martial law. It lasted around six hours. So now, what we have is the opposition calling for his resignation. And look where I am right now. It's a protest led by a large labor union. Francois (ph) is going to pan the camera over here. This is in one part of Seoul where you have hundreds of people gathered at a candlelight vigil here, holding signs, demanding the president's resignation. And we've seen another similar protest in front of the national assembly today. I think what's so striking is that amid this political upheaval, the country seems to be functioning as usual. I flew in, landed at the main airport, Incheon Airport. It was functioning normally, no extra kind of security presence on the ground. The streets were busy, the businesses were open. People are certainly talking about this. The stock market here took a dip about 2 percent and then came back up. But, the main opposition parties are drafting up resolution to try to impeach the president, which could be presented as early as tomorrow. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That is an 800-mile railway project which is yet to be finished, that's aiming to facilitate the transfer of critical minerals from interior countries to the ports for exports, exports that could also be heading to the United States.A senior administration official described this strategy as really serving as a playbook for future administrations. What the Biden Administration has tried to do is identify corridors, specific countries where they can launch these projects instead of just spending and dividing all of their money across the entire continent. They are hoping that surge of support, surge of resources can really help these communities and that they can expand on this and perhaps do other types of projects like this. Of course, this is all coming at a time when China has already made significant inroads on the African continent. They have invested hundreds of billions of dollars through their Belt and Road Initiative into infrastructure projects that are -- that's really outpacing the U.S. and leaving the U.S., at this moment, to catch up to their work.

So the other thing to keep in mind today is that he's going to be meeting with Joni Ernst. She is a key Republican voice on the Senate Armed Services Committee. She has been advocating for women to serve in combat. Obviously, Pete Hegseth has made some past comments about how he disagrees with women serving in combat.

Thank you.One of the issues Donald Trump seemed to focus on again and again and again, as well as a number of his supporters on the trail, was his concern that transgender rights were being taken too far. Well, just a short time from now, the U.S. supreme court is set to consider that issue. The justices will hear arguments over a Tennessee law that bans gender affirming care for minors. So in essence, this law would prevent minors from taking drugs that assist in the transition from one sex to another. One of the lawyers arguing against that law today is transgender. This will be the first time in history a transgender lawyer has appeared before the supreme court. Iran's jailed Nobel Laureate, Narges Mohammadi, is being allowed to leave prison for 21 days. Iranian authorities have suspended her prison term for three weeks to allow her to recover from surgery after having an operation to remove part of a bone in her lower right leg after doctors found what they suspect may be cancer. Mohammadi has spent most of the past two decades as an inmate of Tehran's infamous Evin Prison, notorious of course for housing critics of the Iranian regime. CNN has reached out to Iranian officials for comment. Demonstrations in Georgia showing no signs of slowing down, police and pro-European Union protesters continuing to clash in the Capital Tbilisi. The former Soviet Republic has been rocked by demonstrations after the ruling Georgian Dream Party announced it would delay EU membership talks until 2028. Most Georgians support joining the EU, critics are accusing the government of following authoritarian and pro-Russia policies. Here's more now from CNN's Matthew Chance. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN CHIEF GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Another night of mayhem on the streets of Tbilisi. [08:45:00] The capital of the former Soviet Republic of Georgia is now torn between Russia and the West. Protesters here furious, their government seen as increasingly close to the Kremlin is delaying further talks to join the European Union.",

Over in Ukraine, a daily sobering reminder for Georgians of the price of defying Moscow. Georgia suffered a brief war of its own with Russia in 2008, but avoiding this devastation of their Ukrainian neighbors, the conflict that began with a popular uprising known as the Maidan, is what the Georgian ruling party says now justifies its crackdown.",

But if you look at some of the passenger video that I obtained this past weekend, showing that first attempt to try to put her on a Delta flight from Paris to return her back to New York, since she is a U.S. permanent resident, you could see why Delta Airlines would have some, at least hesitation about letting her back onboard where she caused that disturbance on Saturday during that first attempt, even before the plane even pushed back from the gate. So she was escorted off that flight.Three days later, yesterday, she was escorted back onto another Delta flight and that's where Delta Airlines refused to fly her back to New York. Here we are 24 hours later, the third attempt, and by at least one account, we do understand she's in her seat. She's on that plane, still in Paris, scheduled to take off here shortly. It's about an eight-hour flight time, more or less, where that plane will eventually arrive here at New York, JFK. But as you can imagine, some precautions have been taken here. We understand that at least two security officials are with her right now. We understand she is very calm on this flight thus far. So, this is thus far an incident-free experience, though certainly one that's going to be worth monitoring in the coming hours. Erica?",

She'll likely be escorted off the plane once that flight arrives here at New York's JFK, where they will speak to her to try to learn a little bit more about how this happened. The question, will she face criminal charges? That is yet to be decided, so there's that thread. But the bigger -- the bigger implications here are, and you touched on it briefly, the security impact where new information now showing that she bypassed stations that are meant to check a passenger's ID not once, but twice.The first time before that TSA screening where she essentially went around the TSA official that's supposed to check boarding passes, and then she proceeded to be screened, her actual baggage. Then she made her way into the terminal where surveillance video shows her approaching the gate, and then she managed to blend in with a large group of travelers that was boarding that Paris bound flight last Tuesday. And that's how she was able to make it onto the aircraft. It was then, according to passengers, that she was able to hide in the laboratories until she was discovered by flight attendants short of that Paris arrival. So really, I think this is why this story is really gaining so much attention, not only because of the questions that surround exactly how she was able to do this in a post-9/11 world, but also what needs to change not only from TSA, but also from Delta Airlines. Now, the airline, I have to mention, initially did release a statement saying that they are reviewing, investigating, and they're working closely with airport officials as security continues to be a priority for them.",
