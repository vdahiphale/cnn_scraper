I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.We begin the hour with Donald Trump seizing the spotlight at the Republican Convention, while President Biden is grappling with calls to exit the race for the White House. Right now, the president is isolating at his House in Delaware after his COVID diagnosis. Pressure is mounting on him this morning to step aside in favor of another Democratic candidate to face Trump in November. A senior Biden official told me things are looking bleak inside the campaign after reports surfaced that top Democratic lawmakers are leaning on the president to get out of the race. A separate source close to the president told me Biden is -- quote -- \"listening,\" but the source added that the president feels like he is legally the nominee of the party after winning the Democratic primary. Still another top DNC official said it seems more and more like a change could happen on the ticket. Meanwhile, in Milwaukee, the GOP is uniting at the Republican National Convention. Hours from now, the former president will deliver his first public speech since the assassination attempt on Saturday. Trump says he has changed the focus of that speech to one of unity. We will see how that pans out later tonight. And angry Republican senators confronted the head of the Secret Service at the convention. They demanded to know how security failed so miserably at that rally in Pennsylvania. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And at one point in the conversation, the House speaker asked to get Mike Donilon, the president's senior adviser, on the phone to walk through the data. Now, when presented with this reporting, the White House has maintained that President Biden is the nominee and saying that he can win, and the former House speaker's office saying that she has been in California since Friday and they haven't spoken since then. But this is the second known conversation between the two since that June presidential debate that sparked so much concern and anxiety within the Democratic Party. And while some of those calls for him to step aside were on pause after the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump, they have certainly come back and come back in full force, because, just yesterday, also, Representative Adam Schiff calling for the president to drop out of the race. So, certainly, these are all questions and concerns of the president and his campaign are grappling with, one senior Democratic adviser telling CNN that the president is receptive to this and asking questions like, can Kamala win, his vice president? But, still, no decision appears to have been made yet, and certainly a lot of questions before the president and his campaign, including today, as he is behind closed doors trying to recover from COVID.",

He feels he has run a successful administration, and many outside observers agree with him.

I mean, the conventional wisdom was -- and maybe this was part of the reason why the president was reluctant to pass the torch to Kamala Harris during the primary process.

Forget about the national numbers, because we don't care. We don't vote that way through the Electoral College. But the other half suggests that she's not doing any better than Joe Biden. After all, she is tied to the Biden/Harris administration and she will be held accountable for whatever the Republicans are going to use against Joe Biden. So this is what makes it such a difficult decision for Democrats. Jim, there are no good options. There's no obvious solution that solves the basic problem or all of the problems that Democrats are making. They can solve them, but it's going to take some time. It will also take some good luck.

Maybe it's had some effect on him, but if you believe that, at 78, Donald Trump, who has, let's just say, a very strong personality, is going to be transformed by this event or any event, I have got a beautiful Jeffersonian rotunda to sell you cheap.
