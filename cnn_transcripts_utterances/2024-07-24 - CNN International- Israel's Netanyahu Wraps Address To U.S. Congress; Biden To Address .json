Joining me now, Avi Mayer, longtime expert on Israeli political affairs. Avi, good to have you with us today. I wonder, as you listen to the prime ministers speech, he was strident in his defense of Israel, but he made a number of statements which I think you can at a minimum say were not entirely accurate, but you might even say were straight up false. He said that there were practically none when he was describing political -- rather civilian casualties as a result of military action there. He denied any Israeli responsibility for food getting in and out of Gaza. And he characterized all protesters in this country, which is, you know many of the anti-Israel protesters, some of them are Jewish, right? He called all of them supporters of Hamas and useful idiots for Iran. Did he go too far in this speech? AVI MAYER, FORMER EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, THE JERUSALEM POST:  Well, Jim, I think the prime minister hit pretty much all the notes I would've expected him to. As you said, a very robust as strident speech that I think was focused at both un American audience and in Israeli one. I should note that he was referring specifically to the military operation in Rafah when he referred to that low number of casualties, he said they said we couldn't do it, we could evacuate these large numbers of civilians. Israel did in fact do that, which resulted in a comparatively low number of civilian casualties there. He did characterize the protesters on U.S. college campuses and elsewhere as useful idiots. That is not necessarily a description that I would disagree with. But when he talks about the Iranian hand in steering those -- those protests on and offline, he is referring to an assessment made by the director of national intelligence who said Iran is directly involved in funding and directing those protests, perhaps not all of them, but certainly number of them. So, look, I think he certainly engaged in rhetorical license, but I wouldn't say that his points as a whole were entirely off base.",

There were 80 Democratic members of Congress who deliberately were not in the room. Nine senators, the vice president Kamala Harris and President Biden himself has criticized Israel's conduct of the war for not paying sufficient attention to civilian casualties in Gaza.So my question is by -- by closing off any such criticism, which certainly got applause from the Republican side of the chamber, but not from the Democratic side of the chamber, is he throwing his lot in entirely with one party in this country?

Look at the end of the day, he understands that the U.S.-Israel relationship has to remain a bipartisan priority.

I'm also been critical of some of the pro-Palestine protesters, on some of the messages that I feel like there's a missed opportunity right now, historic, once in a generation opportunity to drum up support for true Palestinian independence through the two-state solution, to leverage the international sympathy for the pro-Palestine cause if you will.

So much history for presidential historian like yourself to cover just in the last week and less here we have a president stepping down voluntarily and really the last time we witnessed this was 1968 when LBJ did the same, though earlier in the cycle, a few months earlier. Tell us about this moment in this country, how significant a moment.",

LBJ step to -- decided not to seek nor accept the nomination of his party for another term as president on March 31st, 1968.The difference here, and its a big one, Jim, is that Joe Biden for the first time in history, has become a nominee of his party based on the primary process that went forward and is declining to accept the nomination of his party when the party convenes next month in Chicago. So that's a big difference. We've never seen something like that in history. We've never seen somebody bow out this late in a presidential cycle. So that makes this a very different moment from 1968. And we hear this all the time, this term, Jim, but an unprecedented moment in American history after that determinative performance that was proved disastrous to Biden's reelection efforts. That's another unprecedented moment that we have seen.",

He had just lost in one of the primaries prior, but here you have a president who was wounded, criticized by some in his own party is not being up to the race, or do the job going forward.So what message would you expect to hear from him tonight? What message do you think he needs to deliver to the American people?",
