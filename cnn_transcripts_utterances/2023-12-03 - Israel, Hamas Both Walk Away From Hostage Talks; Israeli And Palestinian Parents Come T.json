And that's going to be very, very painful. Israel has to maintain the pressure on Hamas. Maybe these negotiations happen to begin with only for one reason. That's because Israel ramped up the pressure, the military pressure on Hamas. We'd be able to get these hostages out so far successfully because of that pressure. We have to continue it. And meanwhile, we're witnessing the surreal situations. You know, have just been several of more than 10,000 rockets have been fired at Israel, many of those rockets in Tel Aviv go literally over my house in southern Tel Aviv and we have an Iron Dome just to the east of us.

Well, President -- the former president had a list of several things which included forcing people to buy specific cars, went on a long tangent about electric vehicles. At one point, he talked about the First Amendment and subpoenaing these social media companies.But the main crux of the argument was really about Donald Trump himself, claiming that President Biden is using his administration to come after the former president. This referring to these multiple charges against President -- former President Trump, including his attempts to overturn the 2020 elections. So really trying to flip this narrative, but again, using an argument that we have heard over and over again from the former president. But I will note we are just about six weeks out from those Iowa caucuses. And all polling that we have seen, shows Trump with a very dominant lead when it comes to those caucuses. And when we were here, at this event, there was an earlier speaker who asked the crowd if anyone had ever -- this was our first-time caucusing. And about half the people here raise their hand to say it was, showing that Donald Trump still has a lot of support, but even a lot of new support despite those charges and his ongoing legal problems here in the state of Iowa.

He's now campaigned in every one of the state's counties. And he says it was about more than just drumming up votes. Here he is.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I don't think doing the 99 counties is just about the caucus like yes, obviously we're going to use that to -- to win the caucus, but I think it has significance beyond there.

The problem is this year it's only four teams, and that's why this matters so much. Georgia has been the dominant force in the sport, the two-time defending national champions and winners of 29 straight games but they finally met their match Saturday against Alabama and quarterback Jalen Milroe who has a really compelling story. He was magnificent. Throwing two touchdown passes in the first half alone. They had a 10-point lead in the fourth quarter before Georgia started clawing back.Kendall Milton scoring to cut through just under three minutes to go. But they would never get the ball back. Milroe, all effort, he had been benched at one point in his career, diving for the first down, to seal the 27 to 24 when earlier in the season, this guy was on the bench and after this game, he was in tears with the victory Alabama which was ranked eighth entering the game could actually vote itself into the playoffs and that's because the field of four is voted on by this committee. Just incredible. To the NBA, listen to this, the Mavericks set an NBA record on Saturday, scoring 30 straight points against the Thunder. And they still lost this game Dallas, getting blown out early in the fourth quarter when A.J. Lawson hits a three and then Seth Curry, then Luka Doncic, and Curry with another and then another. Derrick Jones Jr. joining the party as well. And Doncic giving Dallas the lead. So just over six minutes here. the Mavs go from being down 24 to up by six. But after all this effort, eventually they ran out of gas, the Thunder storming right back outscoring Dallas by 15 the rest of the way for the win, just remarkable. Meanwhile, Steph Curry and the warriors were in control all night against the clippers. That is until they weren't. Paul George training a step back three here overstep with 10 seconds to go to give L.A. their first lead of the game as the Clippers miraculously rally from 22 down to win by one. MLS playoffs, FC Cincinnati and Columbus Crew and Ohio Derby with a spot in the final on the line here, 86 minute. The Crew down, their season nearly sunk Diego Rossi finding a life raft here, the Uruguayan forward tying the game at to Columbus, not just surviving. They are absolutely thriving 100 and 50th minute. Cucho Hernandez finding Christian Ramirez with a brilliant header and Ramirez burying the winner Columbus heading to the Cup Final hosting the defending champs L.A. FC next Saturday. What makes us even more special is that just five years ago, Columbus nearly lost the Crew to relocation so now they're one, one away from their second title in four years, an incredible story coming around and they have the spotlight once again.",
