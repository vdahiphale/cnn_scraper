Well, 2 or 3 days later, that became a permanent force across the border.So we seem to be in that sort of window now of special forces already operating. You would expect intelligence doesn't stay useful for very long. That you go across, you get intelligence about where Hezbollah might be. They could move somewhere else the following day. So I think you can expect these limited incursions to follow on within the next couple of days. That's an expectation. It doesn't mean it definitively is going to happen. But I think if you look at the way the IDF has operated, you know, in the past year in Gaza, that's the way they began there, and it would seem likely they have very much the same units there: Golani, the 98th Parachute Division, so they have the same units. You would expect similar tactics.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. And this -- when they do talk, if they do talk, will be their first conversation in more than a month. And, of course, preventing a wider war is something that President Biden says he's been trying to do really for the last year, and there have been moments where it seems like one is on the horizon and only to be scaled back.Now is one where the administration is very much worried about what could happen next. And, certainly, this talk of a limited ground incursion into Lebanon is something that American officials are watching quite closely. And in their conversations with the Israeli government, they have, you know, stressed the need to deescalate the situation along the Israel- Lebanon border to try and prevent this wider war from breaking out. Of course, President Biden, before the strike in Beirut that killed the Hezbollah leader had been trying to negotiate this 21 day ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. He had worked on that with the French on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly last week. And American officials had thought that Israel was on board with that only to have Netanyahu come out the next morning and essentially brush it off. And then, of course, the strike occurred the next day after that. And so you do hear a level of frustration, among American officials at how this is playing out. Certainly, no one inside the White House is shedding any tears for Hassan Nasrallah, but there is a sense of disconnect at the moment between the United States and Israel at how all of this is being carried out. For President Biden, I think, this all sort of demonstrates the limits of his influence in the region, his limits with the Prime Minister, and certainly this has been true in Gaza for the last year as the president tries to work towards a ceasefire and hostage deal there. But you also see it taking place on the border with Lebanon. And President Biden, I think certainly watching that very closely. In those comments that you played earlier, it is clear that the president is trying to lower the temperatures in the region, but how exactly he does that at this moment seems a little bit unclear.",

When you think back to the first debate between Trump and Harris, foreign policy actually took up, to my eyes, a surprising amount of time during that debate, just given it is not always at the forefront of voters' minds. And I think in in those exchanges you did get a sense of how different these candidates would be when it comes to foreign policy, certainly in the Middle East, but also, in Ukraine as well. And I think for the Walz-Harris ticket, the one that will be represented on the stage tomorrow night, there is a struggle to sort of to say how they would handle this situation in a way that would come to some kind of resolution, because it is evident, and it looks like, you know -- actually Biden's speaking right now.

Well, I think for any president, a hurricane like this is a test of executive management skills, and president Biden certainly is aware of that and was aware of the reason why he needed to come out and deliver this kind of speech today to demonstrate to the people on the ground in these places, but also to the country at large that he is on top of it, that his officials are trying to do what everything they can do to get help to the people on the ground there.And you heard him say, when he was asked, if he thought that congress would have to pass additional money, and he said that he thought that they would, but he didn't have a figure yet. And those figures are always some something of a difficult thing to come up with. This is actually, you know, the one of the first big hurricanes of this year. So FEMA hasn't necessarily expended all of its money yet, but nonetheless, president Biden saying there that he thinks that they will need more money, to try and remedy the situation. And it was also interesting because he was asked about former president Trump's visit today to Georgia where he will be, touring some of the storm damaged areas. President Biden said that he was also going to visit some of these areas, but he wanted to wait because of his large entourage that he didn't want it to impact the first responders to impact the emergency recovery efforts. He said he would go later in the week, potentially as early as Wednesday. President Trump is going today, and he was asked whether that was too early, essentially, whether that was a good idea. And he basically said he didn't want to get into that, really trying to separate this from politics. Of course, Trump has been fairly critical already of how the Biden- Harris Administration has been handling the storm 5 weeks before an election. That is almost inevitable. There is a long history of hurricanes and presidential politics, sort of intersecting in the final month before the campaign. And I think that's one of the reasons one of the many reasons president Biden wants to get out today to really demonstrate that he's on top of things. At the end of the day, there's only so much a President can do. Inevitably, there will be people who don't get the help they need, who don't get the help they need from the federal government, but President Biden right now saying that he's doing everything he can to make sure that happens.",

There are other establishments, businesses here that are surrounded not only by mud, but also by debris.And then many things that were carried by the force of the floodwaters like this barrel or container that ended up here in the middle of this gas station where we are. And if you multiply the scene around me times dozens, maybe 100, you begin to get an idea of what Western North Carolina is facing right now. I was also noticing, for example, that this gas pump, when you look at the screen, it has sand inside, which means that the water level was at least this high at one point. And we have been hearing for from state officials who have said that they set up a system by which they bring water and food to here in this community, Asheville. And then because many roads are impassable they need to airlift those supplies to get the people that are in need. Governor Roy Cooper earlier said that there are 19 -- at least 19, search and rescue teams from out of state trying to help in the effort. Add to those teams an additional three teams with the federal government, and you begin to get an idea of the kind of massive operation that is going on right now. Also, the main problem for this community and others here in Western North Carolina is that people have no water or power, and it's making the situation desperate day by day. Another problem is that there are many people who still have no cell phone service, and much less Internet. Those people have been unable to communicate with loved ones in other states.

      "sentences": "Well, you know, Rahel, as is the case with every war that we cover, you see that it is the civilians who bear the brunt of these wars. And here, we're seeing it in so many different ways, so many crises that have been unfolding. You look at the number of people who have been killed in a matter of days.Lebanese authorities say that more than a 1,000 people have been killed, many of them are civilians, women, and children. You've got thousands of others who've been injured and not all just in a matter of days. You also have those who have been forced out of their homes, by these air strikes in the south of the country, in the eastern, Behar region, as well as the southern suburbs of Beirut, this being 1 or used to be one of the most, heavily populated parts of the country. And what we saw on Friday, Rahel, this is when the you have that massive explosions that killed the leader of Hezbollah Hassan Nasrallah and others and the air strikes that continued intense bombardment of the southern suburbs that night. What we saw is this mass exodus of people running for their lives. We were out on the streets, of Beirut at about 3 o'clock in the morning, Friday into Saturday, and we saw so many families, across the central part of the city as well as the western part of the city, people who just carried whatever they could grab and ran out in search of safety. We saw women carrying their sleeping children. I mean, it was unbelievable scenes that we saw, that night. And days later, a lot of these people are still out on the street. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KARADSHEH (voice-over): War has arrived to Beirut, and this is what it's done to so many of its children, exhausted and homeless, they now sleep on the streets and parks like this one. Most here fled the densely populated southern suburbs where Israel's rained down bombs on Hezbollah targets. But like every war, it is the innocent who paid the heaviest price. Abeer's home was hit in one of the strikes. She grabbed her little girl and ran, and they've been out here since. ABEER, DISPLACE LEBANON (via translator): I've never fled my home before, not even in the 2006 war, the single mother says. But now I have a child. The children are terrified. Far from the air strikes, 8 year old Betul (ph) tells us she's very scared. The roof was falling on us, she says. Every time my mom would tell me they're not going to strike, they would. I wish the war would stop. Betul plays with new friends she's made. Children trying to escape a new reality. They're too young to understand. But beneath their playful giggles, trauma and fear so deep, 10 year old Fatima can't hold back her tears. The whole country is being destroyed, she says. Born in Syria, she fled war a baby. Beirut's the only home she's ever known. My dad was killed in Syria, she says. I only have my mom. I'm scared my mother and siblings will also get killed. Syrians, Lebanese, and migrant workers all found themselves with nowhere to turn but this park. Schools now house the displaced, but there are too many in search of shelter, and this all happened so fast. A million people, the government estimates, have been displaced in a matter of days. We found many Lebanese families like this one camped out on the side of the road. For 5 days, they say, there was no room for them at government shelters. Their disabled young girl sleeps in the car. The rest have mattresses outside. No toilets or showers here. They've heard their home is still standing, the women tell us, but their neighborhood is devastated. Our area has been emptied out, Uma Ahmed (ph) says. There's no one left. In the heart of the capital in Martyrs' Square, the remnants of crises past with a poster that reads, Beirut never dies. And here, many more with no roofs over their heads. For how long, no one really knows, but they fear this may only just be the start of a long war. Mfozi (ph) fled barefoot. It was real horror, she says. Airstrikes were all around us. People were collapsing and fainting. She only grabbed her medication and these tissue packs, her livelihood. She sells them for about $0.50. Although he escaped Syria, her home there is gone. Wherever we go, she says, death follows us. It's all just too much. (END VIDEOTAPE) [11:45:00] KARADSHEH: And, Rahel, we're talking about a million people, that's according to the Lebanese government, forced out of their homes within a matter of days. That's nearly 20 percent of Lebanon's population. And just to put that number into perspective, officials that we've spoken to here say back in 2,006 during that 34 day between, war between Israel and Hezbollah, about 600 to 800000 people were displaced. And right now, you are looking at these figures of about a million in a few -- in less than 2 weeks who have really been displaced from their homes. The government is trying its best, trying to set up shelters, but this is just happening so fast. And for a government that doesn't have much resources, it has really been a struggle. And the fear is that, this is only just the beginning. And, you know, with the talk of potential ground incursion, with the potential of this going on for a long time, the fear is that they're going to see these numbers growing even further. According to the Prime Minister, this is the largest number of people who've been internally displaced in this country within Lebanon in the country's history.",

I mean, just seeing some of these videos and the images of the damage it's really hard to put it into words. I mean, this is a lake and there is so much debris just sitting in it from an entire town that just got washed away, Chimney Rock, North Carolina. Just really hard to look at these images.And this is what happens when you get 2 to 3 feet of rain that comes down incredibly quickly and runs down the mountains into the landslides. This is what's left of the tropical showers. Most of them are to the north from, DC up towards Southern Pennsylvania there going into the Virginias. A couple of showers around Charlotte, but that's what's left out of Helene. So the heaviest rain is out of the way, which is some good news. The showers that are left here are pretty light. We do have, some of these rainfall totals that have just been, again, just unprecedented record setting in this area here in the mountains where, you know, from Asheville over towards Boone, we're measuring this rain here over 10 inches. We're talking about feet from Asheville over towards Boone. You see this pink area here. I mean, we're talking in excess of 10 to 15 inches of rain. Just some incredible totals in the mountains. And, again, because of the terrain, that's what causes the problems with the landslides and the very quick destruction. We've had some rain totals approach 30 inches in North Carolina. Mountain Home, 17 inches. Grandfather Mountain, 15 inches. Nearly a foot in Greenville, South Carolina. Asheville as well also got about a foot of rain. So just incredible to see these totals come down in a matter of hours, and that's what causes the destruction. Rivers are still at major and moderate flood stage, not just in the mountains, but downstream as well. This water has to go somewhere, so the rivers will start to rise even close to the coast as we go through the next couple of days. So we'll have to watch for some of that some of that river flooding, again, even in parts of Central and Eastern South Carolina, North Carolina, and Georgia as this water gets displaced and needs to go somewhere. So something to keep in mind as the rivers just continue to just stay pretty aggravated. This is a look at the rain that we can get as we go through the day today. We've got a slight risk of level 2 out of 4 for an additional inch or 2 of rain. So, again, not huge amounts, but they don't really need any. Rahel?",
