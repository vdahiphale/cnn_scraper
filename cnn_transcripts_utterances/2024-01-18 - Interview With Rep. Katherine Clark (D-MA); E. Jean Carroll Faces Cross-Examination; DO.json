A mass shooter attacked the Robb Elementary School in May of 2022. You will remember he was left unchecked for a stunning 77 minutes inside that school. This is despite the arrival of hundreds of law enforcement officers on the scene, 19 children killed, along with two teachers. This new report bluntly calls that police response a failure. CNN's Shimon Prokupecz has been following this story since the very beginning, breaking news on this story again and again. You have a hold of this report, an early look at what it says, thanks to one of the families who shared it with you. And I know you have been close with them throughout this time. What are some of the most important takeaways when you read it? Because you have seen the failures in person and talked to some of the players in all of this as well.",

I had not heard this before in all your reporting.Each and everything that you have reported has been confirmed in this report. But the idea that the children could have been injured by the officers because of the way in which they were treated and taken out is just mind-blowing. What a moment for the families to have to hear that. I just cannot imagine all that they have gone through all of this, with all the loss, and then with this report, seeing their fears confirmed as well. Shimon, thank you and your team for the great work that you have been doing on this story throughout. We really appreciate it -- John.",

It's not even officially released for some time. We are poring through it. What's the science now on mass shootings? And based on what we have now seen from this report, where did they fall short?",

      "sentences": "So, the science in the post-Columbine world on active shooter was immediate action, rapid deployment.It was get on the scene, don't wait for the SWAT team, form a contact team. You, me, two other officers, OK, we're together, we have got a radio, we have got weapons, and push to the shooter, distract, isolate, neutralize. And some of that happened. Many officers showed up with a large array of weapons, long guns, body armor. But this is a command-and-control issue, which is, there were officers there who were willing to go in, but there wasn't that single commander, whether it was the police chief, the schools chief, or the sheriff, who said, I'm giving the orders here and this is what to do, except telling them on multiple occasions, well, wait. Wait, why? Because we think the shooting is stopped in these barricades. They advance towards the door, the shooting starts again, and they retreat without pushing forward again. That's why the DOJ report, which really doesn't tell us anything new, but its value is. It's not from Texas law enforcement. It's not a self-examination. It's an independent look by a disinterested party far away, validates all of Shimon's reporting from the past year-plus about what didn't happen that day. So I think it's going to be of value to the family members. The other problem here is going to be their expectation of accountability, because, while you have failures of leadership here in command-and-control, what you don't have is anything where somebody is going to be facing criminal charges or going to jail. It's confusion. It's delay. You could argue it's incompetence. It can be driven by fear, but none of those are a crime. If you're the sheriff, your consequence is either you get reelected or you don't. The police chief's already gone of the school system, and their accountability is kind of out there, but outside of civil suits, I don't think we're going to see that kind of thing.",

So there may be very little that can do now that can be done to make them feel better.I understand from people who have gone through this report, it says there were 10, at least, stimulus events -- I guess it was over those 77 minutes -- that should have caused law enforcement to go in, but didn't. That's not one missed opportunity. That's a huge pattern.",

That is their opportunity to try to ask her anything that they want to clean up after the defense had their turn asking her questions. Now, the defense spent most of their time focusing on this question of, how was E. Jean Carroll harmed? That's because this trial is not about the assault, but about damages that Carroll may recover from the jury. So they were focusing in on whether or not Carroll was better off since she went public with her allegations that Trump raped her in 2019. And they brought out in her testimony that she currently makes about $100,000 a year from a Substack that she writes, along with royalties from some books. And she said when she was working at \"Elle\" magazine back in 2019, she made about $60,000 a year. Now, at her peak, way back in the '90s, she said she made as much as about $400,000 a year. So they're just trying to get at this question of whether or not she is better off. They also showed her Twitter and saying that her followers went in 2017 from about 10,000 to 20,000 to today about 282,000 followers. And part of this is to try to question that Carroll is better off here. And one of the closing questions from Alina Habba, Trump's attorney, was just that. \"Your reputation in many ways is better,\" she asked Carroll. And Carroll replied: \"No, my status was lowered. I'm partaking in this trial to bring back my old reputation and status back.\" So that is where they ended the session this morning. We will be waiting to see when this break is over whether Carroll's lawyers will question her or if they will move on to call their next witness -- Rahel.",

And what we are hearing from the Senate is that their vote is imminent on the continuing resolution, which is what will be the temporary budget to prevent a shutdown. And I can tell you that House Democrats are ready to play the role that we have had to play since the majority took over. And that is of being the adults in the room, putting the American people first, and preventing a shutdown. It's what we did in the manufactured debt ceiling crisis back in June. We did it in October.

So, this rejection of any kind of bipartisan coming together to meet this need, address this crisis is at odds with exactly why we're sent to Congress, to do the people's work. And national security is at the top of those responsibilities and we have seen this president, the Biden/Harris administration, coming to the table, working in a bipartisan way in the Senate to create solutions, as the president has done around the border since the first day of this presidency. And this rejection before even seeing a deal just speaks to where the House GOP is. They are fighting amongst themselves, and they have forgotten the American people and what they are asking us to do, which is help them, help them lower the costs of health care, help them address gun violence help them secure our borders.

That's where fentanyl comes through. Not a single Republican vote. And we fast-forward to today, where the administration is in discussions about issues around asylum, around setting up the ability to process people in their home countries. They are willing to come together to address this crisis. And what we are seeing are comments from the speaker that, if it is about bipartisanship, they are not interested.
