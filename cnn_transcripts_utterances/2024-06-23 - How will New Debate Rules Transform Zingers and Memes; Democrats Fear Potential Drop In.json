(END VIDEOTAPE) RAJU (on camera):  Good morning and welcome to INSIDE POLITICS SUNDAY. I'm Manu Raju. It is now officially debate week and ahead of Thursday, a day that could change the trajectory of a race that has been deadlocked for months. The two candidates are spending their final days much differently. President Joe Biden has been engaged in intensive preparations behind closed doors at Camp David, huddling with no fewer than 16 advisers and holding 90-minute mock debates. Former President Trump, meanwhile, has spent this past weekend on stage speaking to a Christian audience in D.C. before revving -- revving up his base at a rally in Philadelphia. And that's where we begin this morning, Steve Contorno, who joins me from Philadelphia. So, Steve, you were in the room last night. What did Trump have to say about the debate?",

You know, it's so interesting because for -- you know, we know, we've been watching Trump and everything that he's said over the campaign season. Of course, INSIDE POLITICS viewers have been watching everything that Donald Trump has been saying and the like. But there's so many viewers who are going to tune in on Thursday for the first time really in years, and hearing what Trump has to say. And they may have actually tuned out what Trump has had to say.

For all that's happened in this race, the convictions, a war, other things, it has been remarkably stable. A lot of that is some voters are not engaged or interested. What the Biden campaign is hoping is to kind of shake some of those Democratic voters, get the base back around him by reminding what Donald Trump was like, but also talking about what he has pledged for a potential second term. So one of the interesting things, talking to a variety of Biden advisers, they said, you know, obviously the biggest challenge for a president is defending his own record. Four years ago, it was all about Trump. This year, it's all about Biden. But Biden has been -- the president has been internalizing and studying a lot of what Trump has been saying at the rallies and other things. So he's trying to make this, of course, about Trump. But the reality is now it's about Biden's record. So that is kind of this split screen moment. RAJU:  It will be so interesting because there's no rally crowd here. There's no audience. And what does Trump still try to cater to his base as he does every time and time again, as he did this past weekend, and throwing red meat, going after migrants and saying things like this.

He sort of exists as a meme. People forget what it was like every day with this onslaught of news and him threatening to do all manner of unprecedented things. And the majority of people, I think, who have been paying attention to what he has said at his rallies, are people who really who support him, who are inclined to tune in to that type of thing. So I think that the Biden campaign, if he can be alert and awake and more like the state of the union, Biden that you were referring to, I think the Biden campaign does have an opportunity here.

I think we're in a no clear leader national race that is within the margin of error.And I think that you're seeing in a lot of the critical battleground states, we're talking about margin of error stuff as well. So this is a close contest. And this is what I mean. And what Jeff was talking about, about it's been that way since the beginning. I mean, you go back and look at that same Fox poll back in October, it looks very similar. I mean, it so it is, it has just not responded to all of the crash of news developments yet, partially in -- because of this disengaged factor of voters who really don't like their choices and just aren't signing up to get involved actively and paying attention to what's going on. But also, I just think we are in, I think we forget a lot, this is our first post-COVID election, and I just think that in the American psyche, there was a glitch in the matrix that was COVID, right, that I don't think we've fully solved for yet. And so I just think we're in a new realm. I know it's two candidates that have faced each other before, but it's a totally new environment for the country in which they're doing so. ZELENY:  Not so clear when you go back and watch the debates. The last ones, which I did this week, it's been four years since the two have been in the same room. Think of all that's happened -- the insurrection, the Dobbs decision, the invasion of Ukraine, the war in the Middle East, the felony convictions on and on. So yes, it is the same people as David said, but it's an entirely different script here. So this is not the same debate. Last time, it was largely fought around the coronavirus and the Trump administration's handling of them. Now, it's on the economy, on immigration and the Biden record. I mean -- and so if Trump says, are you better off now than you were four years ago, that's a difficult question to answer, because four years ago, at this moment, you know, when a coronavirus was happening in the summer of 2020, perhaps, but not necessarily in all parts of the Trump term.",

And some of it's -- Trump campaign has been buoyed by fundraising post-conviction 141 million that Biden has. Trump has raised in May, compared to Biden at $85 million. How do you think Trump is going to deal with? I mean, I guess we know how Trump's going to deal with the conviction question come Thursday. He's going to say he was persecuted.

Then afterwards, Obama didn't do as well in that debate. There was a bit of a jump for Romney. Cut it down to about two points. That was significant, although Obama, of course, ultimately won.

So for me, firing up the base is not necessarily the thing you need to do right now. That's what your conventions this summer will be for right now. This is a chance to reintroduce yourself to the type of voter who's trying to decide who they'll vote. And if they even want to bother voting in the first place. These are also lower turnout, folks.

And then the last, the other thing I'll note is, I guess I would challenge your premise that the base is somehow struggling. I mean, every election, that's whether it's '22 or all the specials ballot measures, everything that's happened since the last presidential election has shown a lot of enthusiasm on the -- on the left, you don't have a lot of Democratic crossover voters going to Biden.

And there is this concern among a number of Jewish Democrats that Joe Biden will pay the price for this if only because he will be blamed for what's happening on the left in his own party. But there is a feeling also that maybe, given Donald Trump's less than perfect record in appealing to Jews and talking about how Jews have dual loyalty and things like that, that they will by November come home. Josh Shapiro, the governor of Pennsylvania, big swing state Jewish himself, he said to me, if you go back in the history of the world and look at the leadership of every dictator from pharaoh to Hitler, to Kim Jong-un, qt what point in our history when a dictator has been leading a nation has a minority group done well?
