Well now, the latest outbreak of allegedly politically motivated violence is in New Mexico. A Republican who lost his race for the New Mexico house who tweeted after his defeat that the election was rigged and he vowed to fight it until the day he dies. Now, that person has been arrested on suspicion of orchestrating shootings at the homes of four Democratic-elected leaders. Now, no one was hurt thankfully but homes were damaged.

We'll tell you who it is and what happened, as the Biden administration is now saying that, tonight, it will continue to cooperate fully with the DOJ probe of presidential records. We also have some major developments tonight, a Massachusetts missing mom, Anna Walshe. Her husband is in custody tonight facing now a charge now of murder, murdering his wife, though her body has not been found. And there's no word yet on what the motive could have possibly been. The D.A. says more evidence could be disclosed tomorrow. So, what might we learn? For more on the developing story in New Mexico, though, I want to bring in CNN Senior National Correspondent Kyung Lah, who's live from Albuquerque, and CNN Chief Law Enforcement and Intelligence Analyst John Miller. I'm glad to have you both. This story is so disturbing thinking about what could have been. And we've seen obviously, Kyung, the idea of political grievance more broadly sparking a whole lot of incidents. Now, what's happening there, tell me the very latest, what are we learning about this suspect who is now in custody?",

The police chief here says that the mastermind behind a plot attacking for Democratic officials here in this city is a person who was on the ballot himself, Solomon Pena. He is a -- well, he was a Republican candidate for the state house. And he lost. He didn't lose by a little. He lost by a lot. You could more than double the number of people who voted for him and he still would have lost.But that did not stop his thinking that somehow he magically won his election and he was posting on a social media account that he would not concede, that he supported Trump in 2024, and the people he blamed, according to investigators, and who he targeted with accomplices are four Democratic officials. I want you to take a look at this list. These are four locations. You can see the dates of when these shootings happened. They're spread out over the month. According to law enforcement, this man, Solomon Pena, went and hired people, he sent them text messages, he went and essentially cased these victim's homes. And then he paid accomplices in order to target these people. And as you pointed out, Laura, thankfully, no one was hurt. But investigators say they believe that this all again circles down to election denialism and this person who was on the ballot, Laura.",

One of the bullets went into the home of a child who was sleeping. And you know parts of the ceiling fell down on her bed. And you know, it's, it's extraordinarily frightening.But one question is where does a Navy veteran who is running for the state house, you know, put together a crew of shooters to carry this out? And the answer is, well, his Navy career was pretty unremarkable, his criminal career was pretty impressive. He was part of a smash-and- grab gang. They used trucks to drive into big box stores and steal high-end electronics. So, as we go forward in this investigation, it kind of makes a whole lot more sense where he could put together a crew to steal cars, do shootings and help him wage this war of intimidation.",

But it does mean they will make very clear that while they will not answer questions and they will fully cooperate, they believe have a pretty attractive foil in House Republicans, who have launched two of their own investigations into that manner. Over the course of the last two days, you've seen White House officials really ramp up, kind of go on offense when it comes to attacking House Republicans for investigating this matter, particularly those House Republicans that were not willing to investigate former President Donald Trump's own classified documents investigation that's been underway, trying to kind of coalesce around the idea that this is a political fight to have as well as long as the investigation and the legal battle are underway. While they will not deal with the legal battle, while they will not address the legal battle and they will maintain that they are going to fully cooperate with that ongoing legal matter, when it comes to the politics of this issue, they are saying two things. One, they're very willing to attack Republicans head on when Republicans go after the president, but also they're going to try and maintain some semblance of business as usual. You have not seen the president diverge from his schedule. You've not seen the president move away from any of the issues that he was planning to talk about before all of these issues came to light. Of course, the wildcard here is they don't know necessarily if anything new is going to come out at anytime in the future. That was certainly a problem they faced in that first week here. And officials acknowledge, they don't know if more investigation or more searches will come to part. They also don't know if more documents will come to light.

And one of their recommendations to the school district was equal outcomes for every student without exception. That's their words, not mine.And that included a directive that said, to get to these equal outcomes, it may mean treating students purposely unequally. And so, what we've seen is about over 70 percent of these National Merit accommodations have gone to Asian-American students. And I want to be clear, there are two branches of one investigation. The start of this investigation actually was the admission policy at Thomas Jefferson High School, it's a magnet school. You have to apply. We saw (inaudible) to a new equity base admission standard, which led to close to 20-point drop of enrollment in Asian-American students. And I heard so many complaints from parents that their children, they felt, were being discriminated against. I had one parent say my daughters done everything right since the first grade, but she's being denied her dream of attending Thomas Jefferson High School, not because of anything she's done, but simply who she is. Because she's Korean-American. And I think that goes against all of our belief in our society. We believe in the equality of opportunity. I think that's so important. And for so many of these students, English is not even the primary language spoken at home. And I know as a child of an immigrant, my mother fled Cuba penniless and homeless, education is a doorway to the American dream. It breaks my heart that some of these students haven't gotten this proper recognition. And all of the scholarship of opportunities that possibly comes with it, the National Merit award.",

And the real-world consequences of this as we know of at least one Virginia college that says you get to go to attend our school tuition free, it's a private school, if you are a National Merit commendation recipient. All we require is a certificate.The principal who is in charge of providing that notification to the students, and that's a value close to $100,000, and I could tell you, as somebody have worked all four years of college, how are you going to pay for college is much more scary in many ways than which college you get into. So, the idea that we have by one estimate, close to 800 different scholarships available to those, that are these National Merit award recipients, and they weren't even notified. They didn't even have the chance to apply. I have to tell you, the time with skyrocketing student debt, I think it's pretty noteworthy that these schools, they didn't notify the students.
