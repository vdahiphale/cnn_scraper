We want to begin this hour with the latest now on that breaking news out of Japan. An investigation underway this morning after a Japan Airlines plane collided with a Japanese Coast Guard aircraft on the runway in Tokyo and then burst into flames. Take a look at this video. It shows the moment of impact after the passenger jet landed at the airport. You can see the apparent collision and the Coast Guard plane in a fireball. The Japan Airlines plane on fire as well as it goes down the runway there. Five crew members on the Coast Guard plane were killed. The captain is in critical condition. The crew were preparing to fly to western Japan to try to help with earthquake relief there. Nearly 400 passengers and crew had only 90 seconds to get off that Japan Airlines flight. You can see the smoke inside of the plane. And amazingly here no one, no one on that aircraft was seriously injured. Four people however, were taken to the hospital after they said that they didn't feel well. CNN's Will Ripley has more now.",

Shortly before 6After that tragedy, and all of the hustle and bustle of the holiday weekend come to a close at this very busy airport, Haneda Airport hub, that serves the serves the Japanese capital along with Narita Airport, two major airports in town and now only one operational because Haneda operations had to shut down after this collision and all of the questions that are being raised about how it happened. But the extraordinary part of this story is that everybody who was on that plane, in a matter of seconds, was safely evacuated. Everybody on that passenger plane, including the parents with their young children, even as the black smoke was filling in the cabin, even as passengers said they really thought they were going to die. And they can see the fire spreading. Even as passengers claim that some of the exit doors were not operational and they all had to go out through the exits near the front of the aircraft. They all made it out alive. And then half a dozen people on that coast guard plane, only one of them survived in critical condition right now at the hospital. Will Ripley, CNN, Tokyo.",

But what is more concerning is the fact that it was on the runway, but it wasn't seen by the pilots as they came in to land so they could have done a go around. But there's too many questions right now, John, as there always is, with these near miss incidents and runway incursions. There's always questions about who talked to who and who said what to whom. It just -- it's ridiculous how unorganized these things can be at this point of such a critical juncture of the flight.",

So there could be something going on with the coordination. However, the actual air traffic control on the ground at that airport is singularly controlled. There was one controller who knew what was going on at that point. But as you know, in United States, we've had a lot of these near misses where the communication was wrong. They said, yes, you can land on this runway, they repeat back, say the wrong runway when they repeat back, and the air traffic controller doesn't catch it, because they're busy, they're moving.And there's even some issues about fatigue and duty and rest cycles that the FAA has a special panel looking at right now.

First, let's talk about what went right, all of these people. And I give you a sense of what they saw on this flight. Well, they were on here, all of them were able to get out of the front here.

I was into loose when we did the aircraft certification of the Airbus 380, about how you test these exits, they actually put people in the airplanes, they put them in these scenarios fill the cockpit with smoke, and well with steam at that point for this test, then then they see how quickly they can get the metal out. And so to get certified, they have to prove that they can get all of those people out within five minutes. Now, this was much quicker than that. They had everybody out of there within two and a half minutes or so, which is just incredible.And it's testament to the amount of preparation, the amount of training, training, training, training. That's what we do to make sure that when the -- when these things happen, that the flight crew is ready for any of these events to occur and how to respond to them.

And then just a little bit later, you can see the moment the plane has stopped here. Here they are starting to move around beginning the process. And you can see the smoke as they're trying to get out of the plane. This gets to what you were just talking about there, David, the flight crews have extensive training on how to handle this situation.Now, the exits on the back of the plane, the ones you can look at are here.

The FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force is leading the investigation. Now that's after an SUV slammed into another car and then careened into a crowd outside of New Year's Eve concert. This was outside the Kodak Center in Rochester. After the flames were extinguished, a dozen gas cans were found in and around one of the cars. Let's bring in CNN's Brynn Gingras from New York. So Brynn, we know in the last hour you told us about the suspect, the suspects name. What more can you share with us this hour?",

      "sentences": "Yes, we've just learned from two sources, Rahel, that that driver has since died. He was brought to the hospital with very critical injuries. We've learned that he has since died. His name is Michael Avery, we were told that he is from Syracuse, and was actually staying at a hotel room in Rochester before this whole incident unfolded. Now when we talk about this being passed -- investigated as possible domestic terrorism, it's important to remember that there's a big umbrella that investigators look into basically trying to pinpoint or at least they've maybe have seen evidence of some sort of ideology that makes them think that it rises to that level.We know that the JTTF was called in by Rochester police to help out with this investigation as well as the FBI. So it's still unclear exactly the motives here. But certainly there's something in there that has raised some flags in investigators minds, we understand from sources that investigators in that hotel room found a suicide note of some sort and also some sort of journal. And they've also spoken since this happened early Monday morning with Avery's family members who hinted at the fact that they believe although weren't diagnosed, according to the source, with bipolar disorder. So all of that is sort of part of this investigation as we know it right now. But as you just mentioned, we are waiting for this news conference with at least Rochester police and the mayor to happen any moment now. So hopefully we have more clear direction when that news conference happens. But let's talk about what happened. It was early morning, not even an hour into the new year in Rochester at the Kodak Center where about 1,000 people were attending a concert. And as concert goers were leaving some crossing a crosswalk with police there, this SUV driven allegedly driven by police say Avery plowed into another car that was trying to exit a parking lot area. Two people in that opposing car were killed. And then there were other people that were injured as well. But in addition to that, there was a huge explosion. And investigators learned once they put the flames out that that car had in it about a dozen gas canisters. So all of this coupled together is why this is where we're at with the investigation with the agencies that are involved right now. So two people killed in this very early morning, New Year's Day incident there in Rochester. And we're waiting to find out more possibly if there's some sort of motive to all this from law enforcement when we get that update any moment now.",

However, they are saying they do not believe that this is associated with previous threats made against the Colorado Supreme Court justices. As you remember back in mid-December, the Colorado Supreme Court voted to remove former President Donald Trump from the 2024 presidential ballot. And as a result, they have been receiving threats. Police saying this morning they believe that this is not associated with that incident.Now this particular incident took place overnight. It happened about 1:00, at just after 1:00 this morning. They say a man fired one shot into the building from the outside, then was able to gain access to make his way inside, where he reportedly held an unarmed security guard at gunpoint, then was able to access other floors inside the building firing multiple shots, causing, as you said extensive damage though no one was injured. And then around 3:00 in the morning, police say the suspect called police himself and surrendered and was ultimately arrested. This building is going to be closed for at least today, again, extensive damage throughout, Rahel.",
