Home to over 165 million people, Bangladesh is the country shown on the map. A tech company is looking to bring a technology called iFarmer to farmers in Bangladesh, which provides them with financial resources and advice. The company`s mission is to empower the farmers to yield more from the same amount of land. The catch is that investors in the technology charge the farmers a commission on their output, and that could be seen as taking advantage of those doing the hard labor. We`ll learn more now about the software, which is said to have furthered the livelihood of 17 million farming households. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Agriculture is a vital part of Bangladesh`s economy. Nearly half of the country`s population is employed in the industry, with more than 70% of its land used for farming. However, farming`s contribution to GDP is in decline. 25-year-old corn farmer, Jahidul Islam (ph), says the startup helped him set up a bank account and apply for a loan of around $470. And use soil sensors to give him personalized information about his crops. At the nearby iFarmer Center, Islam can also get advice on farming and purchase seeds, pesticides and fertilizers. iFarmer opened 100 of these centers, which it says supports more than 87,000 farmers using its platform. The startup plans to launch 1000 centers by the end of the year, with the hope of supporting half a million farmers by 2025. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
