There's a lot to learn from different kinds of experience, whether it's experience in the business sector, whether it's experience in a governor's position, United States Senate.

But the fact of the matter is he is a loner, which means he wasn't trying to be by himself, he was a loner by personality. And when that happens, he prefers to operate by himself. And it's not likely that he would have brought in or even wanted to bring somebody in to his plans. So that makes it difficult. But he also made a concerted effort to cover up his searches and to cover up how he was going about planning this crime. It's pretty clear to me that the planning was very enjoyable to him. When you look at a crime and how much effort and time the person puts into the planning or carrying out the act itself, if the effort is in the planning, that's the part that they really enjoyed. And I think for him, that is something that he enjoyed very much. But he wasn't perfect at it. The reason that I say he wasn't perfect, because he engaged in behavior at the rally that drew attention to him from members of the tactical teams. He was not an experienced assassin. He wasn't an experienced strategic SWAT person. So, he sat on picnic tables. He drew attention to himself.

I don't think he was trying to be a loner. I don't think he was trying to be an isolationist. I think his being a loner was so severe that it could have bordered on an undiagnosed mental health issue. I'm not saying out of touch with reality. But he was very comfortable being a loner. So, for him to bring somebody else in to planning an event that he was really enjoying makes absolutely no sense. The only persons he would have brought in are people close to him, and that would have been his family. But I think he clearly opted that this was going to be just an event for himself. We've seen that in other cases. Is it unusual? Yes. But is it likely at the 11th hour this person who's a loner throughout his entire lifetime brings in a buddy? Not going to happen.",
