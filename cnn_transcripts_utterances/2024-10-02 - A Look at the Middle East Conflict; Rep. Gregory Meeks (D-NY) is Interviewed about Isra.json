He is also the Ranking Member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Thank you so much, sir, for being with us this morning. I do want to get your assessment, because you are on that committee, of what is happening in the Middle East. Do you think we have entered into a wider war now? REP. GREGORY MEEKS, (D-NY) RANKING MEMBER, FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE: I'm very concerned. This is what I've been concerned about all along, that we could be entering into a wider war. I think that Iran has made a mistake by shooting the ballistic missiles at Israel, unlike what took place before. And I think that I know that the United States government is still monitoring the situation and collecting information. And, you know, we've got to continue and I hope that Israel and the United States, we've got to work together on this to protect the interests of Israel, to protect the interests of the United States of America. We've got to stand with Israel's right to exist. You know, and for me, you know, it is important because I want to get, you know, 75 years of trying to destroy Israel. I want that to stop. It has to stop. We were moving in the right direction, I thought, with reference to when I looked at Saudi Arabia talking and recognizing Israel's right to exist, and of course Egypt and Jordan and the UAE. That's what I think that people want, and ultimately, to have some kind of resolution that Israel can live side by side with its neighbors. Clearly what Iran, its position has been, and what it did yesterday with shooting the missiles and them continuing to say Israel does not have the right to exist does not lead to that. But I think that working collectively together in the region, the region is different. It used to be where every, whether it was Saudi Arabia or Egypt or Jordan, all were saying that Israel did not have the right to exist. That has changed. And so I don't want to lose sight of that, because ultimately, in the end, I think what we want is peace in the Middle East, peace for the people of Israel, peace for the people in the region. And I think that the region wants that, overwhelmingly with the exception of Iran, and that's why Iran has made a big mistake this time.",

Vance was trying to say here that we need to do better. And if we are going to take this position, we recognize that we need to support women in other ways so that it's best choice.And, frankly, it was a refreshing answer to folks that said - that many people said, this didn't seem as scary as other answers I've heard before. They want to hear that there's more support to women. Does it answer people whose primary, you know, concern is women's rights and abortion? Absolutely not.
