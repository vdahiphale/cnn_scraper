It was considered a critical phone call, still too early though to know if it will change the course of the war. U.S. President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke today, it was the first time since Israeli strikes killed seven aid workers in Gaza. And we've just learned that Mr. Biden called those deaths and the humanitarian situation in Gaza in general, quote, \"unacceptable\". The White House will hold a briefing any moment now, we will take you there live just as soon as it happens. Meantime, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken just spoke moments ago. Listen.

He made clear that U.S. policy with respect to Gaza will be determined by our assessment of Israel's immediate action on these steps. He underscored as well that an immediate ceasefire is essential to stabilize and improve the humanitarian situation and protect innocent civilians. And he urged Prime Minister Netanyahu to empower its negotiators to conclude a deal without delay, to bring the hostages home. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So, this is what's happening now after -- and coming up to six months since October 7th in that horrendous terrorist attack where all the allies say Israel has the right to defend itself after that attack on October 7th.

Let's listen together. KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  In the channel and allowing the port of Baltimore to reopen as soon as humanly possible. The president will be joined by Governor Moore and other Maryland and Baltimore area elected officials. He'll also be joined by Secretary of Transportation, Pete Buttigieg. As we all know, six individuals tragically lost their lives when the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapsed last week. They were hard workers laboring in the middle of the night to repair potholes on a bridge that tens of thousands of travelers crossed every day. The president will meet with loved ones of those individuals during his trip tomorrow. The President is continuing to lead a whole of government approach in responding to the bridge collapse. As the president said, within hours of the collapse, this administration will be with the people of Baltimore every step of the way. SBA Administrator Guzman is in Baltimore today as part of this administration's effort to support small businesses in need. I also want to share a very big announcement that the Vice President and the EPA Administrator Regan made today in Charlotte, North Carolina, they announced a $20 billion in awards to expand access to clean energy, tackle the climate crisis, improve air quality, lower energy costs and create good-paying jobs. This investment through the EPA's greenhouse gas reduction fund will stand up a national network that will finance tens of thousands of climate and clean energy projects across America. At least, 70 percent of these funds will be invested in low-income and disadvantaged communities. This makes the greenhouse gas reduction fund the single largest non-tax investment in the Inflation Reduction Act to build a clean energy economy while benefiting communities that have historically been left behind. And finally, I want to briefly preview the president's schedule next week. On Monday, we'll -- he'll travel to Madison, Wisconsin, and discuss how he is lowering costs for Americans later in the week. The president and the first lady will host the Prime Minister of Japan and his wife for an official visit to the United States. This will include a state dinner on Wednesday, April 10th. The visit will underscore the enduring strength of our alliance, the unwavering U.S. commitment to Japan and Japan's increasing global leadership role. On Thursday, April 11th, President Biden will host Prime Minister Marcos of the Philippines, Prime Minister Kishida of Japan at the White House for the first trilateral U.S., Japan, Philippines Leaders Summit. In addition, President Biden will host President Marcos for a meeting at the White House on April 11th to review the historic momentum in the U.S.- Philippines relations. Thank you for your patience with that. The Admiral is here to talk about the President's call with Prime Minister Netanyahu and any updates that we have in the Middle East. Admiral?",

And a lot of this material that's been reported publicly was notified to Congress many months, if not years ago, and are in the train to get to Israel. I think it's important to remember as I tried to mention in the last answer, that Israel still has a lot of threats it faces. I mean, we're all focused on Hamas, and I understand that, but they still face active threats throughout the region, including from Iran, and the United States still has an ironclad commitment to help Israel with its self-defense. And so, a lot of these articles including the 2,000-pound bombs and the F- 35s, that's -- those are things that have been long in the train and not tied.

For the first time, the U.S. is introducing the idea of conditionality. It's saying that its support for Israel will depend on how Israel conducts this war. In essence, it is trying to shape the way that, Prime Minister Netanyahu is conducting this war, and that is something Netanyahu has long resisted. So, it's significant for that fact alone. It looks like it could press as a change of policy if the U.S. doesn't get the answers it wants. The second thing is the fact that we saw the Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, came out immediately in Brussels to characterize this call. Now, we've got John Kirby at the White House doing the same thing. This doesn't normally happen after a phone call between President Biden and a foreign leader. You normally get some kind of paper readout that doesn't tell you very much. So, that presentation in itself is an assertion of American power. It's a demonstration to the rest of the world, and also to President Biden's domestic critics that he is changing his policy, he's listening to the criticism, and he is trying to do something to avert the humanitarian cost of this crisis. The question, of course, now is whether Israel will take those steps that Kirby laid out, including more humanitarian aid, opening of more crossings into Gaza, less of a focus on civilians. What will Netanyahu do? And if he doesn't do what the U.S. wants, will the White House then be prepared to follow up and take concrete steps?",

There are still rescues underway in the mountains around this city where there were enormous landslides, bringing down entire mountain faces. But take another look at Hualien, down this road.

It turns out that the Israeli army has come out and said, in fact, they have been playing with the GPS system because they fear that any possible attack from Iran or its allies in the region might use that GPS system for rockets, missiles, drones and whatnot. In addition to that, we are hearing that Israel is evacuating staff from many of its diplomatic missions around the Middle East. We know that many of them, in fact, have already been evacuated several months ago as a result of tensions resulting from the war in Gaza. Now, tomorrow is what's known as Quds Day, Jerusalem Day.
