Just behind me here on the left side of where we are is the roof of an apartment building that, as you can see, was torn away by that one tornado that hit here yesterday afternoon. Another tornado hit just to the north of where we are in North Fort Myers. And so the folks out here, all day long, have been dealing with some of the recovery and the cleanup efforts. This home here, you can see the family that's gathered out front here. They've got workers on the roof. They're trying to lay down a temporary roof. You can see the portion of it there that was torn away by this tornado that hit here. The owner of this house tells me that the family was inside at the time, but because of all of the plywood that they had set up for the storm, they really weren't quite sure what was taking place outside, but they knew something was happening. And then it was quite clear to them that what was taking place was a tornado. Everyone that was inside this house were told was OK. And so the folks out here are now starting the process of trying to just clear out a lot of this debris here. There was a construction crew earlier today going home by home by home and helping to get all of this debris out, which you can see now liters at the front yard of this home. Bianna.",

CNN's Arlette Saenz is standing by live at the White House.

I know that FEMA Administrator Criswell says that at this point -- Criswell says that at this point at least, they have the resources they need.

But there is one Republican congresswoman down in Florida, who a short while ago had said that she would call for Johnson to try to bring the House back to address these funding concerns. And it also comes at a time where the administration has said that they have what they need right now to cover these storms. But then there is the question of what this recovery will look like in the long haul and what exactly FEMA and other agencies might need. One area where the administration has warned about is the Small Business Administration and some of the programs that they have to help, not just small businesses, but homeowners recoup some of the items that they've lost. So these are all things that the administration will try to tackle. But a big question about whether Congress will come back, so far, there seems to be a little appetite for that happening.",

This as Israel launches new strikes on southern Lebanon, hitting what it said were Hezbollah weapons storage facilities in Beirut. CNN reporters are covering all the angles. Fred Pleitgen is in Tehran, Iran for us. Let's begin with Nic Robertson who is in Tel Aviv, Israel. Nic, with this planned vote today in Israel, one would imagine that Israel's retaliation will be coming imminently.

I think what's on the table appears to be everything, despite President Biden saying in thatphone call yesterday and having said publicly as well that he doesn't want Israel to strike Iran's nuclear facilities and he doesn't want them to strike Iran's oil facilities, their refining facilities as well. He's worried about escalation. And he's talked about using proportionality and as Iran struck Israel's intelligence and military bases proportional would be striking Iran's intelligence headquarters a military basis. But at the moment, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and much of his cabinet look at the world around them and they see that they've changed it. They've seen that they have really undermined Hezbollah's ability to strike -- to strike hard into Israel and Hezbollah was always the Iranian proxy that was sort of seen as the guardian for Iran, that if Israel was to strike Iran at these sensitive sites, nuclear sites, other sites, then Hezbollah would mount a huge barrage of missiles here. That seems to be off the table. So, the calculus, I think, in the region at the moment really doesn't know what to expect. But we understand that what the White House has said publicly about that phone call yesterday, and they have been pretty coy about the details, but they haven't said that they've had commitments from Prime Minister Netanyahu not to hit the nuclear facilities, not to hit the oil facilities. So when this vote happens today, the cabinet will have discussed what the response will be. And the vote then empowers the prime minister and the defense minister to then authorize the strikes. So it just moves that trigger point further forward. And the defense minister yesterday, you're right, exactly right about what he said there, precise, surprising. He framed it this way, he said they, Iran, won't understand what happened to them or how it happened even. It implies some kind of stealth attack, but it's hard to see how that could be possible. Israel is still a big distance from Iran.",

No doubt right now the Aerospace Forces of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps will be on high alert to see whether or not there's any Israeli jets or anything else approaching the airspace of Iran. One of the things that we have to keep in mind is that the Aerospace Forces is the same part of the Revolutionary Guard Corps that also hit Israel with those strikes on that military base that Nic was talking about, and of course, that intelligence headquarters as well. What the Iranians are saying is that they're obviously going to try to fend off any attack, but they've also threatened a crushing response to any hits that the Israelis might conduct. And it was quite interesting because the deputy head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Ali Fadavi, he came out a couple of days ago and he said that if the Israelis hit energy installations in Iran, for instance, oil and gas facilities, of course, a lot of those are in the Persian Gulf, some of them also in the border area between Iran and Iraq, all of this is still very much in the western part of the country that then the Iranians could in turn hit targets that are not of military nature, like for instance, energy installations in Israel as well. Yesterday, I managed to speak to a senior politician in the Iranian Parliament and he essentially told me the same thing.

This is one of the first operations that Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office conducted this morning on amphibious vehicles getting in here because the residents here can't do that. They can't walk through there. A lot of them need to use wheelchairs. A lot of them are bedridden. A lot of them use walkers. So they had to get these amphibious vehicles in here and get them out. I spoke with the residents who accounted to me, traumatizing hours overnight and into the day of the water suddenly rising through the night. This is a one-story building right here. And they were up to their knees and beyond full of flash flooding and had to sit there and wait for hours, cold, until finally the conditions were safe enough. The winds lowered. There wasn't any more rainfall that these first responders could get out and not risk their own safety and get out to them and bring them over here. They dropped them off over there onto land and that is where we saw Hillsborough County Sheriff -- Hillsborough County school bus picked them up and take them to safety over at a nearby center that's normally used for basketball games.

And you've seen the damage, you've seen the wind damage with, you know, gust 90, 100 miles per hour across portions of Central Florida. Still substantial winds ongoing along the Florida East Coast this morning, so still a very dangerous situation across much of Florida. It's important to remind people that we lose a lot of people after storms in these types of major hurricane landfalls, so we want people to be safe in that post- storm environment.
