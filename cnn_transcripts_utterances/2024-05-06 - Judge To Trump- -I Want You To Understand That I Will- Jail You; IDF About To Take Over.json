And just moments ago, the former president responded. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT &amp; 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I have to watch every word I tell you people. He asked me a question, a simple question. I'd like to give it, but I can't talk about it, because his judge just gave me a gag order and said you'll go to jail if you violate it. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Mr. Trump, it's important to understand that the last thing I want to do is put you in jail. You are the former president of the United States, and possibly the next president as well.

RYAN GOODMAN, JUST SECURITY CO-EDITOR-IN-CHIEF: Yeah, they're really an incredible documents that Mr. McConney testified about. So the first document I would even say that they're close to being smoking guns. That -- that's significant. The first document is Allen Weisselberg, the CFO at the time, in his own handwriting contemporaneously recording the internal payments. So remember that the entire argument by the prosecutors that this was a cover up, they recorded it publicly and in their business records as legal fees. But this is the handwritten note that shows it's nothing about legal fees. In fact, the handwritten notes say this is to gross him up. You do not gross up legal fees. The exact amount is the $130,000 times two to cover for taxes plus $50,000 for online polling company. And its not that Allen Weisselberg wrote this on a scratch piece of paper, the paper that this is all on is a bank record of Michael Cohen's from the essential consultants care of Michael Cohen on October 27th, shows the fire transfer to who? Stormy Daniels' lawyer. So he's actually doing the handwritten notes on the hush money payments.",

It was built in the 1990s as the contagious disease unit. It's a series of free-standing buildings with several cells inside each one. The cells are all air condition and completely self, so inside each cell, there's a shower. There's a commode and wash basin. And in addition, there's an anteroom in front of each cell where the person inside it can be observed for their safekeeping and well-being.

If the judge orders him confined for four hours or six hours, they may well keep him in a cell at the courthouse, but if the judge directs that he be held overnight, I would think they would have to take him to, a, jail? None of the holding cells in the courthouse have accommodations for overnight stays and presumably he would be alone for several reasons. Needless to say, the Department of Correction and the Secret Service would have to work out some sort of an arrangement for these armed agents to the present, to safe guard him therefore, he would have to be kept apart from other prisoners.

I mean, we are seeing very dramatic video of explosions lighting up the night sky in Rafah, but this appears to be more than the airstrikes that we have watched over the course of the last seven months of this war, including in Rafah. Instead, it appears that the Israeli military, according to our analyst, Barak Ravid, that they are moving into Rafah with ground forces in order to take over that rough border crossing, which happens to be along the Egypt to Gaza border, known hear critically as the Philadelphi route, which is a very strategic root of between Egypt and Gaza, where the Israeli military believes a lot of Hamas smuggling operations also take place.It's not clear exactly the scope of this operation at this point, but it is notable of course that it comes less than 24 hours after the Israeli military ordered tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians living in eastern Rafah, about 100,000 of them to begin evacuating that area. And now less than 24 hours later, it appears that not only is the Israeli military carrying out strikes in eastern Rafah, but also apparently moving in ground forces, including a tank. So not clear what the spells out for the future of a major ground offensive in Rafah but at least for now it appears that at operation has begin to a certain level.",

And yet the leaflets we see today on video being dropped in eastern Rafah ordering civilians to flee north. North, which, of course, WHO has said is in the midst of a mass famine such that there's even anything left in the north of Gaza. A deep irony in that.

So, General Marks, Israel pushing ahead with its assault on Rafah. At this point, what is the military objective of an operation like this? MAJ. GEN. JAMES \"SPIDER\" MARKS (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, first of all, Israel I think has from the outset indicated that Rafah is legitimate target for them and there was certain inevitability to this operation. The objective clearly is for Israel, for that IDF forces to continue the mission to go after two things, infrastructure, as well as Hamas leadership and Hamas fighters. Now bear in mind over this what I would say, period, this interregnum of a couple of weeks, Israel has been doing significant intelligence collection in terms of where are those pieces of infrastructure they need to go after and where are the fighters as well? But also what they've been doing is they've been trying to assess what it is in terms of the best routes in and where you want to try to isolate the fight. You just don't go rushing into Rafah. Then not have some type of controlled exit. Clearly, the exit into Egypt, Egypt is not going to allow that. So the movement north, but Israel is primarily concerned about. So that's what's going to take place. I would tell you that most of the Hamas fighters as well over this period have been able to do some additional preparation as well as in many cases, I would suspect escaping from the kill zone.",

You've got to be able to kill leadership as it exists right now.But Hamas will in many cases, would be, would expect to see it again in some form, you want to buy yourself some time. So Netanyahu was essentially telling President Biden, look, I got it, but I have to complete this job and he's -- as I said, he's playing chicken.
