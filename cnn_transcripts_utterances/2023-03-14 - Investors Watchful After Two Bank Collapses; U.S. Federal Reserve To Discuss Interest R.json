The Federal Reserve is investigating the oversight of the bank to figure out what went wrong and who missed what. The nation's regional banks are bouncing back after confidence in the institutions was shaken yesterday. This is how the stocks are performing right now. That is not all that is shaking up the economic picture this morning. We got the latest read on inflation. The government reporting that inflation, while still elevated, fell for the eighth straight month in February. Matt Egan and Rahel Solomon joining me. Matt Egan to you, what are we seeing?",

But they're bouncing back in a big way.And perhaps more important than what the stock prices were doing, we are seeing what the people are doing with their deposits. A senior Treasury official told our colleague, Phil Mattingly, that people taking money out of the bank is slowing. This is after Washington launched this shock and awe campaign trying to end the panic. And they wanted uninsured depositors to know that they are protected. And also, this is all psychological, right? Panic set in on Friday and over the weekend. Hopefully cooler heads will prevail, because we know that the FDIC insures up to $250,000 per borrower per bank and U.S. officials are willing to rescue the uninsured as well.",

It's coming down and another headline coming in at 6 percent annually is matching what economists have said.So that is excluding the volatile categories like food and energy. But when you look under the hood, a bit more concerning signs. Food prices are still higher by 9.5 percent over the last year. Shelter prices -- and these are essential categories -- are up about 8.5 percent annually Shelter prices was the largest contributor to rise that we saw in inflation. And so still some concerning signs. But essentially, we are seeing that inflation is cooling in a gradual way, as if you are turning off the oven at home after you cook something. You can't snap your fingers and it is automatically going to cool. It will take some time. The White House announced new initiatives to help Americans deal with higher prices is a long process, the White House clearly trying to do what it can to help. (CROSSTALK)",

Back in November, they announced 11,000 job cuts, biggest in their corporate history and, today, they said they are closing 5,000 job openings they had.This is happening for a few reasons. One, the Fed's interest rate hikes has slammed the valuation of tech companies. And they are under a lot of pressure to boost their profitability and cut expenses and also remember that the tech industry went on a hiring binge during COVID-19. They added so many jobs, that they also incorrectly, in hindsight, anticipated demand during COVID would continue. And that has not happened. So they've been forced to correct and, unfortunately, that means they have to lay off workers.",

But the bad news is that inflation is still hot. Year over year CPI inflation of 6 percent; moving in the right direction. The peak was last June, close to 9 percent, so moving in the right direction. But I think that for us to be feeling comfortable and for the Federal Reserve to be feeling comfortable about things, it has to be below 3 percent. I am hopeful we need to see progress. Show me.",

They came up with these extraordinary measures to make sure that everyone understands that the government has the banking system's back and your money is good where it is in the bank.They, you know, set up a credit facility -- and I won't go into the details -- but providing the banks to cash if they need it. With all that uncertainty, it would surprise me, despite the inflation and despite the strength of the economy for them to raise rates. And I don't think it would make sense. They should pause and look around and raise the rates in May if they need to.

But we will be talking about high unemployment and they don't want that.So priority number one is to make sure that the banking system is on solid ground and people are confident that it is on solid ground. And once they establish that, then they can turn back and say, OK, what do I need to do to get the inflation back in. And by the way, Kate, they don't need to do a lot more. As I said, it is moving in the right direction. We have to be patient and realize some positive things are happening underneath the hood to give us confidence. Without further rate hikes or another rate hike or two, we will get the inflation back in the bottle in a reasonable amount of time.",

The rollback allowed banks like SVB, because of their size, they are no longer big enough to take the stress test.The stress tests are important, because they ask the banks and the regulators to simulate what would have happened to you, Mr. or Ms. Bank, if unemployment went to 10 percent, if the stock market plunged, if interest rates spiked. Those are the things they have to be prepared for. And some institutions were too small didn't take that test because of the rollbacks. So I don't know, if they were regulated like they were before the change, if it would have forestalled this problem. But it certainly couldn't have hurt.",

And that is what I worry most about, with the smaller banks who went through this. We can't go back to too big to fail and only a few banks with all the concentration.

I believe, in the case here, Silicon Valley, it seems to me, had the wrong list, took the wrong investments in Treasurys. And as the interest rates go up, the values go down and when there was the run on the bank and everybody showing up at the same time to get their money back, they didn't have enough cash. And so it is not whether there's enough assets on the balance sheets, it was the wrong mix. And how did that happen? The Fed had oversight. Were they asking the right questions and keeping an eye out for this? I am worried about that for all of the regulators across the country, making sure that these banks are secure and sound. And that is what we need to know to get to the bottom of it. And the FDIC insurance is another piece, because people need to feel confident that their money is safe, whether they are over the $250,000 or not.",

The Fed didn't do that; they were doing every other year. So I want to understand why.And part of the importance was ensuring that community banks could be strong and so when Dodd-Frank was passed, it had all of the same requirements for large banks and community banks. And so community banks were consolidating and selling to the big banks, which is the opposite effect of what we were trying to create, which was getting away from a few banks that were too big to fail. And so why weren't the regulators doing the job to get the asset mix correct? That is what I am interested in and whether or not the bank had enough assets on the balance sheet but a question of ratios and mix and the long-term Treasury bills and investments. And of course, what they had in the liquid cash. And that is the question that we have to get to the bottom of. The big thing is that, Kate, we don't want to go back to too small to survive and too big to fail. That is a disaster for the banking in our country and we need strong community banks. And I will keep saying it over and over again. And I want to make sure that we have a system where larger institutions obviously can be strong and protected and so can the smaller institutions and depositors can be assured that their money will be there in the bank.",
