The special counsel says that Trump is trying to intimidate witnesses. We're following these major developing stories and many more all coming in right here to CNN News Central.We begin this hour with more fighting at Gaza's hospitals. Israel's military says its troops targeted a group of militants after they opened fire from inside the Indonesian hospital overnight. The head of the World Health Organization, says he is appalled by the attack, which killed 12 people, including some patients. That strike comes after the IDF released video of what it says is Hamas terrorist activity at the Al-Shifa hospital.

But what this evidence does show is that there is indeed a tunnel on the grounds of Al-Shifa hospital. And this is perhaps the most concrete evidence that the Israelis have put forward so far to prove out their claims. You can see in this video initially shot apparently by a drone going down into this tunnel shaft.There is a spiral staircase. That ultimately leads to a lengthy tunnel. And once you get in the tunnel in this video provided by the Israeli military, you can see the kind of curved ceiling that is very typical of the tunnels that Hamas has built underneath Gaza, dozens of miles of which exists. And then at the end of it, you get to a door, which the Israeli military says it has yet to open because it fears it may be booby trapped. Perhaps what lies behind that door will prove out the Israeli military's claims. But as of yet, we have not seen that kind of evidence. Meanwhile, tonight, the Israeli military is facing a lot of questions and facing a lot of condemnation for a strike on the Indonesian hospital in Gaza that apparently killed 12 people, according to local health authorities who say that among the dead are patients of the hospital and at least 1 medical staffer. The World Health Organization has condemned this attack, saying that the head of the World Health Organization saying that he is appalled by this attack. The Israeli military, for its part, says that it faced gunfire from militants from within the hospital and it says that this is a violent attack. And it is the first time in the history of this country that the Israeli military has been charged with a gunfire. The Israeli military is currently trying to find out where the gunfire is coming from. The Israeli military insists that it did not shell that hospital.",

But several things still need to be ironed out, including the mechanisms of this release and exactly how long that pause in fighting would actually last and how it would be coordinated.

They had prepared resources at the border. But of course, as we've heard in terms of what is happening at Al-Shifa hospital and just how dangerous it was to leave the hospital, they were unable to evacuate. Initially, there were 36 babies that the Egyptians were expecting.Doctors in Al-Shifa say 5 of those babies died. I want to describe some of the conditions they experienced. Lack of oxygen. There was no food in the hospital, water. One mother that was with her baby in the hospital saying that they had run out of milk. And we saw the images of the babies being carried by hand, moved from the neonatal ward inside of Al-Shifa into another section of the hospital and being put just on a bed. And they were using hot water bottles to keep them warm. Talking about very dangerous conditions for very vulnerable patients. Eventually, a safe corridor was created, moved to the Emirati hospital in Rafah. They were stabilized. Doctors said they were very stressed. Various tests were run on them. And medical interventions were given yesterday and today, finally moving through that Rafah border where they were met with ambulances and then taken to hospitals in Egypt. What we're hearing from our sources here is that the very severe cases will be flown to Cairo. We understand that the babies are very underweight. The WHO says that 11 of those cases are critical. They are all going through severe infections. And this is because they weren't given the proper care in Al-Shifa. Now, when we say 28 babies, we're talking only about 4 parents that accompanied those babies and 6 nurses.  So, the question now becomes, where are their parents? Where are their relatives? International organizations will be digging into that to try and reunite the kids. But people are just fearing the worst at this point because we know what has been happening in northern Gaza. And it was just impossible to move these patients elsewhere. We also know there are a lot of other injured Palestinians in al-Shifa right now. And arrangements are being made to try and move those patients. But in the meantime, here in Egypt, they're taking in as many injured Palestinians as they possibly can. They say they can accommodate more. But priority now is all about these babies, to get them stabilized and give them the care they need.",
