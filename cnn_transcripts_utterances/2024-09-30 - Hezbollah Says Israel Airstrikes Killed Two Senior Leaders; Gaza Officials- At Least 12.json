A warning: her report contains graphic and disturbing video. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Another week of hell in Gaza. A mother and her four children were killed when their home in al-Bureij was hit by an Israeli air strike. Their uncle said it happened at 3 a.m. They were killed while they slept. Another strike at a school sheltering displaced in Nuseirat camp killed a couple and their five-year-old child. Israel said it was a precise strike targeting Hamas operatives. A man staying nearby says these are the remains of the missile. They were innocent and displaced, sleeping in this little room. The next day, a drone strike in al-Bureij killed two children and 20- year-old twin men. Their father says they were sitting by the front door, looking at their phones. They were born together and killed together, he says. Children playing in the street were rushed into hospital. We have asked the IDF what the target of this strike was. One little boy is treated on the hospital floor next to the body of a deceased man. No dignity allowed in life or death for the residents of Gaza. Dozens lost their lives last week while thousands of miles away the United Nations headquarters in New York, world leader after world leader called for the war in Gaza to end. A U.S.-led proposal for a 21-day ceasefire on the Israel-Lebanon border is also intended to jolt a Gaza ceasefire, if it happens. But it's a big \"if.\" Families of hostages still held in Gaza worry the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah is overshadowing their cause. Residents of Gaza fear they're being forgotten by a world that has failed to end their suffering. This man says, \"When the war on Beirut happened, we lost all hope. There's no focus on Gaza. It's barely mentioned.\" This woman adds, \"Lebanon is full of our brothers and sisters. We stand in solidarity with them. But at the same time, we do not want the world to forget us.\" This man says, \"I don't think Gaza is forgotten because of the war in Lebanon, because the two are connected. Hopefully, they'll be resolved together.\" Since Hezbollah pagers started exploding in Lebanon two weeks ago, more than 360 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, according to the Ministry of Health. No breakdown of militants versus civilians, but hospitals filled with women and children tell its own story. Israel's shift in focus to its Northern border feels no different on the ground in Gaza.
