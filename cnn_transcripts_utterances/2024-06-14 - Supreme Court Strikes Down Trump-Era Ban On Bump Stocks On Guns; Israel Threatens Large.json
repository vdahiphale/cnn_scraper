It's striking down, striking down a Trump-era federal ban on gun bump stocks, delivering a major blow to gun safety advocates. In a scathing dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor says the ruling will have, quote, deadly consequences, her words.And just moments ago, the Biden campaign laid the blame directly on the former president saying and I'm quoting right now from the Biden campaign statement, weapons of war have no place in the streets of America. But Trump's Supreme Court justices have decided the gun lobby is more important than the safety of our kids and our communities. I want to bring in our Chief Legal Affairs Correspondent Paula Reid, who's watching all of this unfold. Update our viewers on the significance of this, Paula.",

      "sentences": "So, Wolf, this is one of the most significant cases going before the High Court this term also one of the few questions related to gun rights that the justices need to decide. Now this case focuses on bump stocks. And for anyone who's not clear on what that is, a bump stock allows a shooter to convert a semi-automatic rifle into a weapon that can fire at a rate of hundreds of rounds a minute. And the question is whether those should be classified as machine guns. Now the Trump administration, the Biden administration, gun rights advocates have all said that, yes, this should qualify as a machine gun.But here in a six-three decision, the High Court has disagreed they have overturned this. And the opinion was authored by Justice Clarence Thomas and he wrote, quote, firing multiple shots using a semi- automatic rifle with a bump stock requires more than a single function of the trigger. And the mechanism here for operating this gun, that seems to be really the basis of their analysis. But in a scathing dissent, the liberal justices completely disagree. Justice Sotomayor writing, quote, when I see a bird that walks like a duck, swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, I call that bird a duck. A bump stock equipped, semi-automatic rifle fires automatically more than one shot without manual reloading by a single function of the trigger. Because I, like Congress, call that a machine gun, I respectfully dissent. Now there is one other major gun case pending before the justices and that question is whether someone who has a restraining order related to domestic violence can own a gun. We still have 20 at least outstanding opinions from the justices. And we expect to get those opinions over the next few weeks. Wolf?",

And I have to say, this was the first time we had dueling readings from the Court bench, you know, just as Thomas trying to explain just how narrowly this 1934 machine gun loss should be machine gun prohibition should be interpreted. And Justice Sotomayor saying it needn't be read that way, given the way modern devices have developed, and very strongly saying, calling on Congress to do something.Justice Thomas and Justice Alito, separately, in a concurring opinion said, sure, Congress can change it. But the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms does not have the right to do this. Justice Sotomayor said from the bench, that sure, Congress can change it but if you read it the way it's supposed to be read, looking at the language, which he said was the interpretation of the dissenters.

What did you make of his argument?STEPHEN GUTOWSKI, GUN-SAFETY INSTRUCTOR AND FIREARMS REPORTER, THERELOAD.COM: Yes, I mean, I think his argument is factually correct, as far as how the bump stocks actually operate compared to fully automatic firearms where, you know, bump firing, in fact, is entirely possible without the bump stock. You can do this technique on any semi-automatic rifle or handgun as well. Bump stocks make it more a bit easier to accomplish. I've used them in the past. That's their sort of a novelty device. Obviously, you're used to horrific effect in the Las Vegas shooting.

So it wasn't surprising if you listened to the oral arguments. It really was split along party lines. It is worth noting, though, that 17 states and Washington, D.C. still have their own bump stock bans. Many of those were passed after the federal bump stock ban and 2018.Those from what I understand can remain. States can pass their own bump stock bans now. It's doubtful. Red states will. And here we see once again, you know, kind of a split between an America that has one set of gun laws and then other states, Republican-led states that have looser restrictions. Ultimately, Congress must resolve this by passing a law but the realities in the Senate pretty much preclude that from happening.",

The exchange of rocket attacks is escalating along the border with Lebanon. Israel is warning that it's prepared to launch what it describes as a large scale attack on the Iranian-backed group Hezbollah, which is in southern Lebanon. And in the southern part of Israel, the ceasefire talks to end the war in Gaza appear to have stalled. We'll have more on that coming up in just a few moments.But let's begin in northern Israel right now. CNN's Oren Liebermann is now in Haifa for us, right up in northern Israel.

That's the level of concern here. And that's because we have seen more rocket launchers across the border from Hezbollah over the course of the past 72 hours than we have at any point in the course of the past eight months.Two days ago, it was more than 200 rockets fired across the border from Lebanon into Israel. Yesterday was about 50. Today about 35. It's on in terms of numbers alone, a downward trajectory, but the concern is very much still there. And that's why this border is so volatile. One little miscalculation brings you closer to the fear of an all-out war across this border. And a former member of the war cabinet, Benny Gantz, warning that if it continues like this, there may, Israel feels be no choice but to look at the possibility of needing to conduct a larger operation. Now this -- we have seen the sort of the trajectory of escalation moving up over the course of the past couple of weeks. It certainly went up another level when Israel carried out a strike three days ago that killed a Hezbollah commander in southern Lebanon and that's when we saw that large volume of rocket fire. The question is where does this go from here and that's what we're what we're monitoring the situation very closely here. [11:15:10] I'm in Haifa, in northern Israel, the border not that far from me. There is almost a deceptive calm here right now only because it's approaching the beginning of the Sabbath. But in no ways the border itself quiet or calm, nor has it been over the course of the past couple of weeks, and certainly not in the last 72 hours.",

And that's why the former member of the war cabinet pointed out that Israel can't go through another year, like it has seen over the course of the past eight months.And the question is, what does it take to restore at least a stable situation along the northern border, and that the former member of the war cabinet pointed out, Israel may prefer a diplomatic solution.

In April, Hamas released a propaganda video of him, the first proof he survived those injuries. In that video, part of Goldberg-Polin left arm is missing. At the end of the video, he told his family to stay strong, a message that echoed his mother. RACHEL GOLDBERG, MOTHER OF HOSTAGE HERSH GOLDBERG-POLIN: It was just interesting, because as, you know, I've probably said a million times -- over a million times at this point over these 202 days, I love you, stay strong, survive. I love you, stay strong, survive. And so to hear him use that sort of language, which I'm assuming he has not heard us say and to say, I know you're working so hard. I don't know if he knows that.

That gives us the intelligence therefore, to develop AI.So he talked about this AI tool was, like all the other tools that mankind has had. And you can use it for good or for bad. And for bad, he said, an example of automated weapon systems that can shoot and aim and select a target automatically without human involvement. And but the Pope said, look, what he wanted to see was the development of this tool to benefit all communities, not just one country, not just the rich, but the poor. He wanted to see it distributed equitably. And that's what the conversation among the other leaders has been about, two levels to make sure that the developing world for example, doesn't get left behind with this incredible AI tool that it benefits from the scientific developments, that it benefits from the health care developments, that it benefits from agricultural movements. Also, what they want to do is develop a common governance.
