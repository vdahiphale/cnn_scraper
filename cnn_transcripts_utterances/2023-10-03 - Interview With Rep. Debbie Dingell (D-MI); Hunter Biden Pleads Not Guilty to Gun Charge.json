Here, the fact-finder and the legal adjudicator are the same person. And the judge is only human. I mean, if you keep wasting the judge's time rehashing the same arguments the judge has already ruled on, and the judge is telling you, quit doing that, one, the judge will be irritated. But, more importantly, the judge is going to not treat your arguments with as much attention and credibility. His eyes are going to kind of glaze over on this. And that does not do you, as the defense counsel, any good. You really want the judge to be paying attention to what you're saying, not looking at you like, well, you just keep saying the same stuff that I told you not to say. So I think, going forward, that is a problem for them.",

House Democrats have been meeting all morning in a closed-door meeting. Some have been coming out telling CNN there is no love loss for McCarthy. Democratic Congresswoman Debbie Dingell is joining us now. Thank you so much for taking the time, I know on an extremely busy and important day, and what is a historic day if this goes down in the House today. Can you tell me first, were you inside the meeting? And, if you were, what happened inside that meeting? What did you see and hear? REP. DEBBIE DINGELL (D-MI):  So I'm going to be very careful, because I think that this is a historic day and that the American people need to understand that I think colleagues on the Republican and Democratic side of the House are having very thoughtful discussions about what this means, how you move forward, what the implications have been to date for our democracy. And I think a lot of people were expressing in my caucus concerns. And I think the caucus wanted to listen to each other and be unified in what happens. And there was very much consensus on that from all perspectives within our caucus.",
