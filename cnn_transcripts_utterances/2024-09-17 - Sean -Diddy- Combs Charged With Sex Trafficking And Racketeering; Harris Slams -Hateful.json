Tonight on \"Laura Coates Live.\"The man known as Sean \"Diddy\" Combs built a business empire off his music and also his name. But tonight, he's sitting behind bars in Brooklyn accused of running a very different kind of empire. The rapper is now in a special housing unit for inmates who require additional protection. This after being denied bail on the three federal charges against him. Now he pleaded not guilty during his first court appearance today, but what he's facing is incredibly serious. The charges include racketeering, conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution. Now the first two carry a maximum sentence of life in prison, and a sex trafficking conviction is a minimum 15-year sentence. Now the details in the indictment, they are staggering. One phrase that stands out, Combs Enterprise. Enterprise, meaning a group of people organized for the purpose of committing crimes. In shorthand, right, organized crime. Now prosecutors alleged that Diddy was the leader of that criminal enterprise which consisted of security and household staff, personal assistants, high-ranking supervisors, and other close associates. Prosecutors mentioned the criminal enterprise something like 38 times in a 14-page indictment. And as its leader, Diddy is accused of things like this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DAMIAN WILLIAMS, U.S. ATTORNEY, SDNY: Between at least 2008 and the present, Combs abused, threatened, and coerced victims to fulfill his sexual desires, protect his reputation, and conceal his conduct. Sean Combs led and participated in a racketeering conspiracy that used the business empire he controlled to carry out criminal activity, including sex trafficking, forced labor, kidnapping, arson, bribery, and the obstruction of justice.

The allegations tell a story of abuse and coercion, and that appears to be just the start of it.The prosecutors say that Diddy held what he called freak offs. These are drug-fueled and abusive sex performances arranged and also directed by Sean Combs. They allegedly happen regularly. They would last multiple days. Sex workers were brought in from other states and even other countries. Now the victims were given drugs to keep them obedient and compliant. Just think of those two words, obedient and compliant. Drugs like ketamine and ecstasy and GHB. They were often electronically recorded. And the encounters were often so intense that his victims got IV fluids to recover. Some took days or even weeks to heal, to heal. And if one of those victims didn't do what he wanted, well, prosecutors say that this happened. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

This was just a matter of personal embarrassment because he and the person in the video were in the midst of a 10-year relationship that was difficult at times, that was toxic at times, but it was mutually so.

And the resources he has, the kind of person who could have -- could put up $15 million -- $50 million bond package includes private planes and so on.The counter argument was, from Marc Agnifilo, the lawyer, he turned his passports into me, he came to New York with his entire family to support him in order to surrender for these charges. That makes him the opposite of a flight risk, and that argument didn't play with the magistrate.

She is a pragmatist. And that's why I think they need to get her out there more.The whole Democratic Party went on some weird stuff in 2020. People were talking about all kinds of stuff that now makes no sense. People talking about defunding the police, all kinds of stuff. The Democrats woke up with a hangover and ran to Biden. Don't forget, we got off of that Pogo stick with Biden in 2020. Republicans want to keep talking about stuff we haven't talked about in four years.

In fact, she has put out policies on her campaign website. KARA SWISHER, CNN CONTRIBUTOR (voice-over): Uh-hmm. CLINTON (voice-over): Anybody who's truly interested can go read about them.

As little as one to two ounces of explosive materials was implanted next to the battery in each pager. A switch embedded that could be triggered remotely.

I want to bring in Bob Baer, a former CIA officer. Bob, when I heard this story, I couldn't believe it was real. We know around 3,000 pagers were actually purchased from that Taiwanese company.

He responded to a tweet suggesting that if Kamala Harris and Tim Walz secure the presidency, their first move would be to ban X and arrest Elon Musk.Musk's response, yep, the barrage of wild tweets is so beyond the pale, it's sometimes hard to keep track of. Remember, just last week, Taylor Swift endorsed Harris and Walz and signed off with \"Childless Cat Lady.\" Musk responded to Swift, \"I will give you a child.\" Let this sink in for a second. After all of this, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, which he bought, by the way, for 44 billion bucks, it is financially flailing. Fortune reporting since Musk's acquisition in 2022, the company's revenue is down 85% when adjusted for inflation. And the company's valuation will. Fidelity says it's now worth $11.8 billion. That's down 73% from Musk's purchasing price. And I want to bring in two people who are familiar with Elon Musk, more so than most frankly, Kate Conger and Ryan Mac, and two \"New York Times\" tech reporters. They are out with a new book called \"Character Limit: How Elon Musk Destroyed Twitter.\" Well, that's the point. Let's get to it as well. Kate, I'll begin with you. Look, Musk was warned early on that his tweets and everything else could actually hurt Twitter. You've seen the numbers we just talked about. Financially, it empirically is failing. But what was his goal in actually having it? Was it to be financially profitable or something else? KATE CONGER, CO-AUTHOR, \"CHARACTER LIMIT\": I think Musk's goal with Twitter has always been more ideological than financial. And he said that from the outset of the deal. He said he didn't care if he made money or lost money, but he wanted to bring this vision of free speech to the platform. And, you know, he has certainly done that. He has not held back at all in the kinds of things that he posts, and he has been very unbridled in the kind of speech that he promotes on the platform as well.",
