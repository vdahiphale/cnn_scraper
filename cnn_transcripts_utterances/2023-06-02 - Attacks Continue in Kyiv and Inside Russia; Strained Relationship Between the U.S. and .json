A senior Ukrainian official says, quote, the gates of warhave opened on Russian territory, as Kyiv is pounded by another consecutive day of punishing Russian strikes. We begin with a series of fresh attacks and casualties on both sides of the border. Residents ran for cover and took shelter underground in the capital Kyiv, as Russia launched some three dozen cruise missiles and Iranian-made drones, as well. Ukraine's air force says all the projectiles were destroyed. Two people were injured. Meantime, in Moscow today, Russian President Vladimir Putin says ill- wishers must be prevented from destabilizing Russia. His remarks come amid reports of drone attacks and shelling in multiple regions, including Kursk. The governor of the border region of Belgorod says two people were killed in strikes.

Afterweeks of negotiations in Washington, the Senate passed the debt ceiling bill late Thursday, removing the risk of a global economic catastrophe. The deal suspends the $31.4 trillion debt limit until January 2025, allowing the federal government to continue to pay its bills. Republicans used the must-pass bill to extract concessions from the Democrats including a cap on non-defense spending. The bill now heads to President Joe Biden, who will sign it into law. CNN's Jeremy Diamond is at the White House. So, Jeremy, I think the good news for both sides here is the debt ceiling issue is now removed through the elections until January 2025. Obviously, it was impossible for both sides to get everything they wanted. But can either side really claim this as a win here? What are your thoughts?",

      "sentences": "Well, I think we're starting to see that from both sides frankly and that's kind of what was expectedhere. This is a deal that depending on the way that you read it can look like a win for either side. If you look at what it is on paper in terms of the numbers before some of these adjustments are made, it looks like a win for the republican side bringing spending much closer to Fiscal Year 2022 levels. But if you then add in some of the adjustments that they were able to use here including IRS money for example bringing back some COVID funding, and then using that as a backstop for some of the domestic programs that are cut on paper, looks like a better deal for the White House, coming just a billion dollars shy of a Fiscal Year 2023 spending freeze for next year, which is pretty close to what the White House's opening offer in these negotiations actually were. But what is clear is that neither side got everything that they wanted here, and that was a point that the president underscored in his statement about this debt ceiling deal late last night after the Senate was able to pass this on a bipartisan basis. And what is ultimately clear is that for the American economy, this is certainly a victory of sorts in the sense that we are averting the worst potential outcome that could have come as early as Monday. Keep in mind with the potential for the first ever default in U.S. history, that would have been a catastrophe for the U.S. and for the global economy. And so obviously that worst case scenario has now been averted. And what's more, the White House officials that I've been talking to have also been pointing out that this really helps to clear the decks for the rest of President Biden's term. It disincentivizes the government shutdown later this year by incentivizing appropriators to actually pass some of those key government funding bills. And it also, of course, takes the issue of the debt ceiling off the table through the next presidential election cycle.",

Sort of a regular day of work when they just stopped responding to messages and phone calls or their phones were going to voicemail, family members said. And immediately family members knew something was a matter that everyone who worked at this call center, these seven people, would have just gone missing, was too bizarre, and obviously seemed tied to some sort of violent gang activity. And they began to march to protest and call on officials to do more. And then this week, this terrible discovery, bags and bags of body parts found in a ravine on the outskirts of Guadalajara in a sort of near a suburb, we're told, in this very steep ravine, someone hastily disposing of these bodies. And officials saying that it appears that the two cases are connected, that the people found in these bags as they continue to analyze them apparently were at least some of the missing seven people from this call center, and officials going on to say that they believe this call center may have been used for some kind of illegal activity, a real estate fraud or some kind. Family members have not responded to that as far as we know at this point. But of course, even though, Zain, that this has generated a lot more attention just because of the high profile and the horrific discovery of these bags in this ravine, there are no guarantees that it will generate justice or any answers here, because as you said, all too often this kind of thing happens in Mexico and the culprits are not brought to justice.",

So, currently, we are looking at a situation whereby the camp is hosting more than three times what it should be hosting. Therefore, decongesting the camp is something we are calling upon urgently to decongest the camps so that it doesn't put pressure on the limited resources already -- that are already in the camps. The refugees are living with very low levels of access to clean water, access to sufficient latrines and toilets. So, if we can have at least a part of the population move to the camp that the government of Kenya has opened, it will ease this congestion and at least ease the pressure on the resources within the camps.",
