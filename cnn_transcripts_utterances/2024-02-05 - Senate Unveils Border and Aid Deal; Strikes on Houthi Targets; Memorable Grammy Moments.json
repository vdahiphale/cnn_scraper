That he will not be supporting it. That, obviously, is significant because he's part of the Republican leadership team and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has repeatedly said that he thinks this effort was done in good faith. He's been very supportive of Republicans needing to consider this legislation. And he, in fact, sent out a statement last night saying that all of his Republican members needed to be prepared to act this week.So, it's going to be really interesting to see where the votes land in the Senate.

This does more than anything in decades. And then also tie that to aid for Ukraine, aid for Israel, support for Taiwan. A failure to pass this is a dereliction of duty. It is a profile in cowardice.

Can both sides, do you see, claim a political win, which, in the politics of today is required with this one, or does this still remain a zero-sum game?SOPHIA CAI, NATIONAL POLITICS REPORTER, \"AXIOS\": I don't know, Kate. I think for Republicans they see it as more of a political win for Biden. And so that's why you see Trump calling Speaker Johnson. You know, we don't know exactly what the contents of that conversation look like, but it was somewhere along the lines of, don't do this, and that's why you see in the House Speaker Johnson, Steve Scalise, Elise Stefanik, all extremely negative on the bill. And, you know, of course we don't know what the fate of the bill is. But the reason really is Trump, is because he sees this as more of a win for his rival, Joe Biden, in the general election.",

Do you want to be part of the solution to the boarder that you've been complaining about because people are rightly concerned, or do you want to have done nothing because you were afraid someone else might get credit? Ronald Reagan used to say, it's amazing how much you can get done if you don't care who gets the credit. The other thing is - is Ukraine. The people who were in act - it's sort of kowtowing to this and separating out Ukraine. They will be responsible for abandoning an American ally to Russian aggression. They will be Putin's enablers.

We're talking about the strikes that took place first on Friday in Iraq and Syria, and also the strike against Yemen, which intensified over the weekend. The White House National Security Adviser tells CNN the U.S. is not done yet and will take further action. The U.S. launched a series of strikes in Iraq and Syria in response to the killing of three U.S. soldiers. Defense officials say they hit 84 of 85 intended targets. A day later, the U.S. forces targeted the Houthis in Yemen with three dozen strikes across 13 locations. Also today we are watching as Secretary of State Antony Blinkenarrives in the Middle East as he presses for a deal to release the hostages in Gaza.

We're picking up information indirectly from diplomats in other nations. And we're looking to see if these forces that we struck are reconstituting, preparing to restrike us, and we're watching for other targets to emerge.So, I think it's in the interest of the White House and the United States to have a second set of strikes if they can find the appropriate targets and it makes sense. It's going to take a while, assuming that the strikes really do hit the targets that were essential in the first wave, it's going to take a while for the terrorists to reform anyway. A week, two weeks, three weeks. So, before we really expect any continuation of that kind of action from Syria. Yemen's a different case and so we should be overflying Syria with reconnaissance and looking at it from eyes from the sky and striking momentarily whenever we see any - any threatening activities.",

In fact, when you talk to - when I talk to my friends in Iran and connected to Iran, they tell me, they said, it looks like the United States is complicit with this - with this regime in Iran because they're giving them money because they keep telling them we're not going to strike and so forth. So, you don't know how strong the internal opposition is, but clearly it worries the Iranian government, so they're playing a very cagey, sly game against us, trying to hang on to their objective, also trying to maintain control of their population.
