His connections to the Turkish government and what the feds might have been looking for when they seized his cell phone and iPad. A reporter following the money will be here.Plus, one of the most upsetting videos from October 7th, which says a lot. It shows a 19-year-old woman, a kidnapping victim, being taken out of a Hamas Jeep. Her pants are bloodied. Her mother will join us to talk about why that video is so important for the world to see. And leading this hour, the world's reaction since the Hamas attacks, divisive, combative, ugly, even leading to deadly demonstrations as opposing groups take sides. Some people ripping down posters of children kidnapped. Anti-Semitism reaching dangerous, alarming rates worldwide. Also, a spike in Islamophobia, anti-Arab, and anti-Muslim incidents. And not just in the United States, this is happening all over the world. Let's start this hour with the ongoing conflict fueling all of this. A U.S. official telling me that American intelligence backs Israel's showing that Hamas terrorists are using Al-Shifa Hospital as a command center and stealing fuel from the hospital. CNN's Jeremy Diamond is in Ashkelon, Israel. Jeremy, Israel's military has released some highly produced videos backing up some of the claims. Tell us what they show us.",

They've been building up the case for weeks now that underneath this sprawling medical complex, Gaza's largest hospital, claiming that Hamas below it operates one of its largest command and control centers.And as you said, US officials now appear to be backing up that claim, saying that Hamas is indeed using this facility. They have released imagery, satellite imagery that shows where they say that some of these locations are based. They have released 3D graphics claiming to show what these facilities look like below ground. And right now, Jake, we are also learning new information about Al- Rantisi Hospital, a children's hospital in Gaza, where Israeli officials say that they found a cache of weapons in the basement. We can't independently verify those claims of course, but they have released video showing some of those weapons which appear to include AK-47's and suicide vest and other weaponry as well as what they say is potential evidence that hostages were also being held in the basement of Al-Rantisi Hospital. They show a room that has curtains draped around it and a woman's -- some evidence that a woman may have been in that area. Now today, Israeli forces also released evidence that they say shows Hamas militants with an RPG weapon near the entrance of Al-Quds Hospital. This is Gaza's second largest hospital where there has been some fierce fighting between Israeli forces and Hamas militants. And hospital officials have been talking about Israeli forces surrounding the hospital. And so today, Israeli military releasing this video appearing to show a man with a rocket propelled grenade on his shoulder in front of the entrance. Now we can't independently verify when this video was taken, but we can confirm that the image does indeed show the entrance to Al-Quds Hospital.",

Apparently, a protest and a counter- protest got a little out of hand. So, college brass threatened students if they didn't disperse by a deadline, they would be suspended. Then it appears they found out that quite a few of the students involved are foreign nationals. So, if they were suspended, they would lose their visas and they'd be thrown out of the country. So, MIT dialed back a little bit and said, well, as an interim measure, we're gonna suspend them just from non-academic activities on campus.

So, when you're saying things like globalize the Intifada, use your two fists to sacrifice everything for Palestine and one solution, Intifada, you know, we know what happened during the second Intifada. It was suicide bombings and attacks against Israeli civilians in Israel.But the other part of it is that these people aren't just protesting outside and exercising the right to free speech, which I fully support as an American. It's that they're going, you know, they went to the personal offices of a program that runs Israel internships on MIT's campus. And they went to the offices of the people who work for this program, and they tried to enter. They were going from door to door trying to unlock the doors. And the people who worked in this office had no idea what these students were trying to do by trying to get into their office. They were yelling, they were accusing them of apartheid, of ethnic cleansing, of genocide. And it was a really frightening experience. Another frightening experience that a friend of mine experienced is she has a child in the MIT daycare. So, these people were going around campus protesting, yelling anti-Israel things and they were doing it in front of the daycare and she was called to pick up her child early because they were worried that it would go -- it would get violent. And an MIT student who's come here from Israel who has a child at the MIT daycare shouldn't have to worry about her own safety, about her child's safety on campus. She should be able to focus on her studying and that she came to America to do.",
