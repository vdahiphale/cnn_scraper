Let me walk you through what will happen here over the next several hours.At about 9:30 a.m., the defendant, Donald Trump, the former President of the United States -- he will show up. We expect he may say a few words before he enters the courtroom. He does almost every day. When he speaks today, though, it will be different because today is the day the jury gets the case against him. At 10:00, the jury will enter the courtroom and the judge will give them instructions. This is one of the most important parts of the entire trial. The jury will learn what exactly they will be deciding on in the 34 counts against Donald Trump and where they will decide on guilt or innocence. Then at about 11:00, after about an hour of jury instructions, the jury will go behind closed doors and they will begin to deliberate. What happens after that, who knows? With me now, CNN legal analyst and former defense attorney, Joey Jackson -- or current defense attorney, I should say -- Joey Jackson. And also with us, defense attorney and former White House lawyer, Jim Schultz. Gentlemen, thank you so much for being with us. Joey, let me just start with you on what we will see.

They are about the credibility of the witnesses, assessing what facts were proven and what facts are not. The judge is the person who is there to really preside over the law, and that's what the judge will do. In jury instructions, now that you have the facts -- that is, the jury -- they now have to be given well, what are we applying these facts to? What are the general principles of law? And these real principles, John, are very much -- I don't want to say rote, but they are quite common, right? You give instruction to the jury with regard to what reasonable doubt is, right? With regard to what interested witnesses are. With regard to what intent is. With respect to what falsification of business records are and what you have to conclude in order to do that. With regard to concealment of another crime. What is that other crime? What could it be and what mens rea -- that is a fancy term, as Jim will tell you, for the mental state, right, that needs to be applied with respect to reaching those conclusions. So, really looking for the judge to instruct the jury on the applicable principles that they have to apply to the case in order to render a verdict that, the judge will inform them, has to be unanimous -- all have to agree -- in order to make a determination as to guilt or lack thereof.",

They'll also say he signed the various invoices or not, which shows some kind of intent to also falsify. Well, again, that's the prosecution's argument. The defense will try to blow that -- or did try to blow that up with Michael Cohen. Joey, another key part of this is that to make this a felony, they'll have to falsify the documents in order to conceal or cover up another crime. In this case, that other crime is a campaign finance violation. And during the closing arguments we heard both sides go after that. The prosecution suggesting, in a way, this is a type of clear garden variety campaign finance violation. Michael Cohen put $130,000 into something that was to help the campaign. Donald Trump reimbursed him. That's illegal.What instruction are you looking for in there?",

As to, specifically, this other crime, that's a big issue. I think there was a lot made over why in terms of due process. What is due process, right, John? Notice in the opportunity to be heard. And I think the criticism was what is that specific other crime that the prosecutor is talking about? Is it a tax crime? Is it a campaign finance crime? What is it?

Two people are missing after an explosion in Youngstown, Ohio. This is the aftermath of it. This happened yesterday. The city's fire chief says the cause of the explosion in the city's downtown area is under investigation, but they believe it may have been the result of a gas leak. The explosion also left seven people wounded. And for the first time, Major League Baseball will incorporate Negro League stats into its historical records. This is according to new reporting from USA Today. The decision, which is expected to be announced and go into effect today, is a long time coming and will also alter the record books.

That flag that you just showed was a symbol of the Stop the Steal movement. It was flown at the Alito home right after January 6 when pro-Trump supporters stormed the Capitol complaining about the election results that gave the election validly to Joe Biden. And just further bringing in the context, John, right now, the Supreme Court itself, with Samuel Alito, is considering two important cases arising from those events. One, whether the January 6 rioters should be charged under an obstruction criminal statute for -- involving obstruction of a criminal -- official proceeding. And the other involving Donald Trump and his immunity claim arising from a lot of the protests over the 2020 election results. So what has come now is new New York Times reporting that involves a recording that neighbors of the Alitos made in February 2021. And this timeline is going to be important -- or potentially important, John. The New York Times has obtained a tape of these neighbors calling Fairfax County Police complaining about Mrs. Alito -- Martha-Ann Alito. They had gotten into a confrontation with Mrs. Alito over yard signs that were anti-Donald Trump signs. There had been some yelling. And these people called the police. And what The New York Times reports was on the tape was something to the effect of somebody in a position of authority needs to talk to her and make her stop. Now, I want to stress, John, that CNN has not heard this recording. CNN has not verified this. And CNN has tried to reach Justice Samuel Alito for clarification and not gotten any kind of an answer. ' He originally had told The New York Times that the reason the flag was flying in front of his home in January of 2021 -- this symbol of Stop the Steal -- was because his wife Martha-Ann had been involved in this confrontation and was actually just protesting these neighbors. It had nothing to do with January 6 or Stop the Steal. He had cast it that way. But this new New York Times reporting suggests that the real confrontation with the neighbors came later in February after the flag had actually been hoisted up, John.",

The reading in May, 102, up significantly from April. This was unexpected because some other consumer surveys -- most notably, University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey -- they actually got worse recently.This confidence measure, though, is particularly sensitive to the jobs market, and the fact that gas prices have been tame, and the Dow hit 40,000. All of that helps. But let's look at the trend. What stands out to me here is that confidence really remains pretty subdued when you zoom out, right? Even though the stock market has never been higher, and unemployment is historically low, Americans are feeling worse than they did in 2021 and really, worse than they did pre-COVID under Trump.
