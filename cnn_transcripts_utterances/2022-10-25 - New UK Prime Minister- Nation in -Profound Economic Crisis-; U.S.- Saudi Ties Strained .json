Of course, Hunt was brought into attempt to write the ship during Liz Truss's time in office. And he proceeded to scrap virtually all of her economic reforms; the same economic reforms that Rishi Sunak had previously warned would be disastrous for the economy and disastrous specifically for inflation. So perhaps that tells you something about the direction that he plans to go, especially considering - especially this is sorry, this is the details of how we're just coming into number 10. Right now, we've also seen some other cabinet members or former cabinet members entering number 10. There's let's just see what exactly that might tell us among those that we've seen so far Becky, in addition to the Zima Zahawi is also Dominic Raab, the Former Deputy Prime Minister James cleverly, the Foreign Secretary, was inside as well, all of her doubt in the former chairman of the Conservative Party, and then of course, Jeremy Hunt we also saw walking across the street shortly after he was officially reappointed as chancellor. But in his speech earlier today, Becky, Rishi Sunak indicated that he was going to go back to the basics of the Conservative Party manifesto their election promises, which then means improving the NHS controlling the borders a reversal of some of the plans that Liz Truss had to loosen immigration control in this country, support for the military and then reducing inequality between North and South. He also has a long way to go to uniting his fractured party between the Boris Johnson camp Liz Truss camp, and making sure that everyone is singing from the same song book. So he had this to say.

BenWallace is a man who has made it abundantly clear that he wants to stay in his current job, regardless of which the Prime Minister is, but he's also a man who sorry, that's Grant Shapps. That's the current home secretary in charge of policing in charge of immigration and borders in this country. There's another person that lot of eyes will be on what happens with that role in particular, given that Grant Shapps was brought in literally the day before Liz Truss actually resigned. And so if he's replaced, surely this would be one of the shortest tenures in the history of that department. It will also depending on who Rishi Sunak chooses dictate the direction that his government wants to go when it comes to immigration. And when it comes to immigration numbers, whether or not they want to stick to the pledge to reduce overall immigration or whether they want to loosen overall immigration. And just quickly, Becky just getting back to the Ben Wallace point and that is that Ben Wallace has made clear that he wants to stay in his job but also that he wants defense spending to rise to 3 percent. Rishi Sunak has a huge hole in the British budget to try to fill. And so whether or not he's appointed will tell you a lot about whether or not Rishi Sunak is on board to stick with that 3 percent of GDP pledge or whether something closer to 2.2 percent might be more his peed.",

On this day, it's an apartment building on the outskirts of town, two Russian S-300 missiles hit at one in the morning. WARD (on camera): So this here is where the first strike hit.

The fact is the anger towards them is rising and it won't go away, not in a month, not in a year, not even 10 years. In this southern port city people have become used to hardship. Since April there has been no fresh water here. The main pumping station was hit in a Russian strike. Now they gather every day and patiently wait to stock up. A few blocks down another line, this one for humanitarian aid. Will I be able to get something today, this old woman asks. We already have 100 people on the list, the organizer replies. Mykolaiv is less than 20 miles from the nearest front lines and just 35 miles from the Russian health city of Kherson. Last week, Russia announced that civilians must leave Kherson warning of an imminent Ukrainian attack. Ukraine called it propaganda to distract from recent Ukrainian military gains.

And students really have been at the forefront of this protest movements since they began in September.We've seen universities even schooled high schools taking part in these demonstrations which were of course, initially sparked following the death of 22 of Mahsa Amini very much focused on the regime. Severe restrictions on women's rights and in particular, the mandatory hijab, which is enforced often violently by the morality police, but this has really gained momentum and has grown into something far more wide reaching many protesters now of course, calling for regime change. That is certainly the message we've been hearing from those university students now taking part in those demonstrations. Just Saturday alone, Becky, we've seen at least 12 universities now taking part in these demonstrations, students taking over their campuses calling for regime change. And as you saw there in those videos, we saw the government spokesperson being faced head-on by students in his in their words telling him to get lost today in the holy city of Qom university students and they do not want a murderous guest on their campus. So clearly we are seeing very remarkable and grave signs of defiance from these university students. We've also seen videos on social media circulating showing women some wearing the hijab. Some, who've chosen to take their mandatory scarves off standing side by side together in protest against the regime, also saw some students flouting their universities, mandatory regulations around segregation. Women and men standing together in defiance against the regimes severe restrictions and severe human rights abuses as well but of course, there is concern around the crackdown, which is continuing to intensify. According to the Iranian prosecutor, more than 300 people have been charged for allegedly threatening state security. State media says that more than thousand protesters have already been detained. And of course, human rights organizations including the Norway based Iran HR group, which has been keeping a tally of the repressive acts of the government, has said that it believes several thousand people have so far been detained. And of course, we have seen as brutal and deadly tactics being used by the Iranian regime time and time again, we're now in the six weeks of protests and that crackdown is continuing to intensify. Iran HR says it believes more than 230 people have been killed. But of course, CNN can't independently verify that figure, Becky.",

We've seen in a while targeting a relatively new militant group that has grown out of really a disaffection for what's been happening in the West Bank, a disaffection with the current Palestinian Authority leadership and how they don't feel as though they're standing up against the occupation and against Israeli settlers. And last night was the deadliest day in the West Bank so far this year and what's already been a very deadly year for both Palestinians and Israelis. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) GOLD (voice over): Gunshots echo through the narrow streets of the old city of Nablus. As near nightly Israeli military raids targeting militants in the West Bank, reached new heights in the early hours of Tuesday. It became the deadliest day for Palestinians killed by Israeli forces in the West Bank this year, five killed and about 20 injured in this raid, according to Palestinian officials, and another dead in a clash north of Ramallah. The Israel Defense Force says they raided Nablus to target The Lion's Den, a new militant group that has claimed responsibility for deadly attacks against Israeli security forces and who Israel says is planning to target civilians in Israel. According to Israeli officials, soldiers raided and explosives manufacturing site for the group and killed one of their leaders. Palestinians claiming this man was killed in a targeted drone strike suggesting the Israelis are using new lethal escalations in this latest fight that so far had been focused on ground incursions. This new armed Palestinian militant group does not belong to any of the traditional Palestinian factions. They're mostly young male members bounded by the lost faith in their own Palestinian leadership to stand up against the occupation and Israeli settlers. A red ribbon around their weapons as a symbol of the blood of the martyrs won't go to waste. Their popularity is skyrocketing among Palestinians already with more than 200,000 followers on telegram, supporters heeding the call to flood the streets, chanting den in the streets of Nablus after the raid. As 2022 now remains the deadliest year for Palestinians and Israelis since 2015 with no end in sight. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
