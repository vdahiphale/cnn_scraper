Hello and welcome back to \"Connect the World\". Just five hours left for Israelis to choose their new government or at least try to. The stakes potentially huge for the country and the entire Middle East, can the centrist government and Prime Minister Yair Lapid remain in control? Or will voters take a hard right turn restoring Former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to office? Well no matter what happens, it's important to point out that every Israeli government in the country's history has been a coalition with lesser parties poised to tip the scales of power.

And just a few hours ago actually, this morning, a Former Prime Minister now Opposition Leader Benjamin Netanyahu cast his ballot at this school at this polling station. And it was the first time in 13 years that Benjamin Netanyahu cast his ballot, not as sitting Prime Minister and as opposition leader and he's hoping that today's vote will put him back in power. But what's also at stake is not just a referendum on Netanyahu, who by the way, is still facing an ongoing corruption trial. But it's also a question about the future of Israeli Government will and whether it will take that hard right turn because one of the parties that Benjamin Netanyahu will likely need to rely on to form a governing coalition while it's a far right extremist party. One of their leaders once convicted for inciting racism against Arabs.

At the end of the day they look to Bolsonaro really as their figurehead for what they believe is too much government intervention in their lives at the heart of this issue. We heard a lot of that from protesters, and we will continue to hear it. And as we have said before, Becky, this is a much divided Brazil much different from the kind of Brazil that Lula ruled in two terms when he was previously in office. And these people feel emboldened. They feel empowered to take to the streets because they feel they can enforce what they believe is the election result of Bolsonaro won and those they can do that with so called people power. What is important to point out here is that a Bolsonaro's allies, whether it was local elections or state governors, senators, Congress people, they were very successful through these elections, Becky, and in protesting if he decides to say that somehow the presidential election results were fraudulent. He is undermining his own allies who now have a lot of control over a lot of local governments and state governments in this country. Not to mention, you know, congressmen or senators.

CNN's Kylie Atwood is at the U.S. State Department, CNN's Salma Abdelaziz is live in Kyiv and Kylie, let's start with you. What have your sources been telling you about these Iranian shipments of arms to Russia? KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: yes, so what these sources are saying is that Iran is preparing soon to send a new shipment of about thousand weapons from Iran to Russia. And that they would include these attack drones that we have already seen Iran sent to Russia, but they would also include these advanced precision guided missiles. And that is significant, because that would be an uptick in Iranian support for Russia; we haven't seen them send those kinds of weapons to Russia yet. And we know that U.S. officials and western officials have been concerned about the possibility of Iran continuing to provide the support, particularly this kind of advanced weaponry, because it could give Russia a significant advantage on the battlefield. They are right now, clearly not doing extremely well with their own weaponry and the resources that they have. So they're turning to Iran, if Iran is able to boost what they're able to do on the battlefield that could be deadly for the Ukrainians. Now, these drones that we have already seen have been really deadly in Ukraine. So this advanced weaponry is highly concerning when it comes to what the United States is saying. They are saying that they're watching for Iran to potentially provide more weapons to Russia. And the Secretary of State saying just last week, that the United States is doing everything that they can to try and essentially up end these efforts, these networks from being able to allow these weapons to go from Iran to Russia, essentially, by doing things like going after the shippers or the manufacturers of these weapons. But it's still an open question as to if the United States could actually prevent a shipment like this from going ahead, because our sources tell us that these preparations are underway right now.

At times, using these Shahed drones, these Iranian made drones that really have terrorized local populations, including here in Kyiv. A few weeks ago, among the victims of one of those Shahed drones was a pregnant woman and her husband, they were sitting at home in their apartment. And why these drones are of such concern is, they have loitering munitions, they are self-detonating, they are hard to detect, and they absolutely send people reeling in fear. So could these be used to escalate, ramp up this attack against civilians. And then of course, we have to bring up those precision weapons. We know from western officials that Russia stockpile of weapons has been severely depleted since the start of the conflict, particularly, its precision weapons. And Russia has been using what little weaponry does have to target civilian infrastructure, to target the power grid, to cut off water supplies. So that could again, increase those attacks. And then you have to talk, of course, about the battlefield. There we know that Russia of course, has been suffering major losses, it's running out of morale, it's running out of troops, it's running out of weapons. So this could potentially give a boost. And you have to remember, U.S. officials are saying that Iran is not only providing these weapons at times, it's actually training Russian troops on the ground in occupied Crimea as to how to use these weapons. So there's more there. But then, again, just the bigger picture here, Becky, the fact that Russia would turn to Iran at this point in the conflict to obtain more weapons.

So really when it comes to these trials, these indictments were relying on Iranian state media and the information they have released over the past couple of days quoting judicial authorities in the country. They say that more than thousand people have so far been indicted for taking part in these protests over the past month that includes hundreds in Tehran province, as well as other parts of the country. And trials began over the weekend and are continuing in revolutionary courts. These are public trials, according to state media, and according to judicial authorities.

And the fear is, Becky that the authorities there will be trying to use these trials to deter people from taking part in protests that they will be trying to make an example of those who are on trial right now.

Well, the prime minister is acknowledging that lack of institutional knowledge and crowd considerations were partly to blame. The police chief also admits that mistakes were made. Paula Hancocks reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): How does a night of celebration turn into this, too many people in too cramped in area. Eyewitnesses claim a lack of police and no crowd control. Officials say many police were deployed elsewhere in the city were expected protests, admitting they have no guidelines for policing this kind of crowd without an organizer. Park Chang-Ki is a parking attendant who was working across the road. He says the crowds were significant by 4 p.m. Saturday. By 7 p.m. people were spilling into the street. PARK CHANG-KI, ITAEWON PARKING ATTENDANT: I believe it was preventable, local officials, police and firemen checked out the area the day before, they should have known how many people would come out. HANCOCKS (on camera): This is the heart of Itaewon and right here is the alleyway which sloped downwards towards the main road where many people lost their lives. It's around four meters wide, that's 13 feet. It has the wall of a hotel on one side and shops on the other side. Now one first responder said when she arrived here, all she could see was up to 10 rows of faces; she couldn't see any legs, meaning that victims were piled on top of each other. Now this back alley here, this is also filled with bars, restaurants and nightclubs. We saw from images just how crammed it was. In fact, we saw one man trying to scale the outside of a building to try and escape the crush. And down here you have the main road four lanes which just a couple of weeks ago for a festival were close to traffic. It wasn't close to traffic on Saturday, meaning people were condensed more in this area, 20 meters away from the opening of that alleyway is the exit of a subway which remained open, allowing people to continue arriving in the area. This video taken just after 9 p.m. shows the density of the crowd in a narrow alleyway. A photo half an hour later shows more people still arriving in the area by subway. So what are investigators looking for?",

There's been a lot of criticism that climate finance is not targeting developing countries, it's not being delivered to them.

And also, I think the four sectors that are focused on you know, so there's one part of it's about cleaning up traditional energy cleaning up the hydrocarbon production using a cleaner way, another part about other forms of clean energy that are more familiar in a renewable energy.
