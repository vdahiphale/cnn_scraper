Those words, part of the statement, issued Saturday by the Carter Center about the 98-year-old former president. CNN's Jeff Zeleny has more now from Washington.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF U.S. NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Former President Jimmy Carter, Americas longest living president, at age 98, is now in hospice care. On Saturday afternoon, the Carter Center, his presidential library and museum in Atlanta, announcing that the former president would be spending his days in Plains, Georgia. They acknowledge that after a series of brief hospital stays, he's going to be spending his time in Plains, that small town about two hours south of Atlanta, really, where he spent his entire life with the exception of his service in the military and his four years here in Washington serving as the nation's 39th president. Now, he has had many health scares over the years and he has overcome them again and again. Brain cancer, other maladies. But this is a different moment, we're told. He is in hospice care but his life is an extraordinary one. His post presidency, certainly spanning nearly half century, includes building houses with habitat for humanity, traveling around the world to fight hunger issues, to push for democracy issues. And he is, of course, a member of a very unique club here in the United States, the Former Presidents Club. And if you take a look at these images from the time where Barack Obama was sworn into office in January, 2009. You see that Former President Jimmy Carter here standing a bit off to the side with Former President George W. Bush, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and of course Barack Obama. That is a metaphor for how he, sort of, was. He was, sort of, a part from this presidents club. He really marched to his own drum, did his own work, did not live in the elite circles that many former presidents do. He went back to Plains, Georgia and he lived in the same home where he and Rosalynn, his wife of more than 75 years, lived. And they did their own work. So, his legacy certainly is a strong one. If you walk through the Carter Center in Atlanta, that really comes to life. The work that he has done, really, in all corners of the globe, is extraordinary. But Jimmy Carter in hospice care, we're learning on Saturday. President Biden was alerted to this. He's very close to the former president and the White House is keeping in close contact, we're told, with the Carter family. Jeff Zeleny, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

She has more, shall we say, fulsome explanation of what it entails. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. LEANA WEN, CNN MEDICAL ANALYST: Hospice care is a specialized type of medical care that is focused on ensuring comfort. And so, it focuses on reducing physical pain and also caring for someone's psychological needs, spiritual needs with an interdisciplinary team of providers. So, generally, people who qualify for hospice care are people who are near at the end of their life. People with life expectancy of less than six months, and individuals also who have an incurable medical condition. This is not about giving up on medical care but rather it's tending to the individual, tending to their caregivers, tending to the family. And it's a type of care, I think that's really heavily underutilized. There are a lot more people who are qualify for hospice care and who would probably benefit from it. And in this case, I'm sure that it was difficult but an important decision that the former president and his family made. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Yet, at the same time, we are seeing perhaps some signals that there is room for diplomacy. For example, the State Department spokesperson said that Secretary Blinken, in his meeting, did keep the door open to a possible conversation between President Biden and Chinese Leader Xi. So, we are just going to have to see how this unfolds. But I think neither side wants this to be the big sticky foot in a much broader discussion.

Did they want to get the attention of, you know, the leaders of places like the U.S., Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the U.K., the E.U.?Well, they certainly did get it. They got a statement from the G7 members, strongly condemning North Korea's launch of what is to believe to be an intercontinental ballistic missile, an ICBM, like the one that they launched back in November that traveled around 22 times the speed of sound, could potentially hit the U.S. mainland, Japan has warned, and was in the air for more than an hour. Now, this was essentially the same statistics with preliminary information. Today's -- you know, Saturdays launch from that November launch which was later determined to be a Hwasong-17. But the question now is that, is this an old North Korean ICBM or is it something new? Because remember last week, they had a military parade in Pyongyang. They have showed an apparent mockup of new solid fueled ICBMs, solid fueled dangerous because they can fill it up and launch it very quickly without spy satellites getting a glimpse of it, kind of a surprise attack sort of thing. And North Korean Leader Kim Jong-un wants to build a lot of these, wants to mass produce them. Also on Friday, North Korea threatened the U.S. and South Korea over these upcoming military drills that are going to be happening computer simulations. They call them table top drills at the Pentagon. But then next month, boots on the ground drills on the Korean Peninsula. So, don't be surprised. A lot of Korea watchers say if North Korea steps things up, I mean, they've certainly with an ICBM launch, they're sending a strong message and world leaders are listening.

Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter has decided to begin hospice care at his Georgia home after battling deteriorating health for some time. Now, Carter is 98 years old, the nation's oldest living president. He beat brain cancer in 2015, then faced a series of health challenges in 2019. His grandson, Former Georgia State Senator Jason Carter, says the former president is \"At peace with the decision\". Adding that his grandparents' home is full of love. Carter was the 39th president of the U.S., serving one term from 1977 to 1981. After leaving office, he founded the Carter Center and has devoted his life to advancing world peace, health and human rights. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken will be visiting Turkey in the coming hours, while there, he'll get a look at the rescue and recovery efforts and the damage from the devastating earthquake that hit about two weeks ago. Now, the death toll in Turkey alone rising to more than 40,000, according to the most recent figures in the Turkish Disaster Management Agency. Now, across the border meantime in Syria, more than 5,800 people are dead. The majority of them in rebel held areas, that's according to the United Nations.

Vermeer's paintings, their beauty, their size demand intimacy and quiet. And here was an opportunity to spend quality time with his most famous creation. GLASS (on camera): This is rare.

GLASS (voiceover): The Rijksmuseum has pulled off an astonishing artistic coup, the greatest Vermeer show of this or any other lifetime, 28 of the 34 to 37 attributed works. Vermeer himself would never have seen so many of his paintings altogether in one place.",
