It's home to roughly 12,000 Haitian immigrants who are residing legally there, most under temporary protected status because of the deteriorating living conditions in Haiti.But these immigrants have been targeted by former President Donald Trump, who promises to deport them if elected, and by his running mate who spread wildly discredited claims and conspiracy theories about the Haitians in Springfield. CNN's Omar Jimenez has been reporting from Springfield, and over the next hour, examines the long history of why immigrants have flopped to this city, including the recent influx of Haitians, and looks at what will happen to the local economy if they leave.
