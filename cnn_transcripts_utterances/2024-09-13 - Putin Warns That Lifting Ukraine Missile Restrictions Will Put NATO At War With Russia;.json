It's a hospital on wheels, evacuating dozens of wounded military personnel away from the Eastern Front as Russia's brutal offensive grinds on.

It is the fifth time that this particular UN run school has been hit. These are places of shelter and food distribution for people who have lost their homes inside of Gaza.The U.N. Secretary General is saying that these types of attacks must stop. The U.N. director of UNRWA Operations inside of Gaza has said that if they are allowed these types of strikes are allowed to continue, then this will undermine international humanitarian law, undermine the Geneva Conventions. And the statistics here, in this particular case, are staggering five times the school has been hit. 70 percent of UNRWA run schools across Gaza have been hit since October 7. 220 UNRWA employees have been killed so far in Gaza, according to the Irish Foreign Minister condemning the attack earlier today. Now the IDF says that they were targeting a Hamas cell there. It was a command and control center for Hamas. The IDF says that they tried very carefully to avoid civilian casualties. Indeed, they say three of the U.N. employees there were members of Hamas. Now the U.N. has pushed back. UNRWA push back very clearly on this and said these three people that the Israelis claim were working for them, but being members of Hamas. At the same time, they're saying there's no evidence to support that the list that the IDF gives to the U.N. claiming Hamas members working for the U.N., these names don't exist on those lists. That's what the U.N. is saying at the moment. But the reality here is, for all those civilians living inside of Gaza who depend on the U.N. for these shelters in U.N. run schools, they are all at risk. The IDF says that they will strike Hamas operatives where they have intelligence that leads them. They will try to minimize civilian casualties as best they can, but in this case, 18 civilians killed, 44 wounded. Nic Roberson, CNN, Tel Aviv. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
