Hours after the brutal regime of Bashar al-Assad loses control of Syria, the U.S. launches attacks on dozens of ISIS targets in the country. Concerns are growing that the terror group could try to take advantage of the turmoil there, and there is a new warning about the fate of Syria's chemical weapons stockpile.And charm offensive. Some of president-elect Trump's picks for key national security positions head to Capitol Hill, working to win over top Republican senators before their confirmation battles. In the meantime, Trump is laying out aggressive day one plans, including pardons for January 6 rioters. We're following these major developing stories and many more all coming in right here to CNN NEWS CENTRAL. We do begin with a major development in the manhunt for the killer of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. New York police are heading right now to Altoona, Pennsylvania. They are going there to question a 26- year-old man who is now in custody. Two sources telling CNN the man detained had a gun with a suppressor -- you may think of that as a silencer -- and also multiple fake I.D.s. And this just in. The man has been charged with offenses related to the gun recovered.",

So I was waiting for somebody to either pick up a phone, like happened in this McDonald's in Pennsylvania, or a friend, family member, classmate saying, I know who that is.

Now, if this individual who's in custody is the person behind this crime, the DNA should match to the individual, the print may match to the individual because you can't eliminate that somebody else didn't handle the phone. But the gun that he's arrested with, with the suppressor, that's going to be key. Once they fire a bullet through that gun and look at the shell casing and look at the bullet, matching the ballistics on both ends is a very well-honed science.

And she thought, that looks just like the guy. And she was wise enough to and sharp enough to call the police and check it out, because that's all you have to do is call 911. The police come over, check it out. And as they're questioning him, all of a sudden, more -- suspicion grows. He's got a backpack. He's got a gun. And then it takes off.

      "sentences": "Well, Brianna and Boris, we should go back to last week, because they believe, and that -- they being Trump's team as well as Hegseth and his allies, that they are in a very different place today than they were at the end of last week.Now, part of that is because we saw Donald Trump coming out twice, once on TRUTH Social, once in an interview with NBC, saying that he supported Hegseth, two, because of what we have heard from Joni Ernst. Essentially, they had a very frank conversation. Multiple sources told me and my colleague Lauren Fox back last week they weren't sure where it was going to land. However, we saw a little bit of what they believe was a shift in Joni Ernst's talking points over the weekend. It went from essentially being just concerned to moving towards the idea that he should get a confirmation hearing, that she was going to meet with him again. They view that all in a positive way. Remember, all this comes down to the math here, whether or not he can get across the finish line. Does he have enough votes. And they believe they ended last week and are starting this week with no hard no's, which for them is a very good place to go. So that's what we're looking at today. We also know, given the nature of what the allegations are against him -- there is alleged sexual assault, which he has denied, there is alleged alcoholism, which he has also denied, -- that they believe that they're going to have a tougher time with some of these female senators. You actually heard Pete Hegseth's mother on \"FOX &amp; Friends\" just a few days ago essentially imploring these female senators, only saying, I hope you will give him a chance. He's actually not a bad man. Now, this, of course, came after \"The New York Times\" reported an e-mail that she had written Hegseth back in 2018 when he was going through a contentious divorce in which she said that he was mistreating women. She has since said she has apologized for that. So let's go to the other two that are up on the Hill today, because that's obviously very critical as well. Tulsi Gabbard, one of the reasons why this is going to be so critical, one, she has a past. She used to be a Democrat. Now she's Republican. People have a lot of questions about her. She's viewed as a very controversial figure. But, so far, at least from the public posting we have seen, it seems as though her meetings are going well. Joni Ernst actually just posted this on Twitter. She said: \"Wonderful catching up with Tulsi Gabbard, a strong, proven leader.\" So, clearly, there, both women served. They are both former military. So, clearly, they're showing that she has some support for Tulsi Gabbard in a way we have not seen for Pete Hegseth. The other one being Kash Patel, who would be up for head of the FBI. That's going to be a very interesting dynamic, just given the fact that that job doesn't actually exist right now. Christopher Wray is technically in that job for a full 10 years. And just a reminder, Donald Trump put Christopher Wray in that job when he was back in office. It's a 10-year term. And he would have to fire him before Kash Patel could even take that. Kash is seen as a loyalist who has set some pretty outrageous at times things to a lot of Republicans. So whether or not they can make this work, that's another one that's going to be important for the president-elect, so keeping eyes on all three of these controversial figures up on the Hill.",

U.S. officials, of course, are keenly aware of the potentially huge ramifications and also just the uncertainty surrounding the events of the last couple of days. Yesterday, we did hear directly from President Biden himself, who said that the fall of Bashar al-Assad was a fundamental act of justice that presents, he said, a historic opportunity for the people of Syria to try to build a better future for themselves. The president did in his speech outline a couple of priorities, including, of course, the protection of U.S. forces in the region, including, of course, inside of Syria, protecting and supporting Syria's neighbors, and also preventing the resurgence of ISIS. And, to that end, the president announced that there were dozens of strikes aimed at ISIS targets inside Syria as well over the weekend.

I mean, we only have to look at the -- the proof is in the pudding, right?Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham is -- was formerly the al-Nusra Front. I was in the government when we sanctioned them, an offshoot of ISIS, by the way. And its leader, Mohammad al-Jolani, very publicly in 2017 disavowed global terrorism and cut ties with al Qaeda and tried to rebrand as kind of a more moderate, but still Islamist militia. I really -- I want to stress that, that this is not the beacon of democracy. And that's been proven in how they have governed the northwest of Syria. So we only need to look at recent facts and examples of the fact that they have crush dissent in that region. They did -- they have jailed and tortured activists. There were women who were living in that area who said that they were fearful and left, though they were not required to wear a veil and so on. And, that said, at the heart is an Islamist militia behind this that has governed with a conservative, if not radical Sunni ideology. And so we have to see. They have said the right things, as Josh said. So far, so good. But my experience in this region of the world -- and, by the way, when we have seen Islamist militias in other parts of the world, in Afghanistan, for example, obviously, when they take over, is that they promise a lot of things, but then, when they take -- when they want to maintain control, they don't necessarily carry out those promises.

So I think we have to understand the context of how we got here. And I think we have to realize that the HTS will evolve, OK? And the Syrian rebels are an amalgamation of many different groups that come from many different parts of Syria who are trying to work it out. And we just -- we have no reason to assume that they're going to impose some sort of Islamist Sharia system in Syria. It's not what they're doing. It's not what they're saying. So I think we just have to understand that this is a new Syria, a free Syria, and the Syrian people are going to figure it out. Now, how can we get involved without making all the same mistakes that all of our past administrations have made? Well, humanitarian aid, that would be a good thing. There will be a time to lift sanctions. And that should also help the economy. There's reconstruction. We can help them at diplomatic level. There's U.N. council resolutions that can be implemented to help the Syrians form a transitional government to get to the democracy that they want, OK? And we can play a big role in that. And it doesn't require one troop or one American soldier. Now, what the Trump people have said, what J.D. Vance on Twitter and what Donald Trump said on TRUTH Social, is that they want no part of any of it. OK, fine. The Syrians are going to figure it out with or without us, but we do have interests there. We do have allies that have interests there. And there are outcomes that we can help that would be better for the Syrian people and better for the region and better for us. And I say we should try to help those people, those suffering people. And we have a big chance to do it. I hope the Trump administration, at least several people in the Trump administration will take advantage of that, because it could make the difference between people suffering or not.
