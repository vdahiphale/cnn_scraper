I'm Fredricka Whitfield.And we begin in Ukraine, where Russian forces led by the mercenary Wagner group say they have the city of Bakhmut all but surrounded. Intense fighting continues on the outskirts of the city but Ukraine's military says its fighters are still in control and there has been no mass withdrawal of their troops. One Ukrainian commander saying every hour in Bakhmut is like hell. In Friday's fighting, a Russian missile destroyed a vital supply bridge into the city. Bakhmut has seen intense fighting for weeks, as Russia tries to claim a victory in eastern Ukraine. CNN's Melissa Bell joins us now from Kyiv. Melissa, where do things stand?",

      "sentences": "Well, we've just been hearing, Fredricka, from the British ministry of defense, saying that they understand that Ukrainian forces are under increasing pressure.That's what we're hearing from the ground, with one soldier on the ground telling us that they were essentially outmanned four to one. And this has been the story for the last few weeks. So Russian forces sending in more and more men to try and take every trench, every defensive line, at huge cost to themselves, Fredricka, first and foremost. There is also on the Ukrainian side, as we understand it, the lack of ammunition compared to what the Russians are throwing in trying to capture Bakhmut, but yes, for the time being, this town still stands with its four and a half thousand civilians still inside but increasingly encircled and of course, their prospects increasingly desperate as well. This is already, Fredricka, the most sustained battle of this war so far. This siege has gone on for seven months. And if you think back to cities like Severodonetsk, Lysychansk in the past, where Ukraine has adopted a similar strategy of holding on to towns as long as they could, despite the huge cost to themselves and for civilians involved, because it forces the Russians to degrade their war capabilities, what they have to throw at this war, but also their men. And that is what is happening in Bakhmut and has been happening these last few weeks with an increasing intensity of the artillery that continues to pound this particular town. Already Russian forces beginning to turn their artillery westwards to the next town that will surely follow once Bakhmut falls. Still one soldier telling us inside that this could take two days, it could take 20 days. It is entirely impossible to tell at this stage just how long Ukrainian forces will manage to hold out.",

He served as the U.S. senior defense attache to the Russian Federation. And he's also the author of a memoir of his time in Russia called \"Swimming the Volga\". Good to see you, General. So how -- what does it mean if Bakhmut were to fall? BRIG. GEN. PETER ZWACK, RETIRED U.S ARMY: Good to see you again. It will be a set back but not strategic. I think it would be a tactical, what we call operational setback. The Ukrainians have built already successive defense lines behind it, this does not create an option for the Russians who have to break through, penetrating breakthrough. And the way the Ukrainian defense, it is kind of defending the inside of the pocket now. And by, if they are -- if they do pull out and they probably will, they will be able to shorten their lines. Also, this has been a World War I type artillery battle, which plays into the Russian's strength. The Ukrainians are noble (ph). The Ukrainians are flexible and they maneuver well. This is the type of ugly mano a mano fight that they have done very well in, but they're going to pull back probably and that will be I think tactically wise.",

But it's also been a prestige fight between the Russian army and Yevgeniy Prigozhin of Wagner. So there is a lot of stuff playing on just beyond the tactical fight. They need ammunition.

Military commanders decided they wanted to stay. Why do you believe they felt it was important?

And I think, considering where Germany was a year ago, and now, I think we -- they have all come a long way. One other point about Bakhmut, Fredricka, on the 24th of February, that was the day we think that Putin wanted to have a big victory show-off to his people and the Ukrainians held Bakhmut during that time and Putin ended up with nothing that day.

Both of them were damaging winds. But we also had tornado and hail reports as well. Here is a look at where the system is now. The good news is the severe component of the storm is no longer. What we are left with now is snow and very gusty winds. The combination of the two is triggering very low visibility making travel very difficult especially across New England. Here's a look at where we have the heaviest snow still across states like Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, New York. Some of these areas have already picked up over a foot of snow, and you're talking about adding an additional two to five inches of snow on top of that. Wind also still a factor here, a lot of these areas, wind gusts around 40 to 50 miles per hour, some of them looking at 60 to 70. And that could take up even additional power outages on top of what we already have. That is the eastern half of the country. The next big system we're keeping an eye on is actually just now entering the west coast. The main focus for right now is areas of Washington and Oregon, but we're also starting to see some of the heavy snow and rain beginning to push into areas of northern California, even a couple of thunderstorms as well. That system is going to spread inland. So you're also going to start to see a lot of that snow tick up in the intermountain west, not necessarily today but as we finish out the rest of the weekend. Here's a look at the forecast. Again you really start to see. It is going to be wave after wave of a lot of these rain and snow bands that come in. So this isn't going to be one and done unfortunately for this area. Yes, they still need some of this rain and snow because of the drought. But we've made huge improvements in just the last five to six weeks. Looking at the forecast, you're talking snow being measured in feet across this area. Likely one to three feet for most of those areas. Along the coastal regions now you're talking one to two inches of rain. But even in some of the other areas of Washington, Idaho, and Oregon, still looking at, at least a half a foot of snow, to top out in a lot of these places. The concern is getting into the short period of time -- we've talked about this before, Fred -- the concern becomes mud slides, a lot of travel concerns, so we'll have to keep a very close eye on this in the coming days.",

There are members of the National Guard, up in the mountains, who are trying to clear the roads. But a lot of the residents that I talked to have told me it is just not enough. They're frustrated, and they are scared. They all shared similar concerns saying look, there's no food up here at times. People need formula for their babies, food for their pets, and medicine. They cannot get medicine, because all the pharmacies are closed, so there is just so much anger and frustration from the residents there up in the San Bernardino mountains and cannot do anything.

This is -- these are some of those findings that were released by authorities just yesterday. You see the most common symptoms -- headaches, anxiety, some coughing, also fatigue and tiredness, and also some of the irritation, pain, burning sensation on their skin. This is what residents reported the last couple of weeks. Ohio's Health Department basically working with local, state and federal authorities, assessing the conditions of folks there, and to see if this may again, may be potentially linked to the derailment that happened a month ago. Meanwhile, officials do continue with the testing of private water systems. So far they have tested some 157 of them, and they said that they have found no signs of any sort of contamination as a result of this derailment. But nonetheless, there's still plenty of frustration on the ground. Our colleague Miguel Marquez reporting all week from there and telling us that basically residents there, they want certainty, they want absolute answers about whether or not it is safe to continue to live in that community. And officials for their part insist that so far it is, that they do have the monitoring software and the equipment that is going to be necessary long term, as that cleanup continues and the track replacement also continues that likely will extend, Fred, into April.",

This is a place that you could not miss if you wanted to run for president. Now, it seems a lot more like a who's who of MAGA world. It is clearly the Trump show here. And several of those potential 2024 Republican hopefuls ended up skipping this event altogether. That includes Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, former Vice President Mike Pence, as well as South Carolina Senator Tim Scott. Now, it did not stop all of the enthusiasm for Trump, did not stop both Mike Pompeo and Nikki Haley for making their pitches for themselves in 2024. And as you mentioned, without saying Trump's name, they indicated it was time to move on for the party to pick someone new. Take a listen.

There is a reason why Donald Trump is the headliner tonight. You know, his son Donald Trump Jr. got a hero's welcome at this convention. But I thought the message from both Nikki Haley and Mike Pompeo who, let's remind our viewers, both served in the Trump administration, was fascinating. They both said that one thing that caught my eye, that seven out of the eight last -- seven out of the last eight presidential elections Republicans have lost the popular vote. That is the (INAUDIBLE), and that really gets to the point of some of the Republicans who want to move on from Trump. They're tired of losing. And in that subtle way, both Nikki Haley and Mike Pompeo are trying to make the case to this conservative faithful that we need to win elections.

You go from this big conservative gathering to basically a gathering of Trumpism, which is also why you have a separate or dueling retreat this weekend by the conservative Club for Growth. It's a very deep pocketed, influential group that focuses on limited government. And that's group has made it clear that they want to move on from Trump. So you have Ron DeSantis speaking about their retreat, Nikki Haley is doing both. She will be speaking there tonight. But I thought those two retreats were just kind of another, you know, metaphor, if you will; a symbol, if you will, of this divide in the Republican Party, whether you should stick with a person who does still excite a portion of the base like Donald Trump or you should really move on to someone else, and that is a fascinating debate we're seeing right now.",

You do hear a lot of that messaging from some of his closest allies on Capitol Hill. There was criticism from the most far right Republicans when President Joe Biden made that secret trip to Ukraine last month. And they questioned, you know, why for example, why isn't he going to Ohio, and why is he going to Ukraine instead? It is that isolationism that is really taking over or competing with this view that the Republican Party had for such a long time, the top issue, that involvement in the world, that the United States should take a stand against autocracies such as Russia. And you know, it really is a deep ideological fundamental divide in the right now, whether it manifests itself into aid actually being cut to Ukraine, I don't see that happening any time soon.
