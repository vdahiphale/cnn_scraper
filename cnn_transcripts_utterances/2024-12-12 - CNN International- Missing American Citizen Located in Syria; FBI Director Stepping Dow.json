CNN's Clarissa Ward makes an extraordinary discovery.And New York police say they have evidence that ties Luigi Mangione to the killing of Brian Thompson. And 2024 was the year of the U.S. election so it's only right that \"Time's Person of the Year\" is the winner, Donald Trump. The Syrian rebel group that ousted Bashar Al Assad from power is now trying to shape its future. Rebel Leader Abu Mohammad Al Jolani says his team is working with international organizations to secure possible chemical weapons sites. He's also promising to dissolve the toppled regime's security forces and shut down the notorious prisons. One priority will be bringing home Syrian refugees. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Otherwise, you are arrested. And that seems to be exactly what took place. He says he was picked up by security forces shortly after walking into Syria. He was taken again to that regime prison. He says he was treated relatively well. He was given food, he was given water, he was given bathroom breaks, but he says he heard the sounds of people being tortured in that jail.

They say the 10-year-old boy died Wednesday when a gunman opened fire on an Israeli civilian bus near Bethlehem, three other people were injured. The West Bank has seen a major uptick in violence since the outbreak of Israel's war in Gaza.And police in New York say they have evidence that could connect Luigi Mangione to the killing of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson. The police commissioner says a 3D printed gun found on Mangione when he was arrested matches three shell casings found at the Manhattan crime scene. Mangione is being held without bail in Pennsylvania where he was arrested, and now police are focused on the months leading up to the shooting. A law enforcement official tells CNN, the suspect's mother told police that she hadn't spoken to him since July, then reported him missing in November. And now they want to know where he was during that time. Brynn Gingras is joining us now from New York with the very latest. Boy there are a lot of you know, so many unanswered questions, lot of threads to follow here. I wonder if first, you can help answer why is Mangione, kind of fighting extradition to New York? BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, Fred. I mean, it's his right. To be honest, there is really no one who has won a fight against extradition. Eventually the extradition actually will happen. So, it's really just prolonging it. But honestly, I've talked to sources here in New York who says they're not in a rush. Listen, they're able to collect more evidence, build more of their case while they continue this extradition fight. So, as you're seeing right here with this, with the NYPD Commissioner coming out yesterday, and essentially saying, look, we have more evidence to tie Mangione to this crime here in Manhattan. They talked about the ballistics of the gun that you just mentioned with your viewers, as well as fingerprints matching, saying, they say that matches a water bottle that was thrown out at the scene here, as well as a Kind bar wrapper directly tying, they say, Mangione to the crime scene. And this is the evidence they couldn't wait to get their hands on when Mangione was arrested on Monday. But of course, there's also more evidence that they have been collecting surveillance video from all around New York City. They have that fake ID, that New Jersey fake ID, that was on Mangione, and they say it's the same one that was used in a -- to check into a hostel on the upper west side before the killing. So, there's a lot of evidence that is still being collected, even still, though his attorney, as I just said, has the right to fight on his client's behalf for extradition, and he says that he's still waiting to see the evidence.

So that's interesting there.In the meantime, Fred, everyone, rather police and really the press, have been trying to figure out the whereabouts of Mangione prior to this killing, and we've learned he traveled abroad. We learned more about that missing persons' report from sources that his mother filed like you said. She said she hadn't talked to her son since July. She tried calling him. The calls would go right to voice mail. She tried him at work. The phone was disconnected, so she ended up filing a missing persons' report on November 18 at the San Francisco PD because she believes that's the last place, she knew he was and she also told police at the time she didn't believe that he was a threat to himself or to others, Fred.",

The strong winds that were fueling the Franklin fire since Monday have eased, and there could be some rain this Thursday, which could also help slow down the fire. CNN's Meteorologist Derek Van Dam is with me. Is it going to be enough precipitation to make an impact? DEREK VAN DAM, CNN METEOROLOGISTLook at the embers from this very, very intense fire burning so hot at one stage on Monday morning or Tuesday morning, rather, that it actually created its own weather system. So really incredible to see how it altered the weather there. Now, speaking of the chance of rain, that doesn't look like a lot of rain to me, but it will help, right? So, we'll see a few drops of rain pass through with this initial front, and then a secondary cold front moves in for the day on Saturday, still 7 percent containment. So, some marginal increases on that containment number since yesterday at this time. But this is interesting. So, the winds here, yes, they've relaxed from the northeast. That Santa Ana wind that funnels over the mountain ranges and speeds up towards the coastline has basically eased, but the wind direction has changed direction from the more of an onshore component. So, what this will do is will actually bring in moisture from the Pacific Ocean right here, near Ventura and Los Angeles counties. Los Angeles County is where the Franklin fire is burning, and you'll see that the dew point and the relative humidity will increase. So, this will bring more atmospheric moisture, and that will help aid the firefighters on the ground and in the air as they try to battle this blaze. So, here's the initial cold front today. We get a reprieve, bit of cloud cover from that, the change in the wind directions, a break, and then a secondary cold front for the weekend, perhaps bringing some additional light sprinkles, but again, not a deluge of rain to help extinguish flames immediately, but nonetheless, we will take what we can get from this incredible fire.",

Unfortunately, the Americans didn't do anything about it.I was in the government at the time, and some people were arguing that we should have said to the Russians, if you even leave the airport, we're going to shoot you down. But we didn't, unfortunately, and then they were able to really consolidate control. I don't think the Russians are going to fare well, even if some deal is made with them, because the Syrians remember how many civilians were killed by Russians. The Russians were involved in bombing with chemical weapons attacks and chlorine attacks on civilians. And so, I think Syrians will remember that. Turkey is in a little bit of a different place, and I think it will emerge stronger. But of course, Turkey might end up just focusing on the Kurdish issue. They don't want the Syrian Kurds to motivate the Turkish Kurds. So, you know, it's Turkey is a little bit of a loose cannon right now, but I'm hoping you know, they do have good relations with most countries in the region. And so, I'm hoping that you know -- there, of course, they don't want chaos on the border. Turkey was having been home to over 4 million Syrians, and has welcomed them for many years and paid for them. So, it's in Turkey's interest as well for stability in Syria going forward.",
