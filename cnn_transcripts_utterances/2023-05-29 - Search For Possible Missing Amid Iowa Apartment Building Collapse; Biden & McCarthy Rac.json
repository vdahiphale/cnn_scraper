Before this partial collapse, tenants of the building voiced and expressed their concern, calling the city, quote, numerous times for things and these repairs to the building were ordered by the city. So as you can imagine, as crews are there, right now, we're taking a look at some live pictures, you see them looking. We -- they're looking up. You see debris there. They're kind of sifting through the debris and even as they were searching through the night, we're told, some of the debris was falling.

They're going to have to decide whether to accept really the only viable option to avoid the nation's first ever debt default as soon as next Monday or reject it.And then -- and that's going to be the question, if they can accept the concessions that were made as part of this furious round of negotiations. That happened typically, negotiations that could take months to take place. They essentially had to do it in a matter of days because the White House had resisted any talks for several months because they wanted the Speaker to simply raise the debt ceiling without any conditions attached. The Speaker refused, demanded spending cuts. Ultimately, the White House bowed to that demand and cut a deal that is angering some folks on the left, but also angering some folks on the right who believe that the Speaker gave in too much. As part of this deal, it would suspend the dead limit for two years up until January, 2025. Conservatives wanted it much shorter to give them another chance to extract some concessions from the White House, but it also has a range of spending cuts that that would affect domestics programs that Democrats are particularly have protected and sought to protect over the years. And it would impose new work requirements on social safety net programs like food stamps, expand some of the existing work requirements as well as new work requirements on the temporary assistance for needy families program, things that progressives, in particular, are concerned about. So the question will be whether they can afford to lose votes on the left and afford to lose votes on the right, and put together a coalition to get this through the House. At the moment, the expectation is that there will be the votes. To pass this in the House, given that there are support from center left Democrats and 11 number of Republicans who are not a part of that far-right block of members who are willing to push this through, get this through the House as soon as Wednesday. And then it's over onto the Senate, which will have the expectation there that they could get 60 votes to overcome a GOP filibuster attempt to block it, pushing it potentially into the weekend just before that default deadline. So Congress again with his back against the wall, potentially taking up this very complicated agreement that the Speaker and the President reached over the weekend.

Both of them have been outspoken members who have criticized this bill. Another member to watch there, Thomas Massie. If all three of those members vote against this in the committee, tried to stop it from moving forward, it could essentially stop it in its tracks assuming no Democrats break ranks to vote. Its vote for this to move ahead. So that committee vote tomorrow will be so significant to watch going forward. And also, that was all part of the agreement that Speaker McCarthy cut back in January to become the speaker of the House on 15 ballots. He allowed three hard-right members to be part of that very powerful committee. The question would be, will that come back to bite him tomorrow in this key moment to try to avoid a debt default?

So this is an additional effort to the overnight effort, which essentially is directed at trying to get missiles through against the command and control structures inside Kyiv, and absorb as much of the Ukrainian air defenses, a lot of them supplied by the international community, notably, Patriot, but not just that from the United States, Germany and others, and Netherlands but other missile systems that protect Ukraine against the Russian dominance of the airs. It's a very careful balancing act there in terms of resources and the Russians clearly trying to get the Ukrainians to use as much of that resource and waste it on the low-tech Shahed drones, in particular in the overnight attacks, but these attacks during the day are much more sinister nature.",

The problem is I don't have a million bucks to give away.But what it does signal via him is perhaps Kremlin's suggestion that it will nuclearized its sphere of influence in the face of increasing pressure, both economic and military that it is facing more directly here in Ukraine over its illegal invasion of Ukraine. It is facing being an international pariah, it is facing economic hardship as a result of international sanctions.
