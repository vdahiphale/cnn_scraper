(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARAK RAVID, CNN POLITICAL &amp; GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST:  The main issue that is the main sticking point in those talks is the Hamas demand that Israel would basically we draw from this area in the middle of the Gaza strip that divides the enclave into two parts and prevents people from going from the south back to the north. Israel is willing to allow some gradual return from the south to the north, but it does not agree, at least at the moment, we draw from this corridor and the main thing the Israeli cabinet needs to decide is whether it agrees to this demand by Hamas because it seems at the moment, if Israel does not agree and Hamas sticks to its position, which is the case, right now, does not going to be a deal.
