Joining me now, Pennsylvania Republican Congressman Dan Meuser, who joins me from Pennsylvania. Congressman, it's nice to see you. Thank you so much for joining me early this morning. I suppose the - on this issue of fracking, you don't quite by her explanation. But, look, she and Joe Biden, they did not ban fracking when they were in the White House over the last several years. Do you think, though, that voters may give her a pass on this. May say, fine, she's changed her position and she doesn't support banning fracking. REP. DAN MEUSER (R-PA): Hey, Manu. Great being with you. Yes, I mean, certainly last night it appears she avoided a train wreck and, frankly, some of the follow-up questions and really no - I don't mean to criticize, were just nonexistent, particularly on fracking. So, what made the vice president change her mind? You know, that's a fair question. And then, what is your energy plan? Do you have an understanding of what the energy needs and demands are of the United States, and how does natural gas, particularly from Pennsylvania, or anywhere in the U.S., how does domestic energy work into that? And see, that's the biggest thing I think, that there was really no - there was no detail. I think they spoke about energy for maybe 30 seconds. They covered the border for about two-and-a-half minutes. The economy was about two minutes as well. I think the American people just have a real trust issue with the vice president. We certainly do in Pennsylvania. We can get into some of those details. Clearly a make-over is underway. Some people refer to that as a big con taking place.

That -- that's all terrific. And the fact that they wanted photographs taken with him for their personal use and purpose, that's a good thing as well. I get it. I think we want to do more things like that. The problem is that the video then gets used for a political purpose, and that's totally at odds with the standard, the law that would apply to Arlington and other sacred ground. So, it never should have ended up in TikTok. And for that he needs to be held accountable. But I don't want to send the wrong message.

But how many of those voters do you think are actually already in the Harris camp, who believe that abortion is the biggest issue that they're voting on?

When Republicans are seen as, you know, coming at a question that a lot of women are deeply alienated by, that becomes the most salient question and it becomes what is going to, you know, move them into Harris' camp.
