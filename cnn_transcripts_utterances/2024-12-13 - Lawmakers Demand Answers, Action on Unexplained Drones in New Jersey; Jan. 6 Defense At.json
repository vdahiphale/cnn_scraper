So, he really is digging his heels in, as are other local officials, demanding answers, trying to find out a little bit more. Also we're hearing from some drone experts. For example, my wife always makes fun of me for being a big plane geek. So, like using flight apps like Flightradar. We can actually track airplanes. So, experts recommending, when in doubt, open up some of those applications where you can actually see real time what planes may be flying nearby. But when you hear from some of these residents, it will tell you they have used some of these, and in some cases, some of the manned aircraft have not appeared on these apps.

The president-elect has repeatedly promised in the campaign trail all along the way that he is going to pardon rioters on day one. But it's not clear who he's talking about. One defense attorney right now is saying this, quote, the statements change every day. The latest is everybody's nonviolent. But who knows what that means? This comes after a new interview with the president-elect telling Time Magazine that came out just yesterday morning that he will begin handing out the pardons to January 6th rioters starting in the first hour, he said maybe even in the first nine minutes he takes office. CNN's Katelyn Polantz is following this one for us. Katelyn, what are you learning about all this?",

But a reminder, the rioters, they chose to trespass on restricted grounds, destroyed public property, assault law enforcement officers, and attempt to subvert the will of an electoral majority. Conduct such as this is light years outside the ages of the First Amendment. Every rioter is in the situation He or she is in because he or she broke the law and for no other reason. There was another Judge in Washington, D.C. Carl Nichols, a Trump appointee to the bench who said that blanket pardons for all January 6th defendants or anything close would be beyond frustrating and disappointing if that is the way that Trump decides to do it. But still a lot of questions there, exactly how this plays out.",
