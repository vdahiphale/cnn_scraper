Protesters against Trump and some of his supporters gathered in Manhattan today, the day Trump predicted he would be arrested in that hush money case involving former porn actress and director Stormy Daniels, prosecutors are weighing whether to charge Trump with crimes related to his allegedly falsifying business records to hide that payment from voters before the election in 2016 and who knows, perhaps even hiding it from his wife. Here in Washington, D.C., police are similarly preparing. Bike racks have gone up along the U.S. Capitol. Lawmakers have been told they might see extra police presence around the area.

I doubt very seriously that Trump has done opposition research or really has some stuff. I think -- that's the type of I guess it's called the truth, I don't Truth Social, that sort of doesn't have any basis. He just sort of -- he'll make that up in order to try and draw attention away from other stuff. So I think DeSantis is doing a fine job. I also think the other folks who have backed the president are doing a fine job as well. It's a real strange situation where you might be running against somebody but having to back him like Nikki Haley did. Look, DeSantis is in a tough position.

Nick Watt in Los Angeles, thanks so much.Today, a Virginia grand jury formally indicted seven officers and three hospital employees charged with second degree murder in the death of Irvo Otieno. This comes as a Virginia prosecutor released new surveillance video capturing the final moments of the 28-year-old's life that shows sheriffs deputies and medical staff piling on him and appearing to smother him. CNN's Brian Todd brings us the latest from Dinwiddie, Virginia. A warning, you might find this video disturbing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Handcuffed and leg shackled, Irvo Otieno is brought into the intake area of Virginia's Central State Hospital with some difficulty. Within minutes, he is on the floor. For the next 12 or 13 minutes, he will be held down by deputies and staffers, sometimes with a deputy on top of him. At points, his position changes or the officers reposition their grip. There is no audio, and for much of the video, Otieno is not in full view. At least once a deputy seems to use his knee to restrain him. Later, he is turned on his side. A person appears to administer an injection, and then CPR. It is not clear exactly when he died or his official cause of death. Today, seven deputies were indicted by a grand jury for second degree murder as were three hospital staffers.",

Police in Aurora, Colorado, say 45-year-old James Toliver Craig showed intent to end his wife's life by searching for ways to kill someone undetected by giving her poisons that align with her hospitalized symptoms.Investigators say Craig bought arsenic as well as potassium cyanide. Police laid out a chilling time line that began March 4th, when arsenic was delivered to the Craig's home. Two days later, Angela headed to the hospital complaining of dizziness and difficulty focusing her eyes, symptoms consistent with arsenic poisoning according to the police affidavit. Angela texted her husband that day saying, I feel drugged. Her husband James texted back just for the record, I didn't drug you. Investigators say Craig used a computer at his dental practice to research poisons. Police say his search history showed phrases such as how many grams of pure arsenic will kill a human, and top five undetectable poisons that show no signs of foul play. Police say around the time Angela was hospitalized again from March 9th to March 14th, James Craig ordered potassium cyanide online, the highly lethal drug was delivered to his dental practice, so concerned a staff reported what they found.
