      "sentences": "Hello and a warm welcome to our viewers joining us from around the world. I'm Max Foster. It is Monday, May the 13th, 9 a.m. here in London.It is Memorial Day in Israel and officials including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are marking the occasion at Mount Herzl in Jerusalem. The sound of a siren signaling Israelis to pause for a moment of remembrance there. Each year, ceremonies are held to commemorate fallen soldiers. This year, the holiday has special significance. It's the first since the attacks of October 7th which killed at least 1,200 Israelis. Despite strong opposition from the Biden administration, Israel continues to plan an expansion of its military operations in Rafah. The war has already left more than 3,500 people dead in Gaza according to the Ministry of Health. At least 63 were killed over the weekend. U.S. officials are warning that a full Israeli invasion of Rafah could lead to a massive civilian death toll. The Secretary of State says it could leave a vacuum filled by chaos. So far, more than 300,000 people have evacuated from Rafah but they say they have no safe options. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAHER AL-RABAIA, DISPLACED PALESTINIAN (through translator): We are tired and lost. We don't know where to go. In a small area, we are lost. No one is standing with us. Not Netanyahu, nor Muslims, nor Saudi Arabia, nor any Arab country. This is the destruction. We are working as workers. I left with a shirt and a torn undershirt. I'm working as a worker for 10 shekels. We are suffering from the high prices from one side, and the war from the other side, and we are displaced. I swear since five days, I only had one meal.

      "sentences": "It seems like they're getting more and more direct with their messaging toward the Israelis. Max, you heard Kevin describe what U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was saying. He is making increasingly clear that there will be no weapons used in, or the U.S. doesn't want any of its weapons to be used in this Rafah invasion.You also heard Kevin there say that the Israeli side claimed in that call with the U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan that it was taking U.S. concerns into account. But when you look at the situation on the ground, it is difficult to see how anything has changed beyond Israel just plowing ahead with its plan as it had already planned for. You have 300,000 people who have left Rafah, many of them going to this so-called humanitarian zone along the coast in an area called al- Mawasi. But this is a place where people have pitched tents. There's not much there in the way of infrastructure, certainly not the kind of infrastructure that you would need to support that volume of people for potentially an extended period of time. You also have very little aid getting in over the last few days. There have been some squabbles and some disagreements over the precise number of trucks, but no one is claiming that it is a lot, certainly not what is needed. In fact, UNRWA and the World Food Program say that they are at serious risk of actually running out. And this is just misery for the people on the ground who have told our CNN stringer there that, look, some are unable or unwilling to leave. Some of them are sick or they are just simply exhausted. One elderly man initially decided to stay, then he decided to leave, and he's going there on foot because he can't afford money for a car. Others are seriously doubting the safety of that humanitarian zone, saying that Israel may yet still strike it. And one other thing that is worth expanding on from what Antony Blinken said on his rounds with U.S. media over the weekend, and he threw some shade at the Israelis for not engaging with the plan for the day after the war. We know that the Israeli plan for the day after looks a lot like the status quo, with troops on the ground, with full control over Gaza's borders. The U.S. is working with Arab countries to try to formulate a plan, but Blinken there made very clear that the Israelis have not engaged on that, and they need to, in his view. This comes after you had President Biden last week talking about this as well. The U.S. has been in touch in particular with five different Arab countries for a plan to ensure the peace and security of Gaza after the war. And though he didn't say it explicitly, that sounds a lot like what the Turks are proposing for a sort of guarantor-ship system after the war actually ends, whereby you would have Palestinian allies, Arab countries, perhaps Turkey, keeping the Palestinians in line and making sure that they keep their commitments to whatever agreement is made if there is one after the war. And you would have Western countries or Israeli allies doing the same for the Israeli side to make sure that everyone holds up its end of the bargain -- Max.",

They need a firm hand to be able to manage that, to manage this massive ramp-up in industrial production.I think the unspoken thing here is that Putin is now in his fifth term. I think a reshuffle, certainly of this magnitude, with someone of that level of longevity, indicates that no one is safe, that no one will be allowed except Putin to accumulate power in Russia.

They call it this no-limits partnership.And the issue here is the U.S. is extremely worried and has expressed as much to China that China is giving Russia significant help when it comes to ramping up that military production, everything from, you know, drone engines to actual joint production of drones, according to Biden administration officials, on Russian soil. So the West has been really working hard to discourage China in this. So from that perspective, in terms of how it feeds into the war in Ukraine, despite what China says about being in favor of peace, I think that is the element that will be most closely watched here.",

The testimony of Michael Cohen, Trump's one-time attorney and fixer, could make or break the Manhattan District Attorney's case against the former president. He's the only witness who will testify about Trump's involvement in both the alleged decision to pay adult film actress Stormy Daniels $130,000 to keep her from going public about a past encounter with the former president ahead of the 2016 election and the plan to reimburse Cohen for advancing the money.Now tying Trump to both the decision to pay Daniels and the reimbursement is critical for prosecutors who are seeking to prove Trump allegedly falsified business records to keep Daniels quiet. Now the jurors have already heard a lot about Cohen from other witnesses who have testified over the last three weeks and most of it has been unflattering. Trump's defense attorneys will likely try to further undercut Cohen's credibility during what is sure to be a tense cross-examination. Prosecutors meanwhile have tried to lay the groundwork for Cohen's testimony by introducing documents including emails and texts they say back up his version of events. Ultimately the case could come down to whether or not the jury finds Cohen's testimony credible or if Trump's attorneys are able to convince them otherwise. Zachary Cohen, CNN Washington.
