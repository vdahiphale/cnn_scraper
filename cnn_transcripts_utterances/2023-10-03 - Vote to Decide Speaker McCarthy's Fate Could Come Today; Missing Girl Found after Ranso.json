We haven't seen a move like this in more than a century. And it comes when Congress is already scrambling to prevent a government shutdown next month. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MATT GAETZ (R-FL): Well, I have enough Republicans where, at this point next week, one of two things will happen. Kevin McCarthy won't be the Speaker of the House, or he'll be the Speaker of the House, working at the pleasure of the Democrats. And I'm at peace with either result, because the American people deserve to know who governs them. (END VIDEO CLIP) MATTINGLY: McCarthy can only afford to lose four Republicans. Five have already said they would vote to get rid of him, and there's at least 13 other Republicans who are undecided but open to voting him out. That means McCarthy will need support from Democrats to hold onto the gavel. House Democrats are set to meet just hours from now to decide what to do. And sources tell CNN Speaker McCarthy will make a move as soon as today to try and kill the measure against him procedurally. It will give us the first sign of where his support actually lies.

About a quarter mile in that direction, Nationals Park, the baseball stadium. There are bars and restaurants all over this area. It is a very busy area. And yet at 9:30 last night, Rep. Henry Cuellar, right at this intersection, was carjacked by three armed assailants who didn't just make off with his car, his Honda, which as you mentioned, was later recovered. But they also took his phone, his iPad, even his dinner. Now, fortunately, the representative wasn't injured in the incident. We did get a statement in from his chief of staff that reads, \"As Congressman Cuellar was parking his car this evening, three armed assailants approached the congressman and stole his vehicle. Luckily, he was not harmed and is working with local law enforcement. Thank you to Metro P.D. and Capitol Police for their swift action and for recovering the congressman's vehicle.\" And look, Phil, all morning we have seen an increased police presence here at this intersection. Several of these police cars parked around the area. It's not exactly clear if that's solely because of this incident. Because the reality is, this is an area that is often trafficked by law enforcement, given not just the amount of people who live here but also the proximity to the Capitol there.

So they have trust issues with him for that reason. Many of them are unhappy about the impeachment inquiry he has launched into President Biden, as well. On the other hand, there is potentially an opportunity here for Democrats to extract concessions from him. Possibly around that impeachment inquiry. Could it be forced to the vote on the floor that Speaker McCarthy just skipped over when launching it initially? Could they extract Ukraine funding commitments from him, considering they weren't included in this continuing resolution? There's a number of things Democrats could ask for here. What it really comes down to: whether Speaker McCarthy is going to go for that. Because yes, it may save him his gavel, but it could create a boat load of other problems for him politically. JOHN AVLON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST/ANCHOR: There are far worse things we could face than if something resembling a coalition government results (ph). It would actually represent the will of the American people, as opposed to, you know, what Matt Gaetz and the radical right Republicans represent, or folks on the other side of the spectrum, which is an unrepresentative position that wants to push through their agenda. McCarthy is, in effect, being punished for reaching out to Democrats to stop the government from shutting down. What the vast majority of American people want is government that actually works that doesn't have these sort of self-inflicted wounds. This is a pattern with Republicans. Mark Meadows tried to begin a process like this towards Speaker John Boehner before he resigned. So look, whether Republicans are -- Democrats aren't going to fall over themselves to bail out McCarthy.
