That wild timing, the wild timing of all of this underscores the historic nature of this case. Trump was just in court to plead not guilty yesterday. Today he's back on the campaign trail.

And, of course, you know, we know that it may not be final, but she, obviously, is planning to move this case along. This is absolutely a completely different picture from the one we saw in the southern district of Florida, which, let's just say, has been a lot friendlier to the former president and his effort to try to keep these cases from going to trial before the 2024 election. In that case, you know, the judges there allowed Walt Nauta, one of the former president's co-defendants, to stretch out arraignment over a month. A month it took for him to be arraigned. So, this -- these judges are not feeling that. They are seeing -- they are definitely trying to make sure that this case goes to trial before the 2024 election. And, of course, the former president's legal team already began pushing back in court yesterday. They pointed out the voluminous amount of discovery that they have yet to get, that this is a complicated case, that there is weighty matters, obviously, of constitutional importance that are going to be dealt with in this case. So, they may yet get their wish. We'll see. But you can tell already that they are planning to make this about the 2020 election. They're going to really relitigate some of this.

European officials also believe it is highly likely. And one source for this story told our colleague Natasha Bertrand, \"Putin knows Trump will help him and so do the Ukrainians and our European partners.\" So that's why everyone is thinking about this.
