      "sentences": "Hello and welcome to all our viewers watching from around the world. I'm Anna Coren live from Hong Kong.Ahead on CNN Newsroom, nowhere to go. Some Palestinians say they are out of options as Israel conducts strikes over much of Gaza. Russia is claiming gains in Ukraine's Kharkiv region. Ukraine denies that, but is sending in reinforcements. And Sussex fever, Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, are a smash in Nigeria. How their visit is being received. Palestinians in Gaza say they have no safe place to go, as Israel conducts strikes from the north to the south. Israel is now conducting airstrikes and artillery strikes in Northern, Central and Southern Gaza. This is one of those strikes in the north. In the south, the Israeli military says about 300,000 Palestinians have evacuated Rafah to what Israel calls expanded humanitarian areas. The president of the European Council calls those areas unsafe zones and unacceptable. Well, meanwhile, trucks carrying aid are backed up at the Rafah border crossing. And Egypt is refusing to coordinate the shipments with Israel. Egypt's state-run media cites an Egyptian official saying it's because of the, quote, unacceptable Israeli escalation, end quote. Israel took control of the Gaza side of the crossing earlier this week. Well, Journalist Elliott Gotkine joins us now live from London with more on the situation. And, Elliott, the UN in Gaza said that the World Food Programme and UNRWA will run out of food to distribute by Sunday. I mean the situation is beyond dire. Is anything being done to solve this?",

      "sentences": "And I think it's clear that whatever is being done simply isn't enough. And the main problem here is that we are talking about distributing aid in an active combat area. And so as a result of that, the Egyptians who are indispensable when it comes to getting aid coming from the Egyptian side into the Gaza Strip, they are saying that they will not coordinate with the Israelis in terms of distributing that aid so long as Israeli tanks are on the ground. And with Israel saying that, if anything, its ground operation in Rafah is going to expand. It's hard to see how that situation is going to get any better.And we've spoken to the head of the Gaza Crossing Authority, and he tells us that no aid has got through to Rafah for the best part of a week. So, of course, attention then turns to Kerem Shalom on the border between Israel and the Gaza Strip to the south of where Rafa is. Now, Israel says that over the past few days, some 200, 000 liters of fuel have gone in from the Kerem Shalom crossing into the Gaza Strip. But, of course, the problem there as well is that that was closed for a few days about a week ago when Hamas rockets were fired towards it, killing four Israeli soldiers. Israel says that it's since reopened despite additional rocket fire. But it seems that whatever is getting through perhaps is having problems, not just physically getting into the Gaza Strip but being distributed. And, of course, you have drivers of these trucks who are simply scared to drive into these active combat areas. And as a result, the dire humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip is simply getting worse. And if you cast your mind back just about ten days when U.S. Secretary of State Tony Blinken was in Israel meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, I wouldn't say praising the Israelis, but certainly noting the increase in humanitarian aid that had happened since the since the airstrike on the World Central Kitchen had taken place, killing seven foreign aid workers. Noted the increase in aid, saying that that needed to be accelerated and sustained. But given the situation there on the ground right now, rather than being accelerated or sustained, the amount of aid going into the Gaza Strip appeared to have gone into reverse. And there's no sign that that situation is going to improve anytime soon. Anna?",

During Saturday's visit, Harry caused a lot of excitement when he joined the sitting volleyball game with Invictus team on one side and the other led by the Nigerian Defense staff. And they narrowly won by 25 to 21. Meghan watched and cheered from the sidelines and sat next to a nine- year-old Nigerian girl, Siwatokwe Akombe (ph), who told CNN after that she was, quote, so happy that she met Meghan today, and I will never forget it all my life, she said. The Sussexes have been well received in Nigeria's capital, Abuja, and wounded Nigerian service members have been speaking out. About what the visit means to them. One flight sergeant, Ifilma Owago (ph), told CNN she didn't know amputees could swim until after she lost her leg in a line of service. She added that her life has changed completely since getting involved in the Invictus Games. Nigeria took part for the first time in the Invictus Games last year, September, the first African country to do so. Ahead of the visit, Meghan had previously talked about discovering that she was 43 percent Nigerian through a genealogy test. And during a visit to the country's defense H.Q. on Friday, she wrote in a guest book that she felt welcome and at home. Nigerians have also been very vocal about receiving her. A group of women on Saturday approached Meghan and called themselves the Sussex Squad Nigerian, surrounding her after the volleyball game and chanting quotes, we love you, Nigeria loves you, welcome home.

We see these as sunspots when they get strong enough. We've been dealing with one of these large sunspot groups, one of the longest we've seen in decades as well, for this week, entirely through this week. And that's been the active area that's been launching these coronal mass ejections into space.And when they arrive here, they not only have billions of tons of solar material that bang into our protective magnetic barrier here at Earth, but following it, behind it is a strong magnet itself, magnets connected to the sun. And that can interact here with Earth. But what we need to happen is we need the magnetic field to be the right direction. And by that, I mean, Earth's magnetic field is pointed up. It comes out the bottom of our planet and goes into the top. So, along comes a CME. It needs to point the opposite direction is Earth. Otherwise, it's like repelling magnets. When it turns south, we connect and activity drives up. This entire passage of coronal mass ejections throughout the last two days has been with well connected southward-directed components that magnetic field and then that filters into our atmosphere and all the interactions that go on between those energetic particles from the sun with Earth's molecules in the high atmosphere eventually creates light and that's what we see as the aurora.",

Our magnetic field that we measure out in space, and, by the way, we do this with an instrument about 1 million miles from Earth, so 92 million miles from the sun, that's where we see these things like these CMEs reach. And then we know that they're about to reach Earth.And what happened this time is the normal magnetic field out in space, it increased by over ten times its normal background level when it arrived. That's quite extraordinary. And it was very favorable. Most of that was well south-directed. And therefore we had an immediate response. We drove up very quickly into the G4 levels and then not much longer later, we actually reached that G5 that we haven't seen since 2003.",
