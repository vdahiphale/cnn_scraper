But once they developed that surveillance team, that was, now we've got to dot Is and cross the Ts and get a judge to sign off on his arrest warrant and then get a judge here to authorize it in Pennsylvania.

It is not an element of the offense. But it is very helpful when you are trying to convince a jury that an individual has, you know, as the police have said in this case, picked out or targeted these victims specifically, jurors want to know why, what is the connection between this guy and his victims. And so that is what we're really trying to understand. It is clear that the officials in Idaho are greatly limited by their own state law and state Supreme Court rules in terms of what they could say about the investigation before he is presented before a judge in Idaho.

Would not be the first killer to keep something like that as a souvenir. That weapon itself could yield evidence, whether it is traces of DNA or blood and they're also going to be looking for clothing, clothing that he might have worn that night that could have other evidence. So, you know, you want to search that apartment where he lived close to the scene in Washington State. You want to get a warrant and freeze and search this home to determine what did he bring with him that could be evidence of the crime, obviously a warrant for that car as well.

And it all also goes to building that timeline, right? You want to be able to put him down in a place at a location conducting an activity certainly every day following the homicide and but also, as much as possible, in the days leading up to the homicide.

They asked him if he saw anyone try to convince Donald Trump to make a statement publicly, and here is what Ornato told the committee. I'll be honest with you, it was a very chaotic time in trying to get the information and it was usually late information or it wasn't accurate or it was the fog of war and it was misrepresented. And it was very -- a very chaotic day. So, I don't recall those specific details. There was a lot of him not being able to recall. And, again, the committee didn't think he was a very credible witness even though Ornato's lawyer said he testified truthfully.We're digging through the latest rounds.

The foreign aspect of it, I think, underscores the concerns that many in the national security community had when he was running for president and when he was president, that his foreign business dealings could potentially have impacted his decisions as president.

First, China has not been providing material support for Putin's war, as you know. How much does Putin need President Xi's backing right now, even if it is only symbolic? LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Well, as you've just said, Wolf, Putin finds himself increasingly a pariah on the world stage and he's looking for allies, for partners, North Korea, Iran and China. And although Xi and Putin are both authoritarian leaders, and we would think that they would be solid parties, Xi is certainly the top dog in this relationship. There is not a deep economic societal relationship and their partnership is transactional and opportunistic, and that is what you'll hear most China watchers say. Russia depends far more on China than the other way around. And I don't think we'll see China giving much in terms of military arms to Russia any time soon, because China is also very concerned about their standing in Europe. They don't want to alienate any of their European partners because they're actually probably providing about ten times as much to European countries than they are to Russia.

Not on the map is a smaller city called Kremmina, and that has gathered a lot of my attention because that actually is a key transportation hub. And Ukrainians are doing a very good job in terms of holding off continuous Russia human waves of attack.

      "sentences": "Well, the answer is not yet, Wolf. Sources tell me and my colleague, Lauren Fox, that the conference call ended without any major breakthroughs in McCarthy's quest for 218 votes, and that's despite the fact that McCarthy has offered a number of key concessions to his critics. That includes agreeing to an investigative panel to centralize all of the probes into the Biden administration.That is something he agreed to for the first time today on a conference call, that's something conservatives have been pushing for, and most notably McCarthy is also agreed to a lower threshold for a vote on deposing the sitting speaker. That's known as the motion to vacate the speaker chair. It is something conservatives have really been pushing for and it is something up until this point McCarthy has been reluctant to agree to because, essentially, Wolf, he would be allowing his critics to fire him at any point during his speakership. However, as he struggled to lock down the votes, he is now willing to come down to as low as a five-person threshold. That would be a major concession for Kevin McCarthy. But the trick here is that moderates on the call today expressed uneasiness about that threshold, and meanwhile the critics are pushing for the threshold, still wouldn't commit to voting for McCarthy. So, they ended the conference call agreeing to continue work over the weekend. They're hoping to resolve some of the outstanding issues and finalize a rules package, put that out over the weekend and then for McCarthy he's hoping that everything sort of just fall into place. But there is no guarantee that will happen and, of course, time is running out, Wolf.",
