And on this International Women's Day, we meet one scholar who is changing our access to women of the past. Those with the incredible stories that were not being told. That's ahead this hour. But first tonight, we begin with a major international effort to get lifesaving humanitarian aid into Gaza by sea. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen says a new maritime corridor from Cyprus to Gaza could open this weekend. She visited the Port of Larnaca today, highlighting the effort involving the U.S., the UAE, Britain, Germany, as well as many more. Cyprus is the closest EU member to Gaza as you can see there on that map, it says it bears a moral duty to help ease the humanitarian crisis. The U.S. military will facilitate deliveries by building a temporary port on the Gaza coast. President Joe Biden announced the move on Thursday night, saying it will allow a massive increase in aid reaching Gaza. But there are still many questions about how exactly that aid will be distributed when it gets on land, even though, the U.S. backs Israel's war on Hamas with money and weapons, it has been unable to convince Israel to let more aid reach those in need as starvation reaches crisis levels. Well, the U.S. and other countries have also been airdropping aid, but that's just a tiny fraction really of what is needed, and we've heard that from NGOs on the show. A tragic accident today also shows the risks of that operation. Five people in Gaza were killed by falling aid packages after a parachute malfunction. Let's get more on all these angles from our Nada Bashir, she's in Larnaca in Cyprus for us. And Nada, we are getting more details about this -- the C corridor as we just outlined. But while it does look good on paper, do we know just how quickly this is going to happen and the timeframe here, because as you've been reporting for us, the people are desperate.",

      "sentences": "Well, I think, Isa, officially, Israel has said that they welcome the U.S.' support in this seacorridor and trying to provide more aid that way. But privately, there has been a lot of pressure on Israel from the U.S. to open up another land corridor and to open it up in the north because as you know, even the aid that gets through Rafah gets through Kerem Shalom and gets in to southern Gaza. It is very difficult for that aid to get all the way up the Gaza Strip to the areas where people need it most. What's fascinating to see though is despite the official sort of welcoming of this U.S. move. Unofficially, people here do not for the most part support aid being funneled into Gaza to reach people who need it most, there is a strongly-held belief here that all the aid is being taken by Hamas. And for weeks now, we've seen these protests taking place at Kerem Shalom, the border crossing where people have been trying to block those aid trucks from going in, while government authorities essentially turned a blind eye, we went yesterday with a group of protesters back to Kerem Shalom, we found that the authorities are now cracking down. They're not letting these protesters through, but that is doing nothing to stop them. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WARD (voice-over): They marched with determination to the Kerem Shalom border as they have first six weeks. Their mission to block international aid from crossing into Gaza. The border police are waiting for them. \"There's a dangerous sniper fire and projectile\", the officer warns, \"I ask you to leave this place.\" But the protesters are undeterred, made up mostly of hostage family members, former reservists and settlers. They ignore the order and change course to move closer to the crossing. (on camera): So, you can see the trucks with aid over there. The police had been trying to stop the protesters, but then they've just cut through this field and they're pushing ahead.",

We have difficulty because, of course, the situation is not easy and then surrounding us, it's not safe, but we are trying to keep it open to give access to the patient.

We changed the shift also instead of to have like eight hour, we are working now 24 hour at least like that. It's avoiding the movement of our staff in and out. Then of course, we are now facing an emergency. Then we are using our stock and indeed you mentioned that the airport is closed. Then also the airport is -- the port is closed and we had still container that we were trying to ask for custom clearance. Then we are still waiting for.

And I thought, actually, if I'm going to put energy into this, then I need to focus my energy on women's lives. And I started editing, and I started creating articles, biographical articles about women. And after editing for a couple of years, I realized that I had written articles for women from probably about half, half the countries in the world. And I am a great believer in fairness and justice.
