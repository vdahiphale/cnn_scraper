The Israeli prime minister has been accused of sabotaging the deal a number of times. This has also come from families of Israeli hostages saying, for his own political survival, he has obstructed these negotiations and talks in the past. So I think as the day continues to unfold, we'll be getting a lot more reaction from the different mediators here and, of course, the United States. And you know, you look at what's at stake here.

There are risks that a retaliatory strike, however or whichever form it takes, ends up landing too many casualties. And Israel, for example, the risk of catastrophic success, so to speak. And then prompting a wider Israeli response. I think Iran has somewhat puzzled most analysts by delaying the response for this long.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) STEFANO POZZEBON, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The recovery operations are going on through the night for the bodies of the 61 people on board of the Voepass airplane that crashed in Vinhedo, Brazil. It's a residential city about 100 kilometers northwest of Sao Paulo. The plane crashed in a residential complex called Recanto Florido. And as you can see, there are still, even in the middle of the night, operations by the police, forensic medics and the civil protection unit, as they are trying to recover as many bodies as possible as quickly as possible under the rain, to recognize and to identify the bodies. Of course, because of the circumstances of the accidents and the state of that body, that could take some time. At this moment, we know that at least three bodies have been taken to Sao Paulo to the Institute of Forensic Medicine in the capital, Sao Paulo, about 100 kilometers from here, and that the relatives have been advised to go there. At this moment, Brazil has declared a three-day national mourning period. The governor of the state of Sao Paulo has already visited the crash site just behind my back.
