She blasted Trump for refusing to engage in a peaceful transfer of power back in 2020. She also quoted Trump's top general, General Milley, saying that the former president was fascist to the core. The vice president holding an event alongside more than 100 Republicans who are backing her candidacy over former President Donald Trump, in a move that's clearly aimed at winning over conservative voters.

They input what they're looking for. The app provides a list of recommended co-hosts. It fit what they're looking for including their location.
