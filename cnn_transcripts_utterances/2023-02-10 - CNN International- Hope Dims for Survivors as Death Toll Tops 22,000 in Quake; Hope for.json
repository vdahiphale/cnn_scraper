No matter how much aid is getting through. It is nowhere near enough. One U.N. official says people in Turkey and Syria need more of absolutely everything CNN's Jomana Karadsheh reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Endless lines on the road Iskenderun a devastated cities cry for help answered by a nation in shock, united in pain. These men tell us through drove more than eight hours carrying diapers, water and bread. Whatever they can do to help strangers who all they need can get destruction in every corner of the city. No building spared Mother Nature's wrath. KARADSHEH (on camera): So even in this part of the city where buildings are still standing, you can see that there are cracks all over these buildings. They've sustained damage. So we're going to have to walk through here really fast. We just don't know how stable these structures are right now.

I want to bring you one of those stories of family of six if we could pull up that video, a family of six rescued after 102 hours, since this quake, you're going to see in that video, there's one man standing by looking at the rescue.That is the son, the only member of the family that wasn't at home. When the building collapse when the earthquake happened two parents and four children all pulled out again, given to treatment. You can see that huge crowd how much it means to them to be able to see this family alive. One more story of survival. And again, this one being repeated, replayed on television here in Turkey. This is about two teenage girls who were also pulled out alive. Today, you have video there of little Ifa (ph), she's 15-years-old, she's trapped, wedged between two pieces of concrete. Rescue workers, you can kind of see how difficult these operations are. That was a 10-hour operation to get Ifa out. And you can see how these rescue workers approach this difficult work with such compassion, Bianca. They're talking to her they're asking her what she wants. She says she wants ice cream. They asked her what flavor they're going to get her they promised they're going to get it to her as soon as she gets out. They play her favorite song and it's extraordinary to imagine that these first responders, some of them haven't slept, except for a few hours now, nearly five days into the fifth day of this crisis. And again, these stories mean so much to a country so devastated, so heartbroken by this unprecedented disaster.",

These images show just some of the damage from Zaporizhzhia. And it comes after Russia also targeted Ukraine's critical energy infrastructure overnight using drones and cruise missiles.The attacks have caused power disruptions across the country. Air Defense Systems in Kyiv and Lviv have also been operating throughout the morning. So let's go there now, our Senior International Correspondent, David McKenzie is in Kyiv. David, how much of a departure or uptick in strikes and violence from Russia are we seeing?",

      "sentences": "Well, Bianca, it's certainly a significant uptick. As you heard there from the Air Force there's been a volley of missiles from the sea, from the air and from the ground, from a Russian forces attacking all over Ukraine and the east and the south there in the far west, and apparently also here in the capital region.Now the Air Force says they've been very successful considering the volley of missiles and drone attacks of intercepting many of those strikes 61 or so of the 70 odd attacks have been down. They say by Russian, I mean by Ukrainian air defenses, but it is a very significant uptick. Certainly the biggest such attack in several weeks. Now it does appear as you say that the Russian forces are trying to continue attacking energy infrastructure, at least two hydro plants were struck or attempted to be struck by the Russians. At this stage, the Ukrainians have been remarkably successful, keeping the power on large parts of the country. There have been planned outages ahead of the strikes to try and mitigate the impact to the power system. But it does speak to this strategy of trying to cripple the energy infrastructure in this country as people anticipate a possible spring surge of attacks from the Russians, particularly in the northeast of this campaign. So far limited casualties, it seems from today's attacks, but they were air raid sirens, all across the Capitol and across the country, as they were trying to intercept these attacks, Bianca.",

What will happen when it happens if it happens, and you've found that the expectations are sometimes in this case, pushed by both militaries to try and see how they will react?

But one senior U.S. official says the balloon was capable of monitoring U.S. communications and belongs to a fleet that has flown over more than 40 countries on five continents.Jim Sciutto is joining us live from Washington D.C. Jim, it was difficult enough to map and locate the debris that this balloon caused. But now attention turns to its potential capabilities and mission. JIM SCIUTTO, CNN CHIEF U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: That's right. Early on, the Pentagon had said it had a limited surveillance capability. But as we learn more new details, it appears that capability may be more so than initially assessed. So let's get into the some of the details here for one source is telling us that it was able not just to intercept communications, but also to geo locate those communications where they were coming from perhaps where they going to. Useful intelligence for someone watching, particularly U.S. Military installations here in the U.S., but had other capabilities as well. Able to take better photos, more detailed photos than a satellite at a higher altitude, including, as I'm told 3-D photos, something you could do when you're not taking pictures from space, but a little bit closer. In addition to that able to steer and to hover over targets that it might have on the ground here. Again, that gives you more time to gather or at least attempt to gather signals intelligence communications, but also to take better photos to get better images of things you might be looking at it on the ground. Why is this all significant, because when you look at the path of this balloon over the U.S., it went over a number of sensitive sites, military installations up in Montana? There's an ICBM base up there, you come down in Missouri, Whiteman Air Force Base, that's where the B-2 bomber, stealth bombers base. You come in to North Carolina, South Carolina number of military installations here, Fort Bragg, U.S. special forces, Camp Lejeune, and others. This is why as the U.S. looks at this. And then by the way, I should also note, Bianca that this was not just one balloon. It's the U.S. view is part of a network of surveillance balloons that China has deployed all over the U.S. before but also other parts of the world that we're learning more and as you learn more, it appears that this balloon was more capable than initially described.",
