      "sentences": "First of all, we expect schools to prioritize what is in a student's head over what's on it. But a school district in Texas has kept a student out of the classroom since August because it says his locs are too long. The superintendent now says that being an American requires conformity. And now this case is heading to court. Today, that student and his attorney are with us.Plus, President Biden likely needs Michigan to win reelection. The city of Dearborn has one of the largest Arab American populations in the country, and its mayor says he turned down a meeting with the president's campaign manager. He's here to explain why. And Dante Wright's mother is with us. Dante was killed during a traffic stop in 2021 when an officer said she accidentally pulled her gun instead of her taser. Well, that city just rejected a proposal to change rules for when police can pull someone over. And Dante's mother says more people will die. I'm Victor Blackwell. Let's start the show. So I'm starting with this story today because this is about more than hair. We thought about starting with politics as we usually do, but this fight that is happening in Texas is about more than a dress code. The school superintendent has made it about what it means to be an American. Darryl George is 18 years old. He's a student at Barbers Hill High School just outside of Houston. Now, he wears his hair, as you can see here, in locs. Next month, he has to go to court to go back to class because the district refuses to allow him back into the regular classroom unless he cuts his hair. And Darryl has either been under some form of suspension or even at an alternative school since the summer because his hair violates the dress code. He and his mother sued the school district and Texas Governor Greg Abbot in federal court months ago. They say that the suspension violates the state's crown act. The law prohibits discrimination on the basis of hairstyles commonly associated with race. But what caught my eye this week was a claim from the superintendent of the Barbers Hill Independent School District. He responded to the outrage over this case in a full-page paid ad. It was published in the Houston Chronicle, and here's part of it. He writes in this paid ad that, \"being an American requires conformity with the positive benefit of unity and being part of something bigger than yourself\". Being an American requires conformity. Now, we invited Superintendent Greg Poole to join us to explain how being an American requires conformity and how that applies to this, but he declined. And part of his response, he wrote this. \"The author of the bill in Texas clearly states in recorded interviews it protects locs and braids, et cetera which we have always allowed. She clearly states it does not protect unlimited student expressions such as length. This is not a Barber's Hill issue. It's a legal issue, and we are confident our interpretation will legally be upheld.\" Well, Darryl George is here also with his attorney for the family there, Allie Booker. Thank you, both of you, for being with me. Darryl, I want to start with you because you've been kept out of your regular classroom for months now. I just wonder, how does this feel to have to choose between your hair and being in the classroom?",

These are military academies, and they wear uniforms for a reason, and that being an American requires conformity. What did you think? BOOKER: It made me say, if being an American requires conformity, and the people that wrote the law have told you that length is covered, then why won't you conform? And then it also made me say, they're not fighting a war. There are safety reasons and issues and strategical reasons as to why military personnel do not have long hair.

Thank you so much for your time this morning.Let's go to Minneapolis, to Minnesota now. And despite all the changes over the last several years after the killing a black man at the hands of police, the marches were not about adding murals. They were not about painting Black Lives Matter down the middle of the street or taking Auntie Mama off the pancake box. They were about changing policing policies that would ultimately save lives. Well, now the Minneapolis suburb where Dante Wright was killed will not adopt new rules that would limit when police can pull drivers over. He was killed in April of 2021 after Brooklyn Center police pulled him over for an expired tag and a legal air freshener. Officer Kim Potter said that she was reaching for a taser but accidentally shot and killed Wright. Last year, Potter was released from prison after serving 16 months of a two-year sentence for manslaughter. As part of a settlement with the Wright family, Brooklyn Center agreed to pay out $3.2 million and make policy changes. While the policy would have restricted police officers from making traffic stop for low level offenses like having an expired registration or having a broken head or taillight, or, as it's described in the proposal, objects suspended between the driver and the windshield. The city council in Brooklyn Center rejected it this week in a vote of three to two. And Katie Wright, Dante's mother, blasted the decision. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Now, if you haven't been watching too closely, you've been hearing a bit, but not all of it, here's what's going on. I'm going to try to do it in about 90 seconds. House Republicans passed their own border bill. This is May of 2023.Senate Democrats killed that in the House. The Dem said that it did nothing to address the root cause of migration. Fast forward to the fall, Congress passed a funding bill to keep the government open. Now House Republicans needed some Democrats to get it done, so the bill did not include any border provisions. That angered some House Republicans and ultimately cost Kevin McCarthy his job. That same month, the President asked Congress for $105 billion, most of it would go to Israel and Ukraine, but Biden threw in about $13 billion for border security as a sweetener to get Republican support. By November, a group of bipartisan negotiators in the Senate started working to find a compromise on the border provisions so the entire bill could get through and start to let the money flow to Ukraine and Israel. Those talks have been going on for months now, and the Senate got close to a deal and then Iowa happened and then New Hampshire. And the closer that Donald Trump gets to the nomination, the tighter his grip gets on Capitol Hill. And Trump does not want a deal to pass. Here's his argument. I want you to hear it and the outrage from republican Senator Mitt Romney. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. MITT ROMNEY (R-UT): We have a crisis at the border. The American people are suffering as a result of what's happening at the border. And someone running for president ought to try and get the, you know, the problem solved as opposed to saying, hey, save that problem. Don't solve it. Let me take credit for solving it later.

So the goal was set for 80,000. We ended up raising about 86,000 under 48 hours. And I was told by the school district that a corporate foundation had came in and kind of cleared the debt. And then my intention was to still make the donation, set it up almost as a reserve fund so that the parents and students would have something to draw from and that was declined. And what I wanted to do then is -- my first thought was, I know that this is happening all over the country, all over the state, but I had to honor, you know, people's money and my word because I stated I was raising specifically for these students and that's what made me ultimately offer a refund to everybody.",

The Iowa governor, Kim Reynolds, said this, \"An EBT card does nothing to promote nutrition at a time when childhood obesity has become an epidemic.\" Your reaction to that characterization, that map in the work you do? CROWE-HOUSTONWhat they don't always understand is that a lot of times, parents are still working during the day during the summer. There's not always access to transportation to get to these meals. So what that EBT card allows families to do, it's an additional $40 per month per student that now they can go and add extra groceries on. And so we can't always weaponize how they're -- what they're going to purchase. We don't know what they're going to purchase. And to say that it does nothing for childhood obesity is an opinion. You don't know what if they're vegan and they're not buying anything but vegetables and produce for the house. You don't know to say that they're going to just be buying junk food. You can't state that for a fact. So, I think that this is a huge program that every state should have adopted because parents, food is more expensive today than it's been ever. Like, it's, I think a 7 percent increase. Raises stayed flat across the country. People are struggling, and so they need access to these funds to be able to provide for their children.",

There are negative stereotypes as black men being criminals, absentee fathers, et cetera. However, my experience as a black male, we are not those stereotypes. And so because of that, in my work, I create a positive stereotype of black men. I do that through color symbolism. I use the color white in my paintings as a symbol of innocence and purity. I also use the color purple as a symbol of being regal as well as a spiritual color. And I also use gray as a symbol of intellect and sophistication. You will see the portrait, or the figure fragmented, not painted whole, because that shows the emotion of the figure, because they do not feel -- they do not feel whole, and they do not feel free to be themselves. And so it is important to me that I encourage other black men to feel free to be themselves without any type of stereotype. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
