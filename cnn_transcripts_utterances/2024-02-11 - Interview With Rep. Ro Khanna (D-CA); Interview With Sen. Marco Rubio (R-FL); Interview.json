President Joe Biden appears to be legally off the hook in the special counsel investigation into his handling of classified documents, although the special counsel report was also a gift to his opponents politically, given its conclusions that -- quote -- \"Mr. Biden's cooperation with the investigation, his diminished faculties and advancing age and his sympathetic demeanor would be factors that would likely make it difficult for jurors to conclude he had criminal intent\" -- unquote. Mr. Biden came out that night to challenge the special counsel's judgment of his -- quote -- \"diminished faculties and faulty memory.\" And then he referred to the president of Egypt as the president of Mexico.

But he's telling a story. And, frankly, look, Donald Trump is not a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. He doesn't talk like a traditional politician. And we have already been through this now. You would think people had figured it out by now. What he's basically saying is, if you see the comments, he said NATO was broke or busted until he took over because people weren't paying their dues. And then he told the story about how he used leverage to get people to step up to the plate and become more active in NATO. He's not the first American president. In fact, virtually every American president at some point in some way has complained about other countries in NATO not doing enough. Trump's just the first one to express it in these terms. But I have zero concern, because he's been president before. I know exactly what he has done and will do with the NATO alliance. But there has to be an alliance. It's not America's defense with a bunch of small junior partners. Some of these are big countries with big economies. Many of them are doing more. The Germans are doing a lot right now.",

As far as how do I explain it to them, before I explain anything to them, I have to explain to my constituents, I have to explain to the people of Florida, I have to explain to the American people because I'm a U.S. senator. And my number one obligation is America. If America is not strong, we can't help any of our allies. And I will have to explain to them why the Senate is going to work all through Super Bowl weekend, which is fine with me. We're going to make a big priority, except on something that's critical to this country, which is the invasion that's going on, on our own border, on our own border. We're over -- according to a House committee and the documents and the statistics they put out -- I think these numbers are low, but let's just use them -- 3.3 million people have been released into the country who arrived here illegally. Over 600,000 of them either have criminal convictions or pending criminal charges against them. I mean, this is a huge problem and it has to be addressed and they put out a bill. They can call it whatever they want. It wasn't a border security bill. It wasn't tough. And, frankly, it was negotiated by three people. I don't begrudge it, but I wasn't involved in that negotiation. I didn't even ask for a bill.

But, as Trump gears up to fight that legal battle, President Biden seems to be in the legal clear, at least for now, over his own classified documents investigation this week. Here with me now is former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who worked closely with now-special counsel Robert Hur during the Trump administration. Thanks for joining us. I appreciate it. Let's start on the decision to not charge President Biden over the classified documents found in his Delaware residence and garage and elsewhere. This comes after Donald Trump was charged in his own classified documents case. You know Robert Hurricane. He was your deputy at the Justice Department. Do you agree with his decision that Biden should not be charged, it was not a prosecutable case? ROD ROSENSTEIN, FORMER U.S. DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL:  Yes, Jake. And it's -- most people haven't read the entire report. And I don't blame them. It's 345 pages, about 1,400 footnotes. It's very dense and well-reasoned. And I think, if you read the whole report, you will conclude that Rob reached a reasonable decision that, given all the circumstances, that prosecution is not warranted.",

The first issue is,what are the factors you consider in making a decision whether or not to prosecute? And Rob is clearly within Department of Justice precedent and principles in the way he went about making that decision. The second issue is what you release in the public. And the problem here with -- that's really baked in the special counsel model is that it's not really the function of a prosecutor to publicly announce the reasons why they're not prosecuting. And so when you layer that into the process, it can result in unfortunate consequences. The Donald Trump report, I think, got people upset in the same way that this one did. Lawrence Walsh's report about Iran-Contra elicited some of the same responses. When you conduct a criminal investigation, some of the information that you uncover and some things that you evaluate don't necessarily put the subject in a favorable light. And, ordinarily, that's not publicized. And I think that's a good thing. It's unfortunate that the special counsel process results in public reports that expose things that otherwise would remain sealed in Department of Justice files.",

And even if he hadn't, Congress would have used its Freedom of Information Act powers to get the special counsel report.It was going to be made public no matter what. And Robert Hur is a smart guy. He knew that. I want to read from a memo you wrote in 2017 in which you criticized James Comey's infamous press conference in which he criticized Hillary Clinton's handling of classified e-mails, even as he declined to prosecute her, a similar circumstance, although he wasn't a special counsel -- quote -- \"Derogatory information\" -- this is you writing -- \"Derogatory information sometimes is disclosed in the course of criminal investigations and prosecutions, but we never release it gratuitously. \"The FBI director laid out his version of the facts for the news media as if it were a closing argument, but without a trial, it is a textbook example of what federal prosecutors and agents are taught not to do\" -- unquote. By going to the lengths he did to critique Biden's age and memory, even as he was clearing him of a crime, how do you differentiate between what Robert Hur did that you say is OK from what James Comey did that you say is not?",

His job was to ensure the police collected the proper evidence, submitted it to the prosecutors. And, ultimately, it's up to the prosecutors in the Justice Department and the attorney general to make a decision about what information is released. Rob Hur was the prosecutor. It was his job to make that decision, to make that recommendation to the attorney general, who, as you acknowledged, has previously committed to make this report public. That's one difference. The second difference is the special counsel regulation. In the ordinary case, Hillary Clinton was not investigated by a special counsel. There was no procedure to make those reasons public. Here, it's baked into this regulation. Now we sit, Jake, 25 years down the road. That regulation was passed by Attorney General Reno in 1999. Now we have 25 years of experience. I think it's worthwhile to sit back and ask whether or not this is the right procedure. Do we really think that we ought to have prosecutors writing reports for public release of everything they discover and all the reasons for not prosecuting?

And if we decide that it's appropriate to move forward and bring charges, then we have to address that issue, the issue of whether a sitting president is immune from prosecution. The issue raised in this case, of course, is what, if any immunity does a former president receive? And that opinion, of course, the D.C. Circuit has already ruled 3-0 in favor of the government.

Dean Phillips has been making this an issue for the past three months, and we have an electoral process. And the president won overwhelmingly in New Hampshire.

But that's what it is. Now, some people like it. And I know people are going to slough it off as, oh, this is just a tough political campaign. The man is serving the United States in uniform overseas. So it's a below-the-belt shot against someone who is not going to beat him for the nomination. That's the thing here. Joe Biden's doing everything he can do to hand this election to Donald Trump. And his response to that was to go after a guy who's serving America and to say, oh, I'd encourage countries, I'd encourage Russia to invade our allies. That was the response? The political ineptitude alone isn't enough to be upset about. But, more than that, it's... (CROSSTALK)",
