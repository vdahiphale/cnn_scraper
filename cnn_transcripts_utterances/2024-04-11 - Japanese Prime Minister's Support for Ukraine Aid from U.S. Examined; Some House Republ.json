      "sentences": "Prime Minister Kishida has been a very vocal advocate when it comes to the role of the Russian invasion in Ukraine and what it could mean to other countries, specifically in East Asia. Prime Minister Kishida has really coined the phrase, Ukraine today could be East Asia tomorrow. And by that he means that if there is not a strong response from western countries to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, then countries like China could take away the message that perhaps they could take aggressive actions and take over other countries or other territories like Taiwan.So Prime Minister Kishida is really going to try to send that message. The underlying message there is that he hopes Congress will pass but the U.S. aid package to Ukraine, and that he really hopes to see that come through. And secondly, Prime Minister Kishida is going to really stress the strength of the U.S.-Japan alliance. It's been on a really strong point, and Prime Minister Kishida has been key in leading his country to that point. And he's going to want to celebrate the growth of the strength of the alliance.",

That is what one House Republican is saying as a revolt threatens Speaker Mike Johnson's short tenure. Could a trip to Mar-a- Lago and a meeting with Donald Trump help? Backlash in Tennessee after lawmakers pass a law that would allow teachers to carry concealed guns in their classrooms. And bad weather forces a delay in Augusta.

Wray will soon appear on the Hill to tell lawmakers he needs this tool to keep Americans safe.And what is Trump telling House Speaker Mike Johnson as a Republican revolt to oust him? Johnson now heading to Mar-a-Lago for a lifeline. CNN's Lauren Cohen (ph) has more on Johnson's fight and what is happening today on the Hill.

      "sentences": "Yes. OK, so Section 702 of FISA gives the federal agencies and intelligence agencies the capacity to have, and I'll be clear here, a warrantless search of a non-U.S. citizen not in the United States. So this is someone abroad, we're worried about them. We want surveillance, we want basically a wiretap on it, on them, and we're collecting information.In the past, there have been concerns that United States citizens have been captured in this communication. So let's say a foreign person calls me. We're talking, and the FBI then is capturing my conversation without any court approval. Because of that, 702 was reformed to make sure that there's disclosures to a specialized court. So this process has worked pretty well and has gotten tighter over the years, in particular, after September 11th. This reauthorization should have been yawner. Honestly, this is the kind of thing where, like, can we not do even the easy things anymore? And has now become another political lightning rod because of course, Donald Trump is sort of, you know, has, has his opinions out or down south.",

A huge number of the stings and stuff are using that. The criticism, as you say, is the idea that people on U.S. soil are somehow swept up to it, in it. And there are people who say, well, we should require warrants, then, to access the information about the Americans on American soil. Why is that something that the intelligence community doesn't want?",

      "sentences": "So they address that issue through two means. OK, so one is what's called a required  -- a minimization requirement. That means if they're calling me, that they've collected it, they have to either hide who I am or get rid of the information because it may be unrelated to any investigation or concerns. People are calling people abroad for lots of reasons. They don't know what that person is doing. So the first is what's called minimization. That is in the statute. It's a requirement.The second is, of course, disclosure to a court, the Federal Intelligence Surveillance Court. Every year, the FBI and the intelligence community is required to certify that they are only focused on non-U.S. citizens. The third, and this is, I guess there is a third, it's the most important. It is unlawful, unlawful for the federal agencies to utilize FISA, the FISA regime, to target us citizens as a root. So there's lots and lots of oversight in this regard, as we know, because a lot of this has been disclosed by bye FBI Director Wray in his attempts to keep to keep this moving. This is something that Republican administrations and Democrat administrations have utilized. It is something that civil liberties groups have worked with the federal government to minimize the potential privacy concerns. And there is an established protocol. And the only thing I have to say is if this thing does not get recertified, every enemy is now going to know this, right? So they're going to know that they are free to call whomever they want without fear of surveillance.",

It is a priority for them to help get it into Gaza.Over last weekend, the prime minister said that a new border crossing in the north of Gaza, vital of course, because that is where three hundred to four hundred thousand Palestinians are and the UN says, some of them are close to starvation. The prime minister said that crossing would be Erez. Come the start of this week, the COGAT, which is the Israeli body that oversees humanitarian aid transfers into Gaza said that they were still working on the logistics of it. The IDF now says that they are working on a new location. We have an idea of where it may be. The IDF says this is still work in progress, but COGAT, that body that gets -- helps get the aid into Gaza, said over three hundred, three hundred and sixty-eight aid trucks went in yesterday, reaching very high figures earlier in the week, highest figure since the start of the war. But what the White House is saying is look, it is not just a matter of getting the aid in, it is a matter of getting it to the people and to that point, we heard from UNICEF. A UNICEF official today who was in Gaza, at an IDF checkpoint separating the south and the north of Gaza. They had aid that they wanted to get to a hospital for dying children in the north of Gaza, they got caught up in crossfire. Listen to how their spokesman explained it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
