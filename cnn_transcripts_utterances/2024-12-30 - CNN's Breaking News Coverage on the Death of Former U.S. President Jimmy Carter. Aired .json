I'm Max Foster in London, this is \"CNN Newsroom\".And we begin with reaction coming in from around the world following the death of the 39th President of the United States, Jimmy Carter. He was 100 years old, living longer than any other U.S. President. The Carter Center says he was surrounded by family in Plains, Georgia when he died on Sunday after being in a home hospice care for nearly two years. Jimmy Carter, known for his dignity and devotion to service, also spent time building homes for Habitat for Humanity and teaching Sunday school after leaving the White House, but he dedicated his life to fighting for human rights and brokering peace in many parts of the world. It was also a key message during his inaugural address. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JIMMY CARTER, THEN-U.S. PRESIDENT: I would hope that the nations of the world might say that we had built a lasting peace based not on weapons of war, but on international policies which reflect our own most precious values. These are not just my goals, and they will not be my accomplishments, but the affirmation of our nation's continuing moral strength and our belief in an undiminished, ever-expanding American dream.

That's because Jimmy Carter lived a life measured not by words, but by his deeds. Just look at his life, his life's work. He worked to eradicate disease, not just at home, but around the world. He forged peace, advanced civil rights, human rights, promoted free and fair elections around the world. He built housing for the homeless with his own hands, and his compassion and moral clarity lifted people up and changed lives and saved lives all over the globe. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

George W. Bush called him a man of deeply held convictions, who dignified the office of the presidency, whilst Bill Clinton gave thanks for his long, good life.

We have also heard from political leaders across the state praising the 39th President of the United States.And here at the Carter Center, where we are, we have seen how many people, regular people have come here to bring bouquets of flowers. They've also brought candles that they have lit right there behind me at the sign. And we also saw a gentleman that brought a jar of peanuts to honor the memory of the peanut farmer who became the 39th president of the United States. And this institution behind me, the Carter Center, is very significant because after leaving the White House, he came back to Georgia and was able, through this place, keep on working on some of the causes that were near and dear to his heart, including promoting democracy, fighting disease and seeking international peace causes that he took and worked on all over the world. I was able to have a conversation with Craig Withers earlier. He is the vice president for operations here at the Carter Center. And when I asked him to describe how he is going to remember the 39th President of the United States, he said a couple of things. Number one, he said he lived a life well lived. And the second thing he said is that Jimmy Carter was a person who stuck to his principles, a very principled individual who always adhered to those principles. We are also hearing from the senators, both senators here in Georgia. John Ossoff said, for example, that among his lifetime of service and countless accomplishments, President Carter will be remembered for his commitment to democracy and human rights, his enduring faith, his philanthropic leadership and his deep love of family. We also heard from Senator Raphael Warnock, who called Carter one of his heroes. His leadership was driven by love, his life's project grounded in compassion and a commitment to human dignity. And of course, President Carter was admired and respected around the world. But nothing really compares to the love and pride many people here in Georgia felt for the 39th President of the United States. Raphael Romo, CNN, Atlanta. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "Despite Carter's deep roots in the deep south and his evangelical Christian faith, he proved to be a trailblazer and unifier on several divisive issues.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LARRY SABATO, DIRECTOR, UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA-CENTER FOR POLITICS: One of Jimmy Carter's secrets to success was he was determined in 1976 to move the party away from what he thought he saw as pure liberalism toward a more centrist view of what the country really wanted. We were still a much more moderate, even conservative country in 1976. He won a close election against President Gerald Ford. If he hadn't done that, I don't think he would have won. But it's interesting because the very fact that he did it caused liberals to immediately mobilize against him. And that led eventually to Senator Ted Kennedy's challenge to Jimmy Carter in 1980 in the Democratic primaries. That's one of several factors that defeated Jimmy Carter in his reelection race. He was an important figure of cultural reconciliation in a lot of ways after the 1960s. RON BROWNSTEIN, CNN SR. POLITICAL ANALYST AND SR. EDITOR, \"THE ATLANTIC\": He was an ardent, devout Christian evangelical Protestant to embrace rock and roll. He was a southerner who embraced civil rights. He was a Navy veteran who pardoned the Vietnam draft resisters. And, you know, he was someone in a marriage that to all the world looked like a very traditional union, but accepted and celebrated a more assertive role for women in all these ways. I thought he sort of cemented a lot of the cultural change that came through in the 60s. But if he was a figure of cultural integration, as I said, in some ways he was a figure of political disintegration. You know, he was presiding over the Democratic coalition that was really starting to come apart at the seams. And the best kind of model of how that, you know, upended his presidency was that many of his legislative achievements were attempts were blocked in Congress by conservative Southern Democrats. And then in 1980, he got a challenge in the primary from the left, from Teddy Kennedy, who thought that he moved too far to the center. He pioneered some of the, I think, reforms in the Democratic Party that Bill Clinton completed 15, 20, you know, 15, a dozen years later. But in some ways, he was a man ahead of his time in recognizing the Democratic Party had a change. He just couldn't bring enough of his party along with him, either on the right or the left. (END VIDEO CLIP) [03:10:00] FOSTER: Well, Washington is going to be a very busy city in the coming weeks, even busier now with the former president expected to lie in state with the capital there. A state funeral for Carter will be the third national event requiring special security in the days ahead, the other two being the certification of election results and the inauguration of Donald Trump. Now, Carter only served one term, but he left behind a legacy that endures to this day, as we've been hearing. We look back at how he changed the history of the Middle East and beyond, next on CNN.

AMANPOUR (voice-over): The final result? Israel would return the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt, a piece of land the two had fought wars over. Egypt would finally recognize Israel's right to exist and give Israel access to the crucial Suez Canal shipping lanes. Both leaders declared no more fighting. All three men would eventually be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. But one thing wouldn't change. Arabs called Sadat a traitor.

      "sentences": "Absolutely, Max. And it's also the fact that many decades later that peace between Egypt and Israel, the peace treaty, still stands.It has been standing for decades and even despite the pressures between the two countries given what is happening in the region at the moment it is still in place. So, it was a remarkable moment and a remarkable turning point for Israel to sign its first peace treaty with an Arab nation. And you hear this respect when you see the responses and the condolences being given by leaders in the region. For example, Israel's President Isaac Herzog. His response has said that he is a brave leader saying that he had the pleasure in recent years of calling him and thanking him for what he calls his historic efforts to bring together the two great leaders. We've also heard as well from Egypt's current President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi saying he will be remembered as one of the world's most prominent leaders in service to humanity. So the responses there, the condolences being given by the current leaders and current presidents of both Egypt and Israel shows just how secure that peace treaty is and the magnitude of the efforts made by President Carter. Now, the Camp David Accords themselves were supposed to be two parts so a very key part of this was to secure that peace between Egypt and Israel. But one thing that did elude President Carter that he did want to secure was the second part of an agreement and that was really to push the process forward to be able to have meaningful negotiations on Palestinian autonomy that we know that he was keen to also push forward the two-state solution, the creation of a Palestinian state. But that is something that did elude him and something he did refer to in later years. And we also did see in later years once he had left the presidency that he did become more critical of Israel and what he saw as Israel's treatment of Palestinians in the occupied territories. In fact, in 2006, he wrote a book called \"Palestine, Peace, Not Apartheid,\" a very provocative title which did cause backlash among Israel's allies and within that did compare the treatment of Palestinians in the occupied territories to that of South Korea's former apartheid system and that certainly was brought up many times in the years later and President Carter himself said he knew that it was provocative but he wanted to start a conversation. He wanted those in power in America to look at the situation through unbiased eyes he was concerned he said in this book that the pro- Israel lobby was skewing the debate and he wanted a much more unbiased look at what was happening in the region. But there is no doubt Max that what he achieved in this region was hugely significant and it still stays to this day many decades on.",

And when President Mrs. Carter rode that bus up to New York City and slept in a church basement to rehab a tenement building on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, that's when the world found out about Habitat. And that started a 35-year run of every year going somewhere in the world to build homes alongside families in need. And President Carter told me frequently that working with Habitat for Humanity was the best way he knew to put his Christian faith into action in a very tangible and practical way. He loved to build, but I think much more.
