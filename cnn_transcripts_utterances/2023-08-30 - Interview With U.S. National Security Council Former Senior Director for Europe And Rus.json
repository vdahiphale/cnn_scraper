So, what do you think, knowing, obviously, the way they think, operate, et cetera, what do you think this is going to mean to President Putin despite what you say it's really for domestic effect here in Ukraine?

I mean, we see, for example, that Russia's bombardment of Ukraine has in fact strengthened the resolve of Ukrainians. And, you know, throughout history we've seen that aerial bombardments very rarely have effect that the aggressor wants it to have, which is to, you know, break the spirits of the people who were under aerial attack. And in the case of, again, Ukrainian drone attacks on Moscow, it's meant more to signal that Ukraine can put certain basically physical objects at some kind of jeopardy in Russia. But the -- you know, the risk is, of course, that the Russians react to this. They rally around Putin and his accusations and Peskov's other accusations of terrorism and it has an unfortunate unintended consequence of hardening the attitudes of the Russians. I mean, basically, what the Ukrainians are trying to do with this is to also encourage the idea of Russia eventually engaging in some kind of diplomacy down the line, by basically saying, look, this war is a self- defeating exercise for Russia as well. I mean, I think, you know, we have to watch this very carefully because, of course, Putin will try to play this to his advantage. And I think, you know, the Ukrainians themselves are trying to calibrate this accordingly. There are downsides and upsides to doing, you know, this kind of drone assault on Moscow, Peskov and on other cities within Russia.",

I don't think we can talk about an actual negotiation at this stage. You know, you and I have talked about this before, diplomacy is often conflated with that. But basically, we have to have a lot of diplomatic support for Ukraine as well as for Ukraine's position. So, there's a dual track that's going on here, and I think that Secretary General Stoltenberg has been talking about this. I also know that the high representative Borrell of E.U., they're all thinking about this, how do you strengthen Ukraine's diplomatic position, not just Ukraine's position on the battlefield? We've seen President Zelenskyy meeting with the African Union, going to Jeddah in Saudi Arabia, going to Copenhagen in Denmark, you know, for example. There is a big diplomatic effort of foot here to basically make it very clear that Ukraine sovereignty and independence and territorial integrity has to be the starting point that anything we might ultimately do down the line in the negotiation.

I can't say what that long-term will be, but it's overthe course of the next year, of course, because we often think in short- term about this week, next week, you know, for example. There are all kinds of effects on the Russian economy, on Russian politics. We've seen all the episodes with Mr. Prigozhin, you know, for example, and his, you know, horrific death, which is, you know, meant to also frame, you know, people's thinking about this war inside of Russia and doubling down on the conflict. But what we've got to really see here is a constraining of Russian's options to keep continuing this. The economy is one part of this. But again, diplomacy is pretty critical and getting that message out to Russia that other countries will not always be providing lifelines and to cause of that conflict. So, again, we have to have a big effort to work with our partners in the African Union, in the United Nations and to basically demonstrate, just as the fluctuations in the ruble are demonstrating, is that although, you know, Russia can basically keep this war going for some time, it can't keep doing it endlessly. And eventually, we're going to have to come to some point where Russia, Putin and the whole system, you know, decides what they're going to do next beyond the battlefield.",

Basically it says, Wagner became, in little more thanfive years, a crucial plank in Russian power projection in Africa. The group launched election interference schemes, misinformation campaigns, military activities while offering plausible deniability for the Kremlin when anything went awry. Wherever there was chaos to sow or anti-Western sentiment to exploit, Prigozhin and his band of retired soldiers and ex- convicts were often found during the Kremlin's bidding in countries across the continent. So, Prigozhin is gone. We don't know what's going to happen to Wagner and whether it still going to have that role. But do you think, first about Putin, that these sort of -- the memorials, the popularity of Prigozhin is significant enough that it causes some kind of problem for Putin?",

I mean, the role of the Wagner Group and otherparamilitaries there was propping up, you know, individual -- individuals actually, sometimes in Africa but also individual regimes. It wasn't really doing something for the people, writ large. And you know, we know from a lot of the people that looked at this very closely, there's been quite a bit of popular backlash against Wagner and the kind of activities that they've also been associated with atrocities as well as kind of looting, you know, on something of a significant scale in African countries. On the domestic front, you know, I think that there is some risk there. We've seen, as you said, the memorials, they have to basically have Prigozhin buried and in almost a clandestine quiet fashion, keeping people away from commemorating his burial. I suspect, you know, sadly, that there's going to be more cleaning up. You know, euphemistically put inside of the Russian system if the kind of memory of Prigozhin or the idea of him as a martyr and as a fallen hero really get some traction and create some backlash. So, y es, I think Putin is going to have to be mindful in the domestic setting that there may still be, you know, some people who are willing to step up in the memory of Prigozhin. You've seen this in Russian history before as a kind of a folk hero personality that, you know, absolutely leads to more insurgencies and uprisings. There is some risk there. I wouldn't say it's an enormous risk, but I think it's something that Putin and the people around him in the Kremlin are going to be very mindful of.",

Can I start by asking you then what you have come up with in your meetings with the senior European and, indeed, Ukraine officials regarding next steps here in Ukraine for support of this war effort? JOSEP BORRELL, E.U. HIGH REPRESENTATIVE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS: Well, thank you. This was an informal meeting. You know, informal meeting (INAUDIBLE), just a broad discussion about the situation, first in Ukraine, second in Africa. But the main issue about Ukraine was how to continue supporting Ukraine, literally, politically, economically, diplomatically. And on the table, there are, first, the continuation and increasing of our military training mission that has already trained 30,000 Ukrainian soldiers, and it will continue until reaching the figure of 40,000 by the end of the year. I proposed to my colleagues -- and the discussion will continue, but my proposal is to create Ukrainian defense fund with an important amount of money, but that the -- it has to be taken by the ministers yet. And third, to provide ammunition to Ukraine, 155 millimeters. Because we have provided a lot of guns, but the gun doesn't work if it has no ammunition. And we have the commitment of giving to Ukraine 1 million of this kind of ammunition in order to continue the fight.",

But keeping in mind that what European Union has done to support Ukraine was something that it was inconceivable a month before the war. We had breaking a lot of the rules. Yes. Certainly, we have been discussing a lot here in Europe and also in Washington about, do we have to provide tanks, do we have to provide anti- air defense, do we have to provide fighters? And the discussion has taken, in some cases, from my point of view, a certain time. But the decision has been taken, the tanks have been provided and the ammunition is coming. So, yes, we have to continue supporting Ukraine and trying to do it quicker and better. But we should not dismiss the incredible effort that the European Union and the member states has done to support Ukraine.

And it was a landscape for the second World War II, you know. It looked like the German cities and the European cities being bombed massively during the Second World War. This country is being destroyed and Russia continues the war. So, yes, we have to prepare and to work on looking for peace. But this peace has to be a just peace. Recognize it that there is an aggressor and an arrest. And the aggressor has to withdraw their troops, Ukraine has to recovery its sovereignty and territorial integrity. And the aggressor has to pay for the consequences with the aggression. Do you think that it is possible now with the rockets falling in Kyiv and people dying in the streets of Ukrainian cities? No, I don't think so. But we have to continue working and the Jeddah process, what you said, and Ukrainian elite process was a good step forward, because more than 40 people went. And I think this kind of meetings increases the support of Ukrainian and prepares the ground for the future high-level conference to work for peace.

Meaning, that the day will finalize the ratification process in the Turkish parliament as soon as possible. And I expect that to happen shortly after the Turkish parliament convenes again later this fall. To have Sweden as a full member of NATO, together with Finland, will strengthen NATO. It will be good for the Nordic region, for the whole of NATO. It will also send -- it is sending a very clear message to Moscow that when President Putin tried to close NATO's door, he achieved the opposite. He demonstrated that NATO's door is open, that we allow new members to join the alliance. He wanted less NATO. He's getting more NATO in Europe. The exact opposite of what he wanted. Then as a Norwegian, of course, it's a good thing to see our Nordic neighbors joining NATO, but there are many, many challenges ahead for NATO, because as long as we live in a world with conflicts, with countries like Russia, we need to stand together. One for all, all for one in NATO.",

So, the kinds of constraints that I faced were obviously very different from the kinds of constraints that black residents of my county experienced. But I felt that we were similarly marginalized or similarly pushed aside in the centrality of white men in that society, and the openness that white men had to opportunities and freedom of choice and so forth, that I would not have. I was expected to be a lady. I was not expected to work outside the home.

And a lot of what I wanted toshow was just how awful the '50s were, the extent of constraints on African-Americans, on women, on everybody really, as the rules were so ridged in terms of family life and expectations of young people in particular. And I also wanted to portray some of the other things about the '50s that seem just unimaginable now. I went through Life magazine for the '50s, read it cover to cover and was so astonished to see some of the products being advertised that I remember, haven't (ph) existed for years and years. But you see things in Life magazine like food, what people ate. And, for example, advertisements saying, put 7Up in your baby's bottle and the baby will drink it faster, or a picture of a woman smoking while she's delivering her child. Things that are so beyond any possible occurrence in our world today. So, the '50s are a foreign country in so many ways. And I think the nostalgia for them is misplaced because it does not take into account of how constrained everyone's lives -- life was under this regime of expectation. But it also is a time when young people are beginning to challenge that and to see the misrepresentations of the lives that they are expected to lead. And so, the '60s, as they're commonly known as a time of rebellion and a time of change, begin, in my mind, in the 1950s and I try to show that in my book.",

Not that the individuals I knew were on television but I knew people so like them, and it felt very immediate to me. So, when I saw the videos of Bloody Sunday, of John Lewis and others being hit on the head and knocked to the ground and tear gassed because they wanted to go across the Edmund Pettus Bridge and march for voting rights, I just felt it was a moral challenge to me as a person that when you see this and do nothing, you somehow degrade your own humanity. So, it was, of course, about the rights that I wanted African-Americans to have. But it was also a question for me of who I am and who I would be. And so, I went and brought a car, together with my boyfriend, and we drove down to Selma and we marched the -- with the next march. There was a follow-up march. And so, we joined that. And I skipped various obligations in college, including a big, big paper for freshmen that was kind of a cap stone for the freshman year, and I just wrote some nonsense and left it for a friend to type and left for Selma. I had one wonderful professor, a sociology professor I went to see and said I'm going to cut your midterm. And he was very paternal. He was very concerned. He said, do your parents know about this? I sort of said, are you kidding? Of course not. He said, I want you to call me every 24 hours while you're down there so I know whether to send in the cavalry. And I said, what does that mean?

And it was the kind of first significant step in Harvard's movement towards acknowledging its past with slavery. And he came again when I was -- my last commencement. He was the commencement speaker. And he got up at the commencement and -- in the -- you know, his opening words when you thank people. He turned to me and he said, thank you for making necessary trouble. And when I was thinking about this book and what to call it, I thought, those words are perfect encapsulation of what I talk about in this book, which is, I just had to burst out of what was expected of me as a young woman and segregated Virginia.
