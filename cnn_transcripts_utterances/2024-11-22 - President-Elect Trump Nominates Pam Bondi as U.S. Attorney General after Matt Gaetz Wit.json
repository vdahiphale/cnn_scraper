Now adding new pressure to the controversy surrounding another of Trump's picks, Pete Hegseth.And this morning, Sean \"Diddy\" Combs will be back in court as his lawyers try for a third time to get him released on bail. What makes this bail hearing different? And six tourists, including one American, are dead after drinking alcohol suspected of being tainted with methanol. One person now detained in connection with the deaths. I'm Kate Bolduan with Sara Sidner. John is out today. This is CNN NEWS CENTRAL. The fate and future of the President-elect Donald Trump's cabinet this morning, cabinet 2.0, is facing its first big shakeup, hiccup, whatever you want to call it. Matt Gaetz is out and Pam Bondi is now in as Donald Trump's pick for attorney general. What is clear right now is that Bondi's path to confirmation appears far less -- far more stable and far less controversial among Republican senators than what they saw in Matt Gaetz. Some expressing relief to CNN in hearing that Gaetz pulled his name from consideration, aka, he saw clearly that the math was not there for him to survive confirmation. This raises new questions about the math for some of Donald Trump's other nominations marred by controversy and facing allegations that have previously not been made public. CNN's Alayna Treene, she's got much more. She's tracking all of this for us. And Trump quickly did move to name Pam Bondi as now his nomination for attorney general.

      "sentences": "Well, there's a few things. One, just to get back to the Matt Gaetz of it all. I mean, Donald Trump, after Matt Gaetz had been with J.D. Vance on Wednesday going around the Senate, meeting with the people who would be crucial to getting him through his confirmation hearings, many people reported back to Donald Trump that it was clear that the writing was on the wall, and that he likely would not have the votes to make it through. We've learned now that Donald Trump called Matt Gaetz on Thursday morning, telling him that the math was not there, but leaving the decision up to him to pull out and withdraw his own name, which he did do, of course, later that day. I'm told Gaetz called up Donald Trump and J.D. Vance separately to tell them that he was going to be removing himself from consideration.But to get to the Pam Bondi of it all now, I mean, you're right. He moved very quickly to announce a new attorney general. Part of that is because that role is the most important to Donald Trump. He really wanted to push aside all of the other confirmation, or excuse me, appointees that he had to make for different cabinet picks like Treasury, like Labor, and really figure out who would be his attorney general. Now, part of the reason he selected Bondi, I'm told, is, one, he has known her for years. She did serve in his first term as part of his White House counsel. She represented him during his first impeachment trial. He also loves to see her on television defending him. That has been a key qualification we've seen with some of the other picks as well. And she also knows people in Donald Trump's orbit, including his incoming chief of staff Susie Wiles, who, of course, her herself has been involved in Florida politics for a very long time. And you're right, Kate, that when I talk to people working on the transition process, those close to Donald Trump, they said that they were a little bit relieved that Matt Gaetz is no longer in the picture. That was going to be a very difficult battle for them to fight. Whereas they think Pam Bondi, of course, she still has a lot of questions that she's going to be confronted with by different senators, but they believe that she will have an easier time, I'm told, getting confirmed.",

Look, she has said in interviews that she is going to prosecute the prosecutors inside of the DOJ, looking at the prosecutors who went after Donald Trump and saying that, you know, they are going to be investigated.

He was never going to put anybody in there who was going to be a conventional attorney general, who was going to do the business of the United States and not the business of Donald Trump. And you see that today.Look, what's going to end up happening is there's going to be a massive brain drain from the Justice Department. And that's going to be incredibly hard to put back together after Donald Trump is gone. These are people who worked there, who are apolitical, sometimes for decades, people who could have gone to major law firms and made a lot of money, but decided to serve the United States instead. And what's going to happen now is that if she decides that her business is not to do the business of the United States, but the business of Donald Trump, and go after prosecutors who are doing nothing more than their jobs, one of two things is going to happen. Either nobody is going to want to work at the State Department unless they're full on MAGA, which is not great for the people, or they're not going to want to work there because they don't want to work for somebody like that. And what that means is effectively that we're not going to have competent, qualified people who have been there all along doing that. Now, maybe that's Donald Trump's idea of draining the swamp, quote- unquote. But the truth of the matter is, it does not do any good for the people who put him there.

But the reality is, is that if you're going to have an indictment and claim someone was sex trafficking, and if you're the government and going to use this critical piece of evidence to show that, and you're going to edit the video, number one, number two, take it out of context, number three, reorder the series of events, that's troubling.
