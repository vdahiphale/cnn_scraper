The fact that Biden -- Hunter Biden is now facing these three felony gun charges, does it make it, at all, more likely that Weiss could be seeking additional charges? DANIEL J. HORWITZ, PARTNER, MCLAUGHLIN AND STERN AND FORMER MANHATTAN ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY:  I think one's got anything to do with the other necessarily. I think that clearly the Department of Justice thinks that there are grounds to bring these tax cases which were joined in this plea agreement that fell apart over the summer. And then so to the extent that the Department of Justice was trying to make a deal with Biden so that all of these charges could be resolved in one fell swoop, that's what they were doing. Now, that the deal has fallen apart, they're going to have to proceed on different tracks.",

How self-aware was he when he filled those things out? So, that's a legal argument that a jury would have to accept that he actually understood and consciously decided to make a false statement on a gun application.The second is, you know, in the total -- in the totality of the facts, how sympathetic is somebody who struggled with addiction who clearly had some mental health issues? Whose sister-in-law finds the gun and says, I took it away, because I was afraid he was going to kill himself. These are all wildly sympathetic arguments that a jury may find, listen, I'm not going to convict this guy. So, I think that there are those the -- those two key factors, John.",

Nearly 13,000 workers total are on the picket lines right now. CNN's Vanessa Yurkevich is live at GM's headquarter in Detroit. Vanessa, give us the status. VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS AND POLITICS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, all eyes are on these three plants as these workers are now out on strike. The automakers are saying that they are disappointed that they were not able to come to an agreement with the UAW by midnight. The president of the UAW, Shawn Fain, saying shame on them for waiting to the last minute to try to come to a deal. I'm at GM headquarters here in Detroit. I spoke to Mary Barra about a key issue that the union has been pushing. They want a 40 percent wage increase over the next four years. The union is tying that to what they say that the CEOs have made over the last four years. Mary Barra has seen a 34 percent pay increase in the last four years. She makes about $30 million. I asked her if she thinks it's fair that they are only offering 20 percent when she, herself, has seen a 34 percent wage increase. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Later today, John, we expect to see the president of the UAW Shawn Fain with Bernie Sanders at a rally here in Detroit. He is going to be rallying the crowd around his message.
