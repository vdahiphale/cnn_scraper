This idea that she should be at the top of the ticket, saying that she is proud to be Joe Biden's running mate, really trying to both publicly and privately illustrate loyalty.

And he said, you know, if I did my best, and that's what's going to matter.And if you talk to other elected Democrats, they want some passion and fire to beat Donald Trump. This is not just like a consolidation trophy if you lose. They feel like there is a real threat in 2025 if Donald Trump returns to the Oval Office.

Here is more from Dr. Sanjay Gupta. DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, obviously it's certainly up to the president and frankly, any patient, whether or not they want to have this sort of testing. But I should point out that the testing shouldn't be thought of as something that would embarrass or malign, but rather, maybe provide some answers to what is driving some of the signs and symptoms we have seen with President Biden, and maybe even provide an opportunity for some early treatment. It could provide a baseline, something that could be tracked and followed over time, so that you could find early signs of any kind of deficit, maybe even before the person themselves recognized it. Or sometimes this testing just provides peace of mind that there is nothing to worry about. I should also point out that in the United States, there is a cognitive exam that is usually recommended for anyone over the age of 65 as part of their annual wellness checkup. Anyone over the age of 65 going through about an hour's worth of cognitive testing, physical exam, patient history to try and figure out, are there cognitive deficits that can be addressed early? [13:15:02] What, I think has been driving some of the concerns since the debate among many of my colleagues in medicine, was some of the things they saw for a sustained and sort of protracted time during the debate. The differences in speech, the halting of speech, the confused rambling sometimes that occurred. But also, what they saw, when President Biden seemed to not have any facial expression. I think it's why so many people have said cognitive testing, as well as movement disorder testing, could be potentially beneficial. As you certainly heard by now, the White House said, look, it was a bad night. That's basically what it was. It was a bad night. He was jet lagged to some extent. He had not been getting enough sleep and he had a cold. And those things certainly can cause episodes like we saw. But again, the question is, is this episodic or is this reflective of something that is more significant? We do know, finally, that he did have a fairly complete exam back in February. But a cognitive test was not part of that exam. They ruled out things like stroke, like multiple sclerosis, and they made note that he did not have Parkinson's disease. But there are other things that can cause Parkinsonism besides Parkinson's disease, and they didn't really mention that. So, I think there are still a lot of unanswered questions. But again, it is up to the president and any patient whether or not they want to have this sort of testing. But there are many reasons it could be beneficial.",

This is early in the season to have this many active wildfires. The Lake Fire started yesterday in Santa Barbara County, burning almost 5,000 acres now. You mentioned the French Fire, which is now about 20 percent contained, at about 900 acres. Then you've got the Thompson Fire, which is more than 3,000 acres. That they started to get a handle on is now three quarters contained. So, some of the people who were previously evacuated can start coming home there. And then the Balsam Root Fire up in Washington State, Central Washington state. Local fire officials say that one actually started because of fireworks. That is now 30 percent contained. So, really dangerous, dry, hot conditions fueling those flames. And if we take a look at this heat map that was created by the CDC and other federal agencies, you can see just how hazardous the conditions are. Up and down the west coast, but specifically, mostly in California, you see those purple counties, and purple is the highest level. It's labeled as extreme, and that, they define as having a significantly higher likelihood that you're going to see more heat related illnesses reported to emergency rooms.

And so I think that's a good argument that this was official conduct on his part, that the question of a presumptive immunity should apply. But I do not think it applies, Fred, in the obstruction part because that occurred after the fact of his presidency. And I think it was a respective legitimate request for those documents. You've got the two cases in one here. And I'd say they're going to be grappling with the issues that this raises for a while.

The ball bouncing to Rundon (ph), who audaciously loved the Canadian goalkeeper there. What an extraordinary goal that was. But this one couldn't be decided in 90 minutes so it went to penalties. The Canadian goalie redeemed himself with a save there, allowing Canada to win this game with the penalty from Ishmael Coney. As I mentioned, Canada has never played in this tournament before.
