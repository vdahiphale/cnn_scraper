President Biden, once again, seeming hopeful today that these hostages will continue to be released in the coming days and specifically that they will be able to get these Americans out as well.",

      "sentences": "I thought they were pretty significant. He made some news, I thought, in terms of discussing this overall Israel Hamas war. At one point, he said that in his opinion, eliminating Hamas, which is one of Israel's goals, as we all know, eliminating Hamas, he says, is a legitimate objective. I think that's the first time I heard him say that eliminating Hamas is a legitimate objective. That's what we keep hearing from the Israelis, as we know.He also went one step further in terms of blasting Hamas. He says, Hamas doesn't give a damn about the Palestinians in Gaza and the impact that this war has had on the Palestinian civilians living in Gaza. He was very pleased that more humanitarian aid, fuel and medical equipment and other critically important needs were coming in on these trucks coming into Gaza now. He was very pleased about that, but he said, Hamas doesn't give a damn about what's going on with the Palestinians. And as you guys pointed out, he referred specifically, once again, as he has been all of these weeks for a long time, for the need eventually to solve the Israeli Palestinian problem with a two-state solution, Israel living alongside a new state of Palestine. He keeps saying that he doesn't have support for that yet from the Israeli government, the Prime Minister Netanyahu, but he keeps saying that. And one final point I thought that was significant, and Jim Sciutto, let me get your thoughts on this as well. When he said that he believes that Hamas launched this war, went into Israel, went to those kibbutzim along the border with Gaza, and started slaughtering all those Israelis and others, was because Israel was getting closer and closer to some sort of recognition, some sort of deal with Saudi Arabia. The U.S. was working on trying to get the Saudis, like the Emiratis, the Bahrainis, and others in the Arab world to formally establish diplomatic relations, normalize relations with Israel. And one of the things he said that Hamas wanted to prevent from happening was this kind of expansion of Israel's acceptance in major parts of the Arab world. And I thought, Jimmy Sciutto, let me get your thoughts on that. I thought that was significant that he said that as well.",

I'm glad you pointed that out, Wolf, because certainly when I was there, and I'm sure you heard the same thing, there was a lot of speculation that Hamas, and by the way, Hamas' backers, Iran and others, were not happy about the prospect of a normalization of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia, so that the timing was suspect because, as you note, they were very close to exactly that deal and wanted to disrupt it.It's notable to hear that idea, that speculation in effect endorsed by President Biden as well. And we'll see, I suppose, if those attacks were enough to disrupt it, because I've spoken to diplomats in the region who have said that actually that deal might survive this, that they might find a way forward given time. But to your point, Wolf, notable for the U.S. president to see that as part of the motivation for these attacks.",

This at the Rafah Border Crossing in Southern Gaza during what has been a highly anticipated return for some of the more than 200 people Hamas has held since October 7th.Those released now include 13 Israeli women and children.

She's also the former director for Syria and Lebanon on the National Security Council. And also joining us is Seth Jones. He's a director for the International Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.Hagar, first to you, I'm wondering what most stood out to you about Biden's speech and his insistence that ending Hamas, eradicating Hamas from Gaza was a legitimate goal? HAGAR CHEMALI, FORMER SPOKESPERSON, U.S. MISSION TO THE UNITED NATIONS:  Well, it doesn't surprise me actually that the focus remains on defeating Hamas and its military capabilities and its ability to govern Gaza and also to focus on making sure that Hamas doesn't continue to pose a threat to Israel, right? This is a war about defeating Hamas as much as it is a war about deterrence and ensuring that Hamas and no other proxy can pose a threat to Israel this way. The thing that struck me -- there were two things that struck me, and the first was that just how much the U.S. has been involved in these negotiations and in prioritizing the release of hostages. And he's made it very clear that he's going to continue to do that. And I really applaud the Biden administration's efforts on this. And also, the focus about the Saudi Israel relations. And to be honest with you, I am not surprised that those talks will continue. Hamas has played spoiler in the peace process for the last three decades. And so, that's not surprising, but I was surprised as to the extent to which that was a motivator in in Hamas' October 7th terrorist attack, as Biden said.",

That's, of course, something you've heard from Israeli officials as they talk about military action there that Hamas deliberately embeds itself inside civilian areas using civilians as human shields.But you've even heard that in some of the public comments from Hamas leaders, saying that, listen, civilian casualties on their own side. They compare it to the number -- further, Hamas leader compare it to the number of Germans who died fighting Russia, you know, in the millions. An important thing to be said, is it not for the U.S. president to not allow folks to paint Hamas as anything more than a terrorist organization that it is?",

      "sentences": "And, Hagar, I think part of casting Hamas as an illegitimate arbiter of what happens in Gaza and the West Bank and what happens to Palestinians is part of Biden's call for a two-state solution. The difficult part in sort of going that route is that there isn't exactly a replacement for Hamas that many Palestinians see as legitimate. I think the Palestinian Authority has sort of lost some of its claim to legitimacy in that regard.What is the transition look like then to a separate government, a separate leading organization in Gaza and the West Bank moving forward?",

It's the leader, Mahmoud Abbas, who's been the leader -- the president since the '90s, himself is very weak and very corrupt. He raised his hand and said that he would be happy to take charge of Gaza, to which Bibi Netanyahu said that he'd rather some other alternative governing body. And by the way, I think Bibi is on his way out too. And so, is there a chance? It's possible. The Palestinian Authority, by the way, is really a creation of the United States coming out of the 1993 Oslo Accords. So, it is possible they could create something different. But at the end of the day, when you have a situation like this, I don't know that creating something new is really going to be feasible. You might have to go with what is already existing. What is, by the way, the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. They have a representative office in the United States. And so, that would be the best chance. But I think your point about Hamas, and Hamas is the one that is seeking to commit genocide. Hamas is the one that sought this on its own people and doesn't care and has said it very bluntly about how they have to sacrifice their people when they're pursuing their goals. And so, I think that's a very important point to make. But hopefully, they will be focusing on the day after. It's very important. But I think the Palestinian Authority might be the only chance.",

By the way, Palestinian Authority, it cooperates with Israeli forces in the West Bank in terms of counterterror operations, et cetera. So, you know, Bibi may not like them, but of course, they have more support among some Palestinians. That said, there are many Palestinians who have questions about the Palestinian Authority as well.Seth, I want to ask you, just in terms of military, what are legitimate military goals in the view of the president. And he said, eliminating Hamas is a legitimate objective as opposed to a realistic goal, because I've spoken to a lot of former commanders who raise the question, what does that look like? What does eliminating Hamas in Gaza look like? Particularly in light of the enormous civilian casualties we've seen so far from Israeli military operations, but also, you know, you can eliminate many -- perhaps most or close to all of the fighters, but then the ideology remains.",

And I do think both U.S. leaders and certainly Israeli ones have to be careful about making military promises that are going to be difficult to keep over the long run.But I do think it is certainly a plausible military objective to capture as many Hamas military and political leaders, destroy much of their infrastructure, weapons, command and control centers, as is feasible, their tunnel infrastructure in Gaza. So, much of that is feasible. But again, there is a resistance ideology, not just from Hamas, but elements of Palestinian Islamic jihad and other organizations. But I think based on this war, which will and already has impacted civilians, will continue in some form. But again, I think significantly degrading the military infrastructure and individuals involved is achievable.",

And, Seth, a moment that, to your point, caught my eyes when a reporter asked President Biden what advice he had given Benjamin Netanyahu about what happens perhaps after this temporary truce ends when all the hostages are out.The president seemed to take a long pause and seeming to weigh what he was going to say, and then essentially said that eradicating Hamas is extremely difficult, but it's something that must be done. It seems that there is some daylight between the United States and Israel over how to approach the targets and the intensity by which the IDF is carrying out its mission in Gaza.",
