Lebanese authorities say more than 550 people were killed in the deadliest day of strikes in that country in nearly 20 years. And a short time ago, Israel confirmed that it launched this airstrike in the southern suburbs of Beirut. Israel calls it -- quote -- \"a targeted strike.\" Joining us now from the United Nations, Danny Danon, Israel's ambassador to the U.N. Thank you so much for joining us. So, just in the last hour, in his address to the General Assembly, President Biden called for restraint in Israel's fight against Hezbollah. As you know, yesterday was the single deadliest day in Lebanon since 2006. Do you consider this conflict an all-out war now between Israel and Hezbollah?",

As we speak, we continue with diplomatic efforts, but we are also taking measures to degrade the capabilities of Hezbollah that they will not be able to continue and attack Israel. And the end goal is very clear. We want to make sure that Hezbollah will obey Security Council Resolution 1701 and will move to the northern part, not next to our border. Once it will happen, either through diplomacy or through military action, we will have no issues with Hezbollah or Lebanon.",

In order to do that, we're going to push back. That's what we are doing. I hope that maybe the Lebanese government will be able to put the pressure on Hezbollah and to avoid a full conflict.

Our interest is not to go back to the days when we had to send our boys and girls to fight inside Lebanon. We prefer a different solution. But at the same time, in our region, unfortunately, when you show weakness, your enemies, they are emboldened and attack you more.

And he is a former U.S. army commanding general for Europe and the Seventh Army.General, it's interesting because one of the first questions I asked is, is this war now between Hezbollah and Israel? He clearly does not want to say it is war, that he made it very clear that Israel does not want this to escalate into what he views as a war. But I'm wondering how you see it. Is this the start of another war between Hezbollah and Israel? LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  It's certainly a conflict, Pamela, and it's very difficult to not call it a war because there are fires going on from both sides. It's a rocket attack followed by Hezbollah rocket attack followed by strikes from Israel to hit those rocket locations and also to hit the leadership of Hezbollah. So it certainly is an escalation of a conflict. I don't think we're classifying it as a war yet because there is no ground and air campaign, per se. But, certainly, it has the potential for that.",

And when we talk about Israel's strike -- and I think the focus of attention has been primarily -- you showed a map earlier that showed all the strike locations by the Israeli air force. But we don't seem to consider the amount of rocket launches that are coming out of Lebanon toward -- that's the map I'm talking about -- coming out toward Israel. This morning, as I get sitreps every day from the area, situation reports from the area, there were 50 launches inside of Lebanon toward Israeli territory before 9:00. There was another 10 rockets launched into Israel between 9:00 and 10:00. So you're seeing the reaction of the Israeli Defense Forces against those kinds of strikes. They shouldn't be just accepting these rockets launching into the area. And, as you said a minute ago and the ambassador said, there had been close to 80,000 citizens that have been taken out of that area. Some of them, as you said, aren't going to go back and it's because of the tension that continues between the Lebanese and the Israeli border.",

All day today, we saw sort of this weird dance between parents dropping their kids off, sort of looking at them as they walked out of the car. We saw school buses coming this direction with all the police officers and extra security here. Then you saw all these therapy dogs that were being brought into the school. And one of the parts of emotion here at 8:30, when they did the Pledge of Allegiance, we could hear it. And you can see this big school behind us. You could hear that Pledge of Allegiance being read, and then the emotion from the principal as she was walking the students back, basically saying she was there for them and the fact that they were heroes in the hallways.

But if you look across the country overall, about 41 percent of people saying that they want to start cutting back on their drinking. So these numbers have been going up pretty steadily. And if you look how that translates then to purchasing of mocktails and no- or low- alcohol drinks, it's been going up very steadily as well. So you can see the numbers there, going up about 30 percent every year, expected to be a billion dollars sort of within the next few years, which is pretty incredible overall. We talked to the folks at Athletic Beer -- you may have seen this product before. They said this. We looked into this.2018, they brewed 800 barrels of beer, last year, 170,000 barrels of beer. So it is a growing industry, for sure, some areas of it growing more than others. Two important points. first of all About 68 percent of people say that they would still occasionally drink alcohol, so they're not totally upstanding from alcohol. And 93 percent of people who buy any of these low- or no-alcohol products are still often buying alcoholic products as well. So we're sort of in this phase of transition in some ways,what people are calling the desire for intermittent sobriety. But it is a fast- moving sort of trend and it's driven, again, by some of the youngest in our generation.",
