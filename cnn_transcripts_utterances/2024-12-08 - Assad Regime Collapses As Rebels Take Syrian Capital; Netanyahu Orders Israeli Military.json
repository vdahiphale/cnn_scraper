The long, brutal regime of Syrian president Bashar al Assad is over. It was a stunning end to a violent regime started by Assad's father more than 50 years ago. A lightning-fast assault by a coalition of rebel groups captured the capital of Damascus. Russian state media now reporting that Assad and his family have arrived in Moscow and been given asylum there. Many Syrians spent their entire lives under Assad's violent rule. Today, they poured into the streets to celebrate. Syrians who had lived under the fist of Assad's power and corruption could be seen flooding into the presidential office after it was abandoned. Syrians could now walk through the presidential palace, even into the kitchen of Assad's family, where specific instructions were still posted for the family's menu preferences. The rebels also emptied out some of the regime's prisons, notorious places where people who were designated as enemies of Assad were detained and frequently tortured. It was just a little more than a week ago when opposition forces met little resistance as they took the key city of Aleppo. Then they swept south before surrounding Damascus and deposing Assad. In the end Russian fighter jets, which had been striking rebel forces in recent days were nowhere to be found. Assad's troops dispersed and fled into the streets. Just moments ago, president Biden reacted to these stunning developments, pledging U.S. support for the Syrian people. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It's a moment of historic opportunity for the long-suffering people of Syria to build a better future for their proud country. It's also a moment of risk and uncertainty as we all turn to the question of what comes next. The United States will work with our partners and the stakeholders in Syria to help them seize an opportunity to manage the risks. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

What comes next?Will there be chaos? Will there be lawlessness? Will we see more looting like we saw today? But if you have that other clip pulled up, I just would love our viewers to be able to see the scene at that border crossing as we pass through it again. It was already dark, already past curfew, very, very quiet and just nothing like we've seen it before. The only real evidence we saw Wolf, of any struggle to finally take Damascus, to finally oust Bashar al-Assad was a tank in the road below a torn poster of president, or I should say, former president Bashar al-Assad. Take a look at that clip if you can. So we are just crossing now into Syria. It's astonishing to see. It's absolutely empty. The border points before there would have been soldiers, there would have been border guards. Now there is absolutely nobody from the Syrian regime. Just friendly people waving us through. And honestly, the last time I came down this road was back in 2011. I was leaving Syria. I had been undercover in Damascus posing as a tourist went back into Lebanon, and I never imagined this moment would come when we would be driving through this border with no one from the regime to stop us. And Wolf, my cameraman, Scott McWhinnie (ph), just found this on the ground, literally, as we were listening to that clip. This is the old flag of the Syrian regime which has two green stars. The rebels' flag has three green stars, but this one has now been, literally we just found it on the floor. I guess a real moment where you see how much things have changed just in the past 24 hours. In terms of the security situation on the streets, I would just add, we anticipated that we might see quite a lot of checkpoints as we came into the city. We didn't. We did see a group of men. They did not appear to be armed, but they asked us what we were doing, where we were going. And now that we are sort of ensconced in our place where we're staying for the night, we have seen a couple of patrols. I saw two men armed and I went up to them and asked them where they were from. They told me they were from Idlib, which is in the northern part of the country. And we saw a man on the street go up and wanted to pose for a photograph of them, which I think sort of speaks to the moment. There is obviously jubilation, elation, but also this sense of you can't compute. It was so fast, so breathtaking. It's astonishing. And I think people are taking some time to try to process the magnitude. Keep in mind, Wolf, were talking about 53 years of Assad rule, 53 years of a brutal police state. And I can't tell you how many Syrians have said to me Wolf, that, you know we understand that there are concerns about the rebels and the makeup of the rebels. And the fact that some of them are Islamists and some of them are even jihadists, or have been affiliated with al Qaeda or a proscribed organization. But let us have this moment. Let us celebrate the fact that this brutal dictator who has ruthlessly killed hundreds of thousands of people, who has gassed children with lethal nerve agents, who has locked people in prisons and tortured and beaten them to death, that he is finally gone. And that whatever may come and whatever the anxiety, this is a new chapter for Syria, Wolf. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

He mentioned being vigilant, and he said that because we've heard, he said, what the rebel leadership who had its roots in al Qaeda, we've heard what they're saying. It sounds like its good.They're talking about a nonsectarian society with a new political dispensation. And this is something that President Biden said they need to live up to. We've heard the words, but we need to see more. And what President Biden laid out that he expects is in the future is a Syria that's sovereign and independent, which seems to be a very clear message, crystal clear. Russia and Iran will no longer have any kind of stake in the future of Syria. So that's part of the political picture going forward. It's made up of the different ethnic groups. It's made up of the different religious groups. It's made up of all the different elements of society inside of Syria. That's President Bidens aspiration. And that's very much what we've been hearing from the rebels. And I've been talking to actually a political grouping way outside of the rebel structure who were central to peace talks back with Assad's regime and about a decade ago the United States was playing a role in that. And there was a lot of work laid out back then for what a new government could look like, what a new constitution could look like, who could be involved in it. And this political leader told me that's the direction he believes that the country is headed in, again a period of military security. The military pulled back. There's a power-sharing government for a period of time, six to nine months perhaps he outlined. And then elections. And this really fits in with what, you know, President Biden was saying that this new Syria will have a new constitution -- some of that's been drafted in the past, and a new government. The plans to get that new government and achieve it have been made there. But President Biden being very clear that ISIS will not be allowed to fill a vacuum. U.S. strikes on ISIS today, the security of U.S. forces vitally important, but also making sure that ISIS doesn't get stronger and remembering that there are hundreds and thousands of ISIS families and supporters in jails inside of Syria today in the rebel-held areas in the east that the United States supports and helps and helps keep them controlled. That will be vital to oversee going forward. And that is going to be a strategic importance to the United States, so that that's the path that he's setting out. The rebels are setting out a path of change. No longer brutality, political, religious pluralism plurality.",

      "sentences": "Yes it seems that this happened throughout the course today.Russia, of course, by far one of the biggest backers of the Assad government over the past couple of years, really doing a lot to keep Assad in power. And of course, also very important, keeping in power when that civil war was really at its height, and especially with Russia's air force. Now tonight, a source telling CNN that Assad and members of his family, it's unclear how many, have arrived here in Moscow and have been granted asylum on humanitarian grounds, the source says, to stay here in Russia. So it seems as though he has fled here to Russia, and he's being granted asylum here in Russia. And this really comes after a day of uncertainty, Wolf, as to the whereabouts of the Syrian president, Bashar al Assad. Early this morning, of course, when those opposition forces and some other folks there in Syria stormed the presidential palace, it was totally unclear where Bashar al-Assad was at that point in time. And it was the Russians who first confirmed that Bashar al-Assad had indeed left Syria. They said that Bashar al-Assad had instructed those working in his government to ensure a transfer of power, and then decided to leave the country. So it was clear that the Russians certainly knew the whereabouts of Bashar al-Assad. They also said that they were not part of any negotiations or any sort of talks about that transfer in power. So one of the things that we seem to be seeing is that they are obviously still taking care of Bashar al-Assad, making sure that he and his family can go here. But it appears as though that they are somewhat out of the political process that is going to follow next. The Russians are saying that they are in touch with all of the groups, as they put it, the armed groups on the ground in Syria. But a lot of that for them, Wolf, is because of Russia's military assets that, of course, are substantial inside of Syria. We're not just talking about their massive air base that they have in Hmeymim (ph) near Latakia, but of course, also the big port that they have as well in Tartus where just earlier last week, they launched a gigantic naval exercise testing some pretty potent longer-distance missiles, some of them nuclear capable. So these two assets, very important for the Russians right now, very much in question. The Russians, however, are saying that Bashar al- Assad is now on the ground here in Moscow. members of his family are as well and just a little side note on that, just to show that the Russians seem to be right now, at least not interfering with any sort of transition that's going on in Syria. We are also learning, Wolf, that on the former embassy of the Syrian Arab Republic, the flag of the Syrian Arab Republic under Bashar al- Assad has apparently been taken down. And also the plaque of the Syrian Arab Republic has also, at the embassy here in Moscow, been removed as well, Wolf.",

The leader of that movement HTS, he has pushed back on that. He has said that he does not have those links to the more extreme jihadist elements of the Islamist movement. And so right now, what they are doing is they're projecting this image of more moderation, trying to convince the U.S. and its allies, and really people around the world that they are not going to be a brutal terrorist organization, even though the U.S. has designated them as such. But still, for now, the U.S. is intent on maintaining its presence inside Syria as a bulwark against the possible resurgence of not only ISIS, but also of al Qaeda inside the country. Of course, what remains to be seen is whether force protection can be maintained. Whether the U.S. can guarantee the security of its troops there so far, it is not clear whether or not the U.S. has gotten a commitment from this rebel group, and from these various rebel groups inside Syria that they will, in fact protect U.S. forces there, or that they will not openly attack them. Interestingly, these rebel groups they have apparently provided the Russians with that assurance. Russia has a number of strategic military bases as well as ports inside Syria, and the rebels have said that they are not going to attack those. Will they make that same kind of commitment to the U.S.? That really remains to be seen. But for now, all indications are they're staying put, Alisyn.",

What he did also try to do, Wolf, is to take credit in some ways for the events that have transpired inside of Syria calling the fall of the Assad regime the success of the rebels, a, quote direct result of Israel's actions against Iran and Hezbollah. Iran and Hezbollah, of course, have both propped up the Assad regime throughout the course of this 13-year civil war. And there's no question that these rebel forces took advantage of a moment where Iran was distracted with its conflict with Israel, where Hezbollah was significantly weakened by Israeli military action over the course of the conflict between within this region over the course of the last year -- Wolf.",

It is not a peace, but it was at least something stable that Israel could manage. And understand what they are also going to look to see is whether or not Iran is still going to be able to move its weapons through Syria to Hezbollah inside of Lebanon presumably, that route has now been cut off by these rebel forces, who are, of course, opposed to Iran. Israel had been hoping in recent weeks actually, that Assad's regime could perhaps help stem the flow of those weapons as well. Clearly, that is not going to happen.

I think there are about 900 U.S. troops still based in Syria and preventing any resurgence of ISIS. How does the U.S. accomplish that? REP. JOHN GARAMENDI (D-CA): Well, first of all, we've got to recognize that Syria is right smack in the middle of the most important countries in that area. Certainly, Israel, We just heard about their military preparations. You've got Lebanon to the West. You have Turkey and you got Iraq and Jordan. All of those countries have a key, key interest, as does the United States in what's going to happen here. It seems to me that the most important thing here at the moment is for the United States, working with our allies in the area to fill the political international vacuum that has been created as a result of Assad, Russia and Iran pulling out of the Syrian area. We have an opportunity here, and we ought to seize that opportunity with regard to our troops. They've been well protected in the past.

Those are factors that have clearly led to the rebel group being able to move quickly and successfully, and to establish themselves in Damascus.The question going forward is how do we now deal with what is going to be a new government in Damascus in Syria? It's an extremely important that we look at this in a very holistic way. There's a lot of history that this group has it is, as I said a moment ago some eight years old. Are they still associated with al Qaeda, maybe yes, maybe no. But we will not know if we do not set immediately to establish a working communication with this new regime, and to find out what is going to be necessary to create some sort of stability in the area. As I said earlier, you got Turkey to the north, Lebanon to the west, Jordan and Israel, all of them keenly interested in what this new government will be doing. And Iran would love to have an open door back into the area with the new government. We can't let that happen. And so I would suggest its time for us to send a very senior diplomat to the new government and to begin a communication process and simultaneously work with the surrounding countries to develop a plan to understand where the new government wants to go what it needs to get there, and if that path is one that is sensible to the interests of the United States, as well as the surrounding countries.",
