I guess let's just jump right into this. First of all, your reaction to Trump issuing what appears to be a warning or at least can be inferred as a warning, to people involved in the election charges case.REP. JOAQUIN CASTRO (D-TX): Well, I'm not surprised. I mean, after all these years, that's kind of Donald Trump's method of operation, is that he tries to intimidate people, he tries to bully people in his own way, threaten people. And I do think that it was a veiled threat and I'm glad that the prosecutors have asked for protective orders, because what you see Donald Trump do again and again is try to get his supporters or his followers to do his dirty work. That's what the insurrection, the attempted coup was on January 6th, was Donald Trump riling up a bunch of people and letting them march onto the Capitol, break into the Capitol, while he sat back at the White House.",

We will be immediately asking for recusal of this judge on very powerful grounds and likewise for venue change out of Washington, D.C.\"Let me ask you, Congressman.

And if it's not covered, if people aren't able to see it for themselves, what happens is it gives Donald Trump and his team a chance to do what they've been doing for a long time, which is engage in this purposeful, directed misinformation and disinformation and lies about exactly what's going on. And so, by televising it, you would actually allow people to see it in real time and people would be able to see with their own eyes what's going on. And that makes it less likely that when somebody comes, somebody like Donald Trump or his team come up with these conspiracy theories about what happened in the courtroom, people will be able to say, and we'll be able to go back and look at the tape and say, well, you know, that's not what happened.

Even though migration has dropped substantially since the end of Title 42 a few months ago, even though the number of border crossings has dropped, Greg Abbott has gotten more extreme in how he's treating migrants and asylum seekers. So, he installed razor wire along the Rio Grande, even though he's a governor without any jurisdiction over an international body of water.And then he put in these barrel traps that got razor wire below them or concertina wire below them so that people can get stuck on them, and people have gotten stuck on them. In fact, there was -- it was reported last week that among two dead bodies, there was -- in the river, there was one that was actually stuck to these buoys. One of those two bodies was a child from Honduras. And so, as far as I'm concerned, Greg Abbott has blood on his hands. He has installed these things knowing that it's more -- they are more likely to force people to drown in that river. But also, what they've done is for the people that the asylum seekers that do make it over and present themselves for asylum, what the state is doing now is adopting a practice from Donald Trump's playbook. They're separating families now at the border. So, they're traumatizing these young children by taking away their parents from them again at the border. When Donald Trump did this, there were literally thousands of kids that were left at least for a time without their parents. And there's still some families that have never been reunited to this day. Even as the Biden administration set up a commission to work on the reunification, there are some families that they've just not been able to reunite.

You mentioned migrants that had to sleep on the sidewalk as recently as last week. That was actually right outside of the facility that you see behind me.This is old historic Roosevelt Hotel here in New York City that not only has served as shelter for some asylum seekers, but also is still that primary intake center where many of the newly arrived will be directed to so they can get the resources that they need. However, last week amid an influx, there were dozens of asylum seekers, mostly single men, that were forced to sleep on the sidewalk. And we should make clear that the city a few days later was able to place them in some temporary shelter facilities. But all of this really speaks to the wider need of -- for housing. Still about 56,000 of those nearly 100,000 that you mentioned, Jim, are still in the care of New York City officials here. The concern is that those numbers will continue to grow. You know, we heard your conversation with Congressman Castro just a few moments ago. It has actually -- this weekend actually marks one year since the first bus that was paid for by the Texas governor's administration that we actually saw it arrive here. We should however mention that to date we've only received about 10,500 asylum seekers through that busing program. So, it's still a small percentage. So, though it certainly hasn't been the cause of the wider migrant crisis, it certainly has not assisted New York City officials as they warned the scenes that happened out here just last week are bound to repeat themselves if the city does not receive assistance.

It was her first meet since the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, where she withdrew from several competitions to protect her physical and mental health.You can see Biles right there just dazzling the crowd. She hasn't announced her intention just yet to compete in next year's Paris Olympics but she said last month, it was still a possibility. Let's discuss. CNN sports analyst Christine Brennan joins us now. Christine, great to see you. Before we get to this incredible maneuver, Simone pulled off yesterday, set the scene for us and let's talk about the context surrounding her return and the questions raised by her remarkable victory. Could this be a big comeback we're looking at here?",

He always does this. And he didn't realize it, but this time, the tide was going out faster than what he thought it was. A wave comes through, knocks him out of the boat. He loses half the things on the boat, including his cell phone, the throw cushion, the life jacket. He has to remove the engine from the boat, and then he's just holding on to that boat. He says he saw sharks, big fish. He got stung by jellyfish. But out of all the things he experienced, he told his father that the worst thing was the night because he was sunburned that with the wind, it was just freezing cold, so he would try to get in the water to warm up. Of course, thankfully, he got rescued on Saturday by the Coast Guard, and his family is now saying that he still is going to be hurting for a couple more days because of the sunburn, because of the jellyfish sting, because his muscles, the tissue essentially was breaking down.
