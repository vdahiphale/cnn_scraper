This, as Trump suggests, if he were to go to prison, some of his so called, quote, \"passionate supporters could make things dangerous.\" Let's bring in CNN's Evan Perez.Evan, what do we know about why Judge Aileen Cannon settled on mid-May for the classified documents trial to start?",

Obviously, it centers on classified information and classified documents. The former president disputes that they were even classified. And so, that's one of the things that she cites.I'll read you just a part of her ruling, which she says, \"The court will be faced with an extensive pretrial motion practice on a diverse number of legal and factual issues, all in connection with a 38 count indictment.\" And, Jake, what we've seen already in this case is Walt Nauta, the former president's codefendant, has already eaten up one month just to get arraigned, right? That just -- that is something that is usually very perfunctory, and they've already eaten up one month just to do that. So, you can see what game -- what strategy the former president and his codefendant have been playing, and it is working. The prosecution had asked for a trial in December that seemed way aggressive, the judge said. But putting it in May really does put into the realm of possibility that we are not going to get to trial before Election Day simply because just a few more delays after that and you are now talking about a much later trial.",

The Russians cancelled the previous deal to allow the export of Ukrainian grain. Earlier this week, they said they did so in retaliation for what they claim was a Ukrainian strike that damaged a key bridge to Crimea, a part of Ukraine that the Russians illegally seized in 2014.In Moscow, Russian President Vladimir Putin is seething about the continuing flow of weapons Ukraine is getting from its allies, especially from the United States. But as CNN's Fred Pleitgen reports for us now, Putin's isolation and alleged paranoia appear to be growing worse, according to experts, and officials at the CIA, among others, are noticing. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): With Ukraine now using U.S. supplied cluster munitions to try and penetrate the Russian army's entrenched positions on the southern front, Russian leader Vladimir Putin ripping into the U.S. and its allies for aiding Kyiv. PRES. VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIA (through translator): The whole world can see that the supposedly invulnerable equipment that the west boasted about is on fire. And technically, it is often even inferior to some Soviet made weapons. Yes, of course, additional Western armaments can be supplied and thrown into battle. This, of course, causes us certain damage and prolongs the conflict. PLEITGEN (voice-over): But while Putin tries to project superiority on the battlefield, at home, the Kremlin continues to silence critical voices, even some of those supporting their war. Prominent military blogger Igor Girkin, who also goes by Igor Strelkov arrested today, his wife said, after remarks blasting the lack of progress of Russia's military campaign in Ukraine. The situation with a special military operation and in the country in general is deplorable, to put it mildly, he said. This is a result of actions of the incumbent power. Girkin is a former colonel in Russia's security service FSB, and was the defense minister of the so called Donetsk People's Republic in eastern Ukraine when the Malaysian jetliner MH-17 was shot down there in 2014. Girkin was found guilty of mass murder in absentia by a Dutch court for involvement in the incident, which he has never acknowledged. While Girkin is considered a war criminal in Ukraine, he deems himself a Russian ultra nationalist who feels the war should be prosecuted even more brutally. Putin's grip on power was only recently challenged by the uprising of the Wagner private military company and its boss, Yevgeny Prigozhin.

But now they're widening it into these cultural issues, these hot ticket issues that they know really excite their base voters, including really attacking Ron DeSantis, who we know is an architect of a lot of the conversations that we talk about from a day to day.Now, Vice President Harris, she's been on a tour across the country talking about these issues very clearly, really a rights tour, talking about freedoms as trying to put really the Biden administration, her and President Biden as the last safeguard against Republicans trying to claw back at these freedoms.

This is factual and well documented. They cite numerous instances, including, you know, John Henry learning how to be a blacksmith.

Sources I've talked to said there were internal discussions for months within the Department of Homeland Security and the Justice Department to take some action against Texas. But they had never reached the point to do so. We're seeing that play out this week with that letter to Texas Governor Abbott just yesterday. And we should also note to your point this is unrelated to the mistreatment of migrants. That is an ongoing assessment by the Justice Department.
