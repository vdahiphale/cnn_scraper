      "sentences": "That's right, Brianna.The judge certainly was very clear early on that she was not going to give the former president and his legal team two years to get ready for them to go on trial. That's the date they had set. They had asked for a date in 2026. Jack Smith, the special counsel, had asked for a trial to start in January. And John Lauro, who is one of the former president's attorneys, said that the prosecution was not looking for a fair trial. What he said what they were looking for was a show trial. That's when the judge, Judge Tanya Chutkan, asked him to bring the temperature down just a little bit. One of the things that he was complaining about, John Lauro, was complaining about was the fact that there's about 12.8 million pages of discovery, of documents that the government is turning over for them to -- for the defense to get ready for trial. About 47,000 pages of those are what they called key documents. The judge pushed back on the fact that the former president not only has three other indictments, but he also has a political campaign to run in the next few months. So what she said was, setting a trial date does not depend and should not depend on the defendant's personal or professional obligations. She said that the public had a right to a prompt resolution of this matter. Again, that's something before the 2024 election. She compared it, Brianna, to a sports star who, having to answer charges in federal court, doesn't get to say, well, the fact that they have to play in professional games does not allow them to get out of having to go on trial -- Brianna.",

Of course, that's something that is legal team is not very happy about the drug, but the judge said that she gave it a lot of consideration and that she also even called the judge in New York, the state court judge in New York who is overseeing one of the former president's other trials, and consulted with him before picking this day -- Brianna.",

Even if he was getting campaign advocates for Donald Trump involved, personal lawyers involved, talking about things that were of the interest of the president as a candidate, that that, he believed, was part of his job as chief of staff because of the general interest that he had in making sure the trains ran on time for President Trump and making sure that the federal government had some confidence in the election. Some of the testimony near the end of this three hours just came out. I am not sure if he's still on the stand. It's very possible he is. He said he was dealing with the president's personal positions on a number of things and that, when he was pressed by the prosecutors over and over and over again, he grew a little bit exasperated, to the point where the prosecutor said, well, where does the line end here? What is outside the scope of your responsibility as the chief of staff? And he said, well, the example he could give was getting up on a stage and campaigning for Donald Trump. But everything else, even the campaign's goals and objectives, at times, he believed that there was a role for the chief of staff to advance that. And this testimony was really astonishing in so many ways, first of all, the fact that Meadows is under oath in a courtroom right now talking about what happened after the 2020 election, after avoiding testifying in the House, after not seeing him for so long, or hearing what his positions here may be. And he really is emphasizing how much he was doing things believing they were part of his job, because the president was asking to do those things, that he wasn't working for the campaign, and they didn't report to him. But he felt he needed to take certain steps as part of that. And the testimony elicited so far in court this afternoon has not been just about this Raffensperger call. The prosecutors and Meadows' defense team, they have walked through every piece of the allegations, text messages that he was allegedly sending, a visit he made in Georgia to try and watch an audit of one of the county's elections here, all of that. They have gotten Meadows under oath to say exactly why he was interested in it. And, many times, he has said he didn't recall reaching out to specific people who would have been on the private or personal side working for Donald Trump or his campaign in setting up these things. But he over and over again is saying that:  I believe that there was a general interest here of the federal government. That's why I was doing what I was doing. We're going to have to see what the judge says to that and what other testimony might come this afternoon.",

Bush Donald Ayer, who is with us. [13:10:00] OK, Donald, thank you for being with us. Just boil it down, if you could, for us nonlawyers. Why does this matter whether it's state or federal court that Meadows is tried in? And why do you think he should be tried in state court? DONALD AYER, FORMER U.S. DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL:  Well, the normal process is that a federal case is tried in federal court and -- or handled in federal court and a state case goes forward in the state courts. And this is special provision that's been around for almost a couple of hundred years now that allows -- the purpose of it is to protect the functioning of federal governmental roles by officers who are doing their jobs to allow them to remove a case from state court to federal. And so the question is, does it qualify? They're -- the Supreme Court has decided a number of cases on the issue. And the basic rules are, the basic requirements are that, first of all, the official, the federal official, to remove the case to federal court has to have been performing his job. He has to been acting within the scope of his official responsibilities. But the second requirement, on top of that, which your -- the lead-in really didn't get into, but it's also a clear requirement, is that the defendant also has to be advancing a federal legal defense that is plausible to the state charges. So, essentially, it's all about the state's integrity and the state's right pursue the cases it legitimately brings and whether there's some reason for the federal government under this statute to come in and interrupt that and say, no, this has to go to federal court.

The prosecutor from the DA's office really tried to pin him down on this, asking him which federal policy specifically he was advancing when he joined a post-election call with Rudy Giuliani, who, by the way, was the president's personal lawyer, right? This isn't White House counsel. And among Meadows' answers, he said he was the president's timekeeper and schedule manager. He said there was a federal interest in accurate and fair elections.

That's pretty categorically clear that they don't. There's another point to be made on top of that was made forcefully in an editorial that came out in the last couple of days, and that is that actually being involved in any sort of political process involving an election violates the Hatch Act. So it's not only not within the affirmative responsibilities, but it's also contrary to the Hatch Act that says federal officials can't get involved in political activities. So, those are two answers to that point. Remember, though, that on top of all of that, in order to remove this case, there has to be some sort of a plausible federal law defense being advanced. And that isn't even seriously being talked about. The only thing that's really been put forward on that is the crazy idea that Donald Trump has made and argued really throughout his entire administration and now that, because he was president, essentially, he's absolutely immune from being challenged for pretty much anything he does.

Hurricane warnings are already in effect all the way from south of Tampa just to the north of Fort Myers, all the way around the Big Bend there. So, here's the storm, 65 miles per hour just to the east of Cancun. Still going to make a pretty big impact on Pinar del Rio in Cuba, but then gaining strength in this very warm Gulf of Mexico water. We have been talking about this water all season long, about the coral problems along the Keys and the like. This is the warmest water we have really seen here with a hurricane in the water; 115 miles per hour right now is the forecast landfall wind be. Where is that going to be? Well, I know you're looking at the cones at home, but the cone itself is designed and created to only catch 66 percent of the hurricane eye wall landfalls, a sixth on one side and a sixth on the other. So just because you're not in the cone, but if you're close, you need to keep watching, because look how close very big cities are, all the way up here, Apalachicola. Yes, this is the cone, but here is only 66 percent. Another 33 percent will miss it at this point because things are not perfect. Computer models are obviously not perfect. We do know that the storm surge is going to be a huge problem. We also know that, if it's 115 miles per hour, comes on shore up here, many of these areas, looks like land, but that's not land. That's a mangrove swamp. That is going to continue the effect all the way to Lake City, to Tallahassee, possibly all the way to these bigger cities. Along the coast here, not very populated, just inland where this storm is still going to be going, very populated. So we're going to have to watch out all these college towns and such, for sure, lots of rainfall, and wind coming on shore, even for Savannah, Jekyll Island, all the way up toward Myrtle Beach. This thing isn't going to be over by the time it gets there, and some spots in the Carolinas could pick up six inches of rainfall. We know what happens when that happens, Matthew, great example of how much rainfall can come down. Freshwater flooding can kill more people than storm surge, because people know to get away from the storm surge.
