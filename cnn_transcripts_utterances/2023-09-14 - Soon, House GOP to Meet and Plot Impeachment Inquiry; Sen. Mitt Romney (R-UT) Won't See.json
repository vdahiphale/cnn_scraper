It is that many voters are expressing indifference toward him in general. And now they are worried one mistake could enable a candidate they see as a singular threat to American democracy. We know all of this because of fascinating reporting from our colleague, Isaac Dovere, and he joins us now. This is really interesting, terrified. I was looking back at your reporting.

The only thing that I know is that I don't like the other guy. And so that is really driving a lot of the thinking about what this is going to have to be.

I mean, when we had the fight over the debt limit earlier this year, I and I think many other people were surprised by how cleanly that was resolved.Biden had good success working together with House Republican Shalanda Young, who you quoted there, had managed to negotiate this deal with Kevin McCarthy that averted what a lot of people expected was going to be a serious crisis with non-payment on U.S. bonds. And so we have two more weeks left, and we'll see exactly what happens there with Kevin McCarthy. In the conference earlier this week, Kevin McCarthy basically said to his members, well, you don't want to pass our own appropriations bills and we don't want to pass an omnibus and you don't want to pass continuing resolution. So, what are we doing here? And he's basically laying out there that the only option left there is a shutdown. But if they don't have their own agenda to put forward, it's basically a question of do they want to fund the government -- do they want to agree to an omnibus that the Senate will ultimately write up before a shutdown or after a shutdown? McCarthy in the past has successfully gotten the party not to walk down that sort of blind alley specifically on federal spending. So, we'll see if that will happen here. But, you know, Biden going on T.V. and making a bunch of speeches I don't think is likely to move that forward.",

Democrats look and they imagine what would happen if Biden stepped aside, Kamala Harris would be the frontrunner. Her polling is consistently worse than Biden's and head-to-head matchups where Biden is typically tied. Harris trails by four points. A four-point shift in the election outcome obviously is enormous. It means the difference between winning and losing in the last three elections.And so Democrats, you know, for all Joe Biden's weaknesses, they're clearly much better off with him at the top of the ticket than with her at the top of the ticket. And it reflects that was a mistake to ever put her on the presidential ticket in the first place. She never had a job where she needed to appeal to swing voters. She came up as an elected official in Florida. She actually managed to almost lose a statewide election in Florida to a Republican, which is not very impressive for a Democrat. In 2010, she was elected by one point as state attorney general. But the way she got nominated is -- in California, yes. And the way that she got nominated, she's been very good at playing a Democratic Party inside game, where she's popular with staffers and with big donors. She's sort of, you know, if you're an extremely partisan Democrat, she's probably the kind of Democrat who appeals to you. The problem is that that's not a good way to win a presidential election. And so Biden, because he is a transitional figure, because he's going to be so old, and there's -- he will probably serve out a second term if re-elected, but there's a decent chance that he wouldn't, the Democratic Party needs someone who's ready to pick up and lead the party, and that's clearly not Kamala Harris, given where her polling is. If you have someone like Gretchen Whitmer, who's won two elections in Michigan by 9 points and 11 points, who's built a state party there that has taken over the state legislature, I mean, that's the sort of figure that you want to be leading the Democratic Party forward, someone who can win a majority.",

You know, we have at the Leadership Conference created the center on civil rights and technology in order to have more of these conversations and enable and create more public dialogue and public education.
