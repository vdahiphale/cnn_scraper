Vladimir Putin saying he is open to renegotiating the Black Sea Grain Export Deal, despite continued attacks on Ukraine's grain infrastructure. Plus, defense deliberations Ukrainian President Zelenskyy nominates a new Defense Minister at a critical juncture in the country's war effort. He cited the need for \"new approaches in the conflict\". And climate crunch African leaders and more gathering in Nairobi, Kenya today for the first ever Africa summit to address the climate crisis and find financial solutions to help mitigate the impact. We'll discuss Africa's energy challenge and its renewable potential with Fatih Birol, the Head of the International Energy Agency that's coming up on the show. Also garden grows shares of Chinese property developer Country Garden rising 20 percent on Monday after the firm's biggest creditor allowed to delay in bond repayments. The news also helping as you can well imagine a relief rally in Asia stocks with the HANG SENG up 2.5 percent in Monday's trade. All this after Beijing announced a wide array of economic support measures last week that continued to provide a lift. Europe also in the green though with lighter trade due to the U.S. Labor Day holiday, markets has shut the Wall Street bulls chalking up solid gains though last week helped along by market friendly jobs numbers and in line inflation data. So it's a day of rest on Wall Street but no rest here for the team on \"First Move\", and we do begin today's show in Ukraine. Overnight, Russia launched a sizable attack on civilian infrastructure in Ukraine's Odessa region, and a drone attack in the east, officials reporting destruction to warehouses, industrial buildings and agricultural equipment. Meanwhile, President Zelenskyy announcing a major military shakeup, as I mentioned, replacing his Defense Minister as his country enters the 19th month of all. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "We don't know precisely. And I suspect President Erdogan is finding out something aboutthat right now. What we know is that Russia is frustrated that it's not getting enough of its agricultural products and fertilizer to the international market. So it's also frustrated that it's sort of cut off from some international financial institutions. And this does appear to be at the root of why Russia pulled out of that deal, remembering that this was a deal, of course, that was in two parts, the Black Sea Grain Deal, there was the U.N.-Turkey, Ukraine part and the parallel U.N.-Turkey, Russia part. They weren't one in the same deal. But they had to go together. And when Russia pulled out, it sank the whole deal in its totality. Now, Ukraine has been trying to get the Black Sea grain corridor up and running. It's moved five ships successfully over the past month. But not this is not by any means the grain deal in itself. So how does Putin intend to get to the point where he gets what he wants, and as they say, we don't know what he wants behind the scenes. We do know from the Foreign Minister, that they're blaming the situation on the West that they're saying, look, promises have been made, that things will go faster. We'll get what we want. He said their promises, we need guarantees. And what Putin has been talking about lately as an alternate grain corridor, or an alternate grain deal just for Russia, where Russia would ship its grain to Turkey and Turkey would ship it onwards to the world to Africa in principle. So that's perhaps the leverage that Putin thinks he goes into this meeting with. But the U.N. says specifically, there are concrete offers. And this does seem to be what President Erdogan will be trying to push forward here, this going back to the original grain deal, of course, Ukrainians have been very clear to the international community. And particularly to Turkey, that there's no way that Putin should be allowed to sort of do an end run around that original grain deal. And of course, Ukraine points out that since Russia pulled out of that grain deal. It has targeted multiple times, grain storage, and port facilities, which they would say gives light to the fact that Russia wants to maintain food supplies to the world.",

But as you say they missed two payments now on U.S. denominated bonds. The grace period ends next week, they have $200 billion worth of liabilities, and around $4.3 billion in bonds maturing between now and the end of next year according to Moody's, perhaps actually now we can take half a billion dollars off of that, according to today's news.

That just goes to show how much work needs to be done. So there have been some new policy measures unveiled by Beijing in recent days, easing mortgage requirements, more attractive loans for first time buyers. That may help a little but you got to remember the backdrop of economic data in China right now unemployment rising, particularly from younger generations. They've got a long way to go to try and stimulate this economy. So all being said, I would say it doesn't look all that exciting for anyone that looks at Chinese property stories and wonders why we care so much, you know, the property market in China directly and indirectly accounts for almost a third of China's economy.

And President Ruta and I wrote a joint article, Africa's energy future, and challenges and opportunities to put the things in a context for the climate change. Africa is responsible, only 3 percent of the global emissions, which is almost nothing. Yet Africa is the continent, which be the most affected from the impact of the changing climate in terms of gross, sick loans and other, so this is a major, major problem for Africa. And in my view, also for the rest of the world, the social issues taking place in Africa as a result of the climate change the imbalances, resulting in many issues; including immigration is a key, key, key challenge for the rest of the world. And at the same time, Africa is -- huge amount of solar potential, wind potential, a geothermal hydropower potential, but not making the most out of it, because of lack of investments, as you're safe.

And the amount of electricity generated produced from solar in the entire Sub Saharan Africa is half of it, which is produced in Netherlands. Think about the world map. How big is the Sub Saharan Africa, the size of Netherlands, how sunny is the Netherlands and Sub Saharan Africa. This is really a big injustice, and it is changing people's lives. So what needs to happen? Two things one, the government's here, try to minimize the risks of investment coming here because investors will not come here, because they have very good hearts to have the people, most of them at least. The second, there is a need for the intention of financial institutions, such as the World Bank region development bank's playing a facilitator role and provide some concessional funding, funding some de- risking mechanisms.

In Europe, if you see UK, if you see Ireland, the price of metric of squaremeter is very high, the price of mobile is high, the price of materials is getting any rising. But at the same time, all European countries as well as in states and other are -- of construction. In -- , we need to be able to make the 3d printing accepted in size of -- construction, as safe as a normal building, as safe a normal concrete. And that's a long process of allocating. In a train, we were able to pass around that because the Victorian Government now is very, very fast in decision. And we are working with academic universities and the government to also make this type of construction on the history building accepted. It's all a question of advocating, but I can bet you, you will have in all the country already you have in state a lot, 3D-printing for school infrastructure and everything.

It's been difficult over the last couple of days because I also talked to a lot of people who told me look, I walked this behind me here is the playa right. And so that's where it gets muddy and cakey. And people had to walk this whole area here behind me. Now what you're seeing is a lot of the cars are actually able to make their way out. So this is the main entrance and exit out of the festival. And so, you're seeing these RVs finally making their way out, it is not officially clear, they're not lifting the shelter in place. At least we have not heard from the organizers. We're waiting for word on that. And so, we'll wait to see how many people decide to leave today. But over the last couple of days, they've been told to shelter in place to be very careful conserving water, fuel, food, because when people come here, they bring just the right amount of food and water for the days that they're going to be staying. So when they're told Shelter in Place, stay for one, two extra days. There were some that told me it's concerning because maybe we don't have enough for two more days or three more days, but again, very positive. Everybody just very happy and telling me that they've had a great time. The burn is supposed to happen tonight, we'll see if that actually ends up happening. They're now telling people to keep on going because they want the flow of cars to just remain open for people that want to come out. So we're waiting to hear from organizers to see what's going to happen throughout the day. But look, I thought people who had to put plastic bags on their shoes, wrap them with duct tape in order to come out. They told me it took them about three hours. I talked to people whose RVs were stuck. They were using shovels to try to get those RVs up and running again. So it just has been a difficult last couple of days. Just because even though people here expected harsh conditions, they just did not expect this amount of rain and dealing with that very cakey mud Julia.",
