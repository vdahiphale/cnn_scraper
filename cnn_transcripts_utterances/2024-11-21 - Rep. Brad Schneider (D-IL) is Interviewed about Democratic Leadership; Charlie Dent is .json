Like Gore, Harris could remain a top leader in her party unless she makes a similar decision. But as Democrats search for a path forward in Republican-led Washington, new voices are already emerging.Take, for example, our next guest, who yesterday was elected leader of the largest moderate Democratic caucus in the House, chosen to lead at a time when some in the party are looking to the center for answers after Democrats' election losses. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. SETH MOULTON (D-MA): If we're going to win more elections, we've got to appeal to voters in the center. REP. GREG LANDSMAN (D-OH): We like when the center left and the center right work together. That's what we want. REP. TOM SUOZZI (D-NY): And we can't be afraid to speak our minds because we're going to get lambasted by the far left of our party. REP.

At the same time as there, on one level, an ebbing tide, on another level, and you mentioned the New Dems, which I was proud to be selected to lead in the next Congress, we had a tide coming in. We were - our 100 members in the current Congress. We were 42 members when I came here in 2013. In the new Congress we'll be 108. And there's two undecided races. We could be as many as 110 members in the 119th Congress. We are more than half of the Democratic caucus.So there was a shift towards the center, moderates, and I like to say moderate is a style more than a position. We have a variety, a wide range of positions within our caucus, but we are the ones who are willing to roll up our sleeves, get things done, can communicate at our - in our home districts about growing our economy, meeting the needs of people that they talk about at their kitchen tables.

They don't get elevated to the attorney general of the United States, top law enforcement officer. That's why this is so different and compelling. Plus, you have the United States Senate sitting out there saying, hey, we have an official record we'd like to put together as part of this confirmation process. And so, we still have time. By the way, you just saw Congressman Van Orden talking about how they're going to go about, you know, releasing this report. Somebody's going to go to the House floor and move, you know, a privileged motion to have this thing released. Then there will be a motion to table. And that'll be the procedural vote. But there are plenty of House Republicans who are going to want to vote for this. We all know that they - this - have great disdain for Matt Gaetz.

I'm sure that the report recommends sanctions of some sort, reprimand, censure, expulsion in the worst case, although that's moot now that he resigned. So, that's what they're - they're looking at. And they're also, by the way, if they - if the committee uncovers potential criminal wrongdoing, they can refer the matter to the Justice Department. I was involved with a few of those cases. That happens. I don't know what's in this report, but this is really messy. And Matt Gaetz did not resign because this report was going to be clean. So, I suspect they did their job professionally and thoroughly, the committee, bipartisan basis. Now they're caught up over this issue of a post resignation release. And that's unfortunate. But I do think they'll get to it. And, by the way, I don't think Speaker Johnson did anybody any favors by running his mouth and saying this shouldn't go public.
