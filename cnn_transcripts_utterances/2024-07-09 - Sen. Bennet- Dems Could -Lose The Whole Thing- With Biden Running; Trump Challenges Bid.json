The President is working to show he's still fit for the job, amid major concerns behind closed doors. My source tonight is a key Senate Democrat. Meanwhile, Donald Trump's search for his next VP pick is now entering the homestretch, as his former rival turned ally, Senator Marco Rubio was center stage at his Florida rally, tonight, a decision potentially just days away. Also, Ukraine's president, tonight, saying that the whole world is waiting for November's U.S. presidential election, and that includes, he says, Vladimir Putin, as NATO allies in Washington, are on edge. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. We're live here in Washington, tonight, where there has been mass despair inside the Democratic Party, but so far no mass defections. With the eyes of the world on him, President Biden addressed world leaders, gathered here for the high-stakes NATO summit, earlier today, starting with a forceful speech, highlighting the military alliance, as he sought to downplay concerns about his performance.

So far, one more House Democrat has come forward, in the last 24 hours, to call on President Biden to drop out of the 2024 race. That's Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey. You've seen her here on this show, making her the seventh House Democrat to do so. A lot of Democrats in the House and in the Senate still have major concerns about Biden's viability as a candidate. And lawmakers are coming out of meetings, with little consensus about what to do next. Or as Steve Cohen of Tennessee put it today, when he was asked if his party is all on the same page, quote, \"We're not even in the same book.\" But most of the differences that are being discussed, behind closed doors, Biden has made clear that he is not getting out of this race, which means this is what you're hearing in front of the cameras.
