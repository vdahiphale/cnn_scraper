I'm Eleni Giokos, and this is \"Connect the World\". Also happening over the next two hours, Russian President Vladimir Putin hosting the BRICS Summit to show the world he is not as isolated as some Western countries might think. And then Kamala Harris gearing up for a CNN Town Hall, she will make her case to convince undecided voters less than two weeks away from the U.S. presidential election. Plus, the UAE is working to implement artificial intelligence into everyday life. We'll bring you an interview with one of the key technology players in the region. Hi, welcome to the show, and I want to quickly check in on how the markets are going to open in about 30 minutes from now. U.S. futures all showing negative starts to the day all down quite significantly. We'll touch on those overall numbers in about 30 minutes from now. And we start in Lebanon, where Israel's military says it has killed three Hezbollah commanders and the group's drone experts in the past 48 hours. Those reported deaths coming as Israel attacks what it says are more Hezbollah targets around Beirut and in Southern Lebanon. This is the scene from Tyre, one of several areas where the IDF issued evacuation orders today. It's one of Lebanon's main tourist destinations. And in news, reminiscence of Gaza, the head of a Lebanese doctors group says five hospitals in the country are now completely shut down and another 22 partially damaged from Israeli air strikes. He also says some 150 health care workers have been killed. U.S. Secretary of State, Antony Blinken is in Saudi Arabia after his meetings in Israel with prime ministers, the prime minister and other top officials. And he went directly there, after scrapping a planned visit to Jordan. Blinken has been meeting with the Saudi Foreign Minister. Before leaving Israel, he said Israel has achieved most of its military objectives in Gaza, and must now turn that into a quote, strategic success. Blinken's departure from Israel was delayed by this. Air raid sirens rang out in Central and Northern Israel. Hezbollah says it fired rockets at a military base housing an Israeli Intel unit. The rockets were intercepted and no injuries have been reported. Matthew Chance is connecting us this hour from Jerusalem, and we've also got Oren Liebermann standing by at the Pentagon for us. Matthew, I want to start with you. Let's begin with the latest Israeli air strikes in Lebanon. What more can you tell us?",

      "sentences": "Well, that they're continuing and that it's the City of Tyre in Southern Lebanon which isbeing affected most intensely at the moment, with multiple air strikes being reported in the center of that ancient city causing a widespread damage. Earlier, of course, the Israelis issued a declaration, an order for the residents of certain areas of Tyre to evacuate, saying that they were going to carry out these kinds of air strikes against what they say are Hezbollah targets in the vicinity, warning people to stay away from anybody who was a member of Hezbollah or connected with Hezbollah as well. This all part of course of an ongoing and expanding Israeli military campaign to target the militia of Hezbollah in Beirut and in areas of Southern Lebanon and Eastern Lebanon as well. Hospitals, medical workers have been targeted, as have financial institutions affiliated with Hezbollah. And of course, dozens of people have been killed and injured in these ongoing strikes. This is one of the things that I think that Antony Blinken, the U.S. Secretary of State, was urging the Israelis to pull back on. But clearly you know that military campaign in Lebanon as well as in Gaza, is continuing despite that visit the 11th by the U.S. Secretary of State.",

      "sentences": "Well, Secretary of State Antony Blinken just left Israel. Crucially, it's worth noting that hecanceled a stop in Jordan and then made his way straight to Saudi Arabia, where he met with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. He also met with Saudi's Foreign Minister. Blinken is trying to lay the groundwork, or perhaps expand the groundwork, for the day after the war, but as you point out rightly so. First, Israel has not yet put forward a day after the war plan either for Gaza. Well, it has for Lebanon, at least to some extent. Whether that has gained any traction in the region is a very different question. But Blinken is also trying to essentially get Arab countries on board and to put pressure on Israel and on Hamas and Hezbollah to get to the point where they're ready to say we're ready for a cease fire. So that's part of Blinken's goal here. The readout of the meetings didn't explicitly mention Saudi-Israel normalization. That has been a broader goal of the United States. Although that seems incredibly far away, because it requires a pathway towards a State of Palestine and a two-state solution. The Saudis have made that abundantly clear, and the fact that it didn't -- wasn't mentioned in the readout, perhaps give you -- gives you a sense of how remote the U.S. sees that possibility at the moment. Blinken talked about the need now to move towards an end to the war in Gaza, and so that Israel has a sort of strategic success here. That's a line we've heard from the U.S. in the past, but the difficulties here are very much numerous as Blinken tries to make some sort of progress here. And of course, weighing on all of this is the fact that Israel is expected to carry out a retaliation against Iran, perhaps as soon as the coming days, especially now that a U.S. fat air defense batteries up and running in Israel, Eleni.",

The question,of course, is when and what's the target here? President Joe Biden alluded just a couple of days ago that he knows the targets. He knows Israel's plans, but he's not going to simply put that forward here. It is worth noting that any retaliation, any fighting between Israel and Iran, inherently involves Saudi Arabia to some extent. So that perhaps another reason that Blinken was there in Saudi meeting with Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman and others in the foreign minister, the U.S. has tried to limit the scope of Israel's response. The U.S. trying to get past this cycle of attack retaliation. Iran has made it also abundantly clear that any further attack on sovereign. Iran will involve another response, another attack on Israel. So that's the cycle that the U.S. is trying to get away from, but that, in and of itself, is very difficult. So, whatever the U.S. can do to understand and perhaps limit the scope of Israel's attack on Iran, that is something Blinken is very interested in doing here.",

Well, while the conflict escalates inthe Middle East, President Vladimir Putin is hosting the BRICS Summit in Russia, where he says the formation of a new multi polar world order is now underway. During his opening speech at the summit, Mr. Putin said the process of shifting the global balance of power away from the U.S. led west is taking place as a number of countries stand behind him, leaders from China, India, Brazil, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the UAE are among the political heavyweights attending the three-day gathering in Russia. And as you can see, images of that group photo coming through. We've got CNN's Clare Sebastian joining us now from London for an update. Look, Vladimir Putin is making bold claims right now, but BRICS leaders have a wide range of viewpoints and frankly, interests. A reality that observers say truly limits the ability to send a unified message, especially the kind Putin may desire. What can you tell us about what BRICS ultimately is trying to achieve, whether it's economic formation here or whether there's also political elements?",

Charter Human Rights, you know, the protection of democracy, but there are significant emissions. It calls for an immediate cease fire in Gaza, but goes nowhere close to doing that in Ukraine, it calls for freedom of navigation in the Red Sea, but not the Black Sea, where Russia has stepped up its attacks on port infrastructure and civilian vessels recently. And certainly, now that Iran is a member of the BRICS. We see a lot of condemnation of Israel in that declaration as well.

Just a short time ago, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told the media, the U.S. has evidence that North Korean troops are now in Russia. He says, quote, what exactly they're doing is left to be seen. North Korea and Russia have forged increasingly friendly ties since Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The U.S. does not believe North Korean troops have reached Ukraine, but their movements have generated deep concern of potentially serious escalation in the conflict. With time running out until Election Day and the race excruciatingly close, Donald Trump is doubling down on his attacks on immigrants, the media and his rival, Kamala Harris. He launched a new batch of personal attacks at Harris at a rally on Tuesday, asking, without evidence to back it up. Quote, does she drink? Is she on drugs?

You know, assign jersey, baseball jersey from Yankees legend Joe DiMaggio, and other sports memorabilia. A 1980 Mercedes that was once owned by Hollywood star Lauren Bacall, as well as his TV, items of furniture and jewelry. So taken together, look Giuliani has to, now basically match the $150 million that he owes these two election workers.
