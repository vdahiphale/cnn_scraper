And welcome to this special edition of CNN TONIGHT.\"Ukraine will never surrender.\" Those are the words of a defiant Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, preparing now to return, to his war-torn country, a country that until today, he had not left, for 10 months. This is the only time. And he did it, to meet with President Biden, and to deliver that passionate speech, before Congress. We are standing by, now, for his departure, from Joint Base Andrews, in Maryland, a departure, just to be clear here, that comes with the highest security. I mean, Zelenskyy has a target on his back. And now, of course, they know where he's going. He's going home. But he got the most of his mere hours in the United States, meeting for roughly four hours, with President Biden, at the White House. Then, side-by-side, with the House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, as he headed to Capitol Hill. This is, by the way, the last time Pelosi will preside, as Speaker, over a joint meeting of Congress. Zelenskyy received a rousing standing ovation, as he appeared in his olive green fatigues, his sweatshirt, with this trident on the front that is his wartime uniform, instead of a suit and a tie. The Ukrainian leader, thanking the American people, for standing with Ukraine, asking for their continued support. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, President Biden has been unequivocal, for months and, once again, repeated it today, in public comments, standing next to President Zelenskyy.

And General Hertling, Putin now says he has no doubt that Russia's goals, in Ukraine, will be achieved, says it on the same day, of course, that Zelenskyy's in Washington. But Sergei Shoigu, the Defense Minister of Russia, has announced a massive increase, in the size of the Russian Military, from 1 million to 1.5 million personnel.

The point is Mr. Putin continues to announce what he's going to do, in terms of mobilization of forces. In Las Vegas, Erin, this is called throwing good money after bad. He just continues to attempt to mobilize forces. He's seen a great brain-drain, within Russia itself, of young 18-year- olds to 24-year-olds, leaving the country, trying to depart, to avoid this kind of stuff. He has proven decidedly that he does not have the equipment. There's no doctrine that their soldiers are following that's effective. Their leaders are corrupt and immoral, and they are not -- they're actually contributing to the failure, as opposed to preventing it. There's a lack of ability to adapt to the battlefield conditions. And the final thought is any modern army that performs well, on the battlefield, has trust, in their leaders, their equipment, their doctrine, and the support of the people. The Russian soldiers do not have that. So, it doesn't matter how many he's mobilizing. It just means that more of them are going to die on the battlefield.",

The United States is not carrying this burden alone. It's the Ukrainian people, who are doing the fighting. And it's our European partners, in NATO, and in other places, around the world, who are also contributing to the cost. Yes, the United States is the single biggest contributor. And depending on the turn of the war, in the next couple of months, it is possible we would need to provide more.

This includes the former President Trump's National Security Advisor, Michael Flynn, former Trump lawyer, John Eastman, longtime Republican operative, Roger Stone, as well as far- right conspiracy theorist, Alex Jones. OK, so we've got 34. Now, keep in mind, there were like 1,000 people, who testified. So, we're going to get a lot more. But 34 is a lot, and some of these are important, big ones. And we are also learning, just in these past minutes that the Committee's highly-anticipated final report, which had been expected, today, will now be released, tomorrow. Perhaps they decided to wait, because the eyes of the world, of course, were on President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Let's go to Sara Murray, now, who has been going through these transcripts.

So, when you look at the Eastman transcript, he's asked about legal memos that he wrote. He invokes the Fifth Amendment. Roger Stone, remember, he was convicted of lying to Congress, in the Russia investigation, and later pardoned by Trump. He pled the Fifth to every question that he was asked. And Jeffrey Clark, the former DOJ official, he had a pretty combative set of two depositions, with the Committee. In the first one, his lawyer presented the Committee, with 12 pages of their objections. And, in his second deposition, with the Committee, he pleaded the Fifth, roughly 120 times. So, it gives you a look at how investigators were not able to maybe get all of the answers they wanted. But you learn a lot from their questions, even for these witnesses, that were not willing to answer investigators' questions. In the questions they asked, you can tell that they have been able to obtain emails, these people are involved in, text threads these people are involved in. So, it gives you an idea of the volume of evidence the Committee has, even when they're dealing with witnesses, who are not interested, in answering the Committee's questions, Erin.",

So, for example, Roger Stone is asked, \"Did you have any communications with President Trump, on January 5, or January 6?\" Pleads the Fifth. The DOJ official, Jeffrey Clark, \"Did you meet with President Trump, without telling your supervisors,\" which is against policies in the White House and Justice Department, pleads the -- takes the Fifth.
