A live look at Capitol Hill on this Thursday morning. Good morning, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt. It's wonderful to have you with us. We're now getting our first look at never-before-seen evidence filed by special prosecutor Jack Smith in the 2020 election interference case against Donald Trump. This includes the personal notes of then Vice President Mike Pence, who wrote five pages detailing an Oval Office meeting where Trump was pressuring Pence to take action just two days before January 6. Those notes allege that Trump told Pence things like, quote, \"When there's fraud, the rules get changed,\" end quote. Quote, \"You can be bold,\" end quote, and that Pence had, quote, \"the right to do whatever you want to do,\" end quote. But the vice president rejected those plans and two days later oversaw the joint session of Congress to certify the election for Joe Biden, telling Trump that -- his plans in a phone call that morning. While Pence was on Capitol Hill to do this, Trump was at the Ellipse outside the White House, launching what the special counsel calls, quote, \"an indirect threat,\" end quote, against his vice president during a speech to his supporters.

Zolan Kanno-Youngs, let's talk big picture here for a second, because obviously, this is coming down, you know, under 35 days to the election.You have -- this morning, we're learning that Liz Cheney is going to be out on the campaign trail with Kamala Harris in Wisconsin, the birthplace of the Republican Party. She obviously is someone who staked her entire political life on what unfolded on January 6th. What impact does this have on the campaign here at this late hour? Obviously, Trump's people are saying -- and I'm sure Mike will want to weigh in on this -- that the Justice Department shouldn't have done this. But I'm curious kind of how you think about this as you cover the campaign day in and day out. ZOLAN KANNO-YOUNGS, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Sure. I mean, it's -- look, the Harris campaign and the Biden campaign before it, when they would talk about democracy as a theme in this election, they would often point to January 6th. They would point to also the allies of the former president, who were trying to revise the history and the record of what happened on January 6. And you had Democrats really trying to remind voters of that day and what the former president did not do. The amount of time that he spent in the White House seeing that riot unfold. And his statements leading up to that riot that encouraged his supporters to storm the Capitol. Something like this, that's not just sort of a politician attacking another politician, but is -- but are -- but are findings in a legal document that are going to continue to be talked about, are only going to fuel some of the criticism against the former president. Just to your point, as well, when you talk about some of the descriptions in here, particularly about the former president and what's described in terms of his reaction to hearing that his then- vice president was in danger, that the Secret Service had -- was -- had to rush him off because some of the rioters outside were threatening him, I mean, the president -- the former president's reaction is described as saying, \"So what?\" Something like that is only going to be talked about in these limited weeks we have and the remainder of the election. And remember, it comes right after a V.P. debate where one of the real sort of memorable moments was Tim Walz also pressing Vance and asking him whether the former president had lost the election.

But at the same time, an economic downturn, 30 days -- is going to get hung around their necks. ANNIE LINSKEY, REPORTER, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Oh, absolutely. I mean, this union leader is picking a very good time to do this. He has sort of the maximum amount of leverage here. One of the things I think is most interesting is that he has support not only on the Democratic side, but also the Republican side, even though Donald Trump has said supportive things, as well, and is already maneuvering to do exactly what you said and hang this around Kamala Harris and -- and Joe Biden's neck, for lack of a better way of saying it. So, yes, I mean, they have the power at the moment. But I have to say, I cannot fathom that they're going to have this power for a lot longer. I do not think that Joe Biden can allow this strike to actually start hurting the economy. I think they've got a few days, a few more days perhaps. But the president, ultimately, I think -- HUNT: Zolan, what are the options for the president? KANNO-YOUNGS: I mean, they're squeezed, here, right? The president could pursue action known as Taft-Hartley, which would basically say that the longshoremen need to go back to work for what's known as an 80-day cooling off period. That doesn't sort of provide a solution to this labor dispute. You still theoretically, after that 80-day period, would have to have these guys during that time go back to the table.",

And it's just odd for the month of October to have this type of heat. So, we're breaking records, but it's also been this streak of heat that we've had over the past several months, which we'll highlight in just one moment. But this is including places like San Francisco to Sacramento, Los Angeles, and Eastward towards Phoenix. And we highlight into Phoenix, because just yesterday you broke a decades-long record high temperature of 107. It actually reached 108 yesterday. So, this puts 113 consecutive days where your temperature has risen above that 100-degree mark. So, that's really kind of contextualizing just how extreme the heat has been this year and how it remains. And we don't see any real relief in sight for Phoenix. This is just one city, for example. But much of the Southwestern U.S. continues to bake under this abnormally warm October temperature. Now, completely different story unfolding over the Eastern half of the U.S., where we're enjoying very autumn-like weather across the Northern portions of New England, where we're reaching peak fall colors. So, looking beautiful, and we'll enjoy the below average temperatures. But there's the above-average weather that will continue over the Western U.S. Not much in terms of weather, a sign from an area of disturbed weather across the Gulf of Mexico. We're lowering those chances of tropical development. But regardless, this will bring a lot of rain to Florida through the weekend and into early parts of next week -- Kasie.",
