According to the sheriff's office, 58-year-old Rick Chow, the convenience store owner, thought that 14-year-old Cyrus Carmack-Belton had taken four water bottles from his convenience store. The sheriff says that's not what happened. The teen just took the bottles out, put them down somewhere else in the store.But there was a verbal confrontation and then the teen ran out of the store. That's when the sheriff says that Chow and Chow's son chased him out of the store, off of the property. The teen running away from them fell down, got back up, that is when Chow's son told the sheriff they thought they saw a gun and Rick Chow fired, shooting the teen in the back. According to the coroner, he was shot once in the back. His injuries are consistent with someone running away at the time. Now, the sheriff said they did locate a gun near the teen's body. But say, there's no evidence that he pointed or threatened the shop owner with that gun at all. The coroner, Rahel, says that he didn't have any evidence on his body that suggests there was any kind of physical confrontation, simply an argument, and then running away.",

JOHN BERMAN, CNN NEWS CENTRAL CO-ANCHOR:  This morning, an appeals court in New York has granted the Sackler family immunity in exchange for a $6 billion opioid settlement. Now, the wealthy family that owns Purdue Pharma will be shielded from current and future lawsuits. The drugmaker called the ruling a victory. Purdue Pharma branded oxycontin as a non-addictive drug when it began selling it in the 1990s. They are accused of fueling the opioid crisis that has killed more than half a million people over the last 20 years. CNN's Jean Casarez joins us now.

But on top of that, it also emphasizes the importance of managers and establishments being supportive of that because, it's interesting, Rahel, this report found fewer than half, 44 percent of establishments offered paid sick leave.So, the CDC says if more sick workers stay home and if employers support that, that will help reduce the risk of these kinds of outbreaks occurring.",

We still have a few more hours or days or so of erratic fire behavior before the cooler weather and the precipitation settles in. You can see how temperatures spike tomorrow to 88 degrees before cooling off into the lower and middle 70s in the areas worst impacted by the fires over western Nova Scotia.Now, we've tracked this smoke plume that's just brought the thick, hazy, smoky conditions over much of New England and much of the mid- Atlantic as well. And in fact, the National Weather Service hoisting what is called an air quality alert index for fine particulate matter. And why this matter is because the size of this smoke, right, the actual particulate matter is so small, it's about two and a half microns. For comparison, the average width of a human hair around 50 microns. So, this has the ability to get absorbed deep within your chest cavity and that makes people who are vulnerable with, let's say, upper respiratory illnesses, the elderly, children, they are more vulnerable to breathing that type of air quality in. Now, you can see, we have some upsides to this. The beautiful sunrises and sunsets. So, we know what smoke from wildfires can do when it's in the upper levels of the atmosphere. It literally filters out the shorter wavelengths once the sun gets blocked out of it and we're actually seeing what is left over, the red, visible light, the longer wavelengths. But the real problem is when it settles to the ground. Kate, you know, that is the unhealthy air that we all breathe.",
