Cosgrove, of course, was one of the seven cops who was involved in that botched overnight raid on Taylor's apartment just three years ago. The state's attorney general says that he fired the bullet that killed her. The Louisville Metro Police Department fired him nearly a year later.

And it has caused a big uproar in France where Svetlana Maniovich continues to travel despite the role of her husband in the war and despite the fact that, you know, she is spending all this money as people are dying and there are very real questions as to where that money comes from.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WARD (voice over): Svetlana Maniovich is a woman of expensive tastes. Diamonds and couture, extravagant parties and European vacations. Just last month she was seen shopping and dancing in the elite French ski resort of Courchevel. But Maniovich is no ordinary Russian socialite. She is the other half of Russia's deputy minister of defense, Timur Ivanov, one of the most senior architects of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. And, according to a shocking investigation, Maniovich continues to galivant around France, more than a year into Russia's bloody war, despite the fact that Ivanov was sanctioned by the EU in October. The explosive report put out by the Anti-Corruption Foundation, and investigative outfit founded by Russia's jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny, is based, they say, on a leaked archive of more than 8,000 of Maniovich's emails over the last 12 years, and has racked up more than 6 million views on YouTube. It claims that on March 25, 2022, as dozens of missiles rained down on the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, Maniovich spent more than $100,000 in a top Paris jewelry store on the Place Vendome. WARD (on camera): How is it possible that she can continue to do this? MARIA PEVCHIKH, HEAD OF INVESTIGATIONS, ANTI-CORRUPTION FOUNDATION: It's a very simple trick that they've played. Point number one, Svetlana has an Israeli passport through her first - through her first husband. And, second of all, six months into the war, they have filed for divorce. They haven't - they haven't split any assets. Nothing has changed in terms of like in their daily life. This -- whatever they owned, they keep owning together. But technically they're not legally married anymore. WARD (voice over): Equally shocking are the opulent lifestyle and lavish spending that the leaked emails document. According to Russian business publication RBC, Ivanov's official income was once declared to be around 14.2 million rubles a year, less than $175,000. Yet the Navalny Group's report calculated that the couple spent more than a quarter of a million dollars in just one summer. CNN has not been able to independently verify those numbers.

Is it going to be worth it?Joining us now, Ian Rapoport. He's the national insider for the NFL Network and nfl.com. I was just saying in the break, wasn't he going to retire? There was - he would retire. And then there was the darkness retreat. And then he saw the light of New York City and now he's coming? IAN RAPOPORT, NATIONAL INSIDER, NFL NETWORK AND NFL.COM: I mean, it has - it has all been amazing. It all been a journey. Not quite like the personal journey that Aaron Rodgers has been on the last six weeks or so, but a journey for all of us. Yes, Aaron Rodgers did consider retirement. He said on \"The Pat McAfee Show\" he was 90 percent going to retire. Then he went to the darkness. Then comes out wanted to play for the Jets. And that really kickstarted this whole thing. When he said he intended to be a member of the Jets, I would say trade talks probably picked up from there. They were going along, kind of slow. Then there was about a two-week lull. And then my understanding is, right before the weekend, the Jets and Packers re-engaged. And a significant issue here, the one thing that - that kind of took this from dormant talks to talks that were really imminent was the Green Bay Packers wanted a hard (ph) first rounder with no conditions, wanted a first rounder next year no matter what. They finally gave in a little bit of that and ended up being a conditional one based on how Aaron Rodgers played.

The offensive player of the year - the offensive rookie of the year, the defensive rookie of the year, Breece Hall, who probably would have been had he not gotten injured. They just needed one thing. They needed a quarterback. And that is why this Aaron Rodgers trade made so much sense and I would say it had to happen for Woody Johnson and the Jets because they have a team that is built to compete, built to go to the playoffs.
