      "sentences": "Tonight on 360Also tonight, details on what federal prosecutors say was a plot by Iran to assassinate Trump before the election. And later, after two years of more than three dozen felony indictments, Special Counsel Jack Smith is winding down the government's cases against the president-elect. Good evening, thanks for joining us. The President-elect Trump prepares to name more people to his administration, perhaps including some of the names that we will show you. There is new reporting tonight on some of the moves he is already making, as well as talks that some of the government are having about worst-case scenarios involving him as commander-in-chief. Defense officials tell us that informal discussions are underway at the Pentagon about how the department might respond if the new president ordered active-duty troops onto US streets or fires large numbers of nonpolitical staffers. That news coming as we learned that when the president-elect spoke by phone with Ukraine's president on Wednesday, Elon Musk joined the call. Ukraine's military, you'll remember relies on Musk's Starlink communication satellite. It has been critical in the fight there. \"The Wall Street Journal\" earlier reported that Musk had also been in regular contact with Vladimir Putin since the 2022. Both he and the president-elect have talked publicly about Ukraine making concessions to end the war with Mr. Trump arguing recently that Ukraine should have made a deal with Moscow even before Russian troops invaded. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R) PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES: Any deal, even the worst deal would have been better than what we have right now. If they made a bad deal, it would have been much better, and it didn't need to happen. Those buildings are down, those as it is are gone. They are gone and we continue to give billions of dollars to a man who refuses to make a deal, Zelenskyy. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

With us is Kaitlan Collins, anchor of the \"The Source\" and the top of the next hour, she is back from Mar-a-Lago.

And I think having him on the call with Zelenskyy just speaks to Elon Musk's influence and what that could look like in a second Trump term. And obviously, he has stake in the game here since Ukraine is using his Starlink satellite communications service, which I should note, that is a contract with the Pentagon that expires at the end of next month. We will see what that looks like after that. But obviously, he has a lot of stake in this game. And so, just for his presence to be on that call is notable because it is on with the world leader and the president-elect and the world's richest man who has major defense contracts.   It also just speaks to how much influence Elon Musk has right now in Trump's orbit.",

Something he is taking seriously, I should note, this time around.He says that his staffing choices in his first term were some of his biggest mistakes he had ever made. Citing people like Bill Barr, the attorney general. And so, he is taking it very seriously and because of that people know that in order to influence Trump you need to be right in front of him, either on the phone or in front of him having these conversations. And so, there is a lot of jockeying having behind the scenes. A lot of alliances are being formed between people who are trying to say , if we stick together we can kill this other person off for this job and so often, when Trump makes these calls, it depends on the person who has the biggest influence on him when it comes to that.",

There are thousands of positions and they have said, frankly they don't know how certain facets of the Pentagon are going to work if those people just disappear in two weeks from now.And so, I think that's a question of, how much of the hollowing out they actually do that Trump and Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy had promised to do when it comes to the federal government. But at the DoD specifically, one thing I'm keeping an eye on is who Trump is going to pick us as his Defense secretary because he was very frustrated with several of the ones he picked the last time he was in office. He took to the end of Mark Esper's term as the Defense secretary. He was calling him Mark 'Yesper' saying that he just says yes to everything and kind of ridiculing almost, or not even almost just out right in public. And so, he certainly wants someone that he has more cohesion with as Trump people would put it, essentially someone who does more of what he wants and less pushing back at the Pentagon.",

Another, one of his golf courses in Florida, when an armed man was arrested before any shots were fired.Today, the Justice Department announced charges in another alleged plot. This one hatched in Iran to kill candidate Trump. CNN's Alex Marquardt has the latest. So, what do we know about this plot?   ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Well these are murder for hire charges, Anderson, issued against three men. These were orders from the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, the IRGC tasking a man named Farhad Shakeri with assassinating former, now future President Trump. Now, the orders were given, we understand, to Shakeri who is an Afghan national believed to be at large in Iran. He actually spent time here in the US growing up and then he spent years in New York State Prisons and that is where the Feds believe he met many of his future accomplices including two of the co-defendants who were named in the documents that were unsealed today. Now, Shakeri allegedly had a meeting with an IRGC official just a month ago on October 7th. He was told to come up with a plan to assassinate Trump before the election. He was told that you only have a week and if you don't do it within the next week we will wait until after the election because they assume that he was going to lose the election and that it would be easier to kill him after the election. Now, Shakeri says he didn't plan on coming up with that plot within that timeframe and we know that because he was actually speaking with the FBI not once, but five times, Anderson, in the past few months. That's where they got a lot of this information, but this is not the first plot as you know, not the first Iranian plot to try to kill Trump and his allies. A Pakistani man was charged back in August with plans to assassinate government officials, the Feds are believing including former President Trump.",

They tried to track her down in Brooklyn where they thought she lived. He was going to pay them $100,000.00 for carrying this out. That attack never was carried out. Then there were two others of note, Anderson, two American-Jewish businessmen, the IRGC wanted killed. There were going to offer $500,000.00 to Shakeri for each one and then another plot they wanted mounted if you will in Sri Lanka to kill Israeli tourists. And it got to point where just last month the Israeli and American governments issued warnings to their citizens there. Now, this raises all kinds of questions about what future President Trump will do in response.

Susie likes to stay sort of in the back, let me tell you. The ice babe. We call her the ice babe. RANDI KAYE, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Donald Trump's newly minted chief of staff, Susie Wiles, does not enjoy the spotlight like her boss. The 40-year veteran of Republican politics prefers to operate behind the scenes. JOE GRUTERS (R), FLORIDA STATE SENATE: She's a steady hand and she's a loyal foot soldier. KAYE (voice-over): On her LinkedIn page under specialties, Wiles listed this, \"Creating order from chaos.\" A skill that came in handy while running Trump's presidential campaign.",

One of her goals, keep a close eye on who had access to the former president. Wiles has a string of political campaign success stories. In 2010, she helped Rick Scott eke out a win to become governor of Florida. In 2018, she was tapped to save Ron DeSantis campaign for Florida governor. He won by 32,000 votes, the closest governor's election in state history. After that, amid tensions, Wiles was ousted from DeSantis inner circle. She went back to work on Trump's Florida re-election team, but was dismissed at DeSantis's urging. In 2020, Trump brought her back amid concerns about his campaign's standing in Florida polls. He ended up winning Florida by more than three points against Joe Biden.",

What is her overall style like that might benefit the Trump White House?KAYE (on-camera): Well, Anderson, when I spoke with Senator Joe Gruters today, he told me that she has a very specific demeanor. She's very calming, but she's also a great leader. And that should play well in the next Trump White House. It will set the tone for the next Trump White House. And if she has any say, as expected in the hiring of others there, she will likely make sure that they have the same DNA and will try to keep the chaos out of this next White House. He also said that Donald Trump likes to surround himself with winners, and that likely played into this as well, because Susie Wiles is certainly a winner. She has a stack of campaign victories here in Florida, and certainly the most recent presidential election and he likes that about her. But Anderson, of course, keep in mind that Donald Trump in his first term went through four chiefs of staff. So although she is anti-chaos, it seems, we'll see how it plays this time around.
