      "sentences": "A warm welcome to \"First Move\", great to have you with us on this Easter Monday and exciting and an exceptional show foryou as always sorry including a diplomatic scramble U.S. Officials searching for the source of a highly classified document leak exposing sensitive information about Ukraine's Military shortfalls, and more. We'll have a live report from Kyiv and the Pentagon. Plus, hardball Beijing, China conducting a third straight day of military drills and war simulations around Taiwan or this is French President Macron stairs up a transatlantic tussle, saying Europe should avoid getting dragged into the dispute. We're live in Beijing for the latest fair too and sunny side up. Washington Beijing tensions not stopping Tesla's solar and EV ambitions in China, Elon Musk announcing a major new Shanghai battery factory investment on Sunday. We'll discuss that plus other tech trends with Dan Ives of Wedbush Security. Tech, of course, a key part of many nest eggs but a soft bold start, as you can see to the U.S. trading session. It seems though with Wall Street futures lower as you can see and much of Europe still on holiday so liquidity today will be thin. Investors also getting their first chance to react to Friday's solid U.S. jobs report. That data of course strong enough to keep another Federal Reserve interest rate hike in play the other data's matter too, investor walking on eggshells in the meantime, ahead of important inflation data out later this week and too the start of first quarter earnings season. We've got major U.S. banks beginning reporting results on Friday of this week what U.S. regional banks say about profit pressures and the size of their depositor base will be key in the weeks ahead also especially given new data from the Federal Reserve showing U.S. bank lending plunging by the most on record following the Silicon Valley Bank collapse. The numbers playing into fears that U.S. economic growth will slow as financial institutions pull back on providing credit. Let's to get to you as always, but we do begin the show with the latest on the China-Taiwan tensions, \"ready for combat\". The Chinese Military says it's primed to fight after carrying out three days of air and sea exercises under warfare conditions. The drills were staged just days after Taiwan's President angered Beijing by visiting the United States and meeting Senior U.S. politicians. Selina Wang joins us now on this posturing of military power is not unexpected, I think in light of what we've seen in recent days. But I do think we have to put it in perspective once again, Selina, compared to what we saw, after Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan in August of last year. This does feel on a relative basis more muted.",

Beijing claimed the island is theirs and called the move illegal whereas the U.S. says it can operate wherever international law allows. So it's not just Taiwan, the South China Sea is another source of tensions between the U.S. and China. Also interesting is the timing of these military drills around Taiwan. China started them after President Tsai Ing- wen already returned to Taiwan. Some analysts are saying that some of the timing has to do with the fact that China wanted to wait until several global leaders had left China, Beijing was hosting French President Emmanuel Macron as well as the EU Commission Chief and perhaps as China is trying to portray itself as this global statesman. As Xi Jinping is hosting many of these global leaders they wanted to restrain some of their action just a little bit so that they can uphold that reputation, Julia.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Julia, it's already causing some friction between the U.S. and its allies. I'm sure as you sawover the weekend; Israel had to release a statement, downplaying the intelligence that was in some of these reports. That was sourced to the CIA that said that the Israeli Mossad, the intelligence agency, there was actually egging on protesters internally in Israel against the government there. The Mossad having to issue a statement in response to the leak saying that they categorically deny that South Korea as well also mentioned in these leaked intelligence reports. Talking about the request by the U.S. for ammunition and how the South Koreans were very nervous about that they say that they're going to raise this with Washington as well so clearly, a lot of tension now between the U.S. and its allies over this leak. And we should note that there's even information in these documents about U.S. spying on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, something that a source close to him told me is not necessarily surprising, but still deeply frustrating that this information has been put out into the public sphere. So now what the Pentagon has done is they have issued a referral to Justice Department to launch a criminal investigation into who may have done this leak, which stems really it was sitting on a discord server, which is a social media platform for at least a month before anyone even noticed it. So there are going to be a lot of questions here about why this wasn't discovered sooner how these documents that are top ranked listed as top secret, some of them ended up on this random kind of social media platform. And also moving forward how the Pentagon will is going to stem these kinds of leaks, because as we see from the documents, a lot of them come from the joint staff, which is the arm of the Pentagon. That is the most senior military leadership that advises the President, a lot of these documents are intelligence documents made for their daily briefing. So this is going to be really problematic for the U.S. moving forward in terms of maintaining not only its foreign relationships, but also maintaining the access it has, as Nick was mentioning, into the Russian Defense Ministry, as well as the Russian mercenary organization, Wagner group. Really interesting details in these documents about just the level of insight and penetration the U.S. has managed to get into Russian Defense Officials conversations as well as planning by that mercenary organization Wagner group inside Ukraine, Julia.",

They've called itinappropriate across social media after that clip emerge Sunday evening, local time here in India. I'm going to take you through the sequence of events. And I want to make it very clear that it's extremely disturbing for our viewers to actually watch that interaction between the minor boy and the Dalai Lama in Northern India. Now this incident dates back to February this year. And what we can see in the video is the boy going up to the Dalai Lama asking for a hug. The Dalai Lama then calls him on stage invites him on stage and also asks him to give him a kiss on the cheek along with that hug. And the boy obliges moments later you see the Dalai Lama then asking him to kiss him on his mouth. And then he brings in the boy's cheek, chin rather, and he kisses the boy on the mouth. Now this is disturbing enough and then seconds later, the Dalai Lama asks the boy to actually go ahead and also suck his tongue. This is extremely disturbing for people across social media and otherwise, it's led to a lot of backlash, like I mentioned, because of which six weeks after this incident, and mind you not before. The Dalai Lama's office has now come out with a statement where they've said that the Dalai Lama regrets the incident and I'm going to read a bit of that press statement as well. It says a video clip has been circulating that shows a recent meeting when a young boy asked His Holiness the Dalai Lama if he could give him a hug. His Holiness wishes to apologize to the boy and his family as well as his many friends across the world, for the hurt his words may have caused. Interesting to note that they're talking about the words and how it may have hurt people the words and not the actions that you see in that video. That's been the only reaction we've got yet we did put across a lot of questions to the Dalai Lama's office. But they only responded with a press statement that they have put out, which then continues to read His Holiness often teases people he meets in an innocent and playful way, even in public and before cameras. He regrets the incident clearly for a lot of people across social media. This is more than just teasing. It has upset huge sections of people on social media, on Twitter that have called a like I said, absolutely disappointing, absolutely disturbing and absolutely inappropriate behavior by the Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, Julia.",

The new IRA are the group that are still out there targeting trying to kill policemen. They shot a policeman just a couple of months ago. They've been targeting them at their police stations, roadside bombs, that sort of thing. You can probably hear overhead a police helicopter watching the scene here. There's a commemoration by this group going on behind me the graveside here in the cemetery in Derry overlooking the city as to commemorate the 1916 Easter uprising and every as they would see them the volunteers that have died in their struggle for United Ireland since then. But this parade they're having wasn't authorized by the police. The police say that they had strong intelligence that this group wants to create public disorder before the parade began. We saw young men preparing, preparing petrol bombs, Molotov cocktails were thrown at the police. And as soon as the march got in, the remotest contact with the police in their armored Land rovers, petrol bombs were thrown around those armored Land rovers. They try to chase down some more police vehicles or police backed off. And it's not quite clear what happens from here and this protest. But this speaks to that issue that the police have put up the terror threat level rather than the British government has put up. The terror threat level here in Northern Ireland in the past few weeks from substantial to severe meaning an attack goes from being likely to being highly likely. That's the background for this the day of literally the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday peace agreement. There are still the small groups who are opposed to it and they're not giving up what they see as their struggle.",

I never thought I was going to cry like winning a golf tournament, but I got very close on that 18th hole.
