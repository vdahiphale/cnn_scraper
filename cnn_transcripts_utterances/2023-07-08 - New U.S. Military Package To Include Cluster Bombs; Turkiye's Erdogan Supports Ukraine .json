He explained that it was a difficult decision and one that took a lot of convincing for him to ultimately get to a place where he was willing to approve this.There were months of internal debates inside the White House and among the president's national security team, which ultimately recommended unanimously to the president that he take this step. It is a step that, in the words of national security advisor Jake Sullivan, intended to a bridge of supplies to Ukraine. They are clearly running low on ammunition and this provision of cluster munitions is intended to get them the ammo they need, while domestic manufacturing of conventional artillery shells is ramped up here in the United States. This is certainly a controversial decision. More than 100 countries have banned the use of cluster munitions, including France, Germany, key NATO allies. It also required that President Biden bypass a U.S. law that prohibits the transfer of these cluster munitions to other countries. The president determining that it was in the vital national security interest of the U.S. to do that. U.S. Officials have also previously said that these munitions have no place on the battlefield. I asked Jake Sullivan on Friday about how he squares those comments with this decision. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAKE SULLIVAN, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: I am not making an argument that says, they do it, so we will do it. The argument I am making is that Russia has already spread tens of millions of these bomblets across Ukrainian territory. We have to ask ourselves, is Ukraine's use of cluster munitions on that same land actually that much of an addition of civilian harm, given that that area will have to be demined, regardless? Given what Ukraine is doing with these weapons, as opposed to what Russia is doing with these weapons, we see a substantial difference. It is not an easy decision. It is a difficult decision.

The big issue all along with cluster munitions, the reason why more than 100 countries are signatory to this ban, is because of what you call the dud rate.Now we are seeing technical descriptions about what the appropriate dud rate should be for the munitions that would be sent to Ukraine. It basically means that a certain percentage of these bomblets are scattered over a wide area do not go off, essentially creating a land mine hazard to civilians. And in the area where they have been dropped, Ukrainians have come back and said, they have offered guarantees in thanking the U.S. for saying these would be delivered. Ukraine's defense minister said they would abide strictly with international humanitarian law on the usage of these weapons. In other words, avoiding built-up civilian areas. Again though, I think it is pointing to the larger problem that Ukraine is going to have particularly in the east but also throughout the country, of massive, massive amounts of unexploded ordnance. We are seeing, especially in the Donbas, something that resembles the 21st century version of World War I style trench warfare, enormous amounts of ordnance being lobbed all across a huge swath of territory.",

So while Zelenskyy did have an important photo opportunity here, which was commemorating the defenders of Snake Island; quite famously, the Ukrainians came up even with a postage stamp, showing the Ukrainian soldier defending the island, giving the middle finger to a Russian warship. This is an important symbol of Ukrainian defiance and resilience we have seen since the beginning, since following the full-scale invasion of February of last year. Definitely, for Ukrainians today, this is not a joyful milestone. This is one that speaks to the immensely high cost of war.

One application was to bring her to elderly home, where people were slightly dement and we spent quite a lot of time to prepare for this visit with Nadine (ph).

So that means, it was great because they understood it as a tool that can help them with whom they can talk and make jokes, for example. But this uncanny valley didn't happen.
