Younger than 45, start if you're younger than 45 if you have a family history of colon cancer, Crohn's disease, et cetera, start at 45 to 76 for most people get screened with a colonoscopy or there are other tests as well, ages 76 to 85.

First is they didn't have a lot of information, they still don't have a lot of information, in terms of what those three objects that were shot down over the course of three days actually worse. They're waiting to get a better sense of things.Yesterday announced to the Intelligence Community had a theory, a leading theory that they were benign and that gave them some comfort in terms of the ability to come out and speak with some authority about what had been shut down. But I think they also wanted to let kind of the fury in the spiral of events ease up a little bit. So the President could deliver kind of a sober, very steadfast message about where things stood, what was going to happen next and what the process had been both in the lead up to the shutdowns and then what the process will be in the wake of that. You heard that from the President today and that was what his aides pretty much wanted him to communicate. I would say the other critical element here and probably the most critical was what the President was saying, in relation to China, in relation to how the U.S. addressed the Chinese spy balloon that was shut down. But also that relationship going forward probably the most important geopolitical relationship at this moment in time. The President saying he plans to speak with Chinese leader Xi Jinping soon. We don't know exactly when that will be or if it's officially on the books yet. But also making clear that despite what's very clearly something that U.S. officials weren't expecting and were very displeased by it is not having a massively negative impact on the relationship, and that they want to continue the open lines of communication that are so critical. That was a message that wasn't just to the American public, I think, to some degree the Chinese officials as well.",

We're not getting whatever they decided their recommendations were on who if anyone should face criminal charges.But we are getting this - some of these lines about their concerns that people lie to them under oath. It says a majority of the jurors believe that perjury may have been committed by one or more witnesses. They say the district attorney should pursue indictments if she finds that there is compelling evidence to underlie these sort of concerns about perjury. They also said that they came to a unanimous agreement after talking to those witnesses, after talking to Georgia officials, after talking to poll workers that there was no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election that would have overturned the election results. They pointed out that they still heard from witnesses that were making that claim but they unanimously agreed there was no there there. Now we are still hearing from the former president that he believes the call that set this all in motion, the call from former President Donald Trump to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger asking Raffensperger to find the votes, Trump still believes that was a perfect call. Here's a portion of what a Trump spokesperson had to say today. \"The long awaited important sections of the Georgia report, which do not even mention President Trump's name, have nothing to do with the president because President Trump did absolutely nothing wrong. The president participated in two perfect phone calls regarding election integrity in Georgia.\" Now, of course, as we just pointed out, the excerpts of this report don't mention anyone by name, the judge is very clear, he thinks it's premature to do that. So far, no one has faced charges in this case, but it's going to be up to the District Attorney, Fani Willis, to decide if she's going to bring charges against Trump or any of his associates.",

Let's start with this report. Obviously, not a wealth of information from the final report from the special grand jury, but I wonder what you found to be most revealing? ALBERTO GONZALES, FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL UNDER PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH: Well, we have to remember victory, of course, as you indicated that there's not much information here. The information that typically comes from the grand jury is one sided, so I wouldn't get too terribly excited about what's in here. Obviously, I found interesting the conclusion about the evidence - lack of evidence with respect to fraud that might have made a difference in the election. But again, there's this - because of the importance of protecting the anonymity of individuals that are called before the grand jury, and that may ultimately not be charged, obviously, the judge will be very careful about the amount of information that is released. And so, again, it's interesting, but I think we still have a ways to go to really have a fuller picture of what the situation looks like in the mind of the of the prosecutors here.",

So again, I - it's very interesting, of course, and obviously it does indicate that's probably a trail that the prosecutor is going to go down and explore.But I - would just be cautious about getting overly excited about that statement.",

And his argument is not executive privilege, although President Trump's lawyers say that he will follow that line.What Vice President Pence is saying is that based on the protections provided under the speech and debate clause from - on the Constitution that he is protected from certain legal law enforcement.

And it's because of this software, this full self-driving beta software that's onboard many of their cars. So these are the cars in question that includes certain Model S, Model X, Model 3 and Model Y vehicles spanning all the way back to 2016 in some cases.And this recall, notice that we're getting from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration really lays out what the agency says is the danger here. The NHTSA, the federal agency claims that this self- driving software could allow the Tesla vehicle to really act unsafe around intersections to start like traveling straight through an intersection from a turn only lane or entering a stop sign controlled intersection without coming to a complete stop or proceeding into an intersection during a steady yellow traffic signal without due caution. Plus, it could respond insufficiently to changes in posted speed limits or it may not adequately account for the drivers change in speed when that exceeds speed limits. So again, there are a lot of concerns there and this report really makes it clear that Tesla did not agree with the agency's analysis about their software. But ultimately, the company decided to issue this recall where they'll be releasing a free over the air software update. The question now is how is this software update going to fix the problem or to what extent will it fix the problem, because remember, this technology has been under the microscope for years now. And this recall is coming less than a week after we saw an attack ad, a pretty expensive attack ad during the Super Bowl that was created by The Dawn Project that showed Tesla's smashing into mannequins of children claiming that the vehicles are using unsafe self-driving software. Now, according to this recall notice, Tesla has identified 18 incidents that are related to this software issue but no reports of any injuries or deaths. NHTSA has identified at least 273 crashes involving Tesla's self-driver assist systems. So again, we're waiting to learn more. Tesla has not put out a formal response here, but Elon Musk is already tweeting about it saying, \"The word recall for an over-the-air software update is anachronistic and just flat wrong.\" So Elon Musk clearly does not like the word recall being used in this situation, but the headline from that federal safety administration is that 363,000 Tesla's are being recalled in this case.",
