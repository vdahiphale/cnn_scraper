Evacuation orders are in place as Hezbollah vows to keep fighting. And J.D. Vance and Tim Walz spar of a solution for the Middle East, as the two candidates for Vice President play the blame game over Iran's nuclear development. We'll tell you what they said.

One of the things that seems to indicate that, is the fact that a lot of the airports in Iran remain closed, and air traffic right now is very limited through Iranian  airspace, especially a lot of those international flights. Obviously, Iranians believe that something could be in the works. But I also think, Isa, that the Iranians believe that they did send a very clear message to the Israelis yesterday with those strikes that they carried out. They say that this was a limited strike. It was limited only to military facilities. And they say that they believe that this was well within their rights, and that they were the ones who in the past couple of months had shown restraint. I think one of the interesting things and the justification of the Iranian sent after they carried out those strikes yesterday, was that they said that this was in retaliation, not just for the killing of Hassan Nasrallah, of course, the leader of Hezbollah, but also for the killing of Ismail Haniyeh, one of the political leaders of Hamas, which happened in July in Tehran. And if you recall back then, the Iranians had already said that there would be retaliation, that they would not say what that retaliation would look like, but they say that they showed restraint at the time or didn't do anything at the time because they  believed that there could be a ceasefire in Gaza. Of course, that's something that never did materialize. And then after the killing of Hassan Nasrallah, the Iranians now say that they believed that they needed to act, and they say that what they're essentially doing was a defensive act on their part. Now, what they're saying now is they're warning the Israelis from any sort of retaliation, warning the United States as well. In fact, today, the President of Iran, Masoud Pezeshkian, he was in Qatar, and I want to listen into some of what he had to say.

In the meantime, Nic Robertson, Frederik Pleitgen, thank you to you both. Well, people across Lebanon are bracing for the worst as Israel's war with Hezbollah intensifies. Our Ben Wedeman toured some of the devastation today in southern Beirut. Have a look at this. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): This is just one of the latest buildings struck by Israel here in the southern suburbs of Beirut. Driving in here, we saw that this part of town is a ghost town. There are very few inhabitants still left here as more than a million people have fled their homes in southern Lebanon, the Beqaa Valley, and of course, here in the southern part of Beirut. As Israel continues its air and now ground campaigns inside Lebanon, news from Israel says that the Israeli military is deploying an additional division to the northern front, indicating that what started as quote- unquote, \"localized, targeted and limited raids\" inside Lebanon may well become a full-scale invasion. This as the region, the Middle East teeters on the abyss of full-scale war. After Iran's strikes on Israel overnight, Iran of course, bracing for some sort of Israeli counter attack, while here in Lebanon, the death toll continues to rise, at this point, the death toll has exceeded the death toll from the war back in 2006.

      "sentences": "Ben Wedeman there in southern Beirut. Well, Iran's barrage of missiles marks its largest ever attack against Israel, fueling concerns, ofcourse, over a wider regional war. Not at least, due to Iran's -- of course, nuclear capability, you can see there. The U.S. government believes Tehran could build a bomb in just weeks, should it decide to do so. And all eyes are focused on how Israel might retaliate to yesterday's attack, including whether it will strike Iran's nuclear sites. For more military analysis, I want to bring in Colin Clarke, a well-known face here on the show, he's a Director of Policy and Research at the Soufan Group and authored the book, \"After the Caliphate, The Islamic State and the Future of the Terrorist Diaspora\". Colin, great to have you back on the show. So, the focus, as you heard there from our correspondents on the ground is very much on Israel and how it responds, right? To those 200 missiles that kind of rained down this time yesterday on Israel. What do you think that response, Colin, will look like? What are the likely targets here? COLIN CLARKE, DIRECTOR OF POLICY &amp; RESEARCH, SOUFAN GROUP: Thanks for having me. Well, there's a range of options for the Israelis, and I think they absolutely will respond, and I think they will respond forcefully. First, you're talking about missile production sites and missile silos, that's I think, the most obvious target. Beyond that, we could get into talking about oil and energy infrastructure, although there are the -- some real kind of second-order impacts on the global economy. And again, think about the United States' position here, weeks out from an election, that would be fairly disastrous for the Biden administration and Vice President Harris. Lastly, we could talk about nuclear production sites, and that's really, I think, the big question, will Israel go after these sites? I think Netanyahu sees a window of opportunity to do that or not, cooler heads prevail is yet to be seen. Biden has come out and said, he does not support that, but it doesn't mean the Israelis won't go forward.",

Does Israel have the capability here to do so?

That said, we could be looking at targeted assassinations of some high-ranking Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force leaders or other types of the regime.

The quote that we kept hearing back then was, take the win, essentially, the deterrence of -- the deterrence, the balance of power had been re-established. That is not what we are hearing this time from the President on down, we are hearing publicly and privately that the U.S. is supporting Israel's right to respond. They're telling Israeli officials we know that you have the right to respond. They are not telling them this time, take the win. So, essentially, the question now is, what is Israel's response? When does Israel's response come? And of course, will Israel go after Iran's nuclear facilities. Now, the one indication of the U.S. attitude in terms of the targeting that we have is President Biden saying that he hopes that Israel does not go after those nuclear facilities. Currently, we are told the U.S. assessment is that Israel does not plan to, but of course, that remains to be seen. I was told by one senior U.S. official that Israel is being smart, they're taking their time to figure out what the targets are going to be if there was going to be an immediate response from Israel, that would have come last night. Now, we are entering the high holidays in Israel, Rosh Hashanah is about to start for three days, so, that according to U.S. official buys Israel some time and space. We have heard from President Biden and others that the U.S. expects to be consulted with, they expect to coordinate with Israel.
