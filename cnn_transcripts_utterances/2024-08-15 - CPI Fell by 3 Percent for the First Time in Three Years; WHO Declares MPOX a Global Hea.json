Not a lot of detail on how exactly he would do it, but the crowd did go wild. The one thing to remember here is as we talk about the economy, we talk about the economy getting better, which it certainly is by all statistics and measures. I do continue to talk to voters on the ground who specifically point to costs, not necessarily the economy as a whole, but what things that are important to them that they need every day, what those things cost, like groceries, like fuel. And they still say that those costs are impacting them, impacting their wallet. And that's why they believe Donald Trump would be better in office. It's just something to keep note here as when we talk about why his advisers are pushing this messaging so hard and hoping Donald Trump will stay on with that same messaging.

It can be more slowly growing upward or more quickly growing upward.Right now, actually, grocery prices are growing relatively slowly. If you look at today's Consumer Price Index data, grocery prices only rose about 1 percent year over year. That's generally below the trend of the last several decades. So that's quite low. You know, for particular products that have had major supply chain issues, I'm thinking things like bird flu potentially affecting supplies of eggs or certain kinds of poultry. You know, some of those may see some reversals and in fact already have. But the general trajectory is going to be upward. It's just, you know, things are going to plateau, which is kind of what we want. You know, we don't expect them to go back down. So when the Fed cuts rates, that filters through to basically every other credit product in the economy, whether we're talking about mortgages, auto loans, credit cards, etc. So it's not instantaneous necessarily.

However, as you mentioned, Hamas has said they will not be participating in these talks being held today in Qatar. However, they have said they are prepared to meet with negotiators, with mediators rather if there are significant developments or a sufficient response from the Israeli delegation. Now, of course, these talks are focused and centered on that peace plan put forward and presented by U.S. president Joe Biden in May, however while there had been hopes that this deal presented by Biden could lead to some sort of breakthrough and there certainly were those hopes in July, the assassination of Hamas' political chief Ismail Haniyeh in late July in Tehran has really put a spanner in the works when it comes to the progression of these talks. Of course, Hamas and other regional leaders including of course the Iranian regime have pointed the finger of blame squarely at Israel for that assassination. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied responsibility but Ismail Haniyeh was a key figure in these negotiations. He was considered in the broader context of Hamas to be a more moderate figure. Hamas now of course is being led by Yahya Sinwar, a more hardline figure and a man who is one of the most wanted men by the Israeli government. So serious concerns over how these talks will progress. We know of course that there continue to be key sticking points. Hamas wants the proposal presented by Biden to be pushed forward and there have been criticisms from within Israel even of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, allegations that he has intentionally undermined these deals, so fears that more hardline right-wing figures within his own coalition could pull out, lead to a collapse of the Israeli government if a ceasefire deal is agreed. Now of course we have heard from a U.S. official saying that they do not believe or foresee that any sort of deal will be struck during these talks. This isn't seen as being sort of the last step. There are significant sticking points still ahead including the number of Palestinians to be released, Israel's request for a veto on which Palestinian prisoners under the terms of that agreement would be released, the return of Palestinians from southern to northern Gaza and of course a crucial point, a crucial sticking point is the presence of Israeli forces on that Philadelphia corridor separating the Rafah border between Egypt and Gaza. So, of course, there are high stakes but still major sticking points ahead and of course while the broader framework of the agreement has been agreed upon, those final details are key here.

Those satellite images you can see them there they are we think close to a key highway, a key rail link and also just west of the Kursk nuclear plant so Russia is employing some of the same tactics that we've seen them use in Ukraine on their own soil now. In terms of the other stated goal of this from Ukraine which is to sort of pull Russian forces away from other areas of the front line distract them and therefore help Ukraine defend and push them back off their own soil. Well look, we've been hearing from commanders on this, some in the east saying that attacks continue with the same frequency but CNN has a team in the border region of Sumy and they caught up with the commander of a unit that is actually involved in the Kursk operations. Take a listen to him. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DMYTRO KHOLOD, \"NIGHTINGALE BATTALION\" (through translator): The Russians are now trying to stop our advance. They have pulled in reserves which has benefited our defense forces in other areas because it's become easier to work there.

But at a news conference Wednesday with top NASA leadership, they say that they need to make a decision by the end of August at the latest. So we're really getting close to that final window of decision making for NASA. And right now, we know that there is debate within the space agency about whether or not that Starliner spacecraft will indeed be deemed safe to fly Butch and Sunny back to Earth due to helium leaks and thruster failures. The big concern is whether or not those thrusters are going to be reliable during the next key maneuver, that deorbit burn, in which it's essential that the spacecraft is pointing in the right direction to protect the astronauts with that heat shield as it reenters the Earth's atmosphere. That's what's at stake here. And so NASA leadership saying that they're really getting up to this hard deadline because of consumables. So things like food supply, water, perhaps even oxygen. Not at a critical point there by any means, but they're getting to this final window of decision making. So what this means is that they are going to be reviewing the data over the next several days, and then there's going to be an agency- wide flight readiness review, likely at the end of next week or the beginning of the following week.
