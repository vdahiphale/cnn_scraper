Today, we're asking after a dramatic week of Michael Cohen on the stand, did Trump's former fixer blow the prosecution's case?Then debating the debate, our panel weighs in on what's at stake after this week's bombshell agreement between Trump and Biden. And the final \"Jeopardy!\" category is new format. We've got the twist coming to the 60-year-old quiz show. The gang is here and ready to go. So sit back, relax, and let's talk about it. Up first, after an explosive week of testimony, Donald Trump's hush money trial is wrapping up with closing arguments expected as soon as Tuesday. It could all hinge on the prosecution's star witness, Trump's former fixer, Michael Cohen. He made damaging allegations, but Trump's team punched serious holes in his credibility.

Mostly they had supporting stuff around and what he had been saying, but this guy is kind of a sketchy character. And you've seen that happen in a lot of trials like this, like a lot of the mob trials, actually. They have a sketchy character convicting another sketchy characters.

The best thing for him is that the election is not being held today because if it was being held today, I think Donald Trump would win it and I don't I think that it would be terribly close. But we have a lot of time to go. And if Americans actually get very exhausted with this election, the fact that we're having this debate so early, that we're going to be talking about this nonstop between now and November, a low turnout election benefits Biden, because right now, Democrats, they've got the most high propensity voters. Donald Trump will need to bring out a lot of people who hate politics in general or are very loosely connected to the system.

If you look at folks under the age of 18, under the age of five, this is already a majority-minority America. Who are the folks were pushing back hardest against racial preferences in elite higher education? It was Asian Americans. Look at how opinion has changed among black Americans, among Hispanics.

My colleague Jodi Kantor at \"The New York Times\" had a story this past week that talked about Samuel Alito, Justice, Samuel Alito, and how he had after the last election an upside flag in his yard. It was there for several days. And what apparently transpired was that his wife had a personal beef with someone in the neighborhood who had an anti-Trump sign, and put this flag in the yard. Now, the problem here is that that flag and that symbol just after the last election was a sign of the fealty towards Trump and something that is supposed to signify their belief and stop the steal. Justice Alito is someone who is actually so involved in the Supreme Court on all these issues, and the fact that this was there is deeply, deeply problematic.",

So most people think elections are decided by voters, but actually courts and maps have quite a bit to do with it when it comes to the U.S. House of Representatives, at least. And this week, the Supreme Court took action that will put in place a map in Louisiana the ensures a second majority-minority congressional district. Now on its face, this looks like it benefits Democrats at least for the current cycle. But interestingly, all three Democratic appointees on the court opposed the action. They think it sets a bad precedent long term.",
