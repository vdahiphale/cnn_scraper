And while I'm not the person to call it, I can't help wondering, even if the FADO system gets out there in time, this is a U.S. Navy system that's able to actually grapple the ship and bring it up. Even if it gets there, it's going to take several hours to set it up and to bolt it to the deck of the mothership that's going to deploy it and then calibrate all the instruments that have to be set.

He will appear July 26th before Judge Maryellen Noreika, a Trump appointed judge. The Justice Department announced yesterday that Hunter Biden will plead guilty to two tax misdemeanors and he struck a deal to resolve a felony gun charge. Let's bring in Neal Katyal, who served as Acting Solicitor General during the Obama administration and is the host of a brand new podcast called Courtside, which launches today. Neil, congratulations on the new podcast. Let me ask you, this is going to be the initial appearance and plea hearing for Hunter Biden, what usually happens during hearings like these?NEAL KATYAL, FORMER U.S. ACTING SOLICITOR GENERAL: So thank you, Jake, it's a privilege to be on with you. So what's going to happen is the judge has to approve the plea deal. Now this is a plea deal that wasn't, you know, struck by Merrick Garland or Joe Biden or anything like that. It was struck by a prosecutor named David Weiss, who was the Trump U.S. attorney, the chief prosecutor in Delaware. And Garland and Biden kept him on because he had this investigation after Biden won the election. So this is done by a Trump appointee. Weiss had full discretion over this case. He confirmed that in a letter to Jim Jordan, to Congress last month. And so I think the judge is going to examine and say, look, here's what happened. Is this an appropriate sentence given the gravity of the crimes that are now admitted to?",

I don't know how common these kind of charges are. Is it true that it would be a much harsher penalty in an average case?",

Because if you're a first time tax offender, first time gun offender, it doesn't usually result in much. I think what happened here is that you are talking about an investigation of the President's son. And so stakes were raised and Republicans were always going to scream that the sentence -- that the plea deal was or any arrangement was going to be unfair. I mean, if the prosecution sought life imprisonment for these crimes, I suspect we'd be hearing griping about why wasn't the death penalty sought and the like.",

It's about voting and so many other things.And so the idea of a podcast is to take one Supreme Court case, talk about it with a non-lawyer who can just break it down for ordinary people. So episode two next week will be with John Legend on voting rights. I'll have John Mulaney, the comedian, talking about prosecuting presidents, and Regina Specter, the musician, talking about refugees and the like.

And it was a statistical match according to this motion.Now here's what it says. Let's look at this. It says, pursuant to a search warrant, law enforcement then collected DNA from defendant via a buccal swab. A traditional STR DNA comparison was done between the STR profile found on the Ka-Bar knife sheath and defendant's DNA. The comparison showed a statistical match specifically, the STR profile is at least 5.37 octillion times more likely to be seen if the defendant is the source. And this motion came about, Jake, because the defense had asked for everything on DNA analysis, which is their right. They want to know the procedure. They want to know the statistics.
