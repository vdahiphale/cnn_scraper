This targeting, it appears, of the Iranian consulate building, which is right next to the Iranian embassy in Damascus, is a significant target. It also seems significant that Iranian media is also reporting that the ambassador, the Iranian ambassador to Syria and his family were not injured in the attack. But attacks of this nature, as again they are today, are typically blamed by Syrian media on Israel. Israel typically doesn't comment. We're not aware of any comments that Israel has made at this stage. However, Israel does have a track record of targeting IRGC commanders and senior figures, both inside Syria and in other locations. So, it's not impossible that Israel, as Syrian media is alleging, is responsible. But it's not clear that that's the case. However, if they were, it would be, a senior IRGC figure would be a likely target for them that they've taken out many over the past few months. So, this is significant in particular because it targets a building that's used for Iranian government purposes, not just a residence, not just a building associated with the government, but right next door to the embassy. And the consular officers themselves were not aware of any other civilian casualties. Of course, consular officers are used by civilians to go and get visas renewed, passports renewed, all these sorts of things.",

      "sentences": "Well, that is exactly the description that many eyewitnesses have used. And it is important to underscore that some of thefootage that we have received from our colleagues on the ground is simply too graphic to air for our viewers. And it is, of course, hugely shocking after 14 days to see the aftermath of this siege. We've been hearing these eyewitness testimonies over the course of the last two weeks. Though it has been difficult to get up-to-date information out of Al-Shifa, we have been able to make contact with civilians who had been sheltering in the hospital, with medical staff who had been working in the hospital. And, of course, those accounts have painted a troubling picture. But what we see now, according to Gaza Civil Defense, is a devastating death. So, at least 300 bodies have so far been recovered, according to authorities, not just in the hospital, but also around in residential buildings located in the area surrounding the Al-Shifa medical complex. And we've been hearing from those who had been living in those residential buildings describing the bombardment and shooting as near constant. We've heard from one man who was unable to return to the area because of the siege, only to return this morning to find his entire family had been killed. Now, the Israeli military has described the siege as a precise and targeted operation. They say they were targeting Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants they believe to have been operating at the hospital. We heard yesterday from Prime Minister Netanyahu saying some 200 Hamas militants had been killed as part of this siege. CNN cannot independently verify those figures. And, of course, the Israeli military has also said it located weapons and intelligence documents inside the complex. And while the military says it continues to distinguish between militants and civilians, that really stands in stark contrast to what we are seeing and hearing from eyewitnesses on the ground. Earlier in the week, we did also hear, of course, from some who had managed to escape the hospital complex, including teenagers who were told CNN they had been stripped and interrogated in the cold by Israeli soldiers around the hospital complex before being able to flee and move southwards. But this is a troubling situation. Medical officials have said that many of those who had been trapped inside the hospital had quickly run out of food, water and essential medical supplies. Doctors were too afraid to move between hospital buildings or prevented from moving between hospital buildings for fear of being targeted by Israeli snipers. We certainly heard those warnings just a little over a week ago from soldiers telling doctors not to attempt to leave the hospital complex. But this is a devastating situation, and we are only now really getting a clearer picture of what the situation is like on the ground.",

We've been hearing from witnesses of the October 7th accounts, so people who've been very closely touched by what is going on. I think what is interesting now is the political element to this, that Benjamin Netanyahu finds himself under pressure from the left, those who feel that the way this war has been prosecuted is wrong, who are angry about the failed hostages and believe there would have been another way to bring them home quicker. Those on the right who are very concerned about changes currently being made to the law that will allow ultra-Orthodox Haredi Jews to be enlisted, as well. And, of course, there is all that pressure from the outside world. This happens -- these protests happen at a critical time, not only as Benjamin Netanyahu and his Israeli officials in talks with the United States about how a ground operation in Rafah might be avoided, but the hostage troops have also picked up again, not just in Qatar but also in Cairo. So, this comes at a critical time. All lies very much on what happens in Rafah next, and yet that political unity that he's been able to count on, the unity of the Israeli people, suddenly a lot more fragile than it has been so far.

First of all, this unbelievable continuous negotiation about the hostages deal, which should and could have been concluded a long time ago. This continuous of this, which brings those people to protest now because they feel the time is running out, maybe it ran out already for many of them, is because of political reasons. Netanyahu -- this is not his first priority day, releasing the hostages. His first priority is to continue this war, as horrible as it sounds, in order to survive in office.",

There seems to be a bit of naivete or at least confusion between how Americans in the West perceivethe big impetus here in Israel and how it's being perceived within Israel proper itself. As you noted, the majority of people that are turning out to these protests aren't calling for an end to the war. And I think back to the landmark speech that we heard from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, pushing and asking for new elections, saying that Netanyahu's time has come and it's time for new leadership there. If new leadership, and given where the polls are right now, it does appear that Benny Gantz could replace him. It doesn't seem that the war itself and the way the war is being orchestrated would be very different if a new prime minister were in office. Maybe there would be a little more humility publicly, maybe there would be a different personality and more thankfulness to the U.S. and appreciation. But the war itself wouldn't change, no?",

Benny Gantz has different manners. I guess it will be a more pleasant environment and more efficient environment around him, more moderate environment. He might meet Abbas. He will definitely meet Biden. Everything will be around talks and talks and negotiations. But by the end of the day, and this we have to remember, when it comes to the core issues, namely continuing the war, continuing the occupation, continuing the apartheid, there are much less differences between Netanyahu and all the other candidates than it seems from the outside.

      "sentences": "Yeah, I've been talking to people all morning about what they have heard from Speaker Johnson in termsof what his concrete plans are. And many Republicans are just pointing to those comments yesterday on Fox News because Johnson has not really informed his membership as to specifically what he plans to do when they return next week. He is under immense pressure from defense hawks who have wanted him to take steps on Ukraine aid for the last several months but have been giving him some room and some space because they knew he had a series of spending deadlines he had to get over first. Now, that those are behind them, there's a lot more pressure coming from those Republicans who want him to act. On the other hand, he is also facing pressure from people like Marjorie Taylor Greene, who sort of threatened that warning shot right before the recess that she could move to try and oust him from his job. Now, she has not made any commitments as to whether she will ultimately act or when she would act, but that is certainly another factor here. And he has such a narrow majority that whatever he puts on the floor is going to need Democratic votes. And because of all the issues they've had with getting procedural votes across the finish line, it's very possible he would have to bring something that not just got a simple majority of the House but was getting two-thirds of the House. And that means that you have to appeal to Democrats with whatever you're going to put forward. So, that's where Johnson is facing really a series of conflicting limitations when it comes to what he can actually do on Ukraine aid. Meanwhile, it's important to remind everyone back home, the Senate did pass an $85 billion aid package that included funding for Israel, funding for Taiwan and funding for Ukraine. But Johnson obviously wants to make some changes to that underlying bill.",
