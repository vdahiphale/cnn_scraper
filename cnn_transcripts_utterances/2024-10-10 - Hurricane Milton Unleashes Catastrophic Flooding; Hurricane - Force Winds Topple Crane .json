Hurricane Milton, continuing to slam Florida coming to the state is a monster category three storm when it made landfall. It's now been downgraded to a category one, but this is, by all means, still a very dangerous storm currently tearing across the central part of the state, moving east northeast.The winds blowing at about 90 miles per hour right now. Milton bringing with it a six-to-nine-foot storm surge in Tampa. There are also reports of at least 19 tornadoes, and some 116 tornado warnings across Florida. In St. Petersburg, a one in 1000-year rainfall, nine inches of rain in just three hours. In the Tampa area, flash flooding emergencies at this hour, the highest level of flood warning. This after more than a foot of rain fell there, and there are currently more than two million people without power across the state. We want to begin, of course, with my colleague, Victor, who is live there in Orlando and you're really starting to get the brunt of this now, Victor.",

So, you'll see, as I report from here, over the next several hours, the intensity of the winds and the rain fluctuate as it has for the last several hours. We've seen consistent winds for a while of about 30 or 40 miles per hour. We're seeing a calming right now, a gust at the Orlando International Airport.Hurricane force at about 74 miles per hour. So, that's what you should expect as we are here, over the next several hours. The continuing, it's the longevity of the rain that is the major concern here as we're in the center of the state. No real concern about storm surge the coast so far away. I do want to go to the coast, though first. Our colleague, Bill Weir, has been watching a lot of the damage, kind of the exclamation point damage thus far that we've seen overnight without that first light of day to assess the communities and neighborhoods. And I want to start, Bill, with you on the roof of Tropicana Field. When I saw -- first saw this video, I first thought Katrina, and of course, what happened there at Mercedes Benz.

Maybe some, you know, refugees from the storm who needed a place to go. But that is no longer usable right now and they have to figure out, where do you put those 10,000 cots, and what do you do with that?I mean, this -- it's a -- it's a different kind of emergency response right off the bat, before even the sun comes up.

They anticipated maybe 15 feet of storm surge. They did not get that.So that was good. But the rainfall, which they knew was coming, might have even been worse than they anticipated. We had almost a foot of rain here in just a few hours. You're talking maybe four or five months' worth of rain in just a few hours. And again, at the height of it, we were out here, just the sheer volume of water that was just pouring down on us and everybody out here. Visibility was terrible. You couldn't see two feet in front of you. I'd never really seen kind of like a sheets and walls of water coming down from a hurricane since that part of it, Victor, was probably a little worse than was forecast.

So, complete neighborhoods were flooded and people are still trying to recover from that damage.

There's still going to be the rise in the river and other parts, so we don't know the exact damage. But then, with the flash flood warnings, the intensity and the amount of rains, I would see images on Facebook earlier in the evening where streets were becoming rivers and water was coming up to other people's houses, in areas where that didn't get the storm surge a couple weeks ago.

The street behind me turned into a river with water flowing steadily downstream and taking debris with it.We were feeling strong wind gusts of up to 100 miles per hour blowing us down the sidewalk. It was really powerful in the hours leading up to Milton's landfall and also in the hours after Milton made landfall. The mayor of Tampa said that it was going to be a rough few hours and she wasn't lying. We had power for a long time here, but just before we lost power -- there's power lines above us. I know it's dark now, you can't see it, but those power lines started to spark and set flares across the street. We had to run for cover to try and get out of the way of danger. The power pole itself started to shake. It became a really dicey situation where we were here in Tampa. We were far away from where this storm actually made landfall.

Thank you.I want to go back to Storm Chaser, Jonathan Petramala, who is in St. Petersburg. We have Jonathan back with us. So Jonathan, before we lost your audio a short time ago, you were talking to us about the maze, as you put it, to get from Tampa to St. Petersburg, to get to that area where you could assess the damage. And you mentioned too that you were able to get a shot of the damage from above. We've heard so much about these 10,000 cots that were supposed to be staged there. How far into the stadium could you see? PETRAMALA (via telephone):  Yeah, you can see inside, they had it staged to basically house first responders after the storm. And that's -- that was the plan. And of course, that plan had to change in a hurry when you see the roof ripped completely away there. It is completely exposed now. Everybody says they want an open roof stadium in Tampa Bay. Well, here you go. This is what you get. Ironically, they just approved a brand new stadium to be built here in the next couple of years. So, it's just -- again, this is a really surreal scene just to see this. But to go back to the maze, all the bridges to get over from Hillsborough County or from the south, the Sunshine Skyway Bridge, those have been shut down because of, of course, the danger of the bridges being undermined possibly by the storm surge. Fortunately though, since the storm made landfall to the south, we didn't get that epic catastrophic storm surge that was the big fear for most of the week. So, I hope and I believe that those bridges are going to be OK, but it's probably going to be maybe midday before they open those back up. So, to kind of be able to make our way from Hillsborough County, which is Tampa, to get in back in here to Pinellas County and St. Petersburg, you have to go through just a lot of deep water because of the flash flooding. And that was a really big impact. You could see that some neighborhoods, some homes were being impacted by that as well. So, while the Tampa Bay area didn't necessarily see that, just historic storm surge we were all really, really terrified of, we did see some pretty insane flash flooding that occurred here in St. Petersburg in Tampa.",

What could you see on that drive? PETRAMALA (via telephone):  I think we've documented basically, every single impact you can imagine from Hurricane Milton when you -- we started down south around Port Charlotte and made our way up into Venice where storm surge was a big story there. They had the unfortunate reality of being just to the southeast of where Hurricane Milton made landfall. So that means they're in the most surge prone area of that storm. That's just where the most water gets brought in. So, what we were able to document was at least six to seven feet of storm surge. It could be deeper further back in towards the Barrier Islands there. But of course, it's just inaccessible. Also driving around there, you see the really strong winds from the backside, especially of Hurricane Milton that was coming on shore. The sky was looking like a staccato of lightning, even though what it was, it was transformers just blowing repeatedly, all over, as power was getting knocked out around Charlotte County and in towards, around Venice as well. Then you see the mobile home parks, the trailer home parks getting ripped to shreds, just kind of like the roof of Tropicana Field. That's why when these hurricanes are making landfall in Florida, even if you're miles inland and you live in a mobile home or a trailer, that's why officials say you must evacuate because these structures just aren't built to withstand hurricane-force winds. And so that, of course, was just on display with the force of these of winds. So, we've seen the gamut of damage from signs and of course, the power outages, homes damaged, awnings of businesses, buildings damaged, and of course, what you're seeing right here, Tropicana Field.",

But, we did see a few cars pass through and again, this is not the time to come out. I think people saw that there was a moment of calm, that the ferocity of the storm subsided for a moment. But as Chad just said, this is not over, the flooding which you cannot see and of course, we all know that you should not drive on flooded roads. But every few minutes or so, we see a pretty strong gust of wind, some more rain to tell us that Milton is not done with Central Florida. Tens of thousands of people without power now and really, the concern of the power outages is that so many of it, here comes another one, so many of those response crews that typically come in after a storm are in the Carolinas, trying to restore power after Helene or were in route back home. I just saw that the Orlando Utilities Commission, they tweeted out a photo of support coming in from Indiana, from local utility companies there to be on standby for this. But, the storm is not done with Central Florida, more rain and wind, and we're waiting for first light to see just how bad the damage is, Erica.",
