      "sentences": "Welcome to our second hour of CONNECT THE WORLD. I'm Eleni Giokos in Abu Dhabi.This hour, after a two week siege, Israel has withdrawn from Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City where medical crews are now working to recover hundreds of bodies scattered around the complex. It's described as a horror movie. Turkey's local election this weekend marking a major blow for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan as the main opposition party claimed victory in key cities. This hour, a federal judge will sentence Alex Murdaugh for nearly two dozen financial crimes. The former attorney already serving two life sentences for the murders of his wife and son. Welcome to the show and we start inside what remains of Gaza's largest hospital. Now, almost unrecognizable as what a functioning medical facility. The IDF says its 14-day siege day is over. In a statement it said the operation had been precise, and that its troops killed terrorists while preventing harm to civilians. But a local journalist working for CNN says entire families have been found dead, describing bodies crushed into the ground by bulldozers. He says the scene, \"feels like a horror movie\". CNN has asked the IDF for comments on accusations of crushed bodies. Meantime, Gaza civil defense says at least 300 bodies have been found at the hospital since Israeli troops withdrew and that ambulances trying to reach the complex of finding it almost impossible. CNN is also hearing that senior U.S. and Israeli officials will meet virtually today to discuss Israel's proposed ground offensive in Rafah. A U.S. official says the two sides are still working towards an in person meeting on the issue. Now, face-to-face talks were abruptly called off last week by the Israeli prime minister after Washington refused to block a U.N. resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. Meantime, there's growing pressure on Benjamin Netanyahu, protesters are back on the streets of Jerusalem calling for him to step down. They blame him for failing to secure the release of hostages in Gaza. Let's stay now across these very key issues playing out. CNN's Melissa Bell is in Jerusalem. We've got Natasha Bertrand standing by for us in Washington D.C. Melissa, I'd like to start off with you and of course what we've been seeing out of al-Shifa, we've seen images now coming through. A lot of them far too graphic for us to show here on CNN, but it's giving us a better sense of what the last 14 days entailed.",

We've also got Natasha Bertrand standing by and I want to talk about these talks that the U.S. and Israel is going to have virtually in the least -- at least for now. And here's the sticking point, the U.S. might have allowed the U.N. Security Council resolution to pass last week and we know that that derail the talks. But the U.S. has been drawing a red line with Rafah. However, still selling arms to Israel even over the past weekend. So, when the U.S. says there will be consequences of the siege in Rafah, what does that actually entail?",

      "sentences": "Well, that's the big question Eleni, because the U.S. is obviously urging the Israelis to takebigger precautions when it comes to an invasion of Rafah, and come up with a plan to protect them more than million civilians -- the more than one million civilians that are currently sheltering there. But the Israelis so far have not provided that plan to the United States. And it's unclear to U.S. officials whether they actually have such a plan at all. And so, the U.S. has been working really fanatically to try to get Israel to come up with what they're calling an alternative plan, one that focuses more on precision targeting of the senior Hamas leaders that are in the area. And importantly, increasing talks with Egypt to try to seal the border between Egypt and Gaza in a way that would make Israel feel as though they're not just allowing these senior Hamas leaders to escape across the border and therefore, are able to carry out this more precise operation without having to put the civilians in danger. But the question now is, what happens if the Israelis don't actually take the Americans advice? And we have not seen any signs to date that the U.S. is prepared to, for example, limit the amount of weaponry that it it's providing to the Israelis, condition the aid in any way. In fact, Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser said that reports to that effect are uninformed. And so, it seems as though the U.S. and particularly President Biden are still standing by their belief that Israel has the right to defend itself and that the U.S. is going to continue to support the Israelis, really, to the extent that they need it in order to carry out these operations inside Gaza. There are no signs at this point, that the talks last week included any kind of discussion about not providing Israel with what it has requested. In fact, we are told that Yoav Gallant who's the Israeli Defense Minister came with a wish list of weapons that he wanted from the United States. And those were received fairly well. And the Israelis were told that the US is currently working on providing them with that equipment. And so, we'll have to see what the actual red line here is. Because the U.S. has warned in the past, of course, that if Israel does not do more to take care of civilians, then there will be consequences. But so far, we have not seen any of those ramifications play out.",

      "sentences": "Yes, this is actually the first time, Eleni, that President Erdogan's AK party, Justice and Development Party haslost the popular vote across the country since its formation. And last night, as you said, he was pretty reflective about what went wrong in all of this, and this must be especially painful because he had really invested himself in this race. His face was all over banners and billboards. He had campaigned his himself, but he was also battling against the topic that was on the top of everyone's mind, and that is the economy. You have inflation in this country that's out of control. You have interest rates that have hit 50 percent. And while Erdogan's party was able to double the national minimum wage to give people some relief, he could not give the same relief to pensioners, and we heard from many of them on the campaign trail that they were feeling it. And clearly the opposition took advantage in all of this. This is the very first time since the 1970s that the opposition CHP Party, Republican People's Party has won the popular vote. They won the big cities Izmir, Ankara, Istanbul and they won some places you wouldn't expect either like the southern Turkish conservative religious city of Adiyaman. And here in Istanbul, Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu won reelection by 11 percentage points, he is widely viewed to be one of Erdogan's perhaps the strongest opposition figure to take on President Erdogan or his party in the next presidential race. And with this win, that view has been solidified. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MCLEAN (voice over): If there were any doubts about this man's ability to win, they were put to bed last night. Ekrem Imamoglu, the mayor of Istanbul from the secular opposition CHP party was reelected by a comfortable 11 point margin, a gap few polls could have predicted. Hello Istanbul, he says. 16 million Istanbul lights have won. Congratulations, there are no losers in this election. But Ekrem Imamoglu's win is a huge blow to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's religious conservative AK Party, which not only failed to win back Istanbul, but even lost Erdogan's home district. Imamoglu is widely seen as one of the few perhaps the only opposition figures strong enough to beat Erdogan in a presidential race. Originally from the Black Sea city of Trabzon, Imamoglu moved to Istanbul for university, then worked with his family's construction company. Two decades later in 2014, he was leading a small district of Istanbul. Then, five years later in 2019, won the race for city mayor by a razor thin margin after a court overturn the results in order to another vote, Imamoglu won the second time around by an even wider gap. He later face charges of insulting public officials stemming from the aftermath of the bitterly contested race. He's been convicted and sentenced to more than two years jail time on the charges that many believe are politically motivated. Erdogan has denied any link. The appeals process is still winding its way through the courts.",

(END VIDEOTAPE) MCLEAN (on camera): And with those criminal charges against Ekrem Imamoglu, many people see parallels with the -- with the time that the President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was the mayor of this city, and he served four months in jail for the crime of inciting religious hatred by reading from a poem and many people view those charges at the time as politically motivated. It's also worth mentioning that the 1990s, when Erdogan was mayor of this city, he actually crossed paths with Imamoglu in a very different context. At that time, Imamoglu was in his early 20s. He was running a coffee shop or a Turkish meatball shop, and Erdogan during his campaign dropped in for some coffee. He never saw the bill and Imamoglu says that he will never be able to repay that very small debt as long as he lives, Eleni.",

But this time, turnout was really low. Showing people didn't really care that much. They didn't care it would make a huge difference. Opposition voters pretty much lost hope after 2023 elections, hopes about changing incumbents from office through elections declined significantly. And -- but incumbent voters were apathetic and alienated at the same time for different reasons. They were very frustrated about continuing economic problems. They felt like they'd been given credit to the government again and again, election after election but economic problems continued. So, there were -- I've been working on political apathy and I've been measuring alienation on both sides, but we solve that it turns out like incumbent voters stayed at home more than opposition voters which led to this big blow to the incumbent party.",

Well, I always believed that economic problems mattered. But Erdogan was able to frame general elections as a matter of national security and convinced his voters that if the opposition came to power, that will jeopardize Turkey's national interest, opposition could not defend national interest internationally, or even at home, they will not tough on terrorism. So, a lot of AK party voters felt like they shouldn't be placing their pragmatic economic interests on top of national interests. But this time, it was only local elections. So, people felt more free to share their discontent, their unhappiness, without worrying that they're putting national security at risk, because it's only local elections. In fact, it's more about metros and bus lines, and day cares, right? So, that felt -- that made people feel more relieved to vote for the opposition. But that's not the only thing.",
