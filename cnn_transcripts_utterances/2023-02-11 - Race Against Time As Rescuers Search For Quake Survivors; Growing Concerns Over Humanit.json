And three brothers also pulled out after 120 hours. We saw ourselves another rescue in the heavily hit key city of millions of Antakya after 109 hours. Here is our report.

Mike, tell us more about this effort. MIKE VALERIO, CNN NEWSOURCE NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Sure, Fred. Well, the name of the game here is to get 17 tons of supplies out of this 3-1/2-acre warehouse. On a direct flight from LAX down the 101-405 freeway all the way to Istanbul, a 13-hour flight. So, let's give you a little bit of a tour to show you all these pallets are bound for Turkey. And then, further in the background, where we have half dozen guys working on this latest shipment. Those exclusively white pallets wrapped in the white over there, those are bound for Syria. So, they're going to go from Los Angeles, to Istanbul, cross the border, and get to Syria by the middle of the next week. But if we walk over here, we're going to show you Fred, in terms of what's in these boxes, we have these sturdy backpacks that are meant for first responders. So, if you take a look inside here, this section meant for wound treatment, we have bandages, everything, you would need makeshift tourniquet right here, water purification, tablets, light sticks. So, these are going to the center of the earthquake zone. But take a listen to what we heard about the two main types of supplies that are bound for Turkey and Syria. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. ALYCIA CLARK, DIRECTOR OF PHARMACY AND CLINICAL AFFAIRS, DIRECT RELIEF: Yes, it's really a combination of two different things. So, the first kind of set of supplies are to address really the acute emergency. So, fresh wounds, more critical care items, I.V. fluids, antibiotics, and then, it's going to be followed with a series of products meant for chronic disease management. And so, we know that, you know, initially all of the trauma is kind of first and in the front and center. And then, beyond that, it's a trail effect of, you know, chronic disease management.

These are launched by the 1000s every day. We know that's not what it is. So, it's coming from somewhere in Asia. China, could be North Korea, could be Russia somewhere. What's it doing there?

Scientists say it may disappear altogether in five years, but it could be saved with some emergency measures. Many experts believe what's happening is a microcosm of what's expected to happen to the planet. CNN chief climate correspondent Bill Weir has a closer look.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This is what is left of the Great Salt Lake. They hit record lows in recent months, exposing around 800 square miles of lakebed. But unchecked water use and climate change aren't just threatening the birds and sail boaters. And here the western mega drought threatens a lot more than just snow sports, agriculture and industry. (on camera): Because this lakebed holds centuries of toxic runoff. Mercury, selenium, arsenic, some of it natural, some of it manmade mining waste. But if it turns to dust and adds to some of the worst air pollution in the country, this is a threat to the lungs of over 2.5 million people.",

DIR., LAWSON INSTITUTE FOR LAND, WATER AND AIR, UTAH STATE UNIV.: There's human choices that led to that catastrophic event, right? We're looking at the Great Salt Lake in a position right now to where we can avoid that a catastrophe, where we don't have to spend those billions of dollars in remediation in the future if we make choices today. WEIR (voice over): Brian Steed and John Lin are from rival Utah universities. One with a background in state government, the other an atmospheric scientist. JOHN LIN, PROFESSOR, UNIVERSITY OF UTAH'S DEPARTMENT OF ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES: The thing is, it's bipartisan, right? We probably all want clean air.
