They hear the opinions.They see what women are saying in polls, but they also see what other groups are saying in polls. And Kamala Harris isn't doing as well with some voting blocs as, say, Joe Biden did before if she wants to be comfortable, right? This appears to be very tied up. So when you look at the polls, when you look at what you're seeing in these all important states, including Michigan, which you talk a lot about, do you feel -- do you not put credence in those polls that show what is a dead heat here?",

      "sentences": "No, I don't think it's a dead heat. And I'm not saying I don't put credence in them, but I'll just go back to the morning of Election Day 2016, on the front page of the New York Times, where according to their latest poll, said that Hillary, quote, has an 85 percent chance of winning today's election. Trump only has a 15 percent chance.That was the morning of the election. All right. No, I don't think people should be running their lives based on these polls. I think polls that are polling people on the issues are probably more accurate. But on the candidate itself, I think -- what I'm concerned, I'll give you an example, because you mentioned, you know, there are those Democrats trying to get her, you know, to tone it down, you know. That's something women have been told for decades, you know. Now, you better tone that down. You know, the reason she's so progressive, because she believes in a woman's right to choose. She believes that 14-year-olds should not be able to take an AR-15 into a school, and she's going to ban these assault rifles that used to be banned, that Republicans actually used to vote in favor of the assault weapons ban 30 years ago. Now, you go down all of her positions and they line up exactly with where the majority of Americans are at. The majority of Americans believe climate change is real. The majority of Americans believe the minimum wage is too low. The majority of Americans -- just go down the list. But I want to give you one example that's not covered much on the news. So you have these Democrats, millionaire and billionaire Democrats, who have made contributions to the Harris campaign. And they have made it very clear that they expect her to fire Lina Kahn, who is -- who Joe Biden put in as the head of the Federal Trade Commission. Now, I don't want to get in the weeds. I know we're going to lose people as soon as you say Federal Trade Commission. But Lina Kahn is the person who's trying to fight all these mergers, acquisitions, trying to limit competition so that prices go up when you don't have a competitive economy. And they want her out of there because she is anti-merger. She is fighting for the people and they want her gone. And they've publicly come on, even on CNN, and said, you know, this isn't good for business. She's not good. Biden put the wrong person in there. And they expect Kamala Harris to remove her once she's president. That's not going to happen. That's not who we're voting for. The majority of Americans want regulation. They want people to be making sure that when you have a hurricane and only 1 percent of the people have flood insurance, that's not the country I live in. That's not the country I'm going to live in, where people now are suffering because of this. And that's why the Biden administration has said, we're sending everything in, we're sending the army in, we're sending all the money in. And the way, and look, CNN, you've done a great job pointing out when Trump goes up there and says, you're only going to get $750. You know, I mean, I, we just laugh him off, but.",

You know, there's going to be child and family leave where you are covered. You don't lose your job because somebody gets sick in the family. One after another, the American people support the platform of Kamala Harris. And, and, and it would be stunning to me. I mean, I watched Trump's rally boy, those big screens behind him, no tax on social security, no, no tax on overtime, no, no tax, no tax. And he's just lying. All the things he promised before that he never did. He's not going to do this either. But he's hoping that people will do it because it sounds -- I mean, they cut the faces there and you're on CNN in the rally and people almost were tearing up to think, oh my God, I work two jobs and no, no tax on overtime. That's not going to happen. That's not going to happen. I know it sounds good and it feels good. I wish somebody would walk in this room right now and tell me they love me. That would sound really nice, but that's, that's not going to -- that's not going to get me love. It's not going get me a better life. And I think the American people are smart enough.

PATRICK RYDER, PENTAGON PRESS SECRETARY: Yes, well, first of all, Boris, thanks so much for having me, and thanks very much for providing important information about this pending storm. As you know, any time that we have a significant weather event like a hurricane, the U.S. military will do due diligence to ensure that we can relocate assets to places where they'll be safe.

However, they did point out that he was not even arrested in Russian territory. He was arrested in Ukraine in a part of the country that was occupied by Russian forces during the war, and he has spent more than two years behind bars in Russia. Part of why they have such limited information is because the Russian government has not allowed any officials from the U.S. Embassy to go and visit Stephen during his imprisonment.
