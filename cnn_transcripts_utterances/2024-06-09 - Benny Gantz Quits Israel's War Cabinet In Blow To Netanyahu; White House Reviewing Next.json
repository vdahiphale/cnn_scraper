A short time ago, Benny Gantz, a key minister of the Israeli War Cabinet, announced that he is quitting the emergency government. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENNY GANTZ, MEMBER OF THE ISRAELI KNESSET (through translator): We leave the government, the emergency government with heavy heart, but complete heart. We stand again for the campaign for Israel, for generations in order to get real victory so far, we are going to go elections and at the end of it, we will have a government that will have the confidence of people. (END VIDEO CLIP) WHITFIELD: Gantz's resignation marks a pivotal moment in Israel's war against Hamas and a major blow to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is facing mounting pressure to end the conflict in Gaza. His departure comes just a day after Netanyahu failed to meet Gantz's ultimatum, which was calling for a post-war plan in Gaza by June 8th. Gantz delayed his announcement after Israeli forces rescued four hostages from Hamas militants in Gaza. Gantz was to make his announcement yesterday, which was that deadline of June 8th, but instead had it today. CNN has correspondents tracking all of these developments around the world. Let's begin with CNN's Paula Hancocks live for us in Tel Aviv. Paula, so Gantz had been facing pressure to stay in place in recent days, Netanyahu publicly asking him to stay, even members of the Biden administration, were urging him to stay. So, why did he come to this decision?",

They said 64 of the dead were children, 57 were women, and 37 were elderly people, and certainly from the video we saw yesterday, there were a lot of wounded children and women among those being treated in the hospitals in the central part of Gaza. And of course, keep in mind that many of the people who had taken refuge in Rafah in the far south of the Gaza Strip, had moved north because of Israel's operation there. So the Nuseirat Refugee Camp was teeming with people who thought they would be safe. and of course, the operation took place at eleven o'clock in the morning on a Saturday when people were out and about. There was a market nearby where many of the Israeli ordnance landed and that would explain why there is such a high death toll. And of course, people who were there describe a scene that was absolutely horrific. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): A crazy bombardment started hitting everywhere. Something we never witnessed before. Maybe 150 rockets fell in less than 10 minutes. While we were running away, more fell on the market. There were children torn apart and scattered in the streets.

So good to see you, Omar. I would love your reaction about what has transpired a lot in the last 24 hours from four Israeli hostages rescued, the Palestinian Health Ministry, as well as the hospital say more than 270 civilians were killed. The IDF is disputing that saying the number is more in the 100 range. And then we just heard the National Security adviser there with his point of view say innocent people were tragically killed in this operation, the exact number we don't know, but innocent people were killed and that is heartbreaking. The Vice President Kamala Harris saying in Detroit, \"Thankfully four of those hostages were reunited with their families tonight.\" She said this last night, \"But we mourn all the innocent lives that have been lost in Gaza including those tragically killed.\" What is your reaction to all that has transpired? OMAR BADDAR, PALESTINIAN-AMERICAN MIDDLE EAST ANALYST: Look, there is no question, whatever -- I know there is some dispute about the specific numbers, but what unfolded yesterday was unquestionably a massacre. We have seen the images of the bodies of children littering the streets. We've seen the horrific scenes of the hospitals of weeping parents and bloodied children, and to look at an incident of that scale to see that many casualties and to celebrate this as any kind of success is effectively to say that the lives of Israelis are more valuable than the lives of Palestinians. That is the only way anybody can celebrate this as a success. Now, its unsurprising that that is the view of the Israeli government. They've made it absolutely clear that they don't value Palestinian lives at all, not just throughout this campaign of assault on Gaza over the past several months, but Israeli policy towards Palestinians for much, much longer. What has been disappointing is the way our government also has reduced the massacre to a footnote and focus primarily on the retrieval of hostages. And Fredricka, all you have to do is just imagine the reverse scenario. Right now as we speak, there are thousands of Palestinians who have been kidnapped out of Gaza, placed in Israeli detention without any charge or trial. There is an article in \"The New York Times\" outlining the absolute horrific abuse they are undergoing on a daily basis. And if Hamas today were to carry out an incursion into Gaza, kill a couple of hundred Israelis and then retrieve four Palestinians, would anyone in our discourse be celebrating this as some kind of victory? Would anyone even know the names of the four Palestinians who had been rescued from Israeli detention? We know the answer to that, and that is because we currently have a moment in which its incredibly upsetting the fact that we don't see Palestinian lives as equal or as deserving of the same kind of concern and we carry on just accepting this mantra of Palestinians as collateral damage and a necessity and continuing to treat the Israeli government as some kind of protagonist in the story, even though they are ultimately responsible for the situation in which we find ourselves in.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Fredricka, it is even more than just civilian lives. The Israeli insistence on pursuing the release of hostages through purely military means has in fact killed far more Israeli hostages than they have rescued. And that's -- I am talking about. Israeli bullets and Israeli bombs that cost the lives of their own hostages. There is no question that a ceasefire and an agreement to exchange hostages is the only path forward in which you can guarantee the safety of both of Israelis and Palestinians out of all this.We've seen the biggest number of hostages being released the last time there was a temporary ceasefire in which we agreed for an exchange of hostages and prisoners between the two sides, and that is obviously the path forward. [15:15:06] There is currently a deal on the table that basically says an exchange for the end of this war on Gaza that has just utterly devastated Gaza, killed nearly 40,000 people. In exchange for an end to that war, Israel can get all of us hostages back without another person being killed from this point moving forward. There is simply no reason not to accept that, except it seems that the Israeli government's goal of destroying Gaza seems to rank much higher than the lives of their own hostages, which is why we are stuck in this grotesque scenario, and it is why Netanyahu seems to be beholden to the fanatical wing of his own government, who are insisting that the ultimate goal has to be either the ethnic cleansing of Gaza or the permanent reoccupation of Gaza and we are stuck in this situation where there is no real plan for what happens after this war, and in the meantime, people are going to continue to get killed. It is a very, very tragic and unfortunate situation.",

He understands there are significant discontent with Netanyahu within the country for the fact that he has not been able to secure the release of enough hostages, and the fact that there is also international pressure on Netanyahu. The fact that the United States, that President Biden clearly has some tensions with Netanyahu.unfortunately, those tensions have not lead to any real or meaningful pressure. The only way President Biden can actually change Netanyahu's behavior is by credibly threatening to withhold US military funding for Israel if Netanyahu does not change course, that unfortunately does not seem to be on the table. But I think Gantz is banking on that pressure ramping up moving forward, and is trying to express a more clear and decisive disagreement with Netanyahu, hoping that when there is more mounting American and domestic Israeli pressure on Netanyahu, that he might potentially be there to essentially reap the benefits of that discontentment and take charge, but ultimately really we are stuck in a situation in which do you need a ceasefire. That ceasefire can only be brought about through American meaningful pressure and that has to mean that America cannot continue just providing unconditional military funding, knowing how these weapons are being used, knowing that every major human rights organization in the world is describing Israeli bombings in Gaza as indiscriminate, as costing too many civilian lives. That is not something that the United States should be complicit in. It is really way belatedly about time to say that we have to put an end to that kind of support in order to achieve that meaningful change, regardless of what the Israeli prime minister happens to be in charge when that change comes about.",

This is now his third major title at the age of only 21. He has won the US Open. He has won Wimbledon. He has won the French, so he is now the youngest man to win major titles from all three surfaces and I think this was a real passing of the torch moment because this might have been Rafa Nadal's last ever French Open tournament.",

So therein lies the potential that this could be a one and done proposition, but of course now, we are waiting to see how North Korea responds. So what exactly precipitated this? Well, earlier, I should say late Saturday night into early Sunday morning, 300 trash balloons were sent from North Korea, 80 of them made it into South Korean territory. Some of them landing in the heart of the megalopolis of Seoul right in the middle of the Han River. And if we rewind a little further back into Thursday of last week, we have a North Korean defector. He is running an activist group here in South Korea called Fighters for a Free North Korea, he and his group launched ten balloons filled with images and slices of life in South Korea to northern neighbors, so that launch happened in the early morning hours of Thursday. This for tit-for-tat balloon row, listen to what the founder of that group told us just before his balloon launch. PARK SANG-HAK, FOUNDER, THE FIGHTERS FOR A FREE NORTH KOREA (through translator): We send money, medicine, facts, truth, and love, but to send filth and trash in return? That is an inhumane and barbaric act. VALERIO: Now, where do we go from here? That is the essential question. How will North Korea respond, if at all, to this. So important to note before we go, we are standing right here on the Unification Bridge in Paju, South Korea. There are military personnel all around us and a military base very close. And we did not hear when this broadcast happened earlier in the day, so it is possible that this could have been played at a very low level. But again, the South Korean military saying it is up to North Korea whether or not a broadcast like this happens again. We are all waiting to see how the North responds to this latest action.
