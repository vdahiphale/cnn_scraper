And while there's not a gag order in this case, it's just not yet, the judge overseeing the case warned both sides to mind their manners.

Now, the police chief, John Drake, says even before the officers arrived to the school, they were so focused and intent on saving the children that many of them left behind ballistic vests and helmets that would have helped them in confronting the shooter.

But to be honest, they have proven to be quite weak in Ukraine, and in any case, they will not be fighting on two fronts. And to put it bluntly, I think Finland is a safe pair of hands.

I think, you know, when you're desperate, you go into the blame game. And, of course, the Russian narrative has been from the beginning that this was NATO's fault or the U.S.'s fault.
