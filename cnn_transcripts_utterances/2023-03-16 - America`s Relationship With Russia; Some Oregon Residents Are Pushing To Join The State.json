      "sentences": "All of this plays out early Tuesday morning in international airspace over the Black Sea when the U.S.says its MQ-9 Reaper drone was intercepted by two Russian Sukhoi Su-27 fighter jets. That part is not that uncommon, and these sorts of intercepts have happened in the past. What is extremely rare is what happened as this played out. Over the course of 30 to 40 minutes. The Russian fighter jets, according to the Pentagon, repeatedly flew around and in front of the U.S. drone, dumped jet fuel in front of it, and even collided with it, damaging the propeller and forcing the U.S. to take down its own drone in international waters in the Black Sea. Now, the National Security Council`s Coordinator for Strategic communications, John Kirby, told CNN that the U.S. took steps to protect its equities, but it`s unclear exactly what that is, whether that was some sort of self-destruct or some other step to protect it. Now, the drone has not been recovered, partially because at least there is no U.S. naval asset in the Black Sea to have carried out such a recovery. So the U.S. took some step to protect its own equities. This MQ-9 Reaper drone. But again, unclear what that is. Much of the response so far has been in the diplomatic lane. The U.S. summoning the Russian Ambassador to the U.S. and carrying out at least a 30 minutes conversation at the State Department. Russia giving an entirely different version of events, saying there was no collision, there was no Russian jets firing at that U.S. drone, but Russia saying it does not want confrontations.

      "sentences": "Ten-second trivia.Which of these U.S. states is nicknamed the Gem State? Oregon, Idaho, Arkansas, or Delaware? Idaho. The Gem State is the 14th largest, and it`s bordered by Montana, Wyoming, Utah, Nevada, Washington and Oregon. We`ll travel to Oregon now where some residents are pushing to move the state line so that they can join their neighboring state of Idaho. The movement known as Move Oregon`s Border for a Greater Idaho is looking to redraw the border between Oregon and Idaho so that about 20 rural conservative Oregon counties can instead become part of Idaho. These counties say that they want to do this because they want a Republican led government. Oregon`s state government is currently controlled by Democrats, while Idaho`s state government is controlled by Republicans. Critics of the idea have called the plan bad for America and have stated that the U.S. political system works best when there`s a balance of different viewpoints. But members of the group pushing for change have said rural Oregon is politically outnumbered in its state and that their voices have been ignored for years. The group believes their livelihoods, industries and freedoms are hurt by the policies of a government that doesn`t share their values. Still, those opposed to the idea believe dividing America into politically like-minded people is the opposite of a healthy country. We`ll hear now from CNN National Correspondent Kyung Lah looking at both sides of this debate. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
