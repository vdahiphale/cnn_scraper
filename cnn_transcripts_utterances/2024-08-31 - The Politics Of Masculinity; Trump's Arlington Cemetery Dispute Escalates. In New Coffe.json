As a matter of fact, among Gen Z and Millennial men, they're very supportive of gender equality.So it's not that they're moving towards the Republican Party, they feel abandoned by the Democratic Party. And that is, if you have a group -- the Democratic Party right now, Michael, is facing the same issues as some of the DEI apparatus at universities, and that is when you are purposely and explicitly advocating for 76 percent of the population, are you advocating for them or are you discriminating against the 24 percent? And that's how I think a lot of young men feel. Quite frankly, they just don't feel seen by the Democratic Party. To the issue of economics, you reference college, where pretty soon, with these trends, we're going to have two to one female to male college grads. Women in urban areas under the age of 30 are now making more money than men, more single women owned homes than men. And by the way, those are wonderful things, and most men don't resent that, but what they see is a huge apparatus and resources and rhetoric and very inspiring speeches about the importance of advocating for every single group but young men.",

And I took a look, Scott, at some of the comments, and this one caught my eye because it was typical. Put that up on the screen, Catherine (ph). So this person said that \"headline says it all. A bunch of bros with fake jobs preaching to a bunch of bros with no jobs being courted by a tiny man who has never held a job that he was qualified for.\" And I could read you 10 like that, more than 10 like that. And I think that's part of the reason why, you know, there's this mindset out there, like, screw these guys. They don't need assistance. Many of them are young white men.

I think when you say we're advocating for basically everybody but one group, you aren't advocating for those special interest groups, you're discriminating against one. It should be about freedom. It should be about opportunity for the middle class.It should be about lifting up our young people. I don't think you want I mean specific programs that target young men, I think are just too politically charged. But, for example, the Democrats don't take credit where they should, 70 percent of the jobs created by the Infrastructure Act are going to be for men who don't necessarily have college degrees, but they don't want to talk about it. So I think this is -- I think we need to move away from, quite frankly, the politics of identity to the politics of America. The same is true at universities. I don't think -- the University of California in 1997 did away with race based affirmative action and went to income based or adversity based affirmative action. I think that's a role for the Democratic Party, instead of calling out specific observable traits and say we're promoting this group and this group and this group, but not this one. Move to, OK, young people are 24 percent less wealthy than they were 40 years ago versus plus 70 year olds are 72 percent wealthier. Young families are struggling. Three million men between the age of 25 and 34 are no longer even seeking employment. One out of three young men doesn't have a girlfriend. Two out of three young women under the age of 30 do have a girlfriend because they're dating older for more economically and emotionally viable men. So we need programs that lift up all young people, but we need to move away from this identity politics, because it's not about promoting or advocating, it's turning to reverse discrimination.",

The whole shooting match is that America is a platform such that people can get together and form loving, deep and meaningful relationships. That is why you have an economy to create a middle class such that young people can build nice lives. And one of the keys to building a productive life is the ability to find a partner.And the reality is, we don't talk about kind of the core issue here, and it's mating, and that is women make socioeconomically horizontally and up, men horizontally down.

Three of the 13 are buried at the Arlington National Cemetery. Former President Donald Trump visited the cemetery following a leaf raying ceremony to honor those who lost their lives that day. He did so at the invitation of the families.A video of the visit posted by the Trump campaign on TikTok showed the former president walking through Arlington and visiting grave sites. It's a violation of federal law to use cemetery footage for campaign purposes. Prior to Trump's visit to Section 60, that's an area in the cemetery largely reserved for the graves of those who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, campaign officials were made aware of federal laws which prohibit political campaign or election related activities. They were asked not to take photos or videos for that purpose, the grounds are considered sacred and hallowed. An army spokesperson said an employee who attempted to ensure adherence to these rules was, quote, \"abruptly pushed aside.\" The statement goes on to say, \"Consistent with the decorum expected at ANC, this employee acted with professionalism and avoided further disruption. The incident was reported to the police department, but the employee subsequently decided not to press charges. Therefore, the Army considers this matter closed.\" Since Monday, accounts from the scene have varied. Former President Trump has insisted there was no violation of law. Communications Director for the Trump campaign, Steven Cheung, posted on X that the campaign was granted access to have a photographer there. Cheung also disputed claims of a physical altercation, and has said there's video to back this up, yet none has been released thus far. Former President Trump published a statement on Truth Social from five family members thanking him for making the visit and saying, we are deeply grateful to the President for taking the time to honor our children and for standing alongside us in our grief, offering his unwavering support during such a difficult time. Joining me now is one of those family members, Christy Shamblin, mother in law of Marine Corps Sergeant Nicole Gee. Gee aged 23 was deployed to Afghanistan, where she served as a female engagement team member to help facilitate evacuation support for Afghan women and children. She was killed in a suicide attack, along with 12 other service members that day leaving behind a husband. Christy, thank you so much for being here. Please tell me about Nicole.",

Trump's new book called \"Save America\" comes out next week and features this image of the former president with Zuckerberg inside the Oval Office.Trump writes in the caption that Zuckerberg plotted against him during his reelection campaign, and warns Zuckerberg, quote, \"If he does anything illegal this time he will spend the rest of his life in prison as will others who cheat in the 2024 presidential election.\" Zuckerberg now vowing to not repeat the same mistakes his company made during the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2020 presidential election. In a letter this week to House Judiciary Committee chair, Jim Jordan, Zuckerberg writes, \"In 2021, senior officials from the Biden administration, including the White House, repeatedly pressured our teams for months to censor certain COVID-19 content, including humor and satire, and expressed a lot of frustration with our teams when we didn't agree. Ultimately, it was our decision whether or not to take content down, and we own our decisions. I believe the government pressure was wrong, and I regret that we were not more outspoken about it.\" In a separate issue, the Facebook founder also said that his company should have never demoted a \"New York Post\" story that covered corruption allegations against Hunter Biden that were discovered on a laptop during the 2020 presidential election. The FBI had warned Meta about a potential Russian disinformation hack against the Bidens. But further reporting later proved the Russians had nothing to do with those allegations. The GOP also criticized Zuckerberg for donating more than 400 million to help non-profits run local elections in urban, rural, and suburban communities during the pandemic. Republicans claimed that money unfairly benefited Democrats. Zuckerberg ended his letter with this. \"My goal is to be neutral and not play a role one way or another, or to even appear to be playing a role. So, I don't plan on making a similar contribution this cycle.\" Joining me now is Greg Lukianoff, a free speech advocate who is president and CEO of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression.
