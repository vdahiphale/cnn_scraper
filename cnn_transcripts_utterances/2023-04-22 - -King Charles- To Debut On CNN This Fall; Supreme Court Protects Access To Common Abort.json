And the live show will feature top newsmakers and personalities at the center of the most interesting stories of the week. And we're excited to welcome our new colleagues, Gayle King and Charles Barkley to CNN. That's \"King Charles.\" Wednesday nights, launching this fall right here on CNN.All right. Hello again, everyone. And welcome. I'm Fredricka Whitfield. And we begin with the U.S. Supreme Court issuing a critical 11th hour ruling. Protecting access to a common abortion drug, at least for now. The High Court freezing a lower court's ruling on the drug Mifepristone, which had placed debilitating restrictions on its usage. The drug is the predominant method for ending pregnancies in the U.S. Widely used for decades taken by millions of women. The decision sets up the most consequential abortion-related disputes since the Supreme Court overturn Roe v. Wade. A new appeals process must now play out. A process that could take between weeks or even months to be resolved. CNN's Supreme Court Reporter Ariane de Vogue has more. Ariane? ARIANE DE VOGUE, CNN SUPREME COURT REPORTER (on camera): Fredricka, the Biden administration is relieved. Lower courts had put significant restrictions on this key abortion drug. The government and manufacturers had raced to the Supreme Court asking the justices to put those rulings on hold while the appeals process plays out which could take months. The Supreme Court agreed to do so. So that means that this abortion drug will remain unavailable in the states that allow it and all the moves that the FDA has made recently to ease access to the drug will also remain in place. That means that the generic version is available. That women can receive it up to 10 weeks of pregnancy, and they can obtain it by mail. It would have taken five justices to grant this stay as we call it. And we're not sure exactly how all the Conservatives voted. All we know is Justice Samuel Alito and Justice Clarence Thomas dissented. Alito was the only one who explained his thinking. He did not buy into the government's argument that patients would be harmed while the appeals process played out if the restrictions remained in place. Of course, all this comes about a year since the Supreme Court has overturned Roe v. Wade. The issue now goes back to the federal appeals court. Many people believe that after that court rules, it will come back to the Supreme Court and the justices will once again weigh into the issue on whether or not the FDA had the authority 20 years ago to approve this drug. But for now, it is available in the states that allow abortion. Fredricka? Ariane de Vogue, thank you so much. All right. So many questions still about how this will impact access to abortions nationwide. CNN's Isabel Rosales is here with more on this. So, despite the ruling, there are a lot of other restrictions already in place depending on what state and jurisdiction you're in. ISABEL ROSALES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Right. And what this all proves is that the fight over abortion access is not going anywhere. Really since the overturning of Roe v. Wade, we have seen on the ground, a manifestation of a patchwork system where abortion policy is largely left up to the states. In blue states, we've seen protections come about to protect abortion access. In the red states, restrictions or outright bans against abortion.

Opponents argue that's before many women know they're pregnant. Nearly a year since overturning Roe v. Wade another major decision on abortion access from the nation's highest court. The conservative majority court protecting access to a widely use abortion drug, Mifepristone by freezing lower court rulings that place restrictions on medication abortion.

CNN Health Reporter Jacqueline Howard has more.JACQUELINE HOWARD, CNN HEALTH REPORTER (on camera): We're seeing a growing concern among young doctors about how abortion restrictions could impact their training and the care they provide to their patients. An analysis released this month from the Association of American Medical Colleges finds that the number of medical school graduates who applied to residencies in obstetrics and gynecology has seen a notable drop in the most recent application cycle following the Dobbs decision. Applications in that specialty dropped five percent in states without abortion restrictions, but the drop was about twice as much. 10.5 percent in states where abortion is banned. And when you look at Med School graduates across all specialties, the data shows applications to residency training programs ticked down overall last year by two percent from the previous year. But applications specifically to programs and states with abortion bans dropped the most by three percent. One student based in New York, Sarah McNeilly has seen this firsthand. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

(END VIDEO CLIP) HOWARD: Now, the Association of American Medical Colleges says despite these declines, there are still enough applicants for states with abortion bans to fill their residency programs. But the group also says it will be important to keep an eye on this, especially when it comes to the future of the nation's physician workforce. Back to you.",

The shootings unfolded Friday night and police are investigating the incident as potentially connected. When police arrived at the first scene, they found seven men with non-life- threatening gunshot wounds. Police say most of the wounded took themselves to a local hospital.While investigating that shooting, police received a call about a second incident nearby. And when officers arrived, they discovered a 12-year-old girl who had been shot. The girl is reportedly in stable condition and her injuries also non-life threatening. That shooting comes at the end of a violent 10 days of deadly encounters across the country involving tragic wrong place, wrong time shootings. It started on April 13 in Kansas City when Ralph Yarl, a black teen knocked on the wrong door to pick up his siblings. He was shot twice but thankfully survived. Two days later, 20-year-old Kaylin Gillis who was White was shot and killed after she and friends turned into the wrong driveway looking for another friend's house in rural upstate New York. And then on Tuesday of this week, two teen cheerleaders were shot in a grocery store parking lot after one accidentally tried to get into the wrong car. Jennifer Mascia is a CNN contributor and a writer for Trace. An independent, nonpartisan nonprofit newsroom dedicated to shining a light on America's gun violence crisis. So good to see you, Jennifer. Jennifer Mascia, I'm sorry. I mispronounced your name. So, you study a gun violence. Different circumstances with some commonalities in all of these shootings. Meaning they all seem pretty senseless, right? So, what is most striking to you? JENNIFER MASCIA, CNN CONTRIBUTOR (on camera): What's striking to me is we see people opening fire on their neighbors out of fear. And really, it's not that surprising. I mean, gun production is up 152 percent in the last 15 years. And at the same time, the gun lobby and conservative media has been repeatedly forwarding these messages that we are not safe without guns. There are bad guys lurking around every corner. And when you push A Guns Everywhere at All Time mentality, people are going to see threats that aren't there. And the pandemic only reinforced that. We had people who were hunkered down in their homes. Siloed with nothing but the internet inundated with these messages that the government can't be trusted. Wokeness is going to cost you your place in society. Immigrants are going to take your jobs. So, all of this together. You know the man who shot Ralph Yarl reportedly blasted Fox News at full volume. So sadly, this isn't really surprising that we're seeing this happening.",

The positive step forward here is that we are shining more of a light on these cases. We're learning about these as they're happening. And the visibility is uncomfortable, I think, for law enforcement and prosecutors. And even when there is a delay in an arrest, which we've seen, like with Ahmaud Arbery, you know, eventually, you know, justice is served, some kind of prosecution happens. But when people think that they're losing power in society, guns have been shown as -- as you know, messaging, you know, has shown that that is a way that people can feel they're taking that power back.

And the news coverage at the time focused very much on the racial elements. The incident shocked the nation. He was acquitted. But that -- his family and also the host family, the American host family from Louisiana, got together and you know, they pushed for the Brady Bill to be passed. That momentum of Yoshi's family and the host family coming together provided that final momentum for background checks in this country. And then the next year, assault weapon ban.
