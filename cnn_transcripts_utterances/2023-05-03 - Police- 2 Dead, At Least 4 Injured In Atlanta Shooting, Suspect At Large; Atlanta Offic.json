      "sentences": "Jim, look, there's a lot to unravel here. Look, police are still looking for Deion Patterson, that's the man who apparently arrived to this complex -- that's right over here over my shoulder -- earlier today with his mother. Something went wrong during that evaluation. We are told he was a member of the military at one point. They were concerned about him and then the shooting started.We've also talked to other people who were nearby the scene, even a man who was confused with the shooter at one point and briefly detained and then he was told what exactly happened. He saw some of the nurses in tears after this shooting upset that some of their co- workers may have been involved in the shooting. We even heard in the last half hour or so there may have been shots nearby and of course we've seen police go to that general area. I can tell you as I've been talking to my sources, they don't believe right now that that is connected with this. So, you have a bustling city here, you may have different calls for service all happening at the same time. There is an active situation right now where they believe this carjacking that was nearby the scene could still be connected and they may know where this man is headed. This is an active manhunt. You had the surge of metro Atlanta with all the different agencies involved who are trying to figure out exactly where this man is. But what we know is that that initial surge stopped any more shooting from happening. That picture went up, the gray hoodie with the canvas bag showing this former military member with the bag that they believe the handgun was stuffed in and then that shooting and barrage started. Sadly, and unfortunately, we do know someone lost their life and other people are in critical condition getting treatment at Grady Hospital a level 1 trauma center here, the only one in the city of Atlanta. We've heard our sources and John Miller and everyone else talk about the idea of the video integration system that's here in Atlanta. All that has helped to be a force multiplier to get these images out there. And I can tell you right now, they are scouring through the video images to see if they can track this man's movement from the moment the shooting happened all the way to wherever he went to next. There is a building just on this side over here where the \"WHOLE FOODS\" is housed and of course there is condos up there as well. Initially someone thought maybe that parking garage was where the man was so then there were people there that were sheltering in place. Just in the last five minutes or so people that I know who live in the conned do area around here have been texting me to say they've been told they can now leave their building. So, there may be a softening of the perimeter at this point. But so many questions. Is the carjacking connected? Is the shots fired call that they believe that some people heard nearby is that connected as well? You can understand the 911 calls are coming because anybody who's seen in something similar to a gray hoodie and those dark pants have been having those 911 calls flow into the 911 center here in Atlanta. So, at this point right now, we've seen a softening of the perimeter here in Atlanta, in the Midtown area and there still remains an active scene in front of that hospital where the shooting occurred early this morning. And we do know the suspect's mother is actually involved in this because she has been cooperating with the police to try to give them some information about her son who we believe was a service member at some point and then something went to the side. So again, we've been tracking this and following it and keeping it and keeping in touch with our sources to kind of put this all together to figure out what may happen next.",

Andy, we're actually at this point awaiting the first press conference from the Atlanta police department. They've had assistance from U.S. Marshals, from troopers.

It sounds from all indications as we've discussed before and as Josh School mentioned, it looks like this is being converted into a manhunt. And so, that's really what I'm -- look to hear more about from local law enforcement at the presser.But you're absolutely right, I'm sure any local law enforcement agency that's got resources to spare and share is doing that right now within RAMPA. [15:35:00] So, it's all of the federal agencies that you can imagine, FBI, ATF, Marshals and then of course all the significant -- you know, you've a lot of really big robust police agencies in that area, in adjacent counties. You've got state police, Georgia Bureau of Investigations. So, there's a lot of resources that they can throw at this problem. And as we've just seen in Texas in the last day or so, that's how you find people, right? You work the technical means, you work the human means, which is talking to family members and relatives and targeting them in some ways with surveillance. But you need a lot of people to go out there and search these locations, respond to sightings as they come up, which they will continue to happen in great number over the next few hours.",

I know all their parents are probably nervous and want their kids back. So, it's not like you can -- you know, it's not like an office building. You can leave it under a shelter in place forever. There's risks and costs on both sides. You could also use resources, police resources, to supervise the parents coming to pick up those kids to kind of be in the area to respond or at least present a presence that would discourage any offender from acting out in that area. But either way it's a risky thing to do if you think there's any chance that the suspect is in the area.",

Whether they're video, 911 calls, people walking up to police officers saying, hey, I think I see somebody over here.
