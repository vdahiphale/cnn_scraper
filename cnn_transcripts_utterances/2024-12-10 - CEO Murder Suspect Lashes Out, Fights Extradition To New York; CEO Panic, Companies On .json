John Tower was rejected as first President Bush's Secretary of Defense nominee, despite being in the Senate for 24 years because of a pattern of impersonal, you know, intemperance with alcohol and women.

There was a lot of hubbub, if you will, about whether or not she was a Christian if she was on the right or if she was on the left.There was everyone, all the new fans to the sport had so much to say about Caitlin Clark. And today she said something that I thought was more about humanity and bringing that sport together, women's basketball. She said, listen, it's been around since 1997, built on the backs of black women and they deserve to get the same attention that I get. And I hope that I can do my part and give that same attention to them. And I appreciate her for saying that because she makes more money than these women and it's not necessarily her fault in any form or fashion. But she does understand that she has white privilege -- her words, not mine. And what that says to me is that she's well aware of the world that she lives in and she wants to make It a better place.

The Inflation Reduction Act, with a lot of the provisions that really are helping combat climate change, that is due to him and also things like lowering prescription drugs.
