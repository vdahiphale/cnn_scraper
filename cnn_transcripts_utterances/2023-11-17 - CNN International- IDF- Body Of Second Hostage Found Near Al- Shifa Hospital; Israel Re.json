Israel released these images showing a deep hole in the ground surrounded by concrete and rubble. Hamas calls these claims ridiculous. And there are signs that a ground offensive in southern Gaza could come soon. Leaflets were dropped in communities in eastern Khan Younis, the south's largest city asking people to head towards known shelters. Meanwhile, the Director Al- Shifa says his hospital is a scene of desperation and suffering. Nada Bashir joins us with the latest from Jerusalem. The IDF really under pressure now to deliver evidence. And tell us a bit more about the state of the hospital and what people are enjoying there.",

      "sentences": "Well, Max, it certainly is a desperate situation at the Al-Shifa Hospital, as you mentioned that we have heard from the hospital's director describing the situation that they are facing, as we know hundreds of patients are still in the hospital, hundreds of medical staff. And that's in addition to thousands of civilians who are taking shelter in and around the Al-Shifa complex. Now, as we know long before this raid began, Al-Shifa had run out of electricity and power, had run out of oxygen supplies in its neonatal unit. Now, we are hearing that patients are literally starving because of the shortage in food and clean water supplies at the Al-Shifa complex.And of course we have to underscore that this is really being reflected across a number of hospitals, particularly in northern Gaza, as a result of the ongoing bombardment and the ongoing siege. Now, as we know, the IDF says it has carried out this raid -- or is carrying out this raid on the Al-Shifa hospital, focus on what it believes to be a Hamas command and control center beneath the hospital complex. We saw yesterday another batch of evidence according to the IDF provided including as you mentioned evidence according to the IDF of tunneling infrastructure and operational tunnel shaft. That is how they have characterized that evidence. Hamas, as you mentioned, categorically denying this. They have described this as baseless lies and have accused the Israeli Military or fabricating evidence, and of course CNN is not on the ground and hasn't been granted independent access, and therefore cannot verify either side's claims. And that is a message that is being sent out by UN officials as well. We've heard from the UN's Humanitarian Chief Volker Turk urging the Israeli Ministry to allow independent teams from the UN's Humanitarian Office to access the Al-Shifa hospital, to assess the situation at the hospital, and of course to assess the evidence that the Israeli Military has thus far put forward with regards to their claims of a Hamas command and control center beneath the hospital. Now, the situation is deteriorating by the hour. Doctors there say they are having to carry out desperate procedures in order to stem the deterioration of the situation, including carrying out amputations to prevent the spread of infectious diseases within the hospital. We're hearing of doctors carrying out procedures without anesthetic. And of course, while we are very much focused on Al-Shifa, it is important to remember that there is a deteriorating situation facing all hospitals in Gaza. We've heard those repeated calls now for civilians to evacuate northern Gaza to southern Gaza. But, as we know, airstrikes have continued across southern Gaza. We've seen just in the last day or so airstrikes taking place in Khan Younis, the largest city in Gaza, and hospitals there are deeply overrun, and now of course there is mounting concern that we could begin to see at some point a possible ground incursion by the Israeli Military into southern Gaza where more than a million Palestinians have now fled to or displaced in southern Gaza. [08:05:00] We saw those leaflets reports, leaflets being dropped on the eastern neighborhoods of Khan Younis, particularly around areas near the perimeter fence separating the Gaza Strip from Israel, warning civilians there to move to known shelters. But, of course, when you think about some 1.5 million people, according to the UN, being displaced within the Gaza Strip, a vast majority of them now in southern Gaza, living in temporary shelters, living in tents, and of course, potent trend. But, it is getting cold now. It is raining quite regularly now in Gaza. The question is, where do these people turn? Where do they go for safety if there are still airstrikes going on in southern Gaza? And if we do indeed begin to see Israel's ground incursion pushing further south. We've heard those warnings. We've heard the condemnation from international humanitarian organizations, warning about the mounting civilian deaths that will be deteriorating humanitarian situation. As we saw, the UN Security Council passing a resolution, calling for humanitarian pauses to allow for essential vital humanitarian aid to get into the Gaza Strip. Israel rejecting that resolution, saying that this is disconnected from reality. They've described and characterized this to Israel's Ambassador to the UN as meaningless. And there are fears that we will not see long enough pauses to allow for vital humanitarian aid to get in particularly if their ground incursion does indeed spread further south Max.",

Images of those babies shivering and crying without heat from incubators broadcast all over the world earlier this week. At the last report, doctors at Al-Shifa said there were 36 babies who desperately needed to be evacuated. Eleni Giokos has been tracking this story for us from Egypt. I mean, what plans are in place? We've been hearing that no one could get out of the hospital.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. I mean, that's the whole point is to try and get them out of the hospital and into Egypt. Look, we just don't know the status right now, Max. We don't know whether they're still in Al-Shifa. We just heard from Nada's report there is that raid in Al-Shifa. We know that buildings and roads are destroyed around the hospital. The question becomes, can they get safely to the Egyptian border at Rafah? And that is what the Egyptians are efforting right now. They have been expecting 36 babies since Sunday, and every single day, I've been speaking to them. They have high hopes and on high alerts to try and get them in. But, there is no word right now.We can't get hold of the Palestinian Red Crescent. We can't get hold of doctors inside Al-Shifa to find out if these babies have oxygen, if they are in incubators. We've seen those images. They are so vulnerable, and they are in grave danger. We heard the initial number of 36 babies. The Health Ministry here tells me that that number might change. They fear that of course some of them might die because every single minute counts here, Max. It's all about oxygen. It's all about electricity. And I caught up with the Health Minister, and he told me just how he is feeling about this and the sense of urgency from the Egyptian side. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. KHALED ABDEL GHAFFAR, EGYPTIAN MINISTER OF HEALTH AND POPULATION: How you know that there is neonates that needs ventilators, and they are out of electricity, and they are out of gas, and they are out of medication. And they told me that they're trying to put three neonates in one incubator. Can you believe that? And they sent me photos for them, because they don't have anything else to do. So, they put the kids, three of them, in one incubator because they don't have that much source of energy to support. And even though they stopped losing those newborns and they want to get them out, how do you call that? How do you name that? (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I mean, the Egyptian officials that I've been talking to say they go to bed every night with a heavy heart, every day when they are waiting for the babies to come through the border. The reality here, Max, is that these help the souls are stuck in a warzone and no making of their own. And that's just makes -- this is what makes this whole story very tragic is the fact that we can't get any communication about how they will leave and the fate of their lives and whether they can get through to safety.The Egyptians say they're ready and waiting. The question now becomes just what kind of conditions will allow for them to get through, especially with the reality of possibly not enough fuel for ambulances to get down to the border. And you heard that story, you know, three babies in one incubator, which is an impossibility, which just raises concerns about how this is going to play out in the next few days.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. Today does mark the last day of APEC and for President Biden. In terms of what is coming up on his agenda, he is going to be holding a bilateral meeting with the President of Mexico before heading off to an APEC meeting where he will formally hand off the baton to the President of Peru. Peru is going to be the host nation of the next year's APEC summit.I think it's worth spending just a minute talking about this upcoming meeting between the Presidents of the U.S. and Mexico. This is going to be important, not only because of course there are so many shared issues and areas of concern between those two countries, including of course the situation at the U.S. southern Mexico border, this is a politically fraught issue for President Biden back in Washington. They're also expected to discuss the issue of fentanyl trafficking. And that is really noteworthy, because that was one of the issues that came up when President Biden met with President Xi two days ago here. And one of the rare announcements that actually came out of that summit that the two countries would work together to curtail and crack down on substances that are used to make fentanyl. So, the fact that President Biden is having this bilateral meeting with AMLO, and that this issue is expected to come up is notable, and AMLO did discuss this himself with President Xi as well yesterday. So, this should be an interesting bilateral meeting that the President sort of ends the APEC summit with. I should also quickly note, just in terms of what the President has been up to in terms of his domestic agenda too. The President has signed a bill to fund the government. This was flown in, we are told, to California so he could sign it. This wasn't nearly at all everything that the White House wanted, because it only really partially funds the government until later in January. The rest of the government is funded through only the beginning of February. But, just a reminder that even in a week wherein (ph) foreign policy has been extremely heavily on President Biden's mind. Of course, this on the other hand, has been another important domestic issue for the President. It did finally get resolved. But, it was up for question even until a few days ago whether the government would end up being funded, and they would be able to avert a government shutdown back in Washington.",
