It also comes just a few weeks after an initial $12 billion in emergency funding was requested by the White House as FEMA's disaster relief fund moves into dire straits. It's been strained by wildfires and floods and, of course, now hurricane season. President Biden, in a visit to FEMA headquarters on Thursday, stressed the urgency.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I think we just need like an Ohio sports reference to complete the trifecta.But I am happy to indulge you here because this is really an important issue and one that people should be paying attention to because this is a real problem for Kevin McCarthy. And he has been strategizing behind the scenes about how they're going to get out of this mess. And two of the big questions right now is, how long is the CR, the short-term spending bill, going to be. We're hearing likely until maybe early December, potentially a little bit less than that. And then the other question is what gets attached, if anything, and hitches a ride on this short-term spending bill. The problem right now is that while many Republicans support disaster aid, right now that request is attached to Ukraine funding, which many conservatives are against. So, they want to delink those two issues or they want to have offsets. And then you have a number of conservatives, like Chip Roy, who are now demanding that border issues be attached to as well. So, Kevin McCarthy has to figure out the sweet spot here. He doesn't need hard line conservatives necessarily to get this over the finish line because presumably it will have Democratic support. Then he risks enraging those same conservatives who could force a vote to oust him at any given moment, Phil.",

You see Democrats, 89 percent to 88 percent. Very little drop off. But look at Republicans, writers to actors, look at this drop off among actors, just 43 percent of Republicans favor the actors. Maybe it's something, oh, we don't like those Hollywood elites, we don't like those actors out there. Something perhaps is going on out there. Democrats very consistent in their support. Republicans see this drop off. The other little nugget that I think is really interesting here is compare this to what we saw about 15 years ago when the writers, of course, were on strike. And what do we see here? From 2007 to 2023, this is the public overall, look at this jump in support in favor of writers, 12 points more favorable towards the writers this time around than last time around. And the no opinion, look at this, dropped off from 16 percent to 3 percent. So, it's not just that Americans are favoring the writers more, it's also that they care more. Those without an opinion have dropped off. And I think that is largely in line with what we've seen nationally, which is, we've see more support for labor unions now than we saw 15 years ago.
