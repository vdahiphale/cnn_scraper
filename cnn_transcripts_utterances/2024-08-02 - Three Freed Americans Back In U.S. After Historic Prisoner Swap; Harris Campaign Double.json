Amanda, everyone back home is so excited to see this happen. AMANDA DAVIES, CNN INTERNATIONAL SPORTS ANCHOR:  And rightly so. I mean, eight years after the first time she's done it just puts -- that is an unbelievable amount of time in gymnastics world and there's not many who can get away with celebrating with a diamond-encrusted GOAT necklace round your neck. But if anybody can, Simone can. And that's a pretty apt saying when it comes to her gymnastics performances as well, isn't it? I mean, I felt really, really privileged to be there last night. The atmosphere was everything you've been hearing about. The game has changed with the likes of Vogue and Vanity Fair there -- Seth Rogin, Steph Curry, Kim Kardashian. Everybody wanting to get in on the action and see history play out. And she overcame a wobble on the uneven bars, which brought a huge intake of breath. But she put in a great performance on the beam and floor as you can see, ultimately stepping up and doing what she does to become the first woman to win non-consecutive all-around titles. The first woman to win two since 1968. Her sixth Olympic gold medal and well and truly cement her status in that GOAT lineup. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And I was, like, OK, if it goes well, we'll wear the GOAT necklace. I know people will go crazy over it. But at the end of the day, it is crazy that I am in the conversation of greatest of all athletes because I just still think I'm Simone Biles from Spring, Texas that loves to flip.(END VIDEO CLIP)",
