They talked to him for almost a year to try to get the documents and he jerked them around. They finally went through a subpoena. And what did he do? According to the government, he lied and obstructed that subpoena. And then they did a search and they found a lot more documents.

So Donald Trump currently is going to be traveling. Because he needs to get here and face his charges in person. So, he's going to be traveling to Miami on Monday, along with his body man, Walt Nauta, a man also charged in this case, as part of the alleged obstruction part of this investigation. And then they will stay at a resort -- at his resort, near Miami, and then huddle with lawyers. So, they're going to having to talk to their lawyers about what's going to be expected on Tuesday in federal court. And then Trump will come to court on Tuesday. But he's going to have a lot of Secret Service protection around him. It's very possible that there will be no live pictures of him or even photographs of him coming into the building to face these charges for his initial appearance. There's no photos in federal court. There's no video inside the building either. And so, he'll have that proceeding. He be read his charges and we expect him to enter a plea of not guilty at this time. Afterwards, he's going to turn political again. The legal part of the day will be done.

And if you look at where that is, it's just at the top of that frontline where Russia occupies in red there. That is really the narrowest strip linking Ukrainian controlled territory with the Sea of Azov. So possibly fits with that strategy cutting off the land bridge to Crimea.I think the other thing to bear in mind here is that it's not just there we're seeing fighting. We're seeing pockets of fighting around Bakhmut. There is evidence further up even in Kupyansk, which is pretty much the northern most part of the eastern front line. Either they're keeping them guessing or perhaps there's still some probing activity. But I think that is key to understand this isn't as of now a localized counteroffensive like we saw in the Kyiv in the spring of 2022, like we saw in Kharkiv last autumn. It's over a widespread area. But this is a hard fight for Ukraine. We are hearing from sources intelligence firm, a Dutch firm, include Oryx that they've lost 16 U.S. supplied armored vehicles, Bradelys, in the last several days. That's about That's about 15 percent of what the U.S. has supplied in total in terms of those Bradelys. Russia has overall, according to the firm, lost much more equipment over the course of this war. But Russia is making a lot of these attacks on western equipment and Ukrainian strongholds of equipment and forces in general.
