It is 5Later today, the Biden administration will announce a major new round of sanctions against Russia in response to two years of war in Ukraine and, especially, to the sudden death of opposition leader Alexei Navalny. A spokesperson for Navalny says an autopsy claims his death at a prison camp in Siberia was from natural causes. U.S. officials say that the new sanctions are aimed at more than 500 people and entities. President Biden telling reporters among the targets is Russian President Vladimir Putin himself. The president met yesterday with Navalny's wife and daughter in California. This is what he had to say right after that meeting. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

David, good morning to you.Sanctions, so far, have not seemed to impact the continuation of the war in Ukraine. Is there going to be anything different here? And what do you make of the targeting of Vladimir Putin himself? DAVID SANGER, CNN POLITICAL AND NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST, WHITE HOUSE AND NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT, THE NEW YORK TIMES (via Webex by Cisco):  Well, it's not the first time Kasie that they have tried to target Putin. He's been pretty good at hiding his assets and making sure that they are spread around the world and hidden in the hands of some of his oligarch friends. So part of this is how well they track that. But as you point out, the sanctions have not been very effective. Two years ago -- and the anniversary of the invasion will be tomorrow. Two years ago, the IMF predicted that the Russian economy would shrink considerably under sanctions. It has expanded. Well, actually, it's actually grown a little more than Germany, where I am right now. The Russians have found ways to sell their oil (audio gap). So I really look for two things, Kasie. It's not really about Putin, which is satisfying but maybe not very effective. It's does the United States and Germany -- do they drop their objections to seizing $300 billion in Russian assets sort of spread around the West and turn those over to Ukraine? And can they find ways to do secondary sanctions on the countries that are buying oil? China, Argentina, some in Europe. And, so far, they have not been willing to go do that.",

Their first concern is they don't want a real autopsy done on him because it could easily get in the way of their story. But the second thing is they don't want a funeral that becomes a center point for opposition to rally around, much as people came by the thousands when Gorbachev died -- the last symbol of reform -- a year ago. Remember, there is an election in Russia next month. There's no doubt how it's going to turn out. But Putin does not want to give the opposition any reason to have large gatherings that he'd have to crack down on. And I think that's what you're seeing happen in the battle over who controls the body.",

But one of the assessments that both European and American intelligence had prior to his death was that the big crackdowns from Putin would come after the elections -- maybe including a new draft and certainly, crackdowns on opposition. What we're seeing now is it's happening beforehand.And I think it was Navalny's ability to mock -- to still communicate even when he was in prison, even when he was in the Arctic. To use new trial appearances to make the entire thing look like a kangaroo court. You can just see it in the expressions that he offered. And I think that become too much for them.

The two candidates will barnstorm the state today as they make their final pitches to voters. And while polls point to a big win for Donald Trump, Haley is remaining defiant, promising voters that she will stay in the race even if she loses her home state.Let's bring in someone who is on South Carolina on the campaign trail right now, Semafor reporter Shelby Talcott. Shelby, good morning to you. It's always good to see you. Let me just start with what you're hearing from the trail on the ground. Obviously, Haley's been really trailing in the polls. Can you pick that up as you go to events across the state? SHELBY TALCOTT, REPORTER, SEMAFOR (via Webex by Cisco):  Yeah, I certainly can. And even when I've talked to staunch Haley supporters -- and there are a number of, sort of, diehard Nikki Haley supporters, especially here in South Carolina -- there is still sort of a feeling even with some of them that they are not really sure -- they're not super confident that she can actually win. But they really like her and so they plan to go out and vote for her on Saturday. And so that's sort of the overwhelming vibe that I get from a lot of these people. When I ask what her path is they seem a little bit unclear. They say, well, if she does really well here in South Carolina, then there's a whole group of quiet voters, as we talked about last week, that will come out and vote for her in other states. We'll see if that actually happens. HUNT:  Yeah, really interesting. So, of course, the frontrunner is Donald Trump. Sort of, what's playing out with his MAGA movement is happening simultaneously as voters are heading to the polls in this primary. I want to show you a couple of things. Donald Trump spoke at a Christian convention in Nashville. I want to show you what he had to say and then we're going to take a tour over here, back to Washington, to CPAC.

Put pressure on Speaker Johnson and on those Republicans who might be on the fence over what to do over this issue. Obviously, he's only -- he only brought Democrats with him on this trip. But Schumer told me he hopes that this can help persuade his House colleagues to do something impactful on this issue, whether it's the Senate bill or not. Obviously, the Senate bill included $60 billion of both military and economic aid for Ukraine. There's a separate discussion happening over whether this should be just focused on the lethal aid aspect of it, so that would reduce the number to about $45 billion.

The Dodgers scored eight runs in the top of the first against the Padres. San Diego's starting pitcher Joe Musgrove -- he was taken out of the game before he could even record an out. Shohei Ohtani -- he did not make his Dodgers debut in this one. We'll have to wait for that. The Dodgers won 14-1. But, you know, the talk is pretty crazy right now over the anger over the uniform changes. So, Nike and Fanatics are making them now. The players and fans have not been very happy with the way the names and numbers look on the back, but another complaint is the pants are kind of see-through. Major League Baseball and Nike both say they're going to use player input to tweak the uniforms and make some changes before opening day. But, Kasie, you don't want see-through pants out there.",
