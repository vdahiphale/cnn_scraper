And for Donald Trump, it was a rather focused speech, a smaller venue, a crowd that was sitting down. And we're told he's going to give more of these kind of issue- based speeches across the country as his team tries to keep him on message. Obviously, as again we have reported, Kamala Harris has really shaken up this race, her boost in enthusiasm, her boost in polling and among - amid all of that, we've seen Donald Trump at times really seeming to not be able to contain himself, not be able to stay on those important issues that his campaign thinks will help him win in November. So as for this news conference, we will see how it goes. We will see if he stays on message. But the big goal coming out of that was to keep yesterday and today focused on the economy.",

He joined Trump's campaign in June of 2015. He ultimately was ousted and replaced by Paul Manafort about a year later. He is going to be back on the campaign.And again, all of this coming at a time in which allies have expressed concerns about the direction that this campaign is going in and then the direction the candidate is heading in. Lewandowski is a staunch supporter, a staunch ally of Donald Trump's. And we did get a statement from Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles. They are the heads of the Trump campaign. And we are told by sources they're not going anywhere. These are just additions. But in the statement, they say, \"As we head into the home stretch of this election, we are continuing to add to our impressive campaign team: Corey Lewandowski, Taylor Budowich,\" who was the head of MAGA Inc, the super PAC aligned with Donald Trump, \"Alex Pfeiffer,\" spokesperson for MAGA Inc, \"Alex Bruesewitz, and Tim Murtaugh are all veterans of prior Trump campaigns and their unmatched experience will help President Trump persecute - prosecute the case against Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, the most radical ticket in American history.\" Again, this is very clearly these additions are coming at a time in which we've seen the polling. We've seen the energy shift on the Democratic side and we've seen the concerns from Republicans around Donald Trump that he needs to be more on message heading into this critical period. So very interesting to see this kind of changes at this time.",

Let's discuss all the aspects of the campaign right now with former Trump White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci. Anthony, great to see you as always. Thanks for being with us. First, I want to ask you about the economic speech that Trump gave last night in Asheville. Kristen pointed out that the campaign is going to be focused on these smaller events, not rallies, kind of centered around a single issue. Why do you think that is? And what grade would you give the former president's performance yesterday?",

He's demeaning and degrading and he's off topic. So he's going to try to repair that today with the press conference.And I, you know, want to give a shout out to Corey Lewandowski. He's a - he is a friend of mine, even though he's on the wrong team. I like Corey and I don't wish him well with this thing, but I wish him well in general in life because I want Donald Trump to lose. But I would say this to you, the smaller events are because he's worried about crowd sizes. He does not want his crowd sizes to be overwhelmed by Vice President Harris. And it looks that way. If you look at her crowd sizes recently, she's getting way more people. He knows that. And so that's why he's making this adaptation. So we can't rule Mr. Trump out of this race. He's a very aggressive, very formidable competitor. And he's recalibrating right now how he's going to approach the race from here to November. And I'll just point out to viewers and listeners, he did the same thing in August of 2016. We had a swap out in August of 2016. And Kellyanne Conway and Steve Bannon joined. And the race, you know, got a lot tighter and a lot more complex after they joined. So he's doing something very similar right now.",

And we'll have to see today at 4He's being told by his aides, if you stick to the issues, the border, the economy, people feeling better, meaning having more money in their pocketbook, inflation, he'll tighten up these polls. If he doesn't want to do that and he wants to call the Vice President mean, and nasty and he wants to use derogatory insults about her intelligence, I think he'll lose the race. And so I think his aides are telling him that and so I think he'll recalibrate because this guy wants to win and he's a formidable politician. And this is one of many adaptations that he's made during the course of his political career. And we'll see if he - if he's less derogatory at 4:30.",

It is interesting, though, because even that sort of sentiment when you hear reporting about sources inside the Trump camp that he wants a shake up, that he doesn't feel like he's on firm footing. His favorability numbers in a campaign have never been higher. I believe he's close to 45-, 44 percent right now. You look at 2020 and 2016, what do you attribute that to?",

But I think those numbers are his ceiling. I think he has - as everybody says, he has this high floor, but a low ceiling.When you look at data, he could get to 47.5 percent. That's why the Republicans want people like Jill Stein and RFK Jr. in the race so they can chip away at Vice President Harris. But, you know, that's a good number for him. That's about as good as it's going to get, frankly. And that's the fact that he's off of Twitter. If those meanderings on Truth Social, the insanity that he writes on Truth Social was actually on Twitter, and for those 80 million plus people that follow him on X or now called X, I think it'd be a disaster for him and those numbers would drop. So he's been a beneficiary of being on Truth Social because he's talking to a hard-right MAGA echo chamber over there. People are not seeing the full insanity of the stuff that he's writing.",

If they do an attack, it probably at least delays, if not derails, the negotiation. If they don't do an attack, it's a bit of a humiliation for them that the Israelis were able to reach deep into Tehran and do a killing like this involving a bomb that was pre-planted in a - in an Islamic Revolutionary Guard guest house right in the middle of the capital during their inauguration.

So these kinds of things are very important. But I think in the long term, as well, strategically, it gives Zelenskyy, for the first time, an actual card in his hand, you know, when negotiations come. And if Trump wins, those negotiations might come sooner rather than later. And so he needed to get, improve his deck of cards and he's done that so far.Still big risks and whether he can hold on to that, you know, card or not is in question, of course.
