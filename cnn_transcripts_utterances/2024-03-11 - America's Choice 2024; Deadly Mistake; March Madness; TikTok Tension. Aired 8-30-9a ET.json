Is there any way to avoid it? MAURA GILLESPIE, FOUNDER &amp; PRINCIPAL, BLUESTACK STRATEGIES: I don't see how we could avoid it given that Donald Trump will continue to use this childish attacks and mocking Joe Biden. I don't disagree with the fact that there were times where Joe Biden was yelling at us to agree with him on how great the economy is. I don't think that's really how you win over voters, is by yelling at them to agree with you. But the childish antics and the back and forth to the -- mostly American people who, again, you know, we've seen those polls, where steady percent of the people don't want this rematch, it's exhausting. It's exhausting to have to watch this back and forth. And it's not really inspiring anyone to want to jump on either side or go out and vote which is a real problem for us.",

I mean, there's a weird irony here, though, is that a big chunk of the Trump -- existing Trump coalition, the one that turned out in primaries, were actually, particularly in southern states, former Democrats, right? He's won over that part of the FDR coalition that was the sort of working class whites, you know, the sort of Dixiecrat-ish whites. They're already part of the Trump coalition.And so, some of the people that he's talking to aren't the sort of moderates, the middle, all that kind of stuff. They're sort of the radicalized, very online people that have been moving over anyway. I think this is all weird strategy. At the end of the day, every pollster you talk to, who's honest about this stuff, says that this is going to boil down to what they increasingly call the double haters, people who dislike both of them. And while Biden is not reassuring for a lot of people, and a lot of people don't like him for legitimate reasons. When you compare Trump's approach, which is to make fun of Biden stuttering and to be your childhood stuttering, and to be a jerk about it, that feels to me like it pushes a more doubleheaders away than it attracts.

This is one of these very small examples that actually can lead to bigger problems of the sort of cognitive age issue, is that if you don't have this -- that immediate recall that like Bill Clinton had in terms of his incredibly good retail politics skills, you don't connect those dots. And you just sort of go with the little bombs that reporters put in interviews that you don't pick up on and you run with. And I think that's sort of a problem.He had a similar problem when he used the word illegal in the State of the Union Address, because he just -- he forgot the connections that that has with members of his base. His larger problem is, I think that he thinks, and we saw this in the State of the Union, he thinks his political problems can be summed up with his problems with the most passionate parts of his base. And I just don't think that's true. You look at John Fetterman, who's more left wing on a lot of economic issues than Joe Biden. He's been throwing haymakers at the sort of pro-Palestinian left. And he's way more popular than Joe Biden is, according to polls. I think that Biden is being told by people in his cocoon that all of his problems will be solved if he could just convince all of the people on this very hardcore left wing base to his to like him again.

These are people who may have been at UC Davis Medical Centers Emergency Department the afternoon of Tuesday, March 5th. And if someone was unvaccinated, they were exposed to the virus, they could develop symptoms within a window of 7 to 21 days. These are symptoms like fever, sore throat, dry, cough, runny nose, but most importantly, that signature measles rash. That's what you have to look out for.And the reason why health officials are so concerned about this, the measles virus, it's very contagious. If an infected person coughs or sneezes, the virus can linger in the air for up to two hours. And if someone is unvaccinated, and they're exposed, 90% of the time they will get sick. But we know that if you've been vaccinated, the vaccine is 97% effective, so vaccinated people there's no need to panic here. But the reason why health officials are also watching this closely, this one case in Sacramento is one of 45 total across the country so far this year. Many of these cases are either travel-related or they're in pockets of communities that are unvaccinated. But last year, they were total 58 It's just the month of March, John, and we're at 45. So this is something health officials are watching very closely.",

DEBBIE DINGELL (D-MI): Well, good morning. It's good to be with you. Look, this bill is really difficult and tough. I didn't know how I was going to vote on Thursday until almost the minute that I did vote, quite frankly. There are two different issues here. Freedom of speech matter, but let's be very clear, no one in that room that voted for that bill was voting to ban TikTok. What they were voting to do is to separate TikTok from the People's Republic of China, which is controlling that data and using it in ways that could be dangerous to the national security of the United States, nor do people understand how they're controlling the algorithms (ph). We've had classified briefings, I thought long and hard, and quite frankly what TikTok did on Thursday, flooding my office and other offices with calls with kids who didn't know why they were calling us, shows the kind of control that they have. I want TikTok to continue. I don't want the People's Republic of China controlling the data, the access to the data, and manipulating the data that they are doing.
