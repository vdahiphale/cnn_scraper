The court's decision is a momentary win for the Biden administration, which had issued court filings, saying the lower courts were countermanding the FDA's scientific judgment. SEN.

SCHMIDT (voice-over):  A federal appeals court has already scheduled oral arguments for mid-May. There's a chance the case could ultimately come back to the Supreme Court.

But it's still a bit lukewarm ahead of his possible announcement in the coming week.Take a look at this poll from AP International Opinion Research Center released Friday. It shows a broad majority of Democrats say that, if Biden does win the Democratic nomination, they will support him, with only 19 percent saying they wouldn't support him. But this polling shows a close split from Democrats and independents, who lean toward the party on whether Biden should run, with 47 percent saying they'd like to see him do it and 52 percent saying they wouldn't. That's a 10 point improvement for Biden since January polling. Now on the Republican side of the race, former president Donald Trump has been campaigning in his home state of Florida, repeating a series of false claims about the 2020 election and taking veiled swipes at his presumed top rival for the nomination. He spoke at the Lee County GOP's Lincoln Reagan dinner yesterday, taking credit for Ron DeSantis winning the governor's race. Here he is.

CNN was the first to report last summer that the investigation was intensifying and that it had narrowed down to just a few charges, including some potential tax crimes and at least one charge of false statements related to the purchase of a gun. Now nothing has happened, though. Since last year in the recent months, we've also seen Hunter Biden's legal team become a lot more aggressive and forward leaning in their strategy, also becoming a lot more litigious. Now they're about to have another legal, potentially political problem as well on Capitol Hill, now that a potential whistleblower has come forward, writing to lawmakers, saying that he is an IRS agent who has overseen part of the Biden probe. This individual alleges that he has evidence that this has been mishandled, that there has been political interference and even alleges that this individual has evidence that would contradict testimony by attorney general Merrick Garland, who has vowed that there would not be any political interference in this investigation. But at this point, it is important to note this individual has not been granted whistleblower protections. This individual also has not presented any evidence to support these alleged -- these allegations against Biden. So it's unclear exactly what will come of that. But we'll continue to watch what comes of this potential whistleblower testimony and what, if anything, it means for the criminal case -- Paula Reid, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

I'm Kim Brunhuber and this is CNN NEWSROOM.Want to get back to our lead story this hour. In a striking victory for the Biden administration and abortion rights supporters across the United States, the Supreme Court has moved to protect access to a commonly used abortion drug, at least for now. Now the court didn't explain why it granted the request to intervene in a lower court ruling that suspended government approval of mifepristone. The drug has been used by millions of women over the past two decades it's been on the market. Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito publicly dissented while the votes of the other justices weren't made public. Doctors who provide abortion medication to their patients have been reacting to the ruling. CNN senior medical correspondent Elizabeth Cohen explains why mifepristone is so important. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ELIZABETH COHEN, CNN SR. MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  Obstetricians and gynecologists are breathing a sigh of relief after the Supreme Court decision Friday night. That decision allows them, in states that allow abortions, to keep using mifepristone. Now mifepristone is one of two different drugs that are used to treat women who are having abortions or miscarriages. If mifepristone had been taken off the market across the United States, that means that doctors in states that allow abortions would have only been using misoprostol. That's the second drug. Now misoprostol can be used on its own for miscarriages and abortions but studies show that it doesn't work as well. It's not as effective and there can be more complications and more side effects. And so doctors I've been talking to over the past two weeks have said, look, why should I be giving my patients a treatment that we know isn't as good? I want to give my patients the best treatments that they can get. So again a sigh of relief. But this is only for a certain period of time. Things could change in the future as this case winds its way through the courts. Back to you. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

When it comes to specific bans on abortion, like the six week ban Florida governor Ron DeSantis signed into law last week, or restrictions on medications like mifepristone, opinion is more split. Polling shows Americans are overwhelmingly opposed to banning the abortion pill, with 70 percent of all Americans against it; 61 percent of those surveyed are against Florida's six week abortion ban.

There's going to be heat waves. We're going to have coastal flooding because the oceans are rising. The oceans are rising for the same reason if you put your thumb on a thermometer, that mercury or that red alcohol will go up. If you warm the ocean, it gets bigger. So it also goes up. The thermal expansion, very heavy rainfall and, of course, the droughts that come and go. If it rains, it rains. And if it doesn't, it doesn't.
