So, tomorrow, what he has to do is he has to ensure he only loses one Republican vote. And right now, we already know of one Republican, Representative Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who said he is going to be voting for someone else. He's not even going to be voting present, which could help the math for Johnson. Instead, he's going to be voting against Johnson.So, assuming full attendance, Johnson cannot lose any additional votes tomorrow. Obviously, he's been working these members, he's been having phone calls, he's going to continue trying to get the support that he needs to get the speaker's gavel, but people are starting to entertain the idea that this may take a couple of rounds. And just remember, it took Kevin McCarthy 15 rounds to get that job.",

Look, the people that are contemplating voting against Speaker Johnson, if they had another candidate that could get 218 votes, that would be one thing. They don't. Speaker Johnson, as President Trump noted, he's well liked, he's well respected, he can -- I think he's probably the only one that can get the 218 votes.

I mean, you know, there, there are lots of various distinctions here. I mean, he had an ISIS flag, that doesn't necessarily mean it was directed by ISIS. He could have just been someone who -- because of he had fallen, you know, into hard times and had all sorts of issues going on in his life, found ISIS to be something that inspired him. I mean, there's just a lot of different ways this could go.D'AMICO:  I think so. I think you're probably going to look at a cross between some mental health issues and this, quote, \"inspiration.\" Because he talked about like gathering his family and killing them and then decided to do this ISIS attack, which isn't really a normal path. You see something else on some of these. But I think the one common between the two is the Turo app. I think that the FBI needs to go back and start looking at these chat groups to find out did ISIS did any of their chat groups or their discussions talk about using that as a way to rent the vehicle with less scrutiny than some of the regular rental car companies? And if they did, then looking at, were these two people on some of those chats that we're discussing Turo, because again, that coincidence is not -- should not be taken lightly. It could be something that they talked about. And then, I think they -- if they find it, then they can tie it back and see if these guys were in there looking at, again, laptops and phones, their history on their internets and then some of their chat groups.",

And it does suggest, as you were saying a few moments ago, that maybe there's a vulnerability there with that particular way of renting vehicles that sort of flies under the radar.D'AMICO:  Absolutely. You may not need like -- you know, to rent a regular vehicle, you need the credit card, you need other things, their driver's license in there. And this app may like prevent some of that. And same thing with like an Airbnb compared to the hotel, there's probably less scrutiny. And maybe that some of these chat groups discussed that saying, hey, if I do it, I would use this to get the vehicle because I don't have to give him a driver's license or I can give him a fake driver's license and they're not checking it. So, I think that there's some vulnerability in there. And, again, looking at their social media and other things, did they discuss that in any of these chat groups and then bring it back to the larger thing where the Intelligence Community is looking at this and say, hey, was this ever mentioned going out to all your sources? You know, the Bureau and the CIA had tons of sources into there and say, hey, do you guys remember any chats discussing this using this app or any of these plans type of thing? And again, I think that's going to lead down several paths. It may take a little while, but I do think there's a general connection between these, and it could be a triggering event that happened in Germany or a discussion that was going online that caused them to do this. It may be coincidence they did it at the same time, because I don't think the timelines lined up where New Orleans happened and then, the gentleman out in Vegas said, oh, I'm going to do it now too, I don't think that lines up.

It is such a hard target. They're not going to look at that. What's going to end up happening is they push out this no vehicle sector wider, and then you're going to have a bunch of Uber drop offs outside of that sector because the Ubers won't be able to get there.
