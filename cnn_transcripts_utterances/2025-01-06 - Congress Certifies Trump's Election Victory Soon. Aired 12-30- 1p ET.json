That's the same area where he was reporting around this time four years ago. Donie, take us through that moment four years ago and contrast it with what you're seeing now. DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: Hey Jake, it was right about exactly right now actually this time four years ago that we made our way with Trump supporters who had marched down Pennsylvania Avenue here from the ellipse where Donald Trump was speaking at the time by the White House and came down here to this intersection on Third Street and Pennsylvania Avenue. These gates were not here. This barrier was not here. In fact, the supporters that we were walking along with made their way to what is ironically given what happened called the Peace Monument. And that is where the Trump supporters, which turned into a violent mob, first pushed over the barricades that had been set up by police. By the way, the barricades at that point were nothing at all like this. They were those sort of small barriers that come up to your waist that you'd see at a football game or a concert. And it was in that moment when we heard the gates crashing and we saw people moving on to the lawn, that we knew something bad was happening and something terrible might occur. And, of course, the rest is history. As for today, very different scene here, much bigger security presence. Obviously, there is a -- the Capitol is a fortress today. And in terms of the history, in terms of our understanding of what happened that day, you know, for a year or two, for a year, some time after the Capitol attack, people, you know, were somewhat sorry about it. But today, we're going to see demonstrators, January 6 supporters actually marching around the Capitol. We're not sure how big a crowd calling for pardons for many of the convicted. And also not too far from here, MAGA influencers, some of the people more on the extreme end of the spectrum are holding an event calling for those pardons as well, which they're expecting to happen.",

On January 6, 2021, he was trapped with other House members and aides and some police officers inside the chamber as rioters broke in. You see a now famous, unfortunately famous photo of Congressman Crow then, who was a former Army, Retired Army Ranger, trying to help his colleagues as they took cover as the rioters, the insurrectionists were breaking into the House chamber. Thank you so much for being here. I just want to get your thoughts today as you prepare to certify Donald Trump as president again. How that feels given what happened in the photo that we just showed four years ago? REP. JASON CROW (D), COLORADO: There's a lot going through my mind. It's a somber day. This always will be a somber day for me and for a lot of my colleagues and for the police officers and others who went through the trauma of that day. First and foremost, my thought is with the police officers, both with the Metro police officers and the U.S. Capitol police officers, over 140 of whom were brutally beaten, brutally beaten. I mean, we get really close to those officers here. We see them every day. They're at our checkpoints. We get to know them, their stories, their families. And to see many of them who have had to leave service, who are permanently disabled, who have trauma, several of whom took their own lives because of the post- traumatic stress, and to see where we are now, people trying to rewrite the history of that day, to see Donald Trump on the verge of entering office again is certainly tough.",

You know, that's not a normal human experience for folks. So, it always will be with you. And that's why making sure that we tell the story of what happened, that we don't allow history to be rewritten for political purposes is really important for them and for their families. And why we also make sure we stand by and we keep faith with them, that we make sure they have the health care, that we have the mental health support services for them and their families that they deserve and they have earned is also important.",

In America, we settle our political differences at the ballot box, not by violence. We will set that standard. We will maintain that standard. And I don't like the results of that, which means we have to go back. We have to do a better job of making the case. We have to do a better job of earning people's support and keeping their support. And that's what we're going to do. But we are not going to cheat. We are not going to distort reality. We are not going to resort to things like, you know, stop the steal. Those are theories not grounded in reality. And they undermine the basis of our Constitution. And we are not going to do it.

Vice President Al Gore overseeing the certification of his own defeat in the 2000 presidential election after the U.S. Supreme Court determined that George W. Bush was the winner following the ill-fated Florida recount.Today, Vice President Kamala Harris finds herself in a similarly uncomfortable position. CNN's MJ Lee is at the White House for us.

And I'm told, you know, it's never been a question in the Vice President's mind whether she was going to oversee Congress certifying Donald Trump's victory and, of course, her loss.But there have been questions being asked around Washington, D.C., some people wondering, is she, in fact, really going to do this? As some people have fought back on the events of the last four years, the insurrection and Donald Trump refusing to accept the results of the previous election. And I'm told by one senior Harris adviser that the Vice President has almost been a little bit aghast to hear that those questions are even being asked, that she definitely sees this as an important duty and an obligation that she has as, vice president, to see this day through. Now, even still, as you noted, Jake, today is going to be sort of a painfully stark reminder for the Vice President that she lost, and she lost decisively to Donald Trump. There are folks around her who say, look, she does seem determined to be focused on finishing out the business of being vice president. But there's no question that there are some less pleasant things that she has to finish out, like today, like sitting through inauguration. I ask for just the questions about her future. Those conversations, I'm told, have begun, but that she is certainly in no rush to come to any decision about what's next. That thinking and those deliberations will really begin in earnest, I'm told, after January 20th, Jake.",

And as MJ said, you know, for her, it was never a question of whether or not she was going to go and preside over the certification. But the moment in and of itself after the election and how she did talk about, not as much as Biden did in his race, but obviously, how she did talk about January 6th and democracy and what she believed was on the line here. I was just thinking of this as, you know, Trump just posted a few moments ago saying that Biden is doing everything possible to make the transition as difficult as possible. And he's referencing executive orders that Biden is doing in his last few days, which Trump did as well when he was in office and the court cases against him, which are obviously not President Biden's doing.

I mean, those are all things that President Biden and Vice President Harris have not done.They've not sown doubt about the election. They instead have accepted the results and said, you know, this is how it's going to be. I mean, Biden obviously hosted President-elect Trump inside the Oval Office. And so I just think it speaks to the moment that Trump is being afforded that obviously he did not afford to them. TAPPER: So, and just to underline that point, in 2004, there were all sorts of conspiracy theories on the left led by Robert Kennedy Jr., for one, that Ohio had been stolen. And against my better judgment, I went onto a progressive social media site last night, and they're out there about this election, too, that this was a hacked election. I mean, the difference is, of course, that Kamala Harris is not leading the charge in pushing forward these deranged conspiracy theories.",

We're only going to see her once or twice in big roles again before she's gone, right, before the Trump team comes into Washington and she leaves. What next for Kamala Harris? If you talk to people in this town, they all -- most Democrats say, oh, you know, go away. If you want to run for California, governor, fine. Please don't run for president again. I would remind you, and you made the point earlier, on this day four years ago, everyone said Donald Trump was done. So discount her as a potential nominee four years from now, or at least a player in that at your peril. She just won 75 million votes. She just got 48.4 percent of the vote in the country. She just raised $1 billion. She's a black woman, popular with the foundational base of the Democratic Party, which is black women. She has giant problems. She has giant problems. She did not learn to speak to working class Americans about their cost of living and about their disaffection with this town. She's viewed by many as a, quote, unquote, \"coastal elite\". She has a lot of problems. Donald Trump had more when he left this town four years ago. The question I always have about politicians, do they learn from their mistakes and their environment? She did not lose all because of her mistakes. She made some. She also had 100 plus days to do something that normally people spend four or five, six, 10 years preparing for.",

They took the boxes because he realized, had the, you know, the marauders who took over the Senate floor made the decision to open those boxes and tear up those ballots. There was no provision at that point in the Constitution to allow any counting of votes if it wasn't the original ballots. I mean, the Constitution and the Electoral Count Act doesn't allow you to look and say, well, the New York Times said that, you know, Biden won New York, so we'll just count that. So it could have been a constitutional crisis. But, you know, today is a good day. My hope is January 6th from here out, we'll remember what happened four years ago as a bad point in history, but that we can move on. That'll be up to Donald Trump.

But I think it's a reminder of kind of the political moment that I think all polling shows that most Americans thought that was a bad day, it wasn't a good day, it was perhaps un-American, but that there were issues that just weighed higher on American voters' minds. And as somebody who this was a deal breaker for me, I spoke out against it, I testified to the committee and the Department of Justice. It is a fact that more Americans were voting on the cost of living, on border security, and on issues that just deeply affected them personally, not this sort of nebulous idea of democracy.",
