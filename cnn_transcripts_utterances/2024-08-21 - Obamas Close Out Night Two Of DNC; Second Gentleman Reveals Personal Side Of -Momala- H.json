It was sort of true. It took her leg two thirds, three quarters of the speech to warm up and get the crowd where she had been the room was completely mesmerized by her.

I think it's amazing, but she's out here. It's so inspiring. And also people I think reacted to her speech the way they did because she's not out there all the time. She's not out there talking all the time and she's not in the forefront of the party. And so I think it's just inspiring when people see her out there and she was -- it was probably the best speech I've ever seen her give. It was incredible. And I also, you know, obviously, Obama gives amazing speeches all the time while, but I think that the way they're doing it and kind of digging under his skin is really going to get a visceral reaction from him.

She has raised these children with their blended family. A lot of people can relate to that in the U.S. But I also think the one thing I thought was interesting about Doug, you -- you as the second or the first lady or the second spouse, you have a role in your volunteer position, but people expect you to have a profile and its interesting to see him take more of a center stage out there because it'll be interesting to see if they are elected, what he will do with that position, and what his platform, too.

And I think that was part of the point also. HUNT:  Yeah, Shelby, I mean, the reality is this is a pretty -- I mean, this would be if -- if she gets elected really obviously unique reality, we'd have the first, first gentlemen and while obviously Hillary Clinton was nominated in 2016, her husband occupies a much different and particular space in the Democratic Party as a former president, it wasn't the same kind of vibe, I guess, a word that seems to be getting a lot of use this election, as what we saw last night.",

More of the same today and it only gets warmer from here in Dallas, edging towards a hunter greaves by the start of the weekend, you factor in the humidity downright unbearable. We're looking for a cooler than average forecast, but it's not going to be anytime soon. Above average weather moves to the eastern seaboard, the next six to ten days calls for a warming trend over the eastern half of the country. So enjoy the cool weather while it can.
