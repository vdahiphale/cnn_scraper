Hamas says strikes against Israel, quote, \"will continue\" after an incident in southern Gaza left eight soldiers dead, making it one of the single deadliest events involving Israeli troops since the October 7th attack. Now, earlier, the militant wing of Hamas claims it carried out a quote \"complex ambush\" against enemy vehicles. But Israel has not said whether Hamas was responsible for the incident. Meanwhile, Rafah's civil defense says there has been new airstrikes and artillery shelling by Israeli forces in the area since dawn. CNN's Oren Liebermann is in Haifa for us now. Oren, the IDF just released some preliminary findings from their investigation. What are they saying at this point?",

Now it's unclear if that was a bomb affixed to the vehicle itself, an armored vehicle, or if it was some sort of missile or projectile strike. They say the vehicle itself, which was part of a combat engineering unit, had explosives on it as well. But those explosive which were part of the engineering role, were not supposed to explode, they're supposed to be resistant to that. And they say it seems it may have been detonated in some way by that explosion. Regardless, whatever happened there, which is still under investigation, it led to a significant in their words, \"explosion\" that killed eight soldiers there. They say the explosion was large enough that it has been difficult to go in, figure out what happened and locate the remains at this point. Again, remains under investigation. Meanwhile, the al Qassam Brigade, the military wing of Hamas, said they laid effectively a complex trap. First, they say they targeted a military bulldozer and when the escape or rescue or extraction unit came in in an armored personnel carrier, they say they targeted that vehicle with a missile strike. They promised such strikes would continue. Now as you point out, the Rafahs civil defense said there were increasing artillery and air defense strikes in the Tal al-Sultan neighborhood since dawn today. It's possible this is all describing the exact same unit here or the same incident as we learn more about what happened. And we will certainly keep you updated on those updates as we get them from the IDF, Omar.",

They certainly took a break at the start of the war, but they have very much come back in force.Tens of thousands of people came out in Tel Aviv. Protesters calling on new elections, calling essentially for the end of this government led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with his far-right coalition partners and for an ability to change the government, a government that has stunningly low popularity ratings throughout the country and stunningly low leadership marks for Netanyahu himself. Worth noting, it's not just in Tel Aviv, but in Jerusalem and other places as well. But as you can see from the video there, it is Tel Aviv where these protests are focused. We have seen some videos and images there of bonfires started. We have seen a major police response to the protests there. But it is not just the numbers we are seeing. It is how consistent this has been and how consistent this will likely be. We saw them even last Saturday just hours after the country had learned of a hostage rescue that had saved four Israeli hostages in Gaza. That of course, was celebrated but in the hours afterwards, there were once again protests against the government, calling for new elections here. How do you get from where we are now to new elections to the government collapsing? That in and of itself is a very difficult question. It's not easy to see a way how that happens. And yet you can feel the frustration and the anger of these protesters in calling for those elections as soon as possible.",

I think it points up Omar and thanks for having me both a headline and the trend lines for Israelis in Gaza. And it looks pretty grim.I mean, next month is nine months of this war. The Israelis has devastated Hamas' organized military -- military capacity. 24 battalions remaining, four battalions in Rafah. But I think what this demonstrates is that Hamas will be left with a significant capacity perhaps not to govern Gaza, but to mountain insurgency. And the Israelis can clear these areas. But they can't hold them and they don't want to build. David Petraeus is famous strategy for Iraq to clear, to hold and to build. The Israelis usually can clear, but when they clear and when they vacate, Hamas using tunnels, and three-dimensional attacks on the Israelis can appear. And then disappear. So again, this is increasingly fraught. 21 Israelis were killed in January. This is the deadliest strike since then.",

And the only way to predictably distribute aid not getting into Gaza is the problem. It's getting it in and getting distributed. You've got criminal gangs, you've got Hamas diversion and you have Israeli military activity. It's virtually impossible to imagine a predictable, reliable surging of humanitarian assistance when large parts of Gaza are still a free fire zone.

Security Council resolution. Never before has an Israeli peace plan ended up with a positive voted of 14 to nothing with one abstention, the Russians. Well, Mr. Netanyahu's presiding over the most extreme right-wing government in Israel. His main objective is to survive; on trial for bribery, fraud, and breach of trust in a (INAUDIBLE) district court now for three years running. He must remain in office otherwise he couldn't be convicted or be forced into a plea agreement, which would force him from politics. So in an anomalous position, he cannot win this war and he cannot lose it. And as a consequence of that, I think he is trying to buy time. And Omar, if Knesset goes into recess on July 25th, Netanyahu's due here on July 24 the address a joint session of congress. Knesset does not resume until two weeks I think before our elections. And I think it's pretty clear unless something emerges to shake his coalition that you're going to be dealing with Benjamin Netanyahu for better or for worse for a few more months to come to be sure.",

I mean, just today, Hezbollah claimed three drone-related attacks in northern Israel and the IDF says it struck a member of the terrorist group while riding a motorbike in southern Lebanon.

The kind of war we're talking about now is something that goes way beyond this. Hezbollah's high-trajectory weapons cover most of the country. They're precise. They're more lethal and the Israeli plan for preempting that and destroying Lebanese infrastructure and Hezbollah would wreak catastrophe on Lebanese. 18 years, Omar, and they've avoided a major escalation. I still believe that risk-aversion is going to prevail. But the reality is you can never tell. Middle East wars don't happen by accident, but should this one happen intentionally or the two parties stumble into a conflict, its going to dwarf what we see in Gaza. And you could, for the first time have something Middle East has never seen before. A regional war, which could involve Iran and the United States.",

Now President Biden will be on stage here at the Peacock Theatre right behind me with his former boss, former president Barack Obama. Jimmy Kimmel, as you mentioned, will be moderating that conversation. And then what the Biden campaign is looking to do is really tap into some of that celebrity star power. They have George Clooney and Julia Roberts headlining this event. But there are others who will also be part of the program, including Jason Bateman, Jack Black, and Sheryl Lee Ralph. All of this comes as the Biden campaign has really tried leaning into some of the celebrity support to try to engage voters in different ways, including when it comes to fundraising. Now, this event was modeled after that March fundraiser at Radio City Hall in New York City, where President Biden was accompanied by President Obama, as well as Bill Clinton. That event which was moderated by Stephen Colbert that brought in $26 million. So today -- today's fundraiser has already eclipsed that figure. It all comes as the Biden campaign is trying to maintain the cash advantage that they have had over former president Donald Trump throughout this race. Biden really has been leading Trump in fundraising, but recently since Trump has secured the Republican nomination, he has seen a boost in his numbers. So what the Biden campaign is trying to do is trying to make sure that they're not narrowing that gap between the two candidates. Of course, this will be a very expensive race, Biden campaign says that everything they are raising tonight, will go to opening offices, hiring more organizers. And importantly, getting their TV ads up on the air. All of this as they're preparing for this rematch against Trump heading into November, which is expected to potentially be one of the most expensive in U.S. history.",

This is pretty early in the year for something like that.We've got to heat dome that sets up that area of high pressure. That's just dry seasonal air and it kind of holds and traps that heat in. That's going to sit over the Central Plains as we go through the weekend. But does move into the Great Lakes, northeast New England as we go into the workweek. More than 360 temperature records could fall, both daytime highs and overnight lows. Because a lot of the overnight lows are going to sit up at 80 degrees, even in the middle of the night. So again, staying pretty hot. We have a new tool, this heat risk map, that shows us your risk for heat sickness. And it's extreme over parts of Iowa and Missouri as we go into Monday. Tuesday, you could see it up to the Great Lakes, places like Chicago. Wednesday we're getting in father into the east, in Ohio, Upstate New York, where we could find that some extreme heat conditions that could cause sickness. Temperatures in the 90s, middle 90s through Atlanta as we go through the next couple of days. Looks like St. Louis Sunday looking at a high of 98 degrees. Chicago going for 97 degrees by Monday. Just incredibly warm for Chicago. Their average this time of year is 81 degrees. So temperatures in the middle and upper 90s are well above average for this time of year. And look at the overnight temperatures. Only dropping to about 78 degrees. That's closer to the daytime high temperatures that you would see on average. So again, not really getting much relief at night. For anybody that doesn't have access to air conditioning, this can be very difficult when it comes to the signs and symptoms of heat sickness. Now we don't think of Chicago as a place that really experiences too much extreme heat. But their summers are getting warmer since 1970 by a degree and half as that season just becomes longer and more extreme. If you look at the numbers there, when you have a degree in half fever on the whole season, basically, what we're doing is we're adding about eight more warm summer days in Chicago since 1970. So we're getting elongated in the season and some of this heat is just more extreme than it used to be -- Omar?",
