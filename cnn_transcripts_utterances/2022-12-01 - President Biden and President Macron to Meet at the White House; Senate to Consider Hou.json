Climate, Ukraine and China, all on the menu with Emmanuel Macron.All aboard so far to stop the nationwide railroad strike. Next stop the Senate. Could it go off the rails from there? And a big clue about interest rates in America. The Fed chair confident he can stick the so-called soft landing and stave off a recession. Good morning and welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world. I'm Christine Romans. We begin with this high stakes meeting between President Biden and the French President Emmanuel Macron today at the White House. The president tweeting out this picture of the Bidens last night with France's first couple. Macron is the first foreign leader to be welcomed on a state visit during the Biden presidency. The Macrons will be officially welcomed to the White House ceremony this morning. The two presidents will then meet in the Oval Office. That will be followed by a joint news conference and they'll wind up the day with a lavish state dinner tonight. CNN's Jim Bittermann is live for us in Paris. Jim, what is Macron hoping to get out of this meeting?",

But there's also a lot of business here to take care of, especially what the French are concerned about and the Europeans about the inflation reduction aspects of the bill that was passed by the Congress and signed by the president.Some of those aspects, which are meant to help Americans out and to address some concerns about climate change, the French and the Europeans view as protectionist in detail, and in fact it was quite a blunt assessment of all this yesterday when President Macron was addressing a group of mainly French Washingtonians. Here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) EMMANUEL MACRON, FRENCH PRESIDENT (through translator): What has happened in recent months is a challenge for us because we are starting to have differences on energy issues. And the cost of the war is not the same in Europe and in the United States. But most importantly the choices that have been made for which I share the goals, in particular the Inflation Reduction Act or the CHIPS Act are choices that will split the West. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Online accounts, they must be vetted, uses real identifies, it must be verified along with users ID, mobile, social security number. On top of the government censorship already in place, all online platforms must dol their own censorship, which includes vetting and editing in real time. Basically it means that nothing can get online unless it has been signed off. Now the problem for authorities is the massive amount of manpower and resources that it will take to implement these even stricter guidelines. China already has the most sophisticated censorship apparatus anywhere in the world. And while it's hunted down and deleted countless social media posts this past week, plenty have slipped through the system that we've been, you know, watching and measuring. And that is due to the volume and scale of posts but also the savviness of the users who are aware of how to evade censors. And Christine, you know, this week's protests, they have certainly rattled the government hence we are now seeing an easing of COVID restrictions around the country. But even as authorities further tighten cyber censorship, you know, Chinese citizens, they will undoubtedly continue to find ways to voice their dissent.",
