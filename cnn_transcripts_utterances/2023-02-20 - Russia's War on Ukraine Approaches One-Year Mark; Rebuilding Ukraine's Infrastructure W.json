This as American officials warned that China could be on the brink of sending lethal aid to support Moscow's war. And rescue efforts winding down in Turkey two weeks after the devastating earthquake that left tens of thousands dead. But for many survivors, recovery feels further away than ever.",

Still, Mr. Zelenskyy emphasize that the more losses Russia suffers across the front lines, the sooner the war can end with a Ukrainian victory. It's a hope shared by residents of Vuhledar, who lived through the heavy fighting and describe the terror they felt during recent shelling. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): Scary is not the right word. It is really terrifying. When it all started. I couldn't get away from it at all. Can you imagine? (END VIDEO CLIP) HOLMES: Further to the south in the Kherson region, authorities say three civilians were killed five wounded including three children during Russian shelling there on Sunday. A mother and father were among those killed. Meantime, Ukraine's foreign ministry is accusing Russia of blocking the rotation of experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency to the Zaporizhzhian nuclear power plant, that plant currently occupied by Russian forces. U.S. President Joe Biden meanwhile, preparing to visit Poland to mark the one year anniversary of the war in Ukraine. And ahead of that two top Republicans in the House are urging him to boost military support for Ukraine, saying lawmakers on both sides of the aisle want to continue to fund the war. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MIKE MCCAUL, U.S. HOUSE REPUBLICAN: For the past year, we've been very slow at getting these weapons in, in the name of it being too provocative, whether it be stingers, javelins, these short-range artillery now longer-range artillery attack them, they can take out the Iranian drones and Crimea, and also aviation like F-16. If we put this stuff in from the very beginning of this conflict, a year from now may have been very different as we look at the anniversary on February 24. The longer they drag this out, they play into Putin's hands. He wants us to be a long-protracted war, because he knows that potentially, he'll lose, we can lose the will of the American people. And therefore the Congress will we're seeing the same dynamic and the European Parliament's strong support now, but they're worried that if this doesn't end with a resolution, you know sooner rather than later, this will be an issue for us.",

They're saying they need weapons urgently. They not -- it's not just about tanks, which are a tactical weapon. They want strategic weapons, they want jets, long range artillery missiles, and the ability to interdict, the ability of the Russians to continue to supply their large numbers of troops and material that they're pouring into this war.

Ukraine also has actually compared to many other war-torn countries, really, really strong fiduciary systems, especially in the Ministry of Finance and the budget, which is why the World Bank actually has mobilized over $18 billion that we are sending through Ukraine's budget. It's because we are relatively comfortable that those systems work. So there are these bases to build on.

North Korea has publicize that it wants a five-year military modernization plan that started just over two years ago. So there's still three years of that to go and they're ticking through that list, that wish list of what they want to be able to achieve. Just in January the beginning of this year, we heard from the leader himself, saying that he wants an exponential increase in the country's nuclear arsenal, highlighting the necessity of mass producing tactical nuclear weapons. And then shortly afterwards, we saw that military parade where there were at least 11 ICBMs being paraded through the streets and through Kim Sol-song square in Pyongyang. So really what North Korea is saying it will do when it comes to military and nuclear weaponry capability at this point. It is carrying out. It says that it will increase mass producing.

Now the revelation by the U.S. of course, really shows how increasingly frustrated American officials are with China on their role in this war despite Beijing's repeated pledge of, quote-unquote \"neutrality\". What has been happening in the past year, of course is the two sides, Russia and China have grown closer not only politically but especially economically with trade volumes soaring to a new high. And that, of course, is related to part of what Blinken was saying from day one. They were concerned about China helping Russia dodge severe western sanctions, even before the latest assessment came out. And this, of course, also comes on the heels of the whole spy balloon saga which means the fallout makes it even more challenging for China to be willing to work with the U.S. on this issue. Now interestingly, Wang Yi did meet with his Ukrainian counterpart in Munich, at least publicly saying how China still respects Ukraine sovereignty and territorial integrity. But the reality, of course, is that Chinese state media still refuses to call the Russian military campaign an invasion, not to mention Putin and Xi have talked in person and via phone multiple times in the past year but Xi has yet to pick up the phone to talk to Zelenskyy. So all of that is why analysts think despite the growing isolation of Russia on the global stage, Xi Jinping is very much sticking to Putin and the so-called no limits partnership. And that is why China's assertion is that it is the only peacemaker in this conflict just rings hollow to many people, Michael.",
