They've lost their homes. They can no longer go to school. They have no access to proper health care, they have no food, they have no water. It's just a horrendous, catastrophic situation. And I think this investigative piece kind of summarized the story very well of what's happening on the ground, with bombs blasting and killing innocent civilians.

There is no safe place in Gaza. There hasn't been a safe place in Gaza since this horrendous war started on October 7th. The idea that children can be protected anywhere with so much displacement, moving from one place to the other with no underground space to shelter is not realistic. So there is no safe place, that's the short answer. And unless there's a ceasefire, there won't be a safe place for children. And more children will die, more children will get injured. And the true cost of this war will be measured in children's lives and those who will be forever changed by it.",

But the election results also highlight some of their biggest political vulnerabilities. On the Democratic side, a coalition of Arab and Muslim Americans led a campaign, urging voters to choose the uncommitted option on their ballots instead of President Biden. And as you see, tens of thousands of them did just that. They're angry over his administration's handling of Israel's war in Gaza. Now on the Republican side, Trump notched a solid victory over rival Nikki Haley. But she still netted about a quarter of the votes. This may indicate there's still a sizable group of Republicans either firmly opposed to Trump or yet to be convinced that he's the right candidate.

The White House says U.S. President Joe Biden is at Walter Reed hospital for his annual physical. Video taken a short time ago shows him leaving the White House. The president is 81 years old and in the midst of a grueling campaign that would exhaust far younger candidates. Polls show Americans of all stripes have concerns about the president's age and whether he's up for another four years. Our chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, is with us. Great to see you, sir. Everyone focusing, I guess on the cognitive test, right, the outcomes and what that entails because age has come up so often, as we discuss who the next president will be. DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, I think that that's been the focus of a lot of attention. I think, when you think about these types of physical exams, they're pretty exhaustive. So we know, for example, last year, interestingly, he went to the Walter Reed right around the same time, about 09:15 in the morning last year; came back around noon. So gives you a 2-3 hours of exams. And looking at lab tests, heart and lung function, things like that, we know we'll find out what medications he's taking. We know, for example, he was on a statin medication for his cholesterol. He's been on blood thinners because he has a history of atrial fibrillation. There was a lot made of his change in gait or his change in walking. So the question was, what was driving that. And last year they said it was due to arthritis in his spine and some arthritis in his foot that was really causing this. So we will see if there's any updates but you're quite right. I think a lot of attention and questions about cognitive testing. Just to give you a little bit of context here, those cognitive tests are not typically done as part of the physical exam. In fact, about 16 percent roughly of seniors who go in for a physical exam will have some sort of cognitive testing. And it's usually because the doctors say, hey, look, there's some concern here, so we're going to order these tests. Former president Trump had this test done but it was at his own request a few years ago. And I think we have an example of what that test looks like, just to give you a little bit of frame of reference here. This is called the Montreal Cognitive Assessment:  matching numbers to letters, throwing a three-dimensional cube, identifying animals, memory tests, remembering five objects, for example, for several minutes. And it's a screening test, meaning that, if there's a concern based on the score, more tests would be done. It's not diagnostic. But again, there's no indication, to your point earlier, that he's going to have this test done. We're likely to get a written summary over the next several hours and we'll see. We'll see what it shows. We'll see how it compares to last year",

Fight for Alabama Families is holding a rally on the statehouse steps in Montgomery. A number of IVF families and advocates are expected to attend. As of right now, IVF treatments remain in limbo, as the state halted treatment in three fertility clinics. The Alabama Supreme Court this month ruled that frozen embryos are human beings and those who destroy them can be held liable for wrongful death. On Tuesday, Alabama Republicans introduced a bill that would provide protection to anyone who provides in vitro fertilization in the state. Democrats are also making moves to better define frozen embryos are not children. Isabel Rosales is standing by in Montgomery, Alabama. Great to see you.

And they're sharing how this has deeply impacted them and severely restricted their options in trying to pursue having a family. They're pushing on lawmakers to protect IVF. But we can anticipate today, with that senate bill that you were mentioning, senate Bill 159, is today at the Senate, the state senate health care committee will hold a public hearing to discuss that legislation, which offers criminal and civil protection to anyone who provides IVF. So again, this is a legal protection to IVF providers. It does not address when an embryo should be considered an unborn child. So the big question here today is whether they will take a vote on it. If they do and they vote in favor of it, it goes to the senate floor for then an overall bigger vote. I want to introduce right now, Gabbie Price.

There's also a suggestion on the part of Alexei Navalny's team that they struggled to find funeral parlors, a date to get Alexei Navalny's funeral organized. What they say is that, despite the team's attempts to get it for Thursday, which they'd hoped to organize both the farewell and the funeral on, because that is a day when Vladimir Putin addresses the Russian parliament, their allegation is that it was impossible to find anyone who might dig a grave. Instead, then it will be held on Friday, this funeral. Of course, one of the questions is, how many people inside the country will have the courage to attend, to pay their respects, to show their support for the late opposition leader? And I think the significance of what we heard today was both the content and the form it was. There she was, Yulia Navalnaya, once again, as she had when she released that nine-minute video messaging, looking, sounding like an opposition leader or someone who's willing to step into the breach.
