What I do actually find really interesting, Jim, is that you're seeing Vance go to the exact same cities that both Harris and Walz are, and that is by design. Yesterday, he was in Philly, just four miles from where Harris and Walz, you know, introduced Walz to America, to the crowd. Today, he's starting in Michigan and then going to Eau Claire, Wisconsin, the same city where we're going to see Harris and Walz today.But, look, We're going to hear from Vance is he's going to point out that they're both from, you know, more Midwestern towns, middle America, they're both veterans. And then he's going to say that is where the similarities stop. You heard him say that last night in Philly. And then he's going to go very hard after Walz, his record. And part of this is exactly kind of what you laid out at the top, which is they're trying to paint Walz as a radical liberal, someone who is more liberal than both Harris and Biden can be a little bit tough to do. Remember, when Walz was in Congress for 12 years, he was actually widely seen as more of a moderate Democrat. He voted with Republicans on a number of things, on strengthening the border, on lowering deficit deficits. He was backed by the NRA, which later pulled their support once he became governor, but that is their plan. And part of this is that, look, over the last couple of weeks, ever since Biden ended his campaign, we've talked about this, there's no question that they've struggled to define Harris. Now, they see an opportunity with Walz and being her running mate, that they can try to define them together. And we did hear both Vance and Donald Trump kind of make that point in comments over the last 24 hours. Take a listen to what they said.",

But at the end of the day, my conversations with Trump's team is that they actually -- and Trump himself actually doesn't want to debate. He thinks it's an obligation. He thinks it will provide some sort of good contrast.

And he's a relatable figure for so many people in states like Wisconsin.When you see the picture of him ice fishing, you think, oh, I know that guy. And then you hear him talk and you think, oh I definitely know that guy. Maybe he's my dad. Maybe he's my neighbor. Maybe he's my favorite teacher from high school. He's somebody who, you know and I think that's a really connects and understands that whether you live in a town of 400, like the town that he was born in, or in a city or a suburb or, you know, a rural area. This is someone who actually cares about other people, which is really different from what you get from Trump and from Vance. The Harris-Walz ticket is a ticket that believes in lifting everyone up, making sure everyone's free to live their own lives, not subject to control and to making sure we have an opportunity where everyone can get ahead.

Earlier this morning on Fox, he was saying, well, if they come into office, it's going to be like communism immediately. I think he used words along those lines. But there was a Truth Social post that he put up yesterday where he was almost sort of daydreaming out loud that somehow Joe Biden is going to get back into this race.

So, you don't have things like what we saw in Wisconsin, 451 days where every abortion clinic stopped providing services after the Dobbs decision. They're talking about signing voting rights legislation into law, which must be terrifying for Trump, who's constantly pushing these lies about voter fraud in order to justify voter suppression.They're making the case for unions and for workers. And all of that kind of just moves the spotlight away from Trump's fantasies about what he thinks everyone should be talking about. There's this kind of energy from the Trump-Vance campaign about wanting to control people's personal lives that I don't think the country really has time for. And I think it's got to be tough for them not to hear it. We see on our end, people coming to wisdoms.org and signing up to volunteer and to donate these huge responses to the rallies and first in West Allis, Wisconsin, now here in Eau Claire. There's so many people who want to be involved. And I think the Harris campaign, by making moves day after day, by having this amazing process with the vice presidential pick and then this national tour and then the convention next week, it's really bringing the country's attention to an opportunity to close the book on the Trump era and move towards a brighter future where people can get back to living their lives and not having to worry about what Trump's going to do to them if he gets back into power.",

What -- do we know about these suspected Iranian agents or other terrorists and their leverage? And do you think they're preparing an October 7th-style attack in the U.S.?

We did not have a war in the Middle East and a war in Europe and war threatening to break out in East Asia. President Trump was the candidate of peace and prosperity. He delivered peace all over the world. He would do it again if he was president of the United States.Now, what's going on in Israel, again, highlights Kamala Harris administration. Kamala Harris is a person who says she wants the war in Israel to be over with and also that she wants to minimize civilian casualties. Well, I want those things too. Then why isn't she giving Israel the weapons it needs to minimize civilian casualties? And why isn't she giving Israel the weapons it needs to end this conflict quickly? The best thing for the United States of America is for Israel to end its war, to destroy Hamas and then to rebuild the Abraham Accords of President Trump so that the Sunni Arab states and the Israelis can form a regional counterbalance to Iran. That is what is the best interest of our country, that's what's in the best interest of Israel, and it's telling that Kamala Harris refuses to do what she needs to do to keep America and its allies safe. And the final point that I'd say is, yes, I believe that there are Iranian-backed militia groups in this country right now because we know thousands of people have come across the U.S. southern border who have ties to terrorism. Well, it really endangers our country and I fear we're going to have a very bad headline here and a lot of people who could lose their lives because Kamala Harris refuses to keep terrorists out of our country. It's disgraceful, but it highlights the fact that unless you have a border, there is no peace and there is no security for American citizens, even in a place as far north as Shelby Township, Michigan.

He said it after I was the pick, and I think he's absolutely right.Now, I will say that on the vice presidential issue, it's interesting what Tim Walz says about Kamala Harris. Tim Walz is a person, again, who promoted rioters burning down the biggest city in his state. This is a guy who wants to give driver's licenses to illegal aliens. This is a guy who wants to take children away from their parents if those parents don't consent to sex changes for minors. This is a radical human being who comes from the far left wing of the Democrat Party. And what Kamala Harris is telling all of us by selecting Tim Walz is that she bends the knee to the far left of the Democrat Party. She's done it every single time in government. She's done it in who she selected as her V.P. nominee, and she will do it if the American people give her a promotion to president of the United States. We don't have to guess at what Kamala Harris believes. The fact that she keeps on leaning on the most far left people in the Democrat Party tells us exactly who she is and what she stands for. Sir.
