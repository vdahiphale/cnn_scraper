Give us an update on how things are right now, and which areas specifically are you most concerned about? SHERIFF TINA NIETO, MONTEREY COUNTY, CALIFORNIABoris and Amara. I can tell you that we have been watching the storms since December 26th. That's a long time. That's over two weeks. And we are concerned about it because it's a slow-moving event. Unlike wildfires, when rivers are cresting, we are watching the crests, right now we are watching them in the Spreckels area. We're talking about the Salinas River. This is John Steinbeck's river. And it moves slowly, but like John Steinbeck said, it can be a dangerous river. And, unfortunately, to get to the Monterey peninsula, we only have like three ways to get in, and these are all areas that could be overcome by flooding, depending on mother nature and the amount of rain that she dumps on us. And I've got to tell you, I'm listening to the rain right now, and it does concern me a little bit. But I'm optimistically hoping that she slows down.",

Right now, the heaviest rain is across portions of north and central California. We've got some pretty heavy bands north and right along that area near Sacramento.One thing to note is we have all this rain incoming in the next 24 to 48 hours. So you have got more than 25 million people under flood watches. The thing is, it's not just about the new rain that's coming. Just like the sheriff mentioned, the ground is completely saturated in so many spots. And so it's a combination of the two that's really leading to the big flood concerns. For example, if you just look at the last two to three weeks, a lot of these areas, Reno, Sacramento, San Francisco, and Santa Barbara, have all had roughly six months of rain in just those two to three weeks. So again, it's a lot of rain, but also in a very short period of time, and now we are adding more rain and snow on top of it. Here is a look going forward. You'll notice as we go through the day the bulk of the rain, which is right now is located in northern and central California, begins to spread into southern California, also into Nevada as well as Arizona. Then we get a teeny little break early Sunday before the next round arrives Sunday afternoon and evening, and this will likely continue into Monday as well, bringing additional rain and additional snow on top of it. In addition to those things, you also have winds. Most of these areas you see here in orange under the wind advisory, you are talking wind gusts up around 50 miles per hour. But once you start getting up in the higher elevations, now you are talking wind gusts of 60, 70, even 80 miles per hour. So that's likely going to lead to some additional power outages and also the potential for some trees coming down. Overall, most of these areas in terms of rainfall, you are talking about two to four inches. Snowfall, three to six feet in the Sierras up through Monday, which is why you have the winter storm warnings. But again, Boris and Amara, the good news here, we will finally see things dry out by the end of next week.",

And oftentimes, people in this city don't pay too much attention to the air raid sirens because they are a common occurrence. And especially over the last two weeks or so, there has not been any incoming. But this one was different. The authorities quickly warned people that there was incoming fire reported from the southern part of the country, and then quickly we started getting word of things actually landing in various areas.So here in Kyiv, people went just inside of this metro station here to take shelter. There were hundreds of people down there with us taking shelter, deep, deep under the ground. Ordinary people, many with their children, elderly people as well. This has been a common occurrence for people. They have gotten pretty comfortable with living underground for hours on end. And that is what we saw today. We have gotten reports of critical infrastructure has been damaged in the Lviv region in the far west part of the country, also in the central city of Dnipro. A residential apartment building was, from the picture we are seeing so far, very badly damaged. Officials say that 10 people were injured, two of them were children, and 15 actually had to be rescued from some of the debris, some of the rubble of that building. We have also gotten word from the Kherson region in the northeastern part of Ukraine where officials say that there were two strikes on critical infrastructure as well, and so potentially there may be power cuts, emergency power cuts there as well. And that is the big concern when the Russians have gone after this kind of energy infrastructure is the ability for the system to actually function given the power needs for a country that is in the middle of winter where it is quite cold. One other thing to quickly mention, Boris and Amara, is that there was some strikes that actually hit the Kyiv region earlier today. Those explosions woke me up. They were very clearly heard from the city center, and the sirens, the air raid alerts only went off after those actually came down.

The attorney general had outlined that they had found those -- or that they were notified of those documents discovered at the residence December 20th with another item being found just earlier this week. In addition to the documents at the residence, CNN has previously reported that there were 10 documents with the markings of classified found at the office down here in Washington, D.C., that Biden used after he had left the vice presidency. Included in those 10 classified documents were intelligence memos and briefing memos relighting to Ukraine, Iran, and the United Kingdom.

This was all discovered back on November 2nd when the president's private lawyers were searching that Penn Biden Center office, and certainly there are so many more questions about how exactly these documents got to those places. But now we have that new reporting that there is about approximately 20 classified documents that were found between the office as well as the president's residence up in Delaware.",

Joining us now is former federal prosecutor Renato Mariotti, and CNN political analyst Laura Barron Lopez, White House correspondent for PBS. Welcome to you both, and good morning. Renato, I'm going to start with you. There are two special counsels at the same time investigating a former and now a sitting president over the same issue, the handling of classified documents. But we should clarify, these are two very different investigations, right?",

      "sentences": "Got it. So, from legal we love to talk politics, and of course the political exposure is huge, right? And, obviously, this is creating an opening for Republicans for quite a controversial showdown. How would you describe, Laura, President Biden's, I guess, handling of -- especially the drip, drip of disclosures. First it was Monday, the first batch that we heard about classified documents, and then days later it was a second batch, albeit a much smaller number of documents, 20 or so versus more than 300 that were seized in Mar-a- Lago.LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: President Biden addressed this actually one of the first days that it was revealed that there was that first batch of documents. He said that he was surprised that he had those documents at the Washington office, and that he was told not to ask what was in them by his lawyers and wasn't aware of what was potentially in them. So we know that he is getting a lot of advice from his legal counsel right now, his Special Counsel Richard Sauber who was brought over from the Veterans Affairs Department in the lead up to this new Congress because, you mentioned, Amara, that Republicans maybe have in new opening. I would argue they didn't need an opening because they were going to investigate President Biden regardless, whether it was about classified documents or about his son Hunter Biden or about other dealings with his administration. So much of the investigations in these select committees that they are launching are all around President Biden. And also, actually, one of their new select committees to go after what they call the weaponization of federal government is about the FBI, and it's about the FBI in response to the fact that the FBI went in and seized these classified documents from Mar-a-Lago. And all along House Republicans had defended President Trump, have not gone after him for the handling of classified documents, even though it's very clear that the cases are different and that the former president resisted for more than a year returning these classified documents.",

But I will say that that sort of consideration is not the sort of thing that prosecutors usually take into account. When I was a federal prosecutor, I wasn't considering when I was investigating and making charging decisions in a case what somebody on the next floor or a different office was doing. I wasn't going to pull punches on a bank robber or a child molester because some other bank robber might be charged or not charged.I really think Jack Smith's purview is to make the right decision based on the facts and the law. That may have political ramifications and there may be a lot of political experts who could debate that. But from purely a legal perspective, these cases have nothing to do with each other, and I would expect Jack Smith to make a decision based on the facts before him.",

And my advice is to first sign the back of the ticket, because I believe Maine does not have -- they do not, if you lose your ticket or if it's damaged, there is no warranties, I believe, on that. And then to keep it in safekeeping.And then, two, I say for instant winners, do not tell anybody. Stay discrete. Do not -- definitely don't go to the claim ticket right away because, especially at this level of fortune, this individual is going to be targeted by cybersecurity, identity theft. All sorts of fraudsters are going to come at this individual. So I think it's crucial to just take a moment, take a couple of weeks, don't change your life. If you are still working, continue to go to work. Don't change anything in your life. Protecting your identity is going to be absolutely key. So my second piece of advice, critical, is, especially at this dollar amount, is to seek professional expert advice, myself at Windfall Advisors as well as an estate planning attorney to figure out claiming your ticket as far as to keep your identity discreet, you can set up an LLC or a trust to go claim that ticket. And there is no need to rush because Maine has a one-year period to claim that, to claim that period.",
