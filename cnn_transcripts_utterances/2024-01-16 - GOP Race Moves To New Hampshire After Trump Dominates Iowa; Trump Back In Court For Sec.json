We're closing in on a CNN presidential town hall with one of the final three.Also tonight, former President Trump detours from the campaign trail, returning to court to face his accuser, E. Jean Carroll, again in a second defamation trial. And after two U.S. strikes against Iran-backed militants, the U.S. Military Central Command confirms a third retaliatory attack on Houthi rebel targets inside Yemen. Stand by for details on the mission and whether more strikes from the U.S. may be coming. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer in New Hampshire, and you're in The Situation Room. We're live here in New Hampshire at New England College at the site of CNN's Republican presidential town hall with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. He will take questions from voters and from me just three hours from now. Also DeSantis, Nikki Haley and Donald Trump, they are all converging on this state right now. It's the next crucial battleground after Donald Trump's sweeping victory in the Iowa caucuses. Let's go to CNN's Kristen Holmes. She's in Atkinson, New Hampshire, for us, where Trump has an event later tonight. Kristen, Trump is expected to speak, I'm told, fairly soon. What's his message after his Iowa blowout?",

And they are taking her on in two ways. One, they are trying to shore up their conservative support. They are doing that by airing ads that hit Haley on immigration. They believe it's a key issue for Republican voters. Now, they're also targeting moderates, independents, left-leaning independents, who they think might come out for Haley with ads attacking her on Social Security and Medicare.

Jean Carroll, though it didn't appear that they made eye contact at all during the several hours that he was there in court. Trump sat through all of jury selection until a jury of nine men and women were empanelled. And then they went to opening statements.E. Jean Carroll's attorney, Shawn Crowley, was up first. She had told the jury that, as a result of Trump's statements in 2019, denying Carroll's allegation that he raped her in an apartment store in the mid 90s, saying that she wasn't his type, and also saying that she made up the story to get -- to better the sales of her book that she had just released, she said that those statements scared Carroll, that she received numerous threatening emails and communications from Trump supporters and that her career had suffered. And she said that Donald Trump must be stopped, and that was important in this case for this jury to find in terms of damage. She said while sitting in the courtroom today, there were 22 posts just today. Think about that when you consider how much money it will take Donald Trump to stop. Now, Donald Trump's attorney, Alina Habba, gave her opening statement and she told the jury that Carol wanted the attention she had seeking fame, that she welcomed this and she was saying that Donald Trump was just defending himself. She said that of Carroll, her career has prospered. She wants President Trump to pay for the mean tweets. Now, this case went before a jury last year for statements that Trump had made in 2022. A jury found Trump liable for sexual assault and defamation. The judge overseeing this said that these statements in 2022 were nearly identical to the ones in 2019. So, the issue of defamation is not on the table for the jury. It is just up for them to decide how much in damages, if any, former president should pay E. Jean Carroll.

I've been there. Take my word for it. This man controls his courtroom.Also, as we said before, the judge has set very narrow parameters on what Donald Trump can and cannot say. Donald Trump cannot get up there and deny that he sexually assaulted E. Jean Carroll, cannot deny that he defamed her. All he can do is make arguments about how much she's been damaged.

But you know she finished third in Iowa, two points behind DeSantis and 30 points behind Trump. So how is this a two-person race? FMR. GOV. LARRY HOGAN (R-MD): Well, well, I don't think anyone was really that surprised. I certainly wasn't surprised about the results. Everybody expected Donald Trump to have a big win in Iowa. But, you know, before, it's really not representative of what's going to happen in New Hampshire at all. Before Iowa, the polls were showing Nikki Haley down single digits in second place, Ron DeSantis down in single digits, rather than down single digits, and a poll came out today that shows the race tied in New Hampshire at 40 for Trump, 40 for Haley and 4 percent for Ron DeSantis. So, I absolutely do believe that, you know, Iowa does a good job of kind of thinning the herd, and that's exactly what they did. I think New Hampshire is going to be a real battle between Haley and Trump.",

I think about half of the Republican voters do not want to vote for Donald Trump. So, half of them really do and half don't. They just had a lot of candidates to choose from and up until yesterday, they started to weed out a little bit over the past couple of weeks, but there were about 11 candidates.And now, really, there's only one that can possibly beat Donald Trump and that's Nikki Haley. And there are about 50 percent of the people that don't want Trump. They better get, that's their choice, really.

U.S. Central Command says they went after Houthi anti- ship ballistic missiles that were preparing to be launched and that posed an imminent threat to international shipping lanes.But the U.S. hasn't destroyed all of the Houthi's military capability. In fact, several hours after these strikes destroyed the anti-ship ballistic missiles, the Houthis launched another missile, damaging a Maltese-flagged bulk carrier. It was minor damaged and the ship continued on its way. But that shows you the threat the Houthis still posed. And it's also worth noting that on Monday, another Houthi anti-ship ballistic missile struck a U.S. owned and operated vessel for what appears to be the first time over the course of the past several months, that also suffered light damage and was able to continue on its way. But, again, this is the threat that Houthis posed to one of the world's most critical international waterways.

That a potential government shutdown by the end of the day on Friday.There is optimism that ultimately Congress will avert a government shutdown because of a deal that was reached by Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader, and then Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, for a short-term extension of government funding until early March. This after Congress time and again has continued to kick the can down the road. Instead of passing annual funding bills, or expected to approve at the beginning continually improving short-term increase after short-term increase and pushing it now down into March. This has caused significant blowback in the ranks. Remember, in the House, Kevin McCarthy, the then House speaker, was pushed out after he agreed to move forward with a short-term funding increase with the support of Democrats that did not have spending cuts. Ultimately, then Mike Johnson came, took the reins. He vowed to move forward and not pass any more short-term spending bills. What did he ultimately do? Move forward with a short-term spending bill because of the fact that a shutdown was looming. That has caused concern on the right. Others demanding even deeper spending cuts than what Johnson was able to secure in this go around. But at the moment, Wolf, there is an expectation that on Thursday, senators will approve the short-term increase, short term extension, then the House will move on Friday, narrowly averting a government shutdown for now, but they'll be right back at it on Friday, as other huge issues loom like funding for Ukraine, dealing with a border crisis, funding for Israel all moving on a separate track and all issues that have not been resolved will be discussed at the White House tomorrow -- Wolf.",
