But it's now in its seventh mass bleaching events since 1998, which means the warming waters around Australia are killing the coral, turning this vibrant ecosystem into an underwater graveyard. This is just one of several climate crisis that's plagued Australia in recent years. There have been devastating wildfires and massive floods that are made parts of the country uninhabitable, and has decimated the population of native species like koalas. CNN's Ivan Watson has been reporting on the climate disaster in Australia for years, and he recently traveled back to see the evolving threats firsthand, and how people are both contributing to the crisis and trying to find ways to fix it. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) IVAN WATSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A once-in-a-lifetime experience. A chance to walk alone on a desert island in the middle of the Great Barrier Reef. All around me, turquoise blue water as far as the eye can see. I'm on the edge of one of the most beautiful marine habitats on the planet. A natural wonder of the world. An underwater jungle teeming with colors, movement, life. But on this journey off the coast of Australia, I learned about the death and destruction being caused by human activity, both on land and under the water. PROF.
