That and he has subsequently today reiterated that Israel will chase down and go after leaders like Sinwar. And this seems to be implication from the defense minister saying that again today, that he believes that this is Sinwar. We have yet to get that complete analysis. It -- the area in Rafah that the IDF last had any idea where Yahya Sinwar was, was right in the south, right in the southwest of Rafah Tal Al-Sultan. And that was sort of late August. After the six hostages, the young hostages from the Nova Music Festival, were killed by Hamas in a tunnel, the IDF found them. They also investigated the tunnel network there. And they believe at that time that Yahya Sinwar and his brother, Mohammed Sinwar, who is this very senior figure inside of Hamas as well, now their military commander, been joined at the hip with his brother. They've risen through the ranks of Hamas together. That they both were in that tunnel system in Tal Al-Sultan. Now, the IDF doesn't -- hasn't given out updates where they believe Yahya Sinwar has been. He has been essentially the most wanted target. And the analysis they'll be doing now will be vital to know for them and for everyone else if they've got him. But it does represent the potential for a diplomatic injection into the stultified process of ceasefire and hostage negotiations in Gaza. I think the question is, and we have to wait for the dust to settle here and the facts to be established, who rises from that dust to lead Hamas in Gaza and what's their attitudes like? And does Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu want to take this as an off-ramp? That seems to be where we are at this moment.",

And I think as well, look, Mohammed Deif killed in an Israeli airstrike in -- on the 13th of July this year. He was the military commander of Hamas. He was the one, along with Sinwar who helped build up and prepare for the October 7th attack. He was killed, but he was replaced. He was replaced by Sinwar's brother, Mohammed Sinwar, equally hardline like Yahya Sinwar himself. Has he been killed in this strike? We don't know. What we do know is that this is an organization that regenerates itself and will put forward new leaders pretty quickly. What we also know is that it's an organization that has been decimated, that is not the strong political force that it was. But even by the IDF's own calculations, Hamas, perhaps 30,000 or 40,000 or maybe more fighters on October 7th last year, the IDF estimates they've killed maybe 17,000 of those. That leaves half the fighters out there. The leadership, yes, decimated. But the reason that the IDF gives at the moment for re-going back into the north of Gaza and re-upping their offensive there is because Hamas is regrouping there. Hamas' ability to be resilient as a military mechanism, as a group of people willing to keep fighting the IDF and Israel, it hasn't stopped. That's still there. So I think when you kill the leadership, you don't take that away. But what you do and you may do here is get an alternate leader that's ready and prepared to come to different terms with the Israeli government than Sinwar was prepared to. It's a bit of a gamble, hoping for that. We really don't know that at the moment. This is an organization that really has been pressurized, crushed in many ways. But actually, and the IDF is witness to this, it still survives. Just a couple of days ago, they fired a couple of missiles at Ashkelon, just up the coast from Gaza. Not effective there. Not the effective force they were, but not goner.",

I mean, ever since he was released as part of a prison exchange for Gilad Shalit. Just explain to us how hard of a target capturing Sinwar has been for the Israelis.",

      "sentences": "Well, very hard and obviously extremely high priority, not only for the Israelis, butfor the U.S., which has been supporting Israel in so many ways, including with intelligence to try to find Sinwar. I think what is remarkable about what we're hearing from the Israeli side today is that they're putting out clear indications that they have a strong belief that that is indeed Sinwar. Of course, DNA testing will confirm that, whereas in the past, with other senior Hamas officials who they appeared to have killed, they were a lot more careful. It took weeks, for example, following a strike that was targeting Mohammed Deif, the head of the Hamas military wing, for Israeli officials to confirm that he was indeed killed. So for them to come out and say so quickly that during this rather routine operation, they believe that they may have targeted Yahya Sinwar, I think that is very notable. But they have been hunting him for more than a year now since he orchestrated the horrific attacks on Israel on October 7th. And the prevailing sense from U.S. and Israeli intelligence officials was that he was underground in tunnels beneath the city of Khan Younis in the south, where he's from, perhaps surrounded by hostages, so it would make it a lot harder for Israeli forces to go after him. We were constantly asking the question about whether he maybe had used that vast tunnel system to go into Egypt and perhaps escape the Gaza Strip. But again, top officials, the consensus among them was that he would go down with the ship, that he had no desire to leave Gaza, that he wanted to go down fighting against Israel. So this could be, as we've all been saying, a very significant turning point. And the U.S. is certainly looking at this moment as a possibility to ratchet up the pressure on Netanyahu to declare a victory in Gaza, that this does provide, Zain, to use your word, an off-ramp for Netanyahu to be able to declare an end to the war in Gaza. Hamas, U.S. and Israeli officials believe, as a decimated organization. Fifteen thousand or more of their forces, around half or more of their forces, have been killed. They cannot, U.S. officials believe, carry out another operation like October 7th. But that remains very much to be seen whether Netanyahu agrees with what we expect that U.S. pressure to be. But, also, keep in mind, the -- Israel is fighting on a number of other fronts. There's a full-on military operation underway to the north in Lebanon. And we are expecting any day now Israel to carry out a retaliatory strike against Iran. But no doubt, if Netanyahu were able to use this moment as a way to wind down operations in Gaza, that would significantly bring down the temperature in the region as things appear to have been escalating over the course of the past few weeks.",

They will, of course, fill that vacuum. And if they fill it with leaders who are based in Qatar, of course, gives Qatar leverage when it comes to negotiations. I do want to ask you about the long-term goals of Israel, because, obviously, when you kill Yahya Sinwar, that provides Israel with a massive advantage in the short term. However, in the long term, if the humanitarian crisis in Gaza continues, if there is famine, if there is disease, if you have 40,000 Palestinians that are dead within a year, then surely the animosity against Israel only strengthens. And, therefore, the ideology that creates and sustains and fuels Hamas only lives another day. Just give us your perspective on how Israel destroys -- remember, that's their main goal. They've said that the main goal, over the past year, is to completely dismantle and destroy Hamas. I don't see how that happens without addressing the root cause of what is fueling the ideology that creates Hamas, which is, of course, the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and beyond that.",
