That resentment toward the U.S. refusal to back a ceasefire in Gaza is deeper than any commitment to the President's reelection. So don't send campaign officials to try to win votes. today. What happened when the Biden administration not the campaign this time sat face to face with leaders of the Arab and Muslim American community in the crucial state of Michigan.Plus, dropping in the Asian restaurants celebrating Lunar New Year, how a race in New York is a test case for reaching Asian-Americans the fastest growing group of voters in this country. And perspective on the migrant crisis from a Native American leader who just banned the governor of South Dakota from a reservation over her rhetoric. I'm Victor Blackwell. Let's start the show. Thanks for being with me. This morning somewhat lost in the coverage of President Biden's age and memory are these new Stark comments he made about how Israel is executing its war with Hamas.

After a clumsy attempt at a meeting between community leaders and the Biden campaign, the Biden White House followed up this week by sending several senior administration officials. Michigan State Representative Abraham Alyash is one of those leaders who agreed to meet and he joins us. Also here is Abed Alyoub. He was in Dearborn this week and is the National Executive Director of the American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee.Gentlemen, thank you for being with me. Representative Alyash, so let me start with you. You attended the meeting. I want to know what was your message and were they receptive. STATE REP. ABRAHAM ALYASH (D-MI): We were very clear that we are committed to the same message we have been talking about for the last 124 days. We are demanding an end to the violence ceasefire, humanitarian aid to be sent into Gaza, and that unrestricted military aid to Israel must end. We cannot have a nation that has killed 30,000 people, mostly children and innocent men and women to then go in and continue to use our taxpayer money to do that crime. So we are here and we were consistent with our message. It was a very frank discussion. We did not mince words. And we made it clear to the Biden administration that unless we saw policy change, there would not be any follow-up discussions as a result of the meeting that we had this week.",

I run for office with the message and I run for office with a platform and a set of priorities that I share with the public. And then they make that determination.What we have seen over the last 124 days is there has not been a commitment or priority to protect the Palestinian people to stop the ongoing genocide. So for now, we are telling the Democratic Party and we are telling President Biden that we remain uncommitted for now, until we see some significant change. You know, it is a long time from November. But we have a presidential primary and February 27. And we are going to vote on committed because we cannot in good conscience vote for anyone that has allowed what has happened over the last 125 days to happen.

As Representative Alyash has mentioned, you don't run on, you know, the other guy is scarier than me. You have to show something. You have to do something. And the way the Democratic Party is hitting back against, you know, Arab Muslim voters simply for them exercising their opinion, for demanding humanity, for demanding basic humanity for Palestinians, they're getting backlash.This is not a viable campaign strategy. It's not something that will work. And they definitely need to rethink it. And look, if there's any community out there in America, one of the communities that really has felt the brunt of a Trump administration, it is the Arab and Muslim community.

Of course, it could slim the already narrow Republican majority in the House by another seat.

And yet, the group also has data showing that neither Republican nor Democratic candidates are doing a very good job of reaching out to these voters. Let's talk about this with Christine Chen. She's the co-founder and executive director of API a vote which works to engage Asian and Pacific Islander voters. Christine, good morning to you.

Well last year, Oher alleged that Sean and Leigh Anne Tuohy never adopted him, but instead filed a conservatorship and profited from a false narrative about him which they deny.

We can see Greek pottery, Italian ceramics, and so I really want to die from my own culture and community. I feel like our stories should not be ephemeral. They should be things that lasts forever and should be told.The subject matter that I choose in my work is very much informed by trying to represent people of color, specifically impoverished communities in the United States. For example, one of the pieces that I have has been acquired by the Carnegie Museum in Pittsburgh is a piece called the prison -- School to Prison Pipeline. And it is a Greek amphora. And I use a Greek amphora because Greek pots are orange and black, much like prison uniforms, and trying to show a visual description of children waiting in line for food at the cafeteria, and then adults waiting in line for food in a prison. You know, what is not a lot of people to the crime and life that they eventually winded up having to live, has a lot to do with circumstance rather than inherently being bad people. One of the things I tell my students is, it's not about being great at anything. It's about the unique combination of things that you're mediocre at that make you the state. And I think that's very important to communicate to people that they too, are completely capable of doing what I'm doing if they've just put themselves into it. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
