And he was looking forward to an upcoming family trip to Disney World before he was shot and killed in school. Fourteen-year-old Christian Angulo's older sister tells local media her brother was sweet, he was caring. One of his friends who happened to miss school yesterday was absolutely devastated that he had lost his life and been killed by a shooter. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

CHARLES RAMSEY, CNN SENIOR LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST, FORMER PHILADELPHIA POLICE COMMISSIONER (via Webex by Cisco):  Well, I mean, there are a lot of questions. We're finding out more and more as time goes on. You know, previous interactions with both the FBI as well as the sheriff's office. We now know he had an AR-15-type assault weapon. How did he get his hands on that weapon? You know, what -- where were the family members -- the father, in particular? You know, how much did they know? What were they doing to secure weapons? Were there any warning signs from school? I mean, there are still a lot of questions that need to be answered. He is alive so they're able to interview him and they're able to get some information. But this is just one more tragedy that has occurred. And again, my condolences to the families that lost people yesterday. It's just senseless. It makes absolutely no sense.

You had no probable cause to take him into custody. Georgia has some of the weakest gun laws in the country. So there's not a whole lot that law enforcement could do. And that's why I think now you turn toward the family. What did they know? How accessible were those weapons to the individual? Where did he get the AR-15? Who else may have known of his plans -- friends, anyone? I mean, there's a lot that still has to be done in this investigation. But as far as law enforcement's concerned, they got the threat, they followed up. They interviewed people. They didn't have any probable cause to take this individual into custody at that time, from what I have learned so far.

I agreed to do it because they wouldn't do any other network. She only -- the other thing is her best friend is the head of the network.

And then even at one point suggesting that the campaign believed that Joe Biden would perform well. That he was a seasoned politician and had been doing this for decades. And so they expected him to show up that night. So this kind of expectation setting, and playing with the media, and working the rafts (PH) is just kind of how Trump operates. So let's take a moment to step back and remind our viewers what the actual rules for this debate are. Each candidate will get two-minute answers, two-minute rebuttals, and one-minute follow-ups. It's going to be a 90-minute debate with two commercial breaks. There will be no prewritten notes allowed. Trump has repeatedly said that is something the Harris campaign wants, which they have denied. Microphones will be muted when individuals are not speaking. This is something that the Trump campaign has pushed for. The Harris campaign would like it to be open season on the microphones.

The muted mics are going to happen.CNN is reporting on each team's preparations now. And one thing that's kind of changed about Trump's prep includes the addition of Tulsi Gabbard. How might she make a -- I don't know, a dent in this or maybe change what he might do? Because his advisers have been asking him to stop doing these attacks and focus on policy but he -- but he hasn't done that. And he's said look, that -- it works for me to be on the attack. JULIE ROGINSKY, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST, CO-FOUNDER, LIFT OUR VOICES: Well look, I mean, Tusli Gabbard -- they had to bring her in because they needed a woman somewhere in his orbit to play Kamala Harris or to at least be in the room. I don't think they're actually doing real debate prep. Real debate prep actually requires reinforcing and reenacting the debate. What he's doing is having consultations with people, including Tulsi Gabbard. Tulsi Gabbard has debated Kamala Harris, so she does know how to do that. On the other hand, this is not how you run a debate prep. I mean, having run so many debate preps in my life you actually -- it's a very, very disciplined -- probably the most disciplined thing you can do in the course of a campaign. And yet, that is completely contrary to Donald Trump's personality. So Maura is absolutely right. He's going to go revert back to what he's comfortable with, which is attacking Kamala Harris. The problem for him is that she's a woman and a woman of color, something that he doesn't know how to deal with and somebody that he has never really been around. And so, I don't know that his M.O. -- the way it worked for him with Hillary Clinton potentially is going to work with Kamala Harris. Hillary Clinton's negatives were baked in with people. People knew about Hillary Clinton. They're not so much baked in for Kamala Harris. And I think just the notion of him trying to use his physical presence the way he did with Hillary Clinton to try to muscle Kamala Harris out or to try to make her uncomfortable, it's going to backfire on him. He's going to do it because he can't help himself. If I were advising him I would tell him to not, but I think we're going to see that regardless because he doesn't listen to anybody but himself.",

And again, it wasn't some formal speech, some formal announcement. And I think by doing it that way she's not trying to galvanize you; she's more or less explaining here's where I'm at and here's where people who are in swing states need to really consider. It's not just enough to do a write-in and to say no to Donald Trump. If you're in a swing state you've got to -- you know, here's the choice we have.

If you're a Bernie Sanders, you can work with me. I am trying to expand my coalition. Donald Trump has a very small, relatively speaking, MAGA base. He's not trying to expand his base whatsoever. So that's -- you were speaking about Pennsylvania. If you're a suburban voter in Bucks County, Pennsylvania who is typically Republican or of Northampton County, Pennsylvania who is typically Republican, you can be comfortable voting for me because I'm not the communist Kamala, as he calls her.

And the problem is, too, is that the plan that he put out and as he was railing on what Harris proposed as her economic plan, his plan that he proposed then showed to be five times more expensive than what her plan would do.And so that's the real problem he gets into, and he knows that, is that he starts talking policy to -- it just depends on the group he's talking to. If it makes a Tulsi Gabbard feel better that she says IVF for all and then backtracks that same day, he'll do that because he really does believe that his MAGA base will stay with him no matter what he says, and that should be a concern. And again, next week, I think at the debate, it's really important that he gets hit on some of his policy issues and has to say it right there in front of the entire country but also the world. Where do you stand on X, Y, Z? Say it here. Because in these rallies he's able to kind of flip-flop back and forth but then hit on Kamala Harris for being flip-flopping on policy positions. And I think to Julie's point it's really important that she is reaching out into the middle because Trump has largely abandoned an opportunity for the middle of the Republican Party and the middle of the country, and most people aren't on the fringes. They're somewhere in the middle. And he decided to neglect that entire opportunity he had, especially after the shooting, and it's up for grabs.
