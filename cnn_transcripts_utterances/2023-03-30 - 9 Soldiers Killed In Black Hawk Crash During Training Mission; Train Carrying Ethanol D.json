And there have been more than a handful of training accidents with Black Hawks over the years.I think it goes to show just how risky some of these training exercises are and how true to life they might be. Could you speak to that? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Sure, Boris. You know, the military fighters really the way it trains. And it becomes really important for aircrews, especially for Black Hawk helicopter crews as well as you know, all other kinds of aircraft that are engaged in combat operations, to train as realistic as possible. There's a lot that can be done by simulators or through simulators, but that's not exactly the way things really happened when you're out, you know, going into really an operational area and fighting an operational mission. So it becomes really important for aircrew to fly actual missions and to get the practice that they need in order to be proficient in all aspects of airmanship,. And that's really what - what they were trying to do last night.",

It should be noted that you can't put this out with water, that they will put it out with the foam. Burlington Northern has already made the assessment on this. This will be foam. It doesn't contain those forever chemicals you hear about, the potential carcinogens. This will not be that type of foam.

The White House had initially signaled opposition to the measure, prompting House Democrats again just to oppose it.And then, you know, once again went to the House - or sorry, the Senate, the president said that he wouldn't oppose it. So I wondered, you know, why was this the White House signaling opposition again and then coming back around and changing minds? Should there be improved communications, particularly for House Democrats, who are this is the second time now. JEAN-PIERRE: So look, we - I'm going to do a little bit of a lay down because nothing has changed here. We have been very consistent on this process. So look, if the president was planning to veto this legislation, the SAP would have said so. That's how the SAP work. That is incredibly consistent in that way. And certainly, members of Congress know that. They understand how that works and how that process works as well. But that being said, the SAP was issued in January for two bills that would have lifted both the public health emergency and also the national emergency immediately, which, as you know, we oppose we were very public about that. The bill that just passed would only lift the national emergency, which doesn't impact Title 42 or Covid authorities like for testing and for treatments. We are in a different place and time than we were in January, so that is something that you all know and have reported. We've been winding down authorities over the last two weeks - I'm sorry, over the last two months. And the national emergency lifting just a few weeks before the public health one will not impact our efforts to do so in orderly way. And that's what we've been very clear about when we talk about Title 42, making sure that we do that process in an orderly way, Again, nothing has changed. We were very clear with the SAP that we put out back in January. And so we have been very consistent with how we use the SAP and how we move forward with it.",

JEAN-PIERRE: So look, detaining Americans as - as my colleague said, my embassy colleagues said, is a tactic Russia has used for a long time. It is nothing new. When you think about Paul Whelan, you think about Trevor Reed, they were taken prisoner to the prior administration, under the prior administration. And so, as you all know, we're still working very hard to bring Paul home. That is something that we are committed to. You heard that from the president. You heard that from the secretary of state. You've heard that from my colleagues and NSC. And so, right now, our best tool to prevent this is to make sure that we are discouraging anybody to travel to Russia.

I do - we do have some things that we want to put out there. DOJ and HHS are reviewing the decision made by the judge in Texas earlier today. But we want to be very clear, this - this case is yet another attack on the Affordable Care Act, which has been the law of the land for 13 years now, 13 years. In fact, as all of you guys know, the Supreme Court has upheld the legality of it three times. They've had to do that three times in those past 13 years. And because of the ACA, you see 150 million Americans who have access to preventative care like cancer and heart disease screenings And 60 percent of people use a preventive care service under the ACA every year. That's 60 percent of Americans across the country. Preventive care saves lives. It saves families money and protects and improves our health. This case gets between patients and their doctors. That's what it gets. It gets involved in a decision that patients and their doctors should be making. It's yet another attack on the ability of Americans to make their own health care choices. Efforts to undermine this requirement are wrong and they take us backwards, not forwards. So the administration will continue to fight to improve health care and make it more affordable for working families, even in the face of these attacks by the special interest groups that we see out there.

Besides that don't have any specific breakdown on when the counterparts, when State Department or NSC connected with their counterpart. But look, this is a priority for this administration.

If that's the case, and if we were taking the former administration for bowling effect, why did you take until a crisis to decide things?JEAN-PIERRE: Let me just say, unfortunately, the Trump administration regulators weakened many important common-sense requirements and supervision for regional banks like Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, whose recent failures led to that. We have experts out there who have said those rollbacks were caused by recent of the recent bank failures. That's what we're hearing from experts out there themselves. So just want to be very clear. It's not just us who were saying that. That's what the experts as well are saying. So today, the president is urging the banking regulators to consider reforms that will reduce the risk of future banking crises, stronger liquidity and capital requirements, annual stress tests, living wills and stronger supervision. So again, because of what we saw done by the Trump administration back in 2018 - remember what happened in 2008 and what the Obama/Biden administration were able to do. They were able to strengthen some of those requirements, make it stronger, and the Trump administration rolled that back. And experts themselves say that because of those rollbacks that we saw in the Trump administration, it led to these recent failures.",

How - because Iran continues to attack United States targets and American servicemembers right now ,the effort has been to deter them, to stop them. It has not deterred them. So how is that strategy working? And shouldn't there be a higher cost for Iran to pay? JEAN-PIERRE: So look, I'll say this. We have a variety of tools to protect U.S. personnel and deter attacks. And we've been - we will use those tools. We work every day to protect our people and deter attacks. President Biden has taken a deliberate approach, using a variety of tools to reduce risk to our personnel and make clear that we will hold anyone who attacks those responsible. And you've heard that from the president. You've heard that from the administration, on down. The president will not hesitate to take action to protect U.S. personnel and interests overseas.

That was something that was on his schedule to take place around 10:45 this morning in the Oval Office. And there, in the White House press briefings, Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, said that that was, in fact, when President Biden was first informed of this matter. I think it's also noteworthy the way that you heard Karine Jean-Pierre really pushed back on these espionage allegations that Evan Gershkovich is facing at this moment. [14:55:03] She said that they believe that they are ridiculous and that they have no reason to believe that they are accurate. Of course, one of the things that the White House and the State Department have both said today is that they are focused on trying to get consular access to that \"Wall Street Journal\" reporter, as he is in Russia. The State Department had previously said that it could be a matter of days, due to some of the administrative and security requirements on the Russian side. But what will be key during that moment is for officials to be able to ascertain Gershkovich's condition so that they know for themselves, but also said that they are able to relay that for the family. And as you noted, one thing throughout the process of this day, and each of these statements that we've seen, they have been referring to this simply as a \"detention.\" The White House and State Department has not gone as far to say, wrongful detention. That is a determination and a process of this currently underway over at the State Department.
