This meeting is obviously generating quite a bit of attention. In your view, what does success look like, here, for the president of the United States? ROBERT DALY, DIRECTOR, KISSINGER INSTITUTE ON CHINA &amp; THE UNITED STATES:  I think that for President Biden, if he is able to make his concerns about the relationship known to China, if he is able to have a fairly smooth meeting without some of the snafus that have plagued previous meetings, then that's really enough. It would be good if you could also get an agreement on military to military dialogue and resuming that dialogue. He already has some agreement from the Chinese side to be more cooperative in trying to cut the trade of fentanyl precursors. But primarily, what he wants to do is signal to the American people and signal to our allies that he is engaged with China in a responsible way and is trying to prevent conflict. He's not looking here for a specific outcome.",

That was true for many years, and it will be somewhat true this year, except that the anti-China rhetoric from China's point of view has not become a constant factor in the relationship. It doesn't cease.And so, the election itself will be a slight blip, but only a slight blip when the level of political invective from China's point of view is always extremely high. They have also become somewhat inured to that. During the Trump administration, especially during COVID, during the trade war, there were an awful lot of insults and attacks of an unprecedented sort. The secretary of state Michael Pompeo at the time called on the Chinese people to rise up and overthrow their government. So, this has been a constant barrage and I think that they have become a little less sensitive to that, although they do expect China to be an issue, not necessarily on voters' minds but on politicians' minds in 2024.",

We understand that we are about ten hours in or at least 10 hours since the IDF first announced that it was happening, and precise and targeted have to be the operative words here, because this hospital has not been fully evacuated. In fact, we understand from officials in the Hamas-controlled health ministry in Gaza that as of Tuesday, they said there were some 7,000 displaced people sheltering in the hospital, some 1,500 medical staff.On Monday, another official within that ministry told us that there were about 700 patients. We don't know how many of them are still there. But certainly, this will be and is a very delicate operation for Israel. And when it started, the IDF said that they thought there might be hostages also in that sprawling complex of the Al Shifa hospital. We now heard just a couple of hours ago via Israeli radio that they have not found any signs of those hostages. But searches are still ongoing, major caveat, that doesn't mean they won't find any evidence of those hostages. And we're finding out more about those searches essentially. There's Palestinian reporter for the WAFA News Agency at the hospital who has been sending us updates. He said that is really soldiers were in the buildings and the departments of the hospitals, conducting -- conducting what he called search and interrogation operations, essentially bringing out young men. He said that they have now gone into the basement of the hospital, where many of the evacuees were sheltering, taking 30 young men, told them to take their clothes off, and send them off to the first floor. So, look, the IDF has said that part of the work here is to try to distinguish, essentially, Hamas operatives from innocent civilians. This seems to be how they are getting that done. But this is clearly a pivotal moment in this conflict, Kasie, one that the IDF and Israeli forces have been building up to. And it will be a critical test as that pressure mounts on Israel to do more to protect civilians, as to how they will do that, certainly, we are already hearing some concerns, significant concerns, from the likes of the U.N. and the World Health Organization this morning.",
