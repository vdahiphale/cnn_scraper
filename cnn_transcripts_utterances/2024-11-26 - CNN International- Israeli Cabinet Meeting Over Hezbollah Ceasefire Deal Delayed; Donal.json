Within the last few hours, Israel bombed Beirut's southern suburbs, at one point, unleashing at least 20 bombs in a two-minute span. An Israeli military spokesperson described it as a widespread attack on Hezbollah targets. More than 3,000 people have been killed in Lebanon since Israel began its major offensive against Iran-backed Hezbollah in September. More than one million people have been displaced.Let's go to our Nic Robertson, who joins us now for the very latest from Jerusalem. Nic, talk to us about the pressures increasing on Netanyahu in this final phase, although we know that there are still some, at least one in the far right who say that making a deal would be a mistake. What do we expect to see in the next 24 hours or so?",

They feel that this deal is going to look very much like the deal in 2006, the UN Security Council Resolution 1701, and they say that that wasn't enforced toughly enough, and therefore Hezbollah was able to get to the border. Put them in danger. And they feel that this is a repetition.What we know is a 60-day ceasefire. Hezbollah is expected to move back north inside Lebanon, away from the border, 30 miles, 45 kilometers north of a river called the Litani River, which, by the way, the IDF said they reached in some areas. In some places, it is very close to the border. And the IDF, for their part, would pull back, back into Israel. So, they would -- the forces would pull apart, and into that vacuum would go the UN and the Lebanese army. And we heard from the Lebanese Foreign Minister today specifying some of the details about how many troops would be going in. This is what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And so, obviously it would take some time for people to return there.And then the other question is -- I mean, it's important to note that these are areas where Hezbollah holds sway and is actually quite popular. And so, therefore there are people who are residents there, who are also perhaps affiliated with Hezbollah. And so, what happens then? I mean, can these people return? Can they build their houses? Right? What does it mean if they are still affiliated with the group, right? These are various questions that have not been solved or hammered out. Now, it's worth noting that the idea here now is to have a 60-day truce and to use that time to actually hammer those details out. But, the problem is that -- I mean, there are just simply, I think, vital issues on how much there can be no consensus between the two sides, and I would be curious to see how they can achieve it.",

And it would perhaps be a sort of pulling back from the brink. But, with that being said, I mean, all this is, I think, very still unstable, right?

On the campaign trail, Trump spoke a lot about slapping high tariffs on Chinese imports, but now he is making clear that neighbors and allies of the U.S., well, they won't be spared. He is proposing 25 percent tariffs on all imports from Canada and Mexico as soon as he takes office. Chinese imports will face an additional 10 percent tariff, which Trump describes as punishment for China exporting fentanyl to the U.S. The Chinese Embassy responding that no one will win a trade war.Economists, meantime, say that tariffs could wreak havoc on U.S. firms, supply chains, especially in industries that rely on imports from America's closest trading partners. Let's bring in CNN's Anna Stewart to break down for us. Anna, how these tariffs would work?",

      "speaker": "ANNA STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT",
      "sentences": "So, essentially, a tariff is just a tax that a country imposes on imports, usually as a percentage of a product, and that is paid for by the importer of that good, as a result, so that companies can retain some sort of profit margin. They often have to pass that cost on to the consumer, which means, of course, measures like this can really be inflationary. Goods can get more expensive, particularly if you rely on imported goods.Now, here we have 10 percent on China. This would be in addition to existing tariffs that there already are on certain Chinese products. 25 percent on all products from Mexico and Canada. This is huge. These tariffs would cover 40 percent of U.S. trade. Let that sink in. However, I think the timing of this announcement is really interesting. Of course, he is the President-elect. He is not yet President. The campaign is over. In many ways, you've got to wonder whether this is a negotiating tactic, and whether these tariffs that are being proposed here actually maybe less about the economy and trade and boosting inward investment in U.S. manufacturing. Maybe this is more a diplomatic tool or a diplomatic weapon, perhaps. Have a look at what Donald Trump said on Truth Social when he made this announcement. The big focus here really was U.S. borders and drugs. He said the tariff will remain in effect until such time as drugs, in particular, fentanyl, and all illegal aliens stop the invasion of our country. So, I would suggest that while tariffs are so often used by Donald Trump as an economic tool, perhaps it's being used here as more of a diplomatic one.",

You can see quite a bit of recovery now, though.In terms of the diplomatic response, well, you already mentioned Beijing saying that a trade war essentially helps no one. Mexico's President has said that Trump's tariffs will worsen inflation, kill jobs, and she has also said this, to one tariff will come another and so on until we put our common businesses at risk, i.e.., as what often happens with tariffs, if you do impose them, countries will impose tariffs back, and before you know it, you are in a tariff war.

I mean, what we've seen so far with the U.S. tariffs on China is relocation of production. There has been a big shift of production in Asia, particularly to Southeast Asia. Could imagine if the tariffs stay in place, that some of that will continue. Part of the problem is that the strategy for a lot of companies has been to move their Chinese investment into the North American space, and Mexico has been the most attractive location there because of its lower production costs. If you have a 25 percent tariff on imports, that throws that strategy into some doubt.So, it -- again, a lot of it will depend on the nature and duration. This could be, as Anna suggested, bargaining strategy, so companies aren't necessarily going to make big shifts. Short term, you're going to see exports or -- excuse me, you're going to see imports in the United States increase dramatically, because companies are going to try to hedge and beef up their supply in advance of the potential for these tariffs.",

He said that tariffs can't be inflationary, because if the price of one thing goes up, unless you give people more money, then they have less money to spend on the other thing. So, there is no inflation, and paraphrasing here, but essentially the point is that higher prices on one category could mean less demand than another. Do you see that, Ted, as a likely scenario enough so that it actually keeps a lid on inflation?",

I think all the economic research shows pretty clearly that tariffs feed directly into consumer prices. It might change consumption patterns a bit. But, of course, a lot of the things we're talking about here are not particularly optional, food, oil, automobiles. So, no, I think there is no question it'll be inflationary if we see 25 percent tariffs that stay in place for some time. The companies can eat a little bit of it. I mean, some of it, you'll see profit margins hit. But, by and large, no, this is going to pass through to consumers. So, that's just not correct.",

So, they are certainly putting the puzzle pieces together, and that does include states, and it includes moves like those of Texas.Now, Texas had launched its operation Lone Star in 2021 in partisan affront to the Biden administration, and it included steps like buoys in the Rio Grande, blocking off certain parts of the border to federal agents, and also bussing migrants to Democratic-led cities.

Second, no foreign forces are allowed into Lebanon without the government of Lebanon's consent. And finally, a buffer zone was established that would be manned by up to 15,000 UN peacekeepers to ensure the peace.

And here are some of the international headlines we're following today.In Germany, politicians have raised the possibility that a plane crash in Lithuania may have been the result of hybrid warfare or sabotage. The cargo plane had taken off from Leipzig before crashing close to the airport in the capital Vilnius. Investigation is underway, and flight recorders from the plane have been recorded. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz told the media that he is waiting for the investigators' findings, but warned that Germany was seeing what he called many bad forms of hybrid warfare. Three bodies have been recovered off of Egypt's Red Sea coast. A tourist boat capsized on Monday after it was struck by high waves, sinking in just under seven minutes. 31 tourists and 13 crew members were on board. 13 people are still missing. The Red Sea is a major magnet for visitors to Egypt. However, the area had been closed to maritime traffic on Sunday after waves of three to four meters or up to 13 feet were recorded. Thousands of protesters broke through barricades around Islamabad earlier today. They're calling for the release of jailed former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, who is urging his supporters to fight to the end. Police fired tear gas, who dispersed the crowds, and blocked roads to try to prevent them from pushing through. Khan's supporters say that he is being held on politically motivated charges.

The Russian Foreign Ministry summoned the British ambassador, seen here arriving at the Ministry earlier. It marks the latest blow to worsening diplomatic relations between the two countries.Meantime, Ukraine recently carried out two more strikes on Russia, targeting Kursk, using U.S.-made longer-range missiles. That's according to Russia's Ministry of Defense. Two U.S. officials say that Ukraine hit a Russian weapons arsenal with U.S.-made missiles that Ukraine fired across the border for the first time last week. Now, for context, that attack came just two days after the Biden administration gave Kyiv the green light to use the American weapons against targets inside Russia. For more now, let's get to our Senior International Correspondent Fred Pleitgen, who is in Moscow.

Donald Trump said that when he was on the campaign trail, to follow through on that promise.So, the Russians are right now saying that an escalation is happening. There is a big threat that all of this could turn into a direct confrontation between the United States and Russia. And of course, one of the other things that the Russians have done over the past days is launch a gigantic missile for the first time against the target in Ukraine, against the city of Dnipro in Ukraine. That really is something a lot of Russians are talking about as well, saying this is something that the West really needs to watch out for, Rahel.",

It's the last G7 meeting for U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, before Donald Trump takes office. Blinken will head to the Vatican to meet Pope Francis before flying back to the U.S. Let's get to because Jennifer Hansler, who is following developments at the U.S. State Department.

This just came out within the past hour, and in that statement, 15 pages long, they expressed their steadfast support for Ukraine, for the ongoing war, i.e., Russia is perpetrating against Kyiv. They said they would continue that support, that backing for Kyiv, no matter what they have reinforced this idea that they are going to be there, no matter what happens in the broader stage.And then on the Middle East, where we are seeing these developments in Lebanon, the potential for a ceasefire to be voted on today. Those foreign ministers came out with a very strong statement. I want to read to you. It said, \"We support the ongoing negotiation for an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah and the full implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1701. Now is the time to conclude a diplomatic settlement, and we welcome efforts deployed in that regard.\" So, of course, that Security Council resolution was passed in 2006. It was meant to bring an end to the war between Israel and Lebanese Hezbollah. We have seen those conflicts ratchet up over the past months there, and we are going to wait and see what comes out of Israel's cabinet meeting later today on that front. This was, of course, the top topic of conversation yesterday in those ministerial meetings that were focused on the Middle East. In the morning, the G7 foreign ministers met themselves to discuss the situation, and later in the day, they were joined by foreign ministers from the Arab countries, Rahel.",
