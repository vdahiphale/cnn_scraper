Even among people who are anti-abortion, you've heard them say, well, we support IVF because that is helping people grow their families. So again, this is a message protecting IVF that's pretty universally embraced.

And your nerves get frayed, because you don't know if it's -- if it ever will be successful. At least that was my case. But tell us about your journey and why you sought IVF.L. OLSON: Yes. So, in 2022, I was diagnosed with endometriosis. We did the surgery for it, we found that both my tubes were completely blocked. So, I'm fortunate enough that my job pays for progeny, which is an insurance company -- fertility -- insurance company. We start IVF last year. We did all the stem shots in my stomach to get my eggs ready. I had a growth in my cervix as well that we had to pause IVF to get that removed. And then, we had 10 weeks of progesterone shots, which are big 18-gauge needles then go in backside to keep the baby viable and alive.",

We'll talk with someone who's with the group that founded Black History Month about why we ask black students and any students who experience Jim Crow, to experience slavery in a way that we don't ask of other atrocities in American history?

We'll speak with the lawmaker who was the co-sponsor of the Crown Act in Texas about changes he says that he's going to push for in that law. So, he is with us. Also, there are more than a dozen black women in Texas running for judgeships. Some of them are incumbents, and they say that a new law is one of the tools being used against them to target their races and only their races, and they believe it's, in part, because of this history making picture out of Harris County when 17 Black women won seats as judges there and of course, we'll talk about Trump saying that black people like him because he's got a mug shot.",
