On a clearday, this overlook is usually a popular photo stop, but haze is once again obscuring the view. Perhaps not surprising, since Chiang Mai ranks as one of the world`s most polluted cities, according to IQAir, a website that monitors air quality. But the smog isn`t just unsightly, it`s unhealthy. IQAir says the level of cancer-causing pollutants in Chiang Mai`s air is more than 20 times higher than World Health Organization guidelines, and people are getting sick from it. A Thai government report says more than 10 million people required treatment for pollution-related illnesses last year, with many people wearing masks to protect themselves. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): On the day that I don`t wear a face mask, I`m exposed to pollution. Then I would come home with an allergic rash on my arm. I can`t breathe. I have a stuffed nose.",

Butthis year, the government says it`s taking steps to curb the problem. Legislation for a Clean Air Act is underway, and Thailand`s prime minister says he`ll impose regulations on crop burning, but didn`t give further details. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

It has explored Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Most of us keep in touch with people who are far away via text message, phone call, maybe a letter. But what do you do when you`re trying to send or receive messages really far away, like billions of miles up in a spacecraft in outer space far away? That`s exactly what NASA engineers are dealing with, with the world`s farthest-traveling spacecraft Voyager 1. It`s one of the twin probes that`s been exploring our solar system since 1977, even though it was only built to last five years. Engineers are in communication. Voyager 1 sends a steady radio signal back to mission control. But since November, the probe`s flight data system has been acting a bit wonky. It can complete given commands, but important data has not been transmitting back to Earth. So what did mission control do? Well, they poked it. They sent what they call a poke on March 1st, a command prompting Voyager to run different software in case there`s been a glitch. Two days later, Voyager 1 sent back an unusually formatted response decoded by a member of NASA`s Deep Space Network to show it was the system`s own coding. The team will compare and contrast this new report to data from the spacecraft before the problem arose, and try to suss out what exactly is happening on the spacecraft about 15 billion miles away. Question for you. How would you feel about going to a school where they don`t allow any smartphones on campus? Maybe that`s already the case for some of you. But if not, how would you feel about being away from your phone for eight hours or so each day? If you like the idea, why? If not, what would be your reasoning for the objection? Our CNN Digital team went to one small high school in Massachusetts where they don`t allow smartphones so we could learn why the school did it and what the outcome has been. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
