And UPM promised as early as next week. Hash tag brings back Boris trending as we speak. Is Boris mock too really interview honestly speaking, we don't have a clue but we'll try. Also this hour we're awaiting the sentencing of Former Trump adviser Steve Bannon found guilty of contempt of Congress for failing to cooperate with an investigation following the January 6 capitol riots. Department of Justice has recommended a 6-month prison term. We will bring that news to you the moment it breaks. Also, Twitter fitter certainly leaner if a report on the Washington Post proves correct. Elon Musk discussed cutting 75 percent of the firm's workforce if and when he takes control. Twitter shares also under pressure pre-markets on fears. The deal might be up for a U.S. security view. Tech Analyst Dan Ives will give us his take later on in the show and for now nothing positive to tweet about. On Wall Street U.S. stocks on track for a third day of losses as you can see there red on the screen. Despite further solid earnings reports the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield hitting a new 14-year high with the futures market. Now expecting Fed interest rates above 5 percent by next year and as you can see there at the bottom of your screen European stock markets also softer too with the pound softer against the U.S. dollar. Nowhere near last month gut wrenching plunge during the worst of the Truss induced budget fast. But fresh concern that new Chancellor Jeremy Hunt's fiscal plan due on Halloween. Of course 31st of October might be delayed by the search for a new Prime Minister. Much to discuss today, as always first, I will head to Ukraine where homes and businesses have been plunged into darkness there are now rolling blackouts in Kyiv as Russian strikes have knocked out as much as 40 percent of its power infrastructure and a Senior Ukrainian official warning that Russia could open a new front in the war from Belarus. CNN's Senior Diplomatic Editor Nic Robertson joins us now from Kyiv. Let's begin with the rolling blackouts. Nic, what are we talking about in terms of hours with power and hours without.",

Don't use your heavy duty electrical devices, the things like washing machines, heaters, those sorts of things. Don't use those at the peak hours in the evening. That's the way to try to spread the load. But there's also advice such as make sure you've got plenty of water stored away. Because when the electricity is off, you won't get water. Have extra blankets in the house have extra socks, charge your phones, charge your battery packs so a lot of advice. And even in some cities, there are sort of electricity consumption. Police out regular Police but on their patrols, making sure that there aren't extra lights on the City of Kryvyi Rih. Police there are making sure that people aren't sort of leaving lights on business premises overnight where they don't need to be on. So this is a very, very big and sharp issue for the government. If they cannot keep pace with the attrition to the electricity supplies in terms of repairs, then the system could degrade further. So spread out the usage.

Because to detect military activity is detected either potentially missiles being prepared orfighter jets take into the air in Belarus. Because Belarus is already being used by Russia as a platform to attack here and it's relatively close. So Belarus is relatively close to the capital. When Russia launched that advance into Ukraine earlier in the year a lot of the troops came through Russia. But there's a real concern now that as Belarus and Russia now have formed this joint force, several weeks ago. This was announced that this could be a threat to the northern border moving the potential for that advance further to the west. So of course, as you say, this is a concern for authorities, because there have a big offensive in the south. But if you have a threat from the north end, do you have to divert troops up there? Is this a real and genuine threat and the assessment at the moment seems to fall in the area of actually Ukrainian officials feel that the threat from the north is genuine. They say that in recent days, they've seen military equipment, and personnel moving into positions north of the border. So this is the growing concern, balanced against, of course, the need to keep troops in the south and keep that offensive to retake territory ongoing there as well.",

And he's stayed in post for a considerable period of time, given the last two governments that we've had here in the United Kingdom. What he said was significant as well. He said that he was leaning towards the Former Prime Minister because mandate credibility and justification of having another Prime Minister without an election was going to become a question. And you hear that from inside the Boris Johnson camp, that because he's already won an election. He'd be the natural next leader of the Conservative Party to avoid those difficult questions over whether or not the party can really have a second Prime Minister. That was unelected by the British public in terms of where we are and the runners and riders that are emerging. Obviously, Boris Johnson is the large focus in Westminster will he won't he the consensus is that Johnson doesn't like to lose. So behind the scenes, he's trying to figure out along with his team, will he get to that critical threshold of 100 MPs. And if it looks like he will, then I'm sure there's nothing that can stand in his way. And of course, given the Shakespearean nature of British politics at the moment one of the contenders that he would be standing against is successful would be Rishi Sunak his Former Chancellor, and for many in the Johnson camp, anathema. Because he was criticized as being the one to ultimately stabbed Boris Johnson in the back which precipitated that waterfall of resignations that led to the end of Boris Johnson in number 10 last times round. Another key figure though, is Penny Mordaunt. So she was the second runner up in the previous leadership contest. And she is one to watch because the acrimony between Johnson and Sunak and those cams is quite acute. And there's a lot of factionalism. She could present herself as the Unity candidate and make quite a strong case for doing so. But it will all depend on the members if more than one person gets the support of 100 MPs.

And I was speaking to some MPs earlier who said they feel like there's a sense of collective amnesiaabout the circumstances under which Boris Johnson ultimately was forced out of Downing Street. That investigation around 140 of his own MPs, 148 I believe voting against him in that confidence vote. So many letters from his own party saying that he wasn't fit for office anymore but this investigation is key for the reason that you outlined because it the parliamentary standards committee finds Boris Johnson guilty of having misled Parliament along the line. And that investigation was into whether or not he informed the House of Commons that no rules have been broken inside number 10 inside the government buildings during the COVID lockdown and if he was found to have not been honest, when he gave that response to the House of Commons. Then that's misleading parliament, you can't willingly lie to Parliament that is a resigning offense. So that could mean a suspension or losing your seat as an MP. Now naturally, that could be a big issue, because if Boris Johnson did in a sounding turn of events. Find his way back into number 10 by next week. And then faces this investigation, which we understand will occur in November and go on for about three and a half weeks or thereabout. Then that could put the party into another phase of instability. And I think the British public is just getting quite impatient that they want the biggest issues that are facing this country address.

They're worried about their family members being sucked into it. TODD (on camera): Part of the irony of Vladimir Putin managing his image and his messaging on the war so carefully. Observers say is that there have been complaints from Russian families that the Russian government hasn't always been very good about giving information to the relatives of Russian soldiers that their sons have been killed or wounded in the war.

In a highly volatile start to the trading day on Wall Street this Friday the major averages seeing largeswings in early trade amid ongoing concerns about rising bond yields and the effort strengthening U.S. dollar. You've heard it all before. This week also notable for a relentless parade of downbeat economic exclamations from the likes of Jeff Bezos, the Amazon boss, former Amazon boss, Goldman Sachs CEO, David Solomon and Elon Musk, who are all worried about recession. A Conference Board Survey also shows an overwhelming 98 percent of U.S. CEOs anticipate a recession as well as possible layoffs. Cue a report from \"The Washington Post\" saying Elon Musk has discussed cutting some 75 percent of Twitter's workforce with potential investors if and when he takes control of the social media platform. Twitter shares currently down by more than 4 percent also on fears that the $44 billion takeover deal might be up for a U.S. national security review. And Elon Musk once again commenting on Russia's war in Ukraine after Russia's Former President Dmitry Medvedev tweeted about Liz Truss resignation in the UK stick with me. The Tesla CEO responded tweeting \"Pretty good troll to be honest\". By the way, how's it going in - Medvedev responded, \"See you in Moscow for Victory Day\". This is the reality on the ground. CNN's Fred Pleitgen was recently there - it's a place which has been dealing with a barrage of Russia and shelling. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PLEITGEN (on camera): So we're taking cover here because we just had some incoming artillery fire. We're going to wait and hope that there are not any hits anywhere close to us. PLEITGEN (voice over): We're at the receiving end of a full Russian artillery barrage. Photojournalist Richard Harlow tracks several of the projectiles whizzing close over our heads. She says Ukrainian troops face this kind of shelling several times a day. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Joining us now is Dan Ives Managing Director and Analyst at Wedbush Securities. Dan, great to have you with us! And forgive me this question for this question. But I feel if I were an investor, I would be asking you this. There's clearly much to discuss. And we know that Elon Musk is also helping Ukraine with the provision of Starlink Satellite Technology. But when you see him on Twitter, engaging with the Deputy Chairman of the Security Council in Russia, he always raises all sorts of questions. Dan, do you just stick to the fundamentals where Elon Musk and his businesses are concerned? Or is this arguably a worry an ongoing worry? DAN IVES, MANAGING DIRECTOR &amp; ANALYST, WEDBUSH SECURITIES: It's hard to ignore because it's just so horrific in terms of what's going on Ukraine, in fact, that Musk those tweets like that, Julia, it just keeps. The theme here is that and you've seen it in Tesla stock is that this is a CEO right now that continues to sort of get further and further away from really who he was called to three years ago. And I think that's part of the frustration with Twitter, you talk about the national security potential review, the 75 percent cuts, this is just a Twilight Zone circus show that continues to take other twists and turns with Musk leading the way.",

But I think that shows, his backs against the wall, he ultimately got into a horrific deal looking for any way in terms of from a financing perspective. And I think it just shows in terms of some of the desperation that you're seeing, to try to get outside financing because otherwise, it's a must that stuck with the bill, this deal is going to happen outside something anomalous.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): So it's been three years since you last hack me here in Vegas, Rachel. You have stolen about $2.5 worth of hotel points. O'SULLIVAN (on camera): A lot has changed. There's been a pandemic, there's a new president, I am still wearing the same shirt. RACHEL TOBAC, CEO AND CO-FOUNDER, SOCIAL PROOF SECURITY: Oh, yes. O'SULLIVAN (voice over): You have put me in a middle sea. R.TOBAC: I'm afraid-- O'SULLIVAN (on camera): Oh, my God! This time I mean, as far as I know, you haven't broken into any of my accounts so far, anything like that? R.TOBAC: No. I'm about to do that right now. O'SULLIVAN (on camera): OK. R.TOBAC: Most people, when they log into their accounts, they reuse their passwords, or they change it just ever so slightly. And when you do that, if you've been in a breach, which all of us have, that means I can take that password. And I can shove that into all the other sites that you log into. O'SULLIVAN (on camera): I have been using quite a few of the same passwords over the years. I've gotten a bit better with some accounts. R.TOBAC: I guess we'll find out. I'm going to go to a data breach repository site. And I'm going to put in your email address. You can see here that you're involved in 13 breaches, just with this email address alone. O'SULLIVAN (voice over): Wow! Online, there are sites that collect all that breach information like email addresses and passwords. And it's likely some of your data is in there, too. R.TOBAC: We have our first password that I found sounded familiar to you Donie? O'SULLIVAN (on camera): Yes, that's a password I still use today occasionally. R.TOBAC: OK. So you were using that on LinkedIn? O'SULLIVAN (on camera): Many times. O'SULLIVAN (voice over): Tip number one; don't use the same password for different services, your password for your Gmail should be different to the password for your Instagram. If one of these services gets attacked, and your password is leaked, hackers can use it to get into a different site if you're using that same password. R.TOBAC: The hackers got a lot of information, some of which included a hash. We also were able to crack one of your passwords. The other half is Evan is the other half of Social Security. I want to bring him in here and show you what it looked like when he cracked your password. O'SULLIVAN (on camera): Evan emerges from the darkness. R.TOBAC: --Evan.",
