This is all part of a broader effort by the White House to sell the president's accomplishments and take credit for those accomplishments. Including the Inflation Reduction Act which you'll remember included $370 billion meant to combat climate change.Now the president will visit Arizona first. And sources tell us that he is considering designates a new national monument around the grand canyon. It's something that native tribes have been lobbying for years. And it would prevent new drilling in the area. So the president really trying to bolster his climate agenda ahead of the 2024 election. Of course, this is a critical issue for key members of the Democratic coalition, progressives, young voters, people who haven't necessarily been satisfied with the president in this area so far. When it comes to drilling for fossil fuels. When it comes to cutting carbon emissions. The president really hoping to show voters that he is serious about combatting climate change. And now this is all part of a bigger effort by the Biden administration to take more credit for their economic agenda in the month of August. And you'll see the president, the vice president, members of the cabinet, all out talking about their economic record. And they do believe that they have a good story to tell. Inflation is easing, consumer sentiment is ticking up. And certainly hiring remains strong. But there does remain this disconnect with voters. In a poll last week by CNN, 75 percent said that they viewed economic conditions as poor. And that is translating into political headwinds for President Biden when it comes to his approval rating. So certainly, the challenge for President Biden as he gears up for reelection is to close that gap and remind voters of all that he has accomplished when it comes to the economy.

So for example, Corpus Christi on Monday looking at a high temperature right around that 97 degree mark. But with the humidity, it's going to feel more like 114. New Orleans, not much better. The high temperature likely just below triple digits but that heat index is going to feel more like 113.Even states farther to the West, we're looking at incredibly hot temperature. Albuquerque on Saturday topping out at 102 degrees. That is the hottest August date ever for this area. Now some good news for that city specifically. That is temperatures are going to start coming back down, into the 90s for much of the upcoming week. But keep in mind the average this time of year in Albuquerque is 90 degrees. So we're still expecting to be about five to seven degrees above normal. I guess that's better than the 10 to 15 degrees above normal that they've spent much of the summer. Records also possible for many locations not just today but even into Tuesday. You're looking at about 100 possible records today and tomorrow for some of these areas. And a few locations could break records both days in a row. Another concern is also going to be some severe thunderstorms. The target point is really New York stretching all the way back into Mississippi with the bull's-eye really going to be for cities like Washington, D.C., Charlotte, even stretching down into Atlanta. The main threats will be damaging winds and potential for large hail, but we can't rule out an isolated tornado.

This is after all the fifth coup that has happened in West Africa in such a short space of time. They want to act tough against that but that military action plan is not popular.Not least in Nigeria, where the Senate has rejected the President Tinubu's request for military action in Niger. And they're asking to find a more peaceful solution to this. The war -- the military action, is just not a popular move here. Many are fearful that this region which is always so fragile, and it's been hit by so much poverty and extremism from Al Qaeda, from ISIS, from Boca Haram, that this region could be further destabilized. So that the intervention is the very last resort. And as you say, the northern governors of the states that border Niger see this country, see Nigerians as their brothers. Their long historic and epic ties. Many in Niger speak the same language as people in Nigeria. So they don't want to be seen to go into a war with their brothers. And they've asked the president in this meeting, this crucial meeting held last night, to reconsider any planned military action. So, this is really the latest. And ECOWAS will be keen to explore all preventive diplomacy actions. But will the chiefs, head of states of ECOWAS, will they want to push forward in order not to lose credibility? That's what the analysts are asking. And so, it's really -- it's really at an impasse at the moment, Bianca. So it remains to be seen what will happen.",
