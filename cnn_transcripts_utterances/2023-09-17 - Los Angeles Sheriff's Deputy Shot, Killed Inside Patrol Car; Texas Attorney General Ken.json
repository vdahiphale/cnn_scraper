Now, we have seen this kind of scattered mandates pop back up throughout the country. And I think the key word there is scattered. But Ron DeSantis is trying to capitalize on those scattered mandates and say, hey guys, listen, these scattered mandates suggest that, you know, the left could be bringing down mass lockdowns. There is no evidence of that, but it is something that is a big concern for Republican voters. Now, will it continue to be a concern if we don't see mask mandates? I don't know. The second issue that he has been really big on is the LGBTQ issue, and he has been very strong with his stance on transgender issues. And so, his super PAC is trying to hit Trump on Trump's past support over some comments he made when -- during his first presidential run on transgender topics.

      "sentences": "Hi there, Victor. Well, first all, I think a lot of people were shocked when they saw those videos as to what the fighting in that area which is south of Bakhmut has turned those little settlements into. That one that we just saw is a settlement of Andriivka which was very small to begin with. But we can just see as those forces are going through there that the fighting that has been going on there over the past couple of months has turned that area essentially into a moonscape.We can see especially in that fog, you know, the few houses that were in that settlement, most of them reduced to just the foundations and rubble as well. Nevertheless, the Ukrainians say that the gains they have been able to make around Bakhmut are actually quite important for them. These are very small settlements, but they do allow the Ukrainians to target Russian supply lines into Bakhmut. The Ukrainians are saying -- and I was able to speak to the deputy defense minister yesterday, that the Russians are trying to hold on to Bakhmut almost at all costs. It's a big political thing for them. A big P.R. thing for them. It's basically the last big victory they say that they have had on the battlefield. So, the Ukrainians say that right now around that Bakhmut area, that's one of the main areas of fighting. Now, with the Ukrainians making those advances, it is, of course, also very important for them not just on the battlefield, but also as the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is set to head to the United States this coming week to not only be at the U.N. General Assembly, but also, of course, to meet with President Biden as well. And the Ukrainians are saying from their vantage point they, obviously, want the United States to continue the current support that is going on. And they say they especially need the longer-range tactical missiles called ATACMS with which they could attack the Russians' supply lines further than they have been. So far, F-16s is longer down the line. But one of the things that they keep telling us in the short term that they need to keep this offensive going that sort of sluggish in the south, picking up little pace in the east is ammunition, is 155- millimeter artillery ammunition and then more ammunition for HIMARS as well. The U.S. has been supplying that. But the deputy defense minister told me yesterday that there are some areas on the front line where the Ukrainians are trying to advance but where they have 10 times less firepower than the Russians have, where for every shot that the Ukrainians take, the Russians are able to shoot 10 times. Now, the Ukrainians say the western systems, of course, get you further, are more accurate. But still, that ratio is one that makes it very difficult for them. They do say that on the whole, yes, the offensive that they launched is somewhat sluggish, but they also say the fact of the matter is right now on pretty much all areas of the front line, the Ukrainians are the ones who have the initiative and the Russians are on the defensive. And they say that, in itself, is certainly something that helps their motivation. And certainly, they say they will also take to the U.S. and its allies to say, look, continue that support. It's definitely making a difference, guys.",

Ukraine has to fight in that area in order to regain the lost territory that Russia took, first of all, in 2014.As to the ATACMS, you know, truthfully, I can't say. There is a lot of debate and discussion that goes into this kind of arms transfer or what's called a presidential drawdown. That equipment just isn't extra, Victor. It's allocated towards other contingencies and other fights. And in the case of ATACMS, there are very few weapon systems. Now, you know, there has been a bunch of numbers thrown around that, oh, the U.S. has 5,000 missiles, they could give a few to Ukraine. These are long-range missiles that strike deeply buried targets with a great amount of destructive force, and they are used specifically for some contingency -- or planned specifically, I should say, for some contingency operations that the U.S. has. Whenever the U.S. draws down equipment from any of their sources or from any of these plans, it puts things at risk. So, I am not going to say whether or not -- I can't say whether or not the U.S. will make the decision of giving some ATACMS, but truthfully there are a lot of other weapons systems like the Storm Shadow that are much more effective in hitting long-range targets than some of the ATACMS systems. But this has been a mantra from Ukraine of, give us the ATACMS. And everyone has picked up on that without really understanding what the ATACMS does, how it is used and how it can be countered by Russian electronic warfare and air defense systems.",

      "sentences": "Well, this really underscores the humanitarian logistical challenges that President Joe Biden faces on the U.S. Mexico border. In this case, it's about overcrowding as officials have seen more border crossings in recent weeks. And in some cases have had to separate children from their parents while they're in custody because the family holding areas are already crowded.Now, what we learned in this filing again from that pediatrician is that over the course of site visits to a facility in the Rio Grande Valley area, he interviewed children who said they had been separated from their parents, some for days and some as young as 8 years old and we're not aware of protocols to see or request to see their parents. Now, a CBP official that I spoke with said that these are rare circumstances, that they try to keep those separations brief if they have to happen, and that the families are released together. It's important to note here. This is different from what we saw under the Trump administration where there were family separations. Those families remain separated, and in some cases, parents were deported without children. That is not the case here. But all the same, the pediatrician in this filing called it \"profoundly traumatic for children.\" Now, in a statement, a customs and border protection spokesperson said the following, \"The health and safety of individuals in our custody, our workforce, and communities we serve is paramount. They went on to say that DHS and CBP prioritize keeping families together at every step of the immigration process and have protocols to that end. But again, officials that I've spoken with have noted that over the last several weeks, there has been an increase in border crossings, especially families. And that is a vulnerable population that has posed a unique challenge to multiple administrations because these are short-term facilities. They're not equipped for people to stay long term and they are certainly not equipped for families. And so, these holding areas -- there's family holding areas -- family -- holding areas for children, and also for single adults, as they become crowded, can create circumstances where children are separated from their parents. Again, as you noted from the top there, they are rare but it really underscores and highlights that this is an ongoing challenge and one that could get worse as those border crossings go up.
