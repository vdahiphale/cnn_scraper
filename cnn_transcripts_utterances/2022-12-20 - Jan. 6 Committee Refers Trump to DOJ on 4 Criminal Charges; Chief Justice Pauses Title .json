Now, the congressional panel making history by recommending criminal charges against former President Donald Trump. They called it a road map to justice for the Capitol insurrection.

And he'll be facing a pile of criminal referrals, just announced by the January 6th Committee.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) REP. BENNIE THOMPSON (D-MI): We are prepared to share our final findings with you. REID (voice-over): In a historic hearing, lawmakers on the January 6th Committee laid out why they believe the Justice Department should pursue at least four criminal charges against former President Trump. REP. ELAINE LURIA (D-VA): President Trump lit the flame. He poured gasoline on the fire and sat by in the White House dining room for hours, watching the fire burn. And today, he still continues to fan -- to fan those flames. REID (voice-over): Lawmakers concluded there is evidence of obstruction of an official proceeding; conspiracy to defraud the United States; false statements to the federal government; and inciting or assisting an insurrection. REP. JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD): The president's actions could certainly trigger other criminal violations. REID (voice-over): The committee also released a summary of its final report Monday, describing in extensive detail how Trump tried to pressure anyone who wasn't willing to help him overturn his election defeat while knowing that many of his claims were not true.

Instead, prosecutors have relied on laws related to violence, obstruction, and a few cases that you've seen of seditious conspiracy. But with the committee set to release its full report in the coming days that could include tens of thousands of pages of transcripts, potentially hours of footage from the interviews with thousands of witnesses, it will obviously be up to Attorney General Merrick Garland to decide what's next.

They didn't really know what was there until they got testimony from witnesses. It was an investigation that unfolded in front of the public. But here, you had a committee that was unified in terms of what it was doing. There were not any obstructionists on this committee. They put it together very succinctly.

What's really interesting and which got very little attention in this discussion, because we're all focused on who's going to lock up the president, is that going to happen? What kind of historic moment are we in the middle of? Is the issue of the intelligence failure. The committee's report says they had the intel from the FBI, from DHS, from Secret Service, from Jack Donohue's intel team at the Capitol Police. And they all got most of it right. What was interesting is, who's in the feedback loop of that intel? It was not just going to law enforcement, but it was also going to the White House.

Now, that sounds counterintuitive, of course, because Title 42 allows Border Patrol agents to swiftly return migrants to Mexico.

That's a humanitarian-type parole that allows migrants to go to ports of entry, a handful of them, like the ones you see behind me, and actually get processed. And so they'd rather wait in line, wait in these camps to get one of those exceptions to Title 42. And Kaitlan and Don, I've covered this before. I can tell you, the U.S. government has issued thousands of those exceptions to Title 42. And you can't have exceptions to Title 42 without Title 42.",

FLORESyear you just look at the data. The number of migrants, the surge was being driven by migrants from Central America, from Mexico. And so Title 42 was a very effective tool for the U.S. government, because they were able to apply it and swiftly return those migrants back to Mexico. Well, late in the summer, if you look at the data, the numbers show you this. The surge was driven by migrants from Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua. And so those countries, Mexico wasn't taking them back; and the U.S. government has very frosty relationships with those countries, so they couldn't take them back. And so that's why we saw back in October an extension to Title 42 to include Venezuelans. And that's when we started to see the camps built in Mexico, because Venezuelans knew that if they crossed the border, they could be returned very swiftly under Title 42.",

That would really shore up the vice president's role as just a ceremonial one on a day like January 6th that we saw two years ago. We also expect that this bill will include $45 billion in Ukraine aid, as well as $40 billion in supplemental funding for floods, fires and other natural disasters across the country.

And of course, this is the last vehicle, this huge funding bill, to move through Capitol Hill. So it's very, very important that anything that lawmakers want to include gets put in this bill.
