A week and a half ago, Dali was charged in federal court with one count of being a stowaway on a vessel or aircraft without consent. Among other things, the judge ordered Dali to wear an ankle bracelet with a GPS monitor, surrender any travel documents, and told her she cannot go to airports or leave the area where she is staying. That includes, of course, jumping on a Greyhound bus to Canada. Dali had been staying with a roommate. A law enforcement source told CNN, her roommate reported her missing after he saw her GPS ankle bracelet on the floor. Randi Kaye, CNN, Palm Beach County, Florida. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

He's sworn in, in just 34 days. However, it is one step closer to becoming official today. As you said, in state capitals across the country, electors, slates of electors are meeting today to essentially cast the votes that actually matter. Yes, 150 million Americans voted back on Election Day, but this is how America elects presidents, by the Electoral College. So, we are going to see state by state by state sort of a go down as the day goes along here to essentially ratify the outcome of November 5th. And you mentioned those fake electors. I mean, certainly a brighter light was shined on the process of how presidents are elected four years ago when Donald Trump refused to accept his defeat. So, there were slates of fake electors in some states. Well, they are real electors this afternoon in several states. And we are seeing Maryland, I believe is right there. That is the - where the process is beginning today. And as the day goes along, state by state we'll do these. But it is largely a ceremonial. But we saw four years ago it wouldn't have to be.

And then, of course, on January 6th, as we well remember from a four years ago, this actually becomes official in Congress. But she will be presiding over this role of accepting her defeat. We, of course, remember that from Al Gore doing this back when he lost to George W. Bush. But there have been some law changes. So, even if she wanted to, she could not overturn the outcome there.

We don't tell people to stop their cancer drugs to test it against another one. What we do is we build both of them on the back of the individual who's being treated and so that in fact we can say, well, with this drug you even did better.With the polio vaccine we actually did do studies where we looked at the newer vaccines versus the older vaccines at the same time. So, these studies are there. And for him to continue to say they're not confuses the public. It's not truthful.

But what happens is by casting this doubt on them, if I'm a new parent and I'm sitting here wanting to make sure that this is as safe as possible situation for my child, I'll say, well, maybe I'll hold off the vaccine because it sounds like maybe there's a problem with it. That's exactly how we're going to see more and more kids not vaccinated, and more and more kids becoming ill. Don't forget, measles on average kills one out of every thousand kids that get infected with it.

The source tells CNN Ukraine's security service was behind the attack, which happened just four miles from the Kremlin.An attorney for Jay-z calls the sexual assault allegation against him a fantasy. A woman who was identified as Jane Doe alleges Jay-z, along with Sean Combs, assaulted her back in 2000 when she was 13. Jay-z's attorney showed photographs placing him at a Manhattan venue the night in question. And the lawyer says the accuser's story is not plausible because of the time it would take for him to go from that venue to the suburbs, where the accuser said she was assaulted. She recently admitted to her - some inconsistencies in her account, but her attorney insists his firm thoroughly vetted her claims. Jay-z's legal team has now sued the woman's attorney, accusing him of trying to shake down innocent celebrities. All right, this morning, a new frontier for rats. Researchers at the University of Richmond train them to drive little cars. And apparently they liked doing it. They would give the rats the option to walk or drive to a pile of Fruit Loops. And, obviously, the rats chose to drive. Next, they may try to see whether the rats like to race each other. I can tell you right now, the answer is yes. All right, we have important chicken nugget news this morning. A brand-new option, apparently, at Taco Bell this week. I'm not 100 percent sure why this is news. Is there controversy over this? If there's not, I'm sure there will be. We need controversy over chicken nuggets. These ones are marinated in jalapeno buttermilk and coated in tortilla chips and breadcrumbs.
