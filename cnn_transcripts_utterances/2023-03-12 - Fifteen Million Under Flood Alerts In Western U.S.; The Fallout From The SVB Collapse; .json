I'm Laila Harrak.15 million people under flood alerts in California and Nevada as yet another new storm approaches. We'll take you to Monterey County. The fallout from the Silicon Valley Bank collapse as customers wait to hear if they will recover their money. Many worry if it will lead to even more bank closures. And in Israel, hundreds of thousands take to the streets to protest the prime minister's plan to overhaul the court system. We're live in Tel Aviv to discuss why some see the plan as a step away from democracy. We begin this hour in the Western U.S. where 15 million people in California and Nevada are under flood alerts. And some of those flood watches have now been extended through Wednesday. And even as the rain tapers off and flooding slowly improves across much of California for now, more rain is expected Sunday. And the next big storm system is forecast to arrive late Monday night and last through at least Wednesday. Well, that would be the 11th atmospheric river event of the season. There are concerns especially in Monterey County where a breached levee has already flooded one town and emergency crews have rescued more than 90 people. CNN's Mike Valerio has that story.",

And we had the opportunity to interview a spokesman from Cal Fire, one of the agencies responding to this effort. Take a listen when he told us they realized the levee had a breach and how many rescue operations they've accomplished in the early hours so far. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CAPT. CURTIS RHODES, CAL FIRE: We were notified of the levee breached at midnight last night. So, we deployed down here 3:00 A.M. this morning. We did have the high water team with us. That's part of the emergency operation center. They have been countywide this week. They have their high water vehicles and have been successful in nine rescue high water rescue situations this morning. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And just to set the scene, I mean, we have been really, for four decades now, in kind of a falling rate environment. So, the way banks operate, the way businesses operate in general is sort of predicated on interest rates being low. That's changed now. Interest rates are going up. So, what did that do to Silicon Valley Bank? Well, this was a bank that was kind of a go-to bank for California investors, for venture capitalists, and there was so much money pouring into this bank at the beginning of the pandemic when tech stocks really boomed because everybody was online and we all needed technology. All the money that was being created in the valley when into the bank, they didn't have enough places to really lend it out so they started investing it in government bonds.Now, the yields on those bonds haven't really changed but the amount they have to pay in deposits has been going up as interest rates go up. Now, that leads to a mismatch essentially between supply and demand on the balance sheet and that's what took Silicon Valley Bank down. The question is, is it going to spread? And I think the answer might be yes to some of the smaller institutions that have been playing the game of trying to get more money from deposits.",

Those institutions, the JPMorgans, the Citigroups, they're pretty well capitalized. They've come under a lot of regulation in higher capital standards since 2008.Now, I will say that, recently, banks of all sizes have been pushing back against the idea of holding more capital. I think those arguments are going to be very hard to sustain when you see an incident like this. It just kind of reminds everybody that, hey, we need to know the regulatory is safe, we need to make sure that the bank's business models are safe. I wouldn't be surprised to see some smaller institutions have a ripple out effect, and also private equity, I think, shadow banks are going to be under more scrutiny because of this.",

I think we're going to see on Monday what the market thinks about this.One thing that I would expect just looking out even beyond the week a little bit longer term, midterm, I think you're probably going to see a continued slowdown in the tech sector, because what this says to me is people are going to be a little anxious about what's happening in the valley, in general. I think it could also mean that maybe the Fed is going to rethink hiking rates this fast or maybe they're going to slow, pull back a little bit on the size of rate hikes.

There has been an unprecedented wave of pilots in the Israeli airports who were joining these demonstrations and warning that they signed up to serve in the military of a democratic country and they will not serve in a dictatorship. And we're seeing people who fought in all of Israeli's wars, including some of the veterans of the 1948 war for Israel's independence, join these protests and say, again, we fought to establish here a Jewish democratic homeland, now we are seeing an attempt to erode democracy here and create something much more similar to formerly democratic counties, and that is not what we fought for, that is not the vision we have for this country.",

We're seeing it even in some religious communities. We're seeing it not just in Tel Aviv, where you had more than 200,000 people demonstrate yesterday but also in peripheral parts of Israel that are usually considered strongholds of Netanyahu's Likud Party. And so it's spreading all over the country and it's reaching also parts of the economy system here that usually stayed away from politics and from demonstrations, whether it's the high tech sector that is warning the government. This plan would weaken Israel as the start of nation and hurt the Israeli tech engine. We're seeing even the banks warning the government that they're seeing a phenomenon of Israelis pulling their money out of the country because of this plan.

He tweeted in a private capacity that, in his words, the plan was immeasurably cruel, directed at the most vulnerable people in language, again, his words, that is not dissimilar to that used by Germany in the 30s. Now, some M.P.s here in England took umbrage to that. BBC three days later suggested that he would step away from presenting the football highlight show match of the day until, quote, we have an agreed and clear position on his use of social media. But the groundswell of support for him was massive. His co-presenters and pundits say they too would step away from the show.

That was put to the BBC director general, Tim Davie, yesterday. He said he wouldn't be drawn into what he described as hypotheticals. But the problem for this is that the BBC had a contract with the Premier League here in England to show those highlights every week and to have that preview show as well, got to do it again next week. If they don't, they could well be in breach. Now, I'm not a legal expert, I'm sure we'll get somebody on who will tell us what the ramifications are, but, certainly, it would appear that with Gary Lineker not backing down and others are prepared to stand in his corner, two things, A, it could well spill outside of sport and, B, there is no end to this any time soon.",
