Wehave producers around the world, calling airports, calling airlines, to try to figure out. And as you can expect, there is an anticipation that there could be delays and even cancellations in the coming hours and potentially days. We do know that, in the U.S., there is going to be a ground delay program to address the backlog domestically. That again you can only expect will result in those delays and cancellations around the world. I just want to read you what we know so far. Air Canada, that is a foreign carrier with the most flights into that U.S., they say their cross border operations will be affected. They don't know yet to what extent. They are going to put in a goodwill policy in place, Becky, for travelers to try to figure out what their next steps are, what their next plans. Virgin Atlantic says already some of the U.S. flights have been affected. British Airways says it's continuing to operate normally but we've already seen on the board, inside the airports, that there are some delays already there in place. Amsterdam airport as well, saying it expects some potential delays for Paris. Paris as well, Charles de Gaulle, saying they have yet to see any cancellations but also potential delays. And then here, of course, at Heathrow Airport, we have already gotten eyewitness testimony from one passenger, who said that they were sitting on an American Airlines flight for three hours, waiting for it to take off as a result of this outage. And Heathrow Airport in particular has been suffering. It has had staff shortages, lost thousands of staff during the pandemic. During the holiday season, there were backups and delays due to strike actions by transportation groups across this country. So this really compounds an already difficult travel period.",

Right now, there are conflicting reports about that battle for Soledar. Let's bring in Scott McLean. He is in Kyiv. He's been talking to his sources and studying what is going on on the ground.

So the only person at this stage,, Becky who says that they are in control of Soledar, the strategic town inthe eastern part of Ukraine in the Donbas region, is the Wagner chief, who says that they are completely in control of the territory of Soledar. But not even the Kremlin is acknowledging that that is the case. They say it is trending in that direction. Of course, the Ukrainians say that is not that case at all. They continue to fight, even if troops are regrouping. And so, it is a very mixed messaging. The Russian defense ministry says that their troops have managed, their paratroopers have managed to block off the northern and southern part of the town. And they have what they call assault squads. That is essentially doing the fighting on the ground, building to building, with small arms. Perhaps though the most unvarnished view that we got came late yesterday, when CNN actually managed to reach a soldier, a Ukrainian soldier fighting on the front line. He said that the reality is that these front lines are changing so quickly. One moment the house is yours; the next minute the house belongs to Wagner. And the front lines are moving all the time. But he said that a big chunk of the city, at least as of late yesterday, was this gray zone that both sides claimed to control and frankly where a lot of the fighting was taking place. He also said that both sides are taking a heavy number of casualties. They are also replacing those casualties very quickly. The Ukrainian side, he said, new troops were coming in so quickly that he doesn't even have time to memorize their call signs before he's actually going out and fighting alongside them. What I also found interesting about what he said, Becky, is that he said everyone understands that the city will have to be abandoned; in other, words the Ukrainians are going to have to withdraw. They are going to have to retreat at some point. The question is, when might that be? His question is, why the command to retreat hasn't happened already, given that the Ukrainians have said before that they are not against the possibility of potentially moving back if it meant preserving lives so that those troops can live to fight another day.",

JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT:  Becky, what we know is that we're talking about 10 documents so far that have been turned over by the president's legal team to the National Archives, now being reviewed by the Justice Department, by the FBI. And they have to do, as you pointed, out with briefing memos that were prepared for Biden when he was vice president during the Obama administration. They had to do with countries including the United Kingdom, Iran and Ukraine, dating back to the Obama administration period. The White House and the president seem to be indicating that they believe that there is not much here to worry about, that this is probably going to be over soon because we're going to hear a lot more about what happened and what was in this. Not so sure that's exactly the way the law enforcement people feel about this. There is a decision to be made by the attorney general, Merrick Garland, as to whether to make this a full-blown investigation, not just a review. That will be something that would take a lot longer to complete, including, perhaps, even appointing a special counsel. Of course, as you know, politics being what it is, Republicans are already seizing on this. And they believe that there is a lot more here to be investigated. Listen to Kevin McCarthy, the new speaker, talking about what he thinks is hypocrisy on this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE SPEAKER:  It's hypocrisy. Think about this. They've gotten away with so much for so long. This was discovered before the last election. Why weren't they raided? Why didn't they have the FBI coming in? Why didn't he and \"60 Minutes\" say I understand that because I have the same problem. They think the law doesn't apply to them. They think they write their own.
