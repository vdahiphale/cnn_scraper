In addition to that, they've been telling me that they are worried that if he fall short of a 20 point gap in any way hey, but that's going to be viewed as a disappointment at a time which they really need to be building momentum. Do they think he's going to win tonight? Yes. Do they think its going to be decisive victory? Yes. But the big question is, how big is that margin going to be? Will it give Donald Trump the momentum he needs going into New Hampshire? Will it stop the momentum that Nikki Haley has going into New Hampshire. That is what they are looking for and Donald Trump himself has been doing his part. He has been urging his supporters to show up in caucus.

He is not -- he is not shaken control over somewhere between 40 and 50percent of the parties since the beginning of this process, right? And so, it really would take something extraordinary for that dynamic to radically change and for the candidates who are, it seems vying for second and third here. I think at this point, that Nikki Haley, and Ron DeSantis are acknowledging Trump is likely to win. It's still unclear what they think second or third will get them, and certainly third really calls into question both or either of their campaigns and the road forward to them.",

He is not really campaign there near as much as she has.And what Trump world is hoping for is that this race for second place continues after tonight because they believe that that is actually going to bend if it him going forward and their concern is if Nikki Haley does do well tonight, if Ron DeSantis is a third, if this is the end of his campaign, that then it consolidates Nikki Haley as the clear Trump alternative going into New Hampshire and they don't want to see that.

That's really what he pitches to voters, that he can deliver on the promises that he makes. Then he points to Florida as the example.But I'm told by a source familiar with the plans that tonight at the caucus sites, the many people who will be talking on his behalf to people there who are preparing devote that they wont be talking about that, that instead they're going to be talking about Ron DeSantis, the person, to really humanize him for some of these voters, to really talk about, I'm told, fights that he's taken on, on these people's behalf, moments of personal connection that they've witnessed to really, again, drive home his human side. We know he's quite reluctant to talk about himself on the campaign stage. She will bring his kids out. He'll talk about his children. It took awhile for him to talk about his military experience, for example. But advisers and people close to him want him to talk more about this.

But if she comes in number three, that's not damaging to them.And the reason for that is because of how much resources and time Ron DeSantis and former President Trump had put into the state. By contrast, she just hasn't put as much effort into the state as she has you know, across the board and to New Hampshire. And, of course, heading into South Carolina. They point out that Ron DeSantis, really the stakes, couldn't be higher for him, given the fact that he has a 99-county operation, that he has the backing of Iowa's governor, that he has the backing of Iowa's top evangelical leader. And they also point out that the former president has touted the possibility of winning this state by 50 or 60 points. So they feel like they are in a good position tonight with one of the folks who's familiar with the Haley camp's thinking, telling me, quote, it's not do or die for us tonight in Iowa.",

There are people coming in.They are registering those who are Republicans. You see the gentlemen there. And that fabulous bright jacket they will go show their ID and they'll look at the roles, bring him in. There's also -- you have the capability of changing parties, but you have to register as if you're just registering for the first time. So you have to register. We've seen people do that here, too. We've seen a couple of people come in and register to be Republican, so that it can take part in the caucus. I'm giving you a look because this is the rec center. It's quite a huge, wonderful building that gives a lot of space to folks. This is another caucus site here. And then there's one more. So, there's a lot of space. And one of the reasons for that is, is that when they start the count, Jake, you will start hearing everyone talking at the same time, once about 20 or 30 minutes in after everyone is seated. They have their captains. They're ready to do the count that have their counters. You're going to see people start yelling out names and they'll say things like, this is another caucus site right here, another precinct right here. You will hear people start saying names of the candidates. They will fill out what they have been given, which is a pre-printed piece of paper that has the candidates' names on it, people will choose those. They will hand those in. It's secret ballot. So you hand them all it. And then all of a sudden, the counters will start counting out loud. So, we'll be able to hear in real time at each six of these precincts exactly who's doing well, who's going to be sort the number one candidate. And so what you'll hear people yell out, Trump, we've got one for Trump here. We've got one for Haley here, we've got one for DeSantis here. And you'll hear that throughout this whole building, it will reverberate and will show that to you as soon because it happens 20 to 30 minutes into its pretty quick.

This is opening day of 2024, and that was interview was just a fabulous snapshot of what I'm finding when you're out on the road as well, disaffected Americans who don't know where their political home is.A man who caucused for the Democrats voted for Donald Trump, considered Vivek Ramaswamy and then lands on Nikki Haley. [19:40:06] That's a ping pong of politics. And I say that with full respect, no disrespect at all. That's how people feel. Where is my home? Who do I trust, who represents me? And that's what makes this so unpredictable. And so, Kate is in a place that as she notes, Story County, right. This is a plus 17 Democratic county. If we come up to the 2020 map, Donald Trump won Iowa huge. She's in one of the places that Joe Biden won. She's in a Democratic county. If you have people who used to vote for the Democrats -- yes, he was a Trump voter in 2020, but now still participating with Republicans. That's good for the Republicans. They're bringing in new voters are solidifying with this gentleman who voted with them for years ago. It's bad for Democrats. It means you're not winning people who you once had on your side. But so come back out here. Number one, Joe Biden, win Story County. Now, let's bring it back out and bring it back. Doesn't want to come back out. Okay. Well, let's come back to 2016 and see if we come to the Republican primary here. As this is a Marco Rubio area, as Kate just noted. The lighter red is Marco Rubio. What does that mean? Traditional Republicans, that's a place Nikki Haley, the old Republican Party, if you will, has to do well tonight. So the fact that that gentleman, a former Democrat and a former Trump voter says he's for Nikki Haley is one sign of what Nikki Haley needs to do to build not only in that community center where Kate is, but where Sara Sidner was over here. She's in Linn County in Cedar Rapids. Ted Cruz won this last time. Joe Biden will probably Linn County come November or the Democratic candidate, assuming its Joe Biden. But where it was -- what was Donald Trump's kryptonite in 2018, 2020.2022, the suburbs, right? That's why Ted Cruz did better than Donald Trump in the suburbs. He was third in this county in 2016. And if you come into the 2020 presidential map, again, Joe Biden wins this county the by six points there. So do we see some seeds? If Donald Trump wins Iowa tonight, as good for Donald Trump. But is it just rural voters, just evangelicals, just farmers? Or is he beginning to recover at least suburban Republicans, you know, them outside of Philadelphia as well. Now some of them are moderate, some of them people who swing back and forth. But for Donald Trump good to be a competitive general election candidate, he has to start to win back suburbanites, starting with Republicans, then moving on to independence and soft Democrats. So this is the 2020 map. Again, Brian Todd was over here. He's in Pottawattamie County. This is -- that's Nebraska, right? So, you're now much more rural, much more conservatives, you get out here, come back to 2016 in the Republican primary this is a place again, crews Trump Rubio. You had this split. Do you get this again tonight? Now that its Donald Trumps party, do you get a split so that Haley or DeSantis or both can argue I have a rationale to go on or does Trump win this in when this big, this is a place if you come out here to look at the map again and bring out 2016, Iowa. This is out here. This is where Trump needs to run it up. If Trump wants to get above 50 percent, he wants to quiet any talk that he's vulnerable where Brian Todd is tonight is a great place to watch.",

Many more people have shown up than they anticipated. So here's what they've got to do.Our photographer, David Albriten (ph), can maybe take you pass these folks and show you what they're giving to people now. Sheets of paper from a small yellow legal pad. That's what they're handing out to people in order to facilitate their ability to vote tonight because they have run out of ballots. The turnout here, exceptional, much better than they anticipated. They've also got to set up more chairs in here. I'm going to scoot over here while David shows you people checking in and getting their paper ballots. And then David will come over here and kind of zoom past me into the room that is pretty much at capacity. Mary Ann Hanusa, who's running the organizational part of this, tells me that they're going to have to set up more chairs in there. I can already see people standing in the back row so this is going to be called to order shortly. She did say that people who are in line right now when this is caucus is going to be called to order in about five minutes will be allowed to continue to register and check in before they start the caucus. So the short answer to the obvious question is -- yes, they will delay this for a couple of minutes in order to get people checked in and into the room so that the caucus can start -- Jake.",

You see here 54 percent of those arriving at the caucus sites called themselves very conservatives. These numbers will update even as we go through them here, 34 percent say somewhat conservative.It's a very conservative electorate. In fact, it's more conservative than it was eight years ago. This number was 40 percent, eight years ago, of self-identified, very conservative voters. The view on banning most or all abortion nationwide. We asked about 60 percent of Iowa Republican caucusgoers tonight, at least these early arrivers tell us they favor a national abortion ban, only 32 percent say they oppose it. And in terms of the overall issue set driving voters decision, the most important issues for these Iowa Republican caucusgoers, immigration at 37 percent, the economy at 36 percent, abortion at 11 percent, foreign policy at 11 percent. This is an electorate largely driven by the immigration issue and economy.",
