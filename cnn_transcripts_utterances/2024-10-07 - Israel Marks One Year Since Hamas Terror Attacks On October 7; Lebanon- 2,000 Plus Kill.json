And today is obviously not only a day of mourning in Israel, a day of commemoration for the victims sharing the stories of their loved ones whose lives were cut short on that very dark day one year ago. But, of course, it is also an opportunity for the families of the hostages to also talk about the plight of their loved ones as 97 hostages who were taken on October 7th are still in Gaza today, still being held captive amid the inertia that we are seeing on the political scene in terms of no prospects right now of real negotiations to see their release. And today, I spoke with Aviva Siegel, former hostage herself, whose husband, Keith, an American Israeli, is still being held hostage in Gaza. She talked to me about the moment when she was being held in Gaza with her husband, Keith, and she was going to be filmed by Hamas, and he told her not to cry.

As you mentioned, nearly 42,000 people killed according to U.N. data, more than half of them women and children. Important to underscore, of course, that this is not over. We continue to see airstrikes across the Gaza Strip just in the last few hours. It has been confirmed that we have seen yet more airstrikes around the Jabalia refugee camp in the north. This is an area where the Israeli military has issued fresh evacuation orders. It has told civilians to move to the Al-Mawasi coastal area, a designated safe zone, and has said that it will be focusing on the Jabalia area, targeting what it has described as a resurgence of Hamas militants in the area. Of course, what we have seen over the last few days is a series of airstrikes targeting this northern region, but we've also seen Israeli military forces on the ground and circling the refugee camp. And, of course, these evacuation orders do come in sporadically across the Gaza Strip for civilians. It's unclear how many of these civilians are actually getting these evacuation orders directly or whether through word of mouth, as you can understand, communication are fought across the Gaza Strip. And we are also hearing of evacuation orders now across several neighborhoods in parts of Southern Gaza surrounding the Khan Yunis area, where we know, of course, thousands of civilians are still displaced, taking shelter in this region. Again, they have been told to evacuate to the Al-Mawasi coastal area. The Israeli military has said it will be using its full force against what it believes to be Hamas militants in the area and targets in the area. But again, these are all very densely populated areas. It is hard to avoid civilian casualties in these areas. And, of course, important to underscore that these humanitarian zones that have been designated, namely the Al- Mawasi coastal area, have been shrinking in size over the last few months. They are packed full of civilians and have also come under attack in the past. So there are no real guarantees of safety in these humanitarian zones. And, of course, this is all happening as Gaza continues to grapple with a worsening, deepening humanitarian crisis, still not enough aid getting in, still not enough medical supplies getting in. The vast majority of hospitals in Gaza completely now overrun and not functional. Of course what we've also seen in the weekend is a deepening of strikes in Central Gaza as well, particularly those surrounding the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital compound. So that is also, of course, extremely concerning for civilians who have been taking shelter there and, of course, for the civilians who are desperately in need of medical care at one of the last remaining hospitals in the Gaza Strip.",

And even though we feel like we've heard so much about Israel and Palestine in the last year, we didn't hear from the real people and the ground, the real stories of their homes, their communities, their families' histories. I spoke with hundreds of families for this interview, for this book, people who came from Arab countries, from the former Soviet Union, from Europe. And all of them are sharing a trauma that is a trauma of generations. We get to see the personal stories woven together with the larger, you know, political and historical picture. So if you really, you know, this time, people really want to understand better the Israeli history and the history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, I think this 100 stories are giving us a window, a way to better understand history from the perspective of the everyday people, you know, mothers and fathers, they just try to live their lives, children that try to go to school. I bring in the book, you know, different stories of different communities. For example, there's the story of Eitan (PH), a refugee from Ukraine, part of a community of 50,000 Ukrainian refugees who fled to after Putin's aggression in 2022 just to find themselves escaping Hamas again, you know. Eitan is saying, why am I escaping again rockets now from Lebanon, now from Iran? I'm just a kid who want to live, you know.

I want to ask you, how has Israeli sentiments about this war changed over the past 12 months? I mean, October 8th, Israel, and really, honestly, most of the world, was very united in terms of the war in Gaza. And then, eventually, a lot of Israelis became very disillusioned with Netanyahu, with what his priorities were, with whether or not he actually genuinely cared about the hostages and whether or not there was more sort of self- interest at stake here. Just give us a sense of how Israeli political opinion about the war has evolved over the past 12 months. NOA LANDAU, DEPUTY EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, HAARETZ: Yes. So, you know, a memorial is usually something that you do when you want to look back and remember something. But these events are very much still alive. I think this whole year has been, you know, one big continuing memorial. Israelis are, you know, remembering this every day. If you look at Israeli media, you would see that, you know, each day on, you know, television, newspapers, media in general, there's always a testimony. There's always, you know, someone talking about that day. So in many -- in a lot of the aspects, Israel never, you know, doing this memorial, it's not really something that we left behind and we're looking back at. It's something that we're living still every day. And the other thing that's really important to remember is that this is not something, you know, that something that happened and it's just fate. There's also a political decision here. And, you know, referring to your question. Um, this is very much a political decision if there is or there isn't a deal because there is an option to make a deal that will also end this war in Gaza and also release the prisoners and the decision, whether or not to make that deal is political.

I think a lot of what we've seen this past year, including, you know, some of the bigger operations in the region is also, you know, the IDF trying to win this trust back and regarding an investigation. Again, this is a political decision. The government does not want to be investigated. They keep, you know, throw -- they're in the blame game. They throw the blame ball on each other. Netanyahu was trying to blame the army itself. They're not willing, you know, to allow serious national investigation into this matter.

And, of course, so have the Palestinians as well. And so my question to you is, given the fact that the objective, just in terms of the stated objective of this war was, of course, to completely destroy and dismantle Hamas. And we're not really anywhere closer to that objective. And, obviously, there's been a lot that has been achieved militarily, but psychologically, Hamas is very much alive. What does that mean for the war going forward?",

There are some things that you can say that somehow work tactically. But strategically, I think you're right. The thing is that you cannot -- there isn't such a thing the Israeli government keeps saying, the slogan total victory. There isn't such a thing as total victory when you're fighting, not only, you know, physical infrastructure, but also an idea. So I think many Israelis, as I think Bianna mentioned before, quite disillusioned, you know, with the idea that there is such a thing as total victory. And the most important thing is that we're currently doing memorials and ceremonies. The ceremonies are important, you know, to raise the awareness, but we're currently doing ceremonies and memorials while people are still alive. They're still alive. And there isn't -- you know, no one is signing the deal to release them. So this is not something, you know, that is out of -- totally out of anyone's hands. This is very much in this government's hands to sign a deal to release these people instead of doing, you know, ceremonies and remember them.",

Hurricane Miltonexploded to category five strength just moments ago, packing sustained winds of 160 miles per hour or more than 250 kilometers per hour. Emergency officials are preparing for the state's largest evacuation in years. And Florida residents are bracing for catastrophic flooding, filling up sandbags to protect their homes. Boards are going up over windows across the state. You've got long lines and bare shelves as well at the grocery store. All of this a common sight as people stock up on supplies and non- perishables. And also that they have to get ready now for long-term power outages too. Tracking the storm for us in the weather center is CNN meteorologist Elisa Raffa. I mean, the fact that this is a category five storm, and it became a category five storm so quickly and Florida can't get a break. You know, it was just two weeks ago that we saw Hurricane Helene as well. Just explain to us what the state is bracing itself for.",

Now, it will wane some as it heads towards Florida. They might not be dealing with a category five hurricane, but they're still going to be dealing with a major hurricane that can bring some devastating impacts. A hundred sixty mile per wins right now in the center of the hurricane. Gusts, getting up to 190 as it sits 700 miles away from Tampa. Just the satellite again that crisp clear eye, it's symmetrical. Really just the signs of strengthening. And look at how much it's strengthened just in the last 24 hours, almost 100 miles per hour increase in that center core of the winds in just 24 hours. We went to sleep last night with a category one hurricane, we wake up now and it's just a totally different storm. As it heads towards Florida, it does wane some in intensity. You can see it scrapes the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico as that category five. But as it gets closer, there's some drier, some wind energy that will start to kind of cut down on the intensity a little bit, but we're still looking at a major hurricane of category three strength or stronger where you have this hurricane watch in effect there in the pink. Landfall will be sometime maybe late Wednesday or Thursday. Just slowing down significantly. So we're looking at maybe impacts about a day later. When you look at the purple here, Tampa Bay from Sarasota down to Fort Myers, that's where we could have the most destructive winds of 110 miles per hour. And that could bring some unprecedented storm surge up to 8 to 12 feet. Ladies.",

We want to warn you, this piece contains some disturbing images. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOLODRYGA (voice-over): It's any parent's nightmare not being able to protect their child. Yet, that's exactly what happened one year ago on the morning of October 7th when then 19-year-old Naama Levy was dragged by her hair at gunpoint by a militant. Her pants soaked in blood in one of the first harrowing videos that Hamas released of that fateful day. She was abducted alongside several other Israeli female soldiers at Nahal Oz military base near Israel's border with Gaza. Seen here in another chilling Hamas video. Among them was her friend, Liri Albag, who was 18 at the time. They were all working as IDF observers, a role that involves monitoring border security. Military service is mandatory in Israel. Naama tries to tell her captors that she has Palestinian friends. She had taken part in an Israeli-Palestinian peace initiative. Liri and Naama's mothers are still stuck on that day. AYELET LEVY SHACHAR, MOTHER OF OCTOBER 7 HOSTAGE NAAMA LEVY: This terror attack is ongoing. For a year now, our girls are in the same terror attack. SHIRA ALBAG, MOTHER OF OCTOBER 7 HOSTAGE LIRI ALBAG: Liri and Naama are little girls. They're young girls. That one year are there in hell. GOLODRYGA (voice-over): Hama's rampage left more than 1,200 people dead. Another 250 were taken hostage. Over 100 are thought to remain in captivity to this day, according to Israel's prime minister's office. But it's unclear how many are still alive. The attacks triggered Israel's war in Gaza, which has killed more than 41,000 people. For these two women, a ceasefire deal is standing in the way of their reunion with their children.",
