With what audacity you compare between the Hamas that murdered, burned, butchered, raped, and kidnapped our brothers and sisters, and the IDF soldiers who are fighting in just war?

This is a moment when we see in the shadow of Ukraine, an increasing cacophony of noise, of double standards and selectivity, and what we're trying to do is not go with the tide of emotion but take our time, move as effectively as we can. But we got to by evidence and every human life, every baby that is killed, whether it's a baby that's cruelly abducted by Hamas and killed or a baby that's been bombed or killed or has died in incubators because of no electricity or water or food in Gaza. For them, for their families and humanity, it's a tragedy and this is why we have a court. It's about the equal application of the law. And no people are better than another.

No matter the evidence that is found against them and wanting to stand trial in the Hague.I want to get to the issue of equivalence because it's highly contentious for obvious reasons. We have a democracy that it says is defending itself against the terrorist group that we all know murdered, tortured, and kidnapped civilians. But two details that I want to highlight that Mr. Khan said out there. One was the fact that he began his evidence in this case on October 8th, less than 24 hours he says after the October 7th attack and the other is the word intentional. The intentionality of this against Israel. ELLIS: Yes, this is -- well, first of all, I think you can see through the prosecutor's case that he's really focusing on the civilians. Both sides of this conflict. The horrendous attacks against the Israeli civilians October 7th and then his position that Palestinian civilians have been attacked, too. And he's arguing things are intentional. And I think he's setting forth the evidence saying they're intentional. The reason he's doing that because that's to me -- that is at the heart of international humanitarian law. You cannot intentionally target civilians. You have to protect civilians. So he's making it very clear that his focus is on ensuring that those civilians who have been victims of this, of this war that justices brought to them. So that's what he's focusing about. But the other point that he makes is moral equivalency, part of it. He puts that aside and I think rightfully so. This is about law. This is about the requirements that are set in the Rome statute, the International Criminal Court, but also more generally about international criminal law. War crimes, crimes against humanity, all of those are imbedded in international law. Every party has to abide by those principles. And that's what he's saying.",

But I also want you to listen to this.The panel also, they say unanimously, agrees that the evidence presented by the prosecutor provides reasonable grounds to believe that Netanyahu and Israel's minister of defense, Yoav Gallant, have committed war crimes and crimes against humanity. This includes the war crime of intentionally using starvation of civilians as a method of warfare and the murder and persecution of Palestinians as crimes against humanity. This definitely involves experienced jurists, one of them being Amal Clooney, who has worked obviously on cases between Syria and ISIS before.

So this is just an opportunity to get a set of experts of each and every one of them as seen as an international experts to review the evidence. They've done that, they've come back and they've given the prosecutor I think additional credibility to say, listen, this was just not me seeing -- looking at the evidence. I've asked these other experts to say they have found in the exact -- they have the exact same position and I have.

The bodies will travel to the cities of Tabriz, Qom, Tehran, and then on Thursday, Raisi's body will go to Birjand and finally his hometown of Mashhad. And that is where he will be buried. The Iranians have appointed a high commission to investigate what they are calling a, quote, \"the dimensions and causes of the crash.\" Now, so far no official explanation has been given. It's not clear if it was due to mechanical error, weather conditions, human error or foul play. Now, obviously, conspiracy theories abound, but Israeli and U.S. officials have ruled out any involvement in the crash.

You have government supporters who've gathered for prayers, but then there was also a celebration, particularly among those who were very much part of the resistance. But, look, those people hoping for a shift in Iranian politics and policy, you know, they're going to be solely disappointed. 63 year-old Raisi, he was a divisive hardliner. He was referred to as the butcher of Tehran for his key role in the extrajudicial killing of thousands of political prisoners in 1988 and then more recently as president he oversaw the enforcement of those strict morality laws and bloody crackdown on the protests that ensued.
