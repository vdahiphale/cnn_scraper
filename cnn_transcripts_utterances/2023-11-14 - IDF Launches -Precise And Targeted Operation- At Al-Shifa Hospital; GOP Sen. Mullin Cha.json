That's the largest hospital, in the Gaza Strip.Israel says there's a Hamas command center underneath it. The White House says it has intelligence, its own intelligence, to backup those assertions, and officials adding today, that Hamas is also using the hospital, to store weapons and ammunition. CNN's Jeremy Diamond is live, on the ground, in Sderot, Israel. Jeremy, what do we know, about this?

Tonight, the Israel Defense Forces say that they are carrying out a targeted and precise operation. They're being very specific, saying that this is being carried out, not on the entire hospital complex, but on a specified area, of the hospital, that they say is being driven by intelligence and, quote, \"Operational necessity.\" They say this operation is designed, to target Hamas, and to rescue our hostages, in this statement. They also note that there will be medical teams, and Arabic speakers, as part of this, and that the units involved have undergone specific training, to try and minimize any potential harm, to civilians, who may be at that area of the hospital. We heard, earlier tonight, from one of the IDF spokesman. I want you to listen to what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. COL. PETER LERNER, IDF SPOKESPERSON: So, we're not overrunning the hospital. But we are conducting a very precise and targeted operation, against a specific location, where we have intelligence, and indeed, operational necessity, in order to defeat Hamas, and perhaps rescue hostages.

Active gunfights could be heard, across the hospital yard. And a doctor, at the complex, also told CNN, that hospital staff, were given about 30 minutes warning, before Israeli troops began moving into the hospital complex, to carry out their operations. Now, we don't know of for sure whether or not there are hostages there. But you heard the IDF spokesman, has repeatedly indicated, tonight, that there may be hostages, on the complex, and that may be part of this ground operation, that's being carried out, right now.",

But that is notable as well, given that timing there.Jeremy Diamond, in Sderot, we'll continue to check back in with you, as these developments are happening, in this hour, breaking news, happening. But for Military perspective, on what this operation could result in, what it could be looking like, on the ground, I want to bring in retired Air Force Colonel, Cedric Leighton, who is here with me. You just heard from Jeremy there, and that sound, from the IDF spokesperson. Do we believe that there could be potentially hostages here? And that could be part of why they're calling this, this precise, specific operation? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: I think so, Kaitlan. I mean, it's, clear that there's no guarantee, the hostages are there. But it seems as if, based on the IDF press release, and how they've phrased things, and how the White House is phrasing things, it does seem as if they believe that hostages, either are there, or were in that Al-Shifa Hospital compound. And so, if that's the case, they want to get those hostages out as quickly as possible. And a hostage rescue operation, if this is what this is, is certainly something that requires a lot of precise action, precise intelligence, and a very concerted effort, to go in, and very precisely.",

Because we know, just yesterday, there were -- or the thousands of people that we believed, as our last update, that were sheltering outside. They said they couldn't comment beyond what the IDF had said publicly.But that is a question here. I mean, can you carry out part of an operation, on part of a hospital, and everyone else is fine?

So, there are, you know, there's certainly the possibility that they could have honed in, from a Military perspective, on one particular area, if they believe the hostages are there, for example, or if they believe the command center is there, for Hamas.But if that's the case, then yes, it is possible, for other people, to stay in that area, without being harmed. But it is, certainly risky. And there are situations, where, if there's an overflow of personnel from, let's say, the command center, or if there's an overflow of the hostages, from one area to the other, that could complicate things. So, it's a very risky situation. We don't know yet precisely where everything is, in terms of where the people are, and even which buildings they've used, for these, for each specific activity. But we do know, where, at least the intelligence folks know, where the operation rooms are, for the hospital, where the maternity ward would be, and things like that. So, it's, those are the kinds of things that would be part of a preparation, until preparation, of an operation, like this.",

We've heard a bit about some, from a doctor there, who said they could hear some firefight. But that's basically the extent of what we've been able to learn, from the ground, in Gaza. LEIGHTON: So, Special Operations often occur at night, because the night is the special operators' friend. In essence, they use night vision goggles, they use other systems, to basically penetrate the darkness. They are banking on the fact that they might gain surprise, that they might be able to make, you know, have the Hamas fighters not be able to grab any night vision goggles that they might have. So, they're hoping, for a surprise. And they're hoping to basically take them out, while they can. And --",

She actually documented the whole series of events pretty well. And I was called by reporters, about it, when I was on the House floor, because I was a little shocked, that there wasn't any really reporters, around, when it happened, just her. And it was a narrow -- it was in the hallway, outside of Republican conference meeting. And I was standing there. And I got -- somebody hit me in the back, and I leaned forward a little bit. And she was -- she said, \"Man, I've been here a long time,\" or something like that, \"and I have never seen anything like that.\" And then, I turned to Kevin, and said something to him. And he, of course, as he does, he had his little security detail. And he marched off. And then, I went and confronted him about it. But I think this really just shows to America, why the eight of us did what we did. This is the man that was three steps away from the White House.

I mean, I know this is a lot of hypotheticals. I understand that, Michael. But if that does happen, and Trump is reelected, which we don't know that he will be? This is a State case. So what happens? MICHAEL MOORE, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY: Well, I'm glad to be with you. It is hypothetical in the sense that, we're all guessing in who's going to have which trial first, whether it's going to be the federal case, or we're going to get to the State case. But if he were reelected, and if the case were going on, my guess is that the trial would probably be immediately stopped. Because there's a general rule that a President needs to be able to focus on those things that he needs to do as President. And that, in fact, he can't be bothered with State court actions, during the time that he's the President of the United States. And you've seen that from time to time. You remember some cases that were put on hold, really while he was President of the United States. And so, I think that's probably what would happen. I really think it's an optimistic view, to think that we would even be getting to the trial, by election time, in this case. And I think it's more likely that we won't even start before the election.",
