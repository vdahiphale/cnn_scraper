Yes, but I think that they are also giving these specific answers strategically. Because if you actually look at the data about the Republican base, you know, DeSantis said tonight that Republicans, you know, believe in colorblindness. He used the term colorblindness. Well, actually, the data suggests otherwise, because, you know, data from the Public Religion Research Institute found that 65 percent of Republicans say that discrimination against white Americans is just as big a problem as discrimination against black Americans. And 81 percent of Republicans disagree with the statement that generations of slavery and discrimination made it more difficult for black Americans to rise up from the lower class.
