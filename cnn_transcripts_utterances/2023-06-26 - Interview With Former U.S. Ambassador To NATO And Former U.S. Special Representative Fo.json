I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. 24 hours in June. What happened this weekend in Russia stunned the world. An apparent mutiny that ended almost quickly as it started driven by Putin's friend turned foe, Yevgeny Prigozhin, and his notorious mercenary group, Wagner. And what is left is another week of war begins are only more questions, where is Prigozhin, and what is his fate? The supposed deal brokered by Belarus has not shown him to be in Minsk or anywhere else for that matter. But he has just released a new audio restating what he said on Saturday that he was not making a coup or moving against Putin himself, just against what he has called all along incompetent Russian military leadership. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YEVGENY PRIGHOZIN, HEAD OF WAGNER PRIVATE MILITARY COMPANY (through translator): Two factors played into my decision to turn around. First factor, we want to avoid Russian bloodshed. Second is, we marched in demonstration of a protest, not to overturn the power in the country. At this time, Alexander Lukashenko extended his hand and offered to find solutions for the further work of Wagner PMC in legal jurisdiction. The columns turned back and left for the field camps.

As for the real target of Prigozhin's wrath, Defence Minister Shoigu, the defense ministry released a video of him visiting troops. Where and when? No indication. Meanwhile, President Biden says he has convened key allies, saying that it's critical to stay focused on the defense of Ukraine. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: They agreed with me that we had to make sure we gave Putin no excuse. Let me emphasize, we gave Putin no excuse to blame this on the West or to blame this on NATO. We've made clear that we were not involved. We had nothing to do with it.

He had people in the streets bringing flowers and bread and water. And so, there was clearly a show of support for Prigozhin in doing this, and everybody else who should have been on Putin's team here was just kind of sitting it out and some were even getting on their airplanes. So, it showed a relative weakness for Putin and relative support for Prigozhin. That is really striking. He may not have accumulated the forces that he wanted to be able to take Moscow, but he showed that he actually has some residents in the Russian military and the Russian population.",

The president was very clear, and actually all we weekend, none ofthe NATO allies came out with anything much more than, we are watching the situation, we are talking to our partners. They obviously didn't want to give any excuse to anybody, like the foreign minister, Lavrov, already has, you know, said that investigation will commence on whether the West was involved in this.

First off, I think it's important to make clear, as President Biden has done, as Secretary Blinkenhas done, that we have nothing to do it with this. There will be efforts to blame the West, and we should preempt them by saying, we had nothing to do with this. This is an internal Russian thing. The second thing is we should drop the restrictions on aid to Ukraine. The Russian soldiers sitting in trenches in Ukraine right now do not want to be there. They know that their country is coming apart behind them, they know that the imperial quest that Putin has set them on is failing and they don't want to be there. So, we should be giving Ukraine what it needs to help push them out, and that will help convince them to lead on their own. And then, finally, I think that NATO needs to recognize that all of this depends -- you know, all of this future, the future of European security depends on Ukraine being secured in the future. So that if Russia is left on its own, it will regroup, it will attack again, this will be a threat to all of Europe, not only Ukraine. So, as NATO convenes, (INAUDIBLE), they need to send a signal that Ukraine is on the way into membership.",

      "sentences": "So, OK. We'll get to that in a second, but I'm really interested to hear what you say that they should give Ukraine what it needs. A lot ofthe narratives about the West, particularly the United States, method of delivering weapons has been to do enough but not too much to antagonize Putin and, you know, prompt some irrational response. Are you basically saying now that that equation should be out of the door because you've seen a weakness in Russia?",

My view on that is if Putin could have done more already, he would have already done it, that he's not in this war in Ukraine to lose, he's in it to win. And if he could add more troops, if he could attack somewhere else, if he thought that attacking a NATO ally would help him, he would have done it. The fact is that he knows he is losing in Ukraine, he can't possibly open another front somewhere else, least of all with a NATO country. He couldn't possibly handle that. Nuclear weapons won't solve his problem, and I think he knows that. So, he is putting these messages out to deter us rather than to actually mean that he's going to go on these various directions. We ought to understand that and we should be pouring on the support to Ukraine now.",

I want to play this bite, part of an interview from Secretary Blinken, because it relates to this, and we'll talk about it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: The fact that you have, from within, someone directly questioning Putin's authority, directly questioning the premises that -- upon which he launched this aggression against Ukraine, that in and of itself is something very powerful. It adds cracks. Where those go, when they get there, too soon to say, but it clearly raises new questions that Putin has to deal with. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Do you -- what do you think? I mean, it's very byzantine. These are two, I mean, essential gangsters fighting for supremacy and money and power. What do you think?

Putin cannot live with having been challenged this way. It is a threat to his control of Russia, to his legitimacy if he is seen to be weak. So, he has no choice now but to go after Prigozhin. I think Prigozhin knew this, knows this. He stood down to position himself as the reasonable person, the one who does not want to destroy the state, but then if Putin goes after him, it gives him a justification for trying, again, for somehow pushing back again. So, many shoes left to drop that we haven't seen. Now, as far as the U.S. policy goes again, I just want to come back to that. The U.S. has no stake in this other than to say, get out of Ukraine, live within your own borders and accept responsibility for the war that you launched. Who runs Russia? There is no way we control that, no way we can do that and we shouldn't pretend that we're involved in that. So, I think that we've got that part of it right.",

This is what the China, you know, foreign ministry said on the weekend. This is Russia's internal affair. As Russia's friendly neighbor and comprehensive strategic partner of coordination for the new era, China supports Russia in maintaining national stability and achieving development and prosperity.

China is very happy for Russia to try to weaken the West. They can get anything from Russia that they want for cash, whether it's minerals or whether it's energy, oil or gas, et cetera. They're not invested in Putin's war, and I think they actually look down on Russia. They don't have a lot of respect for Russia, because they view it as a declining power that doesn't take care of the state and does not take care of the people. China is very much the opposite of that. So, I am not at all surprised that China looking at this says, it's just one more mess, more chaos, Putin is not the strong leader that it pretends to be, and we are just going to sit this out and watch.",

So, the windows are just in case bolted. But Putin is a bigger question. I mean, they showed this -- his video meeting with the -- with some young people, but something that I've argued, I think maybe even on your program earlier, that if Putin survives this, he actually would get some sort of a boost and he could have because he survived this. Unfortunately, he hasn't spoken. Unfortunately, he allows his TV very active but not entirely convincing propagandists to speak for him, and could have been a great PR moment at 10:00, on Saturday, all resolved, Alexander Lukashenko speaks, Prigozhin says something and then Putin comes out and says, well, it's all resolved for the benefit of the people. Yes, it was mutiny, it was treason, but I, the great leader of Russia thought that it would be better and we are going to figure out the other way. That he could have shown strength.

But he himself just, you know, whatever he decides is good enough. And, you know, when people talk about his tarnished reputation, which reputation? He's sitting with this giant table, five meters long, across -- with all sorts of leaders and doesn't even blanket how ridiculous that looks. So -- but the question, especially in the afternoon, has been -- and people have been calling is that, is he dead? What's happening? Why is he not showing up? I mean, what we know of Putin's history is that he shows up when he wants to show up. It doesn't mean that something dangerous has happened to him, although, of course, we're guessing, and he likes people to guess. The problem with this kind of motive operandi, which before added to his mystique, now, it just shows like, what, you don't know what you're doing? They would just coup against you and now, you are pretending that nothing happened? That shows weakness. And that's why it seems -- I mean, because the question you asked earlier, whether Prigozhin was alone or not, of course he was not alone. But he did think that other people in the military, he would have more people on his side. He will kind of bring up more interest to his cause. And by the, way those who were cheering him up, they were not cheering him up to add to his cause, they were not cheering him up to join him. They were cheering him up because it seemed like a total absurd circus, people on tanks, the heroes of Russia fighting against other heroes of Russia. So, that, basically what shows is that Putin may think he's in control, but he's not. And so, for those around him, that's a good lesson to see how they can maybe form certain groups, not as evident as Prigozhin's, but certain groups to may weaken Putin's power even more, because he is certainly not popular among the elites, that's for sure.",

I mean, it was the general ripper moment from Dr. Strangelove, he got a little funny in his hat. He thought that he can do all the things he thought he can do. But it -- from what I'm reading and we're obviously, to some degree, reading tea leaves, what I'm reading is that it's not necessarily that people or people around Putin are not ready for some action. It's just they were not ready to take these actions with Prigozhin because he is a bloody nationalist who promise to cleanse Russia the way 1970 revolutionary happened. And this is really not something that people want and the elites want. So, I'm not predicting, I'm not saying that (INAUDIBLE) if not before. And yet, this jelling of the elites against the Kremlin has not happened. It doesn't mean that every crisis doesn't lead us closer to that.

I mean, they're trying to sort of set up, you know, they're trying to generate business investment and they're trying to fix the economies and the political systems of South and Central America. But, I mean, that's not a short-term thing. I mean, that's not a quick fix. Like that's going to take years. I mean, you know, we've tried that in other parts of the world and like it's hard, you know.

The number is a significant increase from the past year, with an extra 1,500 whales counted. The mammals are migrating north for the winter, putting on a spectacular show. And just before we go, a note about what's coming up later this week, which marks the 50th anniversary of the founding at the Women's Tennis Association, a landmark moment for women sports and the fight for equality. Leading that battle all along was Billie Jean King. And I sat down with her earlier today in the very hotel where the WTA was founded to discuss why it's such a seminal moment. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
