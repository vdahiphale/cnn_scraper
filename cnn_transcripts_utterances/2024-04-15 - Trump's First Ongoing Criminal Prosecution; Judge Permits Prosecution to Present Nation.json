I'm Kaitlan Collins outside of the New York courthouse, where Donald Trump's hush money trial has just officially gotten underway, and is now going back and forth between the prosecution, the defense, and the judge, Judge Juan Merchan, who is overseeing all of this.CNN's Paula Reid is outside the courthouse here with me. And Paula, the prosecution just got a major win inside of that courtroom as they were arguing that evidence related to the \"National Enquirer\" and its coordination with the Trump campaign of 2016 should be allowed in as evidence, which Trump's team didn't want. and the judge just said?",

      "sentences": "Yes, I'll let it in. And specifically, this is evidence about articles that were run in the summer of 2015 about Trump's then opponent, Ted Cruz. Now, Trump's lawyer, Todd Blanche, objected to this, saying, look, this is going to confuse the jury. Running a negative story about Ted Cruz, they argue, is not a crime.But the judge said he's going to allow this evidence in because, remember, the theory of the case here from the district attorney is that when Michael Cohen was reimbursed for that hush money to Stormy Daniels, that the documents were falsified, right? They wrote down fraudulent reasons for why he was being paid. But the reason that's being charged as a felony is because the district attorney insists that this was all done to interfere with the 2016 election. And so, the reason that this evidence is critical for the prosecution is they're trying to show that these falsified business records were part of a larger scheme to help Trump's chances in 2016. And the judge here said he's going to allow this in because, \"The district attorney's office has demonstrated, there was an understanding that certain things would be done and wouldn't be done at AMI.\" That is the company that owned the \"National Enquirer\". He said, I believe this evidence is necessary to complete the narrative of what took place. So, not great for the Trump team there because, again, this is the larger narrative that the district attorney is using to charge this as a felony.",

You know, we always call this the hush money case, but what Alvin Bragg, the district attorney's been arguing is that this all has to do with efforts to sway the election and to protect Donald Trump.

And the jury is going to have to decide whether that was a fair characterization of payments that President Trump was making to one of his lawyers at the time.Were legal retainer payments an accurate description of the payments being made to Michael Cohen? That's going to be a question for the jury. That's core to this case.

For our audience that -- who may not know who Karen McDougal is, Karen McDougal is the 1998 Playmate of the Year with whom Donald Trump also had a relationship, although I think longer term, allegedly. And she was paid money by David Pecker of the company that owns American -- the \"National Enquirer\", it's called American Media, I believe.And so, I guess the idea here is from the prosecution is that this would establish a record, a pattern of hush money being paid to people to keep quiet so as to not embarrass the president before the presidential election. What is your reaction to the news that Judge Merchan is going to allow Karen McDougal to testify, although not apparently about any explicit details?",

This is the first gag order of its kind ever entered against a political candidate for office, I believe, in American history. We believe it's wildly overbroad and unconstitutional, and that certainly complicates my ability to answer your question directly.I will say that I think that McDougal's testimony is irrelevant here, and that's why we moved to have it not allowed in into court on. I think, again, what we've seen with Judge Merchan over and over again is rulings like this against this. We've moved to have Judge Mershon recused off of this case due to what we believe are irretrievable conflicts and biases.

He then went on with what seemed to be kind of an implicit warning to Israel's leadership, which is, he said, strength and wisdom need to be different sides of the same coin. And so, I think you're really seeing a push, at least from Israel's allies to try to find that Goldilocks, that sweet spot. between doing what Israel needs to do to meet its own needs, but also not escalating this and propelling it, you know, into an all-out regional conflagration. But we've heard the hardliners, particularly here in Israel. They have been pooh-poohing the idea that Benny Gantz put forward yesterday of trying to form a regional coalition, saying these air hollow Western catch phrases.

So, now if there's an Israeli retaliation against Iran, I think this could even exacerbate this domestic unrest, not only in Saudi Arabia, but many other countries in the region. And on the other hand, it shows Israel -- and this is what the Biden administration is trying to tell the Israelis, is that look at the opportunity here. You can turn this crisis into a huge opportunity and a huge strategic win, even if it means that you're not going to retaliate directly against the Iranians on their soil.",

So, what you've got, essentially, is a three-pronged security package there.The Secret Service owns Donald Trump from a security standpoint. They're handling him, in terms of close protection. But the NYPD owns the roads and the routes and all of the moving parts that make that work. That's that motorcade you saw this morning where the front of the route is swept out of traffic ahead of him. The back of the route is swept from traffic coming behind. And it appears that he travels in this bubble. It's not a frozen route that a president of the United States, a sitting president would get, but it's about as close as you're going to come for a former president. And the third piece of that stool of court is the court officers. Once Donald Trump goes into that courthouse, the court officers are in charge of security there. So, you have a lot of practice that went into this between the court officer and the secret service.",
