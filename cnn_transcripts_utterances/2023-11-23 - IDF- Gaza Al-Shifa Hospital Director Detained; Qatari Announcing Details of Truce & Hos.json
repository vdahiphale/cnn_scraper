I can tell you that one of the things that we are looking to happen during the four days of pass is to collect more information about the hostages. Those who we have been told are not all with Hamas, and to get all the numbers to get all the information. That would help in a second wave that we are hoping by the fourth day.

AL-ANSARI: We have been in constant contact with our entire region and international partners over this, including Iran; the uninformed Minister has been in Doha two times already. And this will be his third visit to Doha. We have discussed with the Iranians the prospects of regional -- over of this, this conflict. And we have made sure that we relate to all our partners in the region. The complexities that will result from any regional spill over and the need for us all to work together to make sure that this conflict is contained.

Benjamin Netanyahu was very keen to point out that the U.S. President had played asignificant part in upping the number of hostages who will be released and lowering the cost of those releases to the Israelis. Can you just comment on the role that the U.S. President has played? AL-ANSARI: Because I can't testify to what the Prime Minister has mentioned. What I can tell you is that we are working very closely with the United States over this. And as you know, we had various delegations from the U.S. Administration come here last week, which was Brett McGurk. And before that, of course, Secretary Blinken and we have been in closer contact. You know, President Biden has been calling on the His Highness the Emir. And we had constant calls between both sides to make sure that we work together on this. And we appreciate, of course, the work done by the United States to make sure that the deal comes to fruition. And we continue to work with the United States over this. I can't speak of the details of how the, you know, the United States was formulated. But I can tell you that of course with the communication that's taking place all across the board, the Americans were very instrumental especially in working with Israel -- .",

I do not, of course, have any details about this meeting. As Bryce, I said, all the parties in the region, including -- they're trying to get guarantee so that the crisis does not extend. And of course, the seriousness of the issue has been discussed. Dr. Majed just to confirm regarding the Palestinian prisoners that will be released, will they have the freedom to go to their homes? Or do they have to go to certain areas and the mechanism of supervising this process? Who's going to supervise this truce and the daily arrest against Palestinians? Will this stop or is this that the truce has not gone into this? And what is the fate of these detainees? The truce, as I said, and the agreement was only to do with the escalation in Gaza, the current escalation, and we hope that this truce would lead into further discussions. But the scope of this agreement is only to deal with the Gaza Strip. We do not have any information to confirm anything about children, women and children are only going to be released, and from the other side to from Israel.",

AL-ANSARI: We of course, we are not on the ground, which is always a handicap for overseeing the deal itself. What is happening right now is that the operations are going here in Doha has direct lines of communication where the political office here in Doha, Hamas and with the Israeli side, and with the Red Cross. And it's all happening in real time, where we are monitoring everything that happens. I think -- that might come in, of any breach and you talked about the hostages, any additional information that we can relay between the three sides that we are working with, along with our partners in the region, including Egypt and internationally, including the United States. So we can make sure that we immediately jump in to continue our mediation work and to make sure that we troubleshoot any issues that might arise on the ground.
