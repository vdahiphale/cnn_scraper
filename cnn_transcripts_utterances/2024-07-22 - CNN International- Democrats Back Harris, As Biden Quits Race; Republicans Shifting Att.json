Vice President Harris is already moving the chess pieces in her attempt to earn and win her spot after President Biden drops out of the race.Donald Trump, fresh off receiving the Republican nomination, is already lashing out on a social media platform about facing a new potential opponent. And the Secret Service is in the spotlight. In the next hour, the agency's director is set to face tough questions on Capitol Hill over the assassination attempt on the former president. Uncharted waters. Democrats here in the U.S. are facing an unprecedented political landscape after Joe Biden's decision to drop out of the 2024 presidential race. The President almost immediately endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to succeed him in the Oval Office, and she is getting quick support from some prominent Democrats and big-ticket donors. Harris says she is ready to earn and win the nomination, but the party leadership had yet to endorse her. And some Democrats are calling for an open process to determine the nominee at next month's convention. Whatever happens next, Mr. Biden's decision is being met with overwhelming support and gratitude from fellow Democrats. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHRIS MURPHY (D-CT): This is a president who has a remarkable record of achievement. In the end, he decided to put his country first.",

Once the campaign realized that the Democratic hand-wringing over Joe Biden's debate performance was going to continue, they sort of started assuming that this was going to be the eventual outcome and began the preparations for this exact moment. And we saw them during the convention, for example, increase the attacks on Vice President Harris.We've seen Donald Trump online and in his remarks attacking Vice President Harris. And this is something that they have been building towards for a while. They did spend some time researching some of the other people who have been thrown out there as potential names, the governors Whitmer and Shapiro and Beshear, Senator Kelly of Arizona. But really, they have been focused on Harris for quite some time. And the attacks on her began almost immediately. As you said, there's that ad that is now running in multiple states. It's going to be airing in Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, and Pennsylvania. those are obviously some very critical swing states. We're also going to see them attack Harris on immigration, crime, and the economy, those areas where they believe that they have some headway against the Democratic ticket, and were planning to attack Biden over as well. But look, this is going to be a very different campaign. They acknowledged that. They had built a campaign to go up against an 81- year-old unpopular incumbent. Now they're going up against a younger face. They are now the older candidate in the race, which was not what they expected. And they're going to have to shift accordingly.",

America wakes up this morning to an entirely new presidential race, one that could see Kamala Harris become the first black woman in first Asian America to lead a major political party's ticket.This is not her first time seeking the Democratic nomination. She ran against Joe Biden back in 2019 for the right to take on Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential race. This time around, she already has the backing of high-profile Democrats, including President Biden himself. Let's stay on this with CNN's Jeff Zeleny. Jeff, you've had a lot of political news to cover in recent days and weeks, and yesterday, no exception. I wonder, of course, we've heard a long list of Democrats, quite prominent Democrats, come out very quickly to endorse Kamala Harris. Are there any expectations, rumblings, that a prominent Democrat might raise their hand and say, well, I'm going to challenge? JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF U.S. NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Jim, there absolutely are not. All the talk of an open convention really have closed down, and Democrats are circling the wagons and closing ranks around Vice President Kamala Harris. There is still time, of course, a couple weeks or so before Democrats begin their virtual roll call. And what that is, they are just going to have the delegates, so there's about 4,700 of them, vote on who the party's nominee is. But it was really extraordinary on Sunday, hour by hour by hour, her support grew, not only from members of Congress, senators and members of Congress, but also a state, Democratic delegations. There was a call last evening where every state Democratic chair, all 50, voted to support her. Labor unions have different groups on Capitol Hill, the Congressional Black Caucus, the Hispanic Caucus, Progressive Caucus, really, so all corners of the Democratic Party, people are coming to support her. Will there be perhaps someone who sticks their head up? That is possible, but no significant challenge is expected. And that is one reason, it's respect for her. But, Jim, I think the bigger reason is, talking to Democrats, is because Democrats want to get on with this. They want to turn this race back into a contrast with Donald Trump. They know that a few weeks' time has been lost with President Biden making his decision. So that has coalesced her support, the ticking time clock.",

I mean, there is no question when President Biden first put out his bombshell statement that he was not going to seek re-election and would instead return to focus his effort on the presidency. He did not in that statement say he was endorsing Kamala Harris.So I would say for about maybe 10 minutes or so, there was a question of if he was not going to endorse her, that would have led to a potential mini-primary, a potential free-for-all. But then when he sent out his endorsement of her, that really quieted things down very quickly. Shortly after that, former President Bill Clinton, Secretary Clinton also came out in support of her. The one exception, former President Barack Obama, he praised Joe Biden, did not offer his endorsement, and as of this moment has not as well. But I'm told that is not that he does not support her or is behind her, but rather is staying on the sidelines and hopes to unify the party should that be necessary going forward. Nancy Pelosi also is not. You know, she played a very critical role in making President Biden see the light on this, I guess, if you will. But it is pretty extraordinary how quickly people came around her. But Jim, I think the most unifying factor, the biggest reason is, again, Donald Trump. Democrats are so terrified about the path ahead. And we should say, this race is still a very challenging one for Democrats, no doubt about it.",

All of that could have been tightened well before the assassination attempt.Then you have the problems during it, the time lag between people -- when people are noticing that Trump is under threat and the Secret Service actually not doing anything until Trump is shot at. And then, of course, the sort of after part, which the Secret Service should be criticized for as well. I mean, they threw the state and locals under the bus. They weren't very transparent.

So they'll -- they'll determine whether they feel like they have it under control. They were wrong in that assessment this time.So I've been in the situation where -- where entities are asking for more protection. And you can't just say yes, every single time you're doing a resource and threat allocation. They made a terribly bad judgment call here. But part of it has to do with the assassin and just the lack of knowledge about who he was. I mean, we still don't know motive. And so that's -- that's the challenge with these -- these kinds of threats that obviously will be buttressed. I will say one thing, you know, in terms of the personnel assigned to Trump, I've talked to a lot of Secret Service agents. You know, you have people who are paying attention. Notice that his -- that his Secret Service team now is -- is -- is, let's just say, more male and larger. I mean, a big part of this was, are they able to get the protectee protected and out of the way in time?

I think a combination of factors because of the amped up radicalization. We know it's related to race. We know it's related to white supremacy. Part of it is going to be how does the Trump campaign and the Trump proxies play the race issue with Kamala Harris? They've already come out on Black Lives Matter.

But by and large, when you look around the globe, and especially here in Europe where I am right now, there is a lot of praise for the president's decision and a lot of respect also for the political legacy that no doubt he is going to leave behind. Of course, one of the things that we've been reporting so much about, Jim, is that here in Europe, President Biden really seen as someone who brought transatlantic relations back on track. You just read that quote from German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. And I can tell you from looking at the relations that they've had with one another, they really are very close politically, but also especially on the issue of the war in Ukraine and Russia's aggression in Ukraine. Of course, someone else who's also very close to President Biden on that issue is the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. I want to read you some of what he posted on social media. He said, quote, \"Ukraine is grateful to President Biden for his unwavering support for Ukraine's fight for freedom, which along with strong bipartisan support in the United States has been and continues to be critical. Many strong decisions have been made in recent years, and they will be remembered as bold steps taken by President Biden in response to challenging times.\" Of course, for the Ukrainians, those challenging times first and foremost facing down that Russian aggression. And of course, the U.S. has been instrumental in leading some of those European NATO partners as all of that has been unfolding. The special relationship, however, of course, here in Europe is between the United Kingdom and the U.S. And I want to listen in to some of what the U.K.'s new Prime Minister had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) Keir Starmer, British Prime Minister: I respect the decision that he has now made. Not an easy decision, but a decision that I know that he will have arrived at taking into account the best interests of the American people.
