If you're just joining us, let me bring you up to date with the top stories in the coming hours.Donald Trump is set to arrive in New York ahead of a Tuesday arrangement. Trump becomes the first former or current president to face criminal charges. He faces more than 30 counts related to business fraud, but most notably the hush money payments made to adult film star Stormy Daniels. CNN's Kristen Holmes has more on what we can expect to see in the days ahead. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: The logistics around former president Trump's trip to New York tomorrow, and his arraignment on Tuesday are still being sorted out. But we have learned that the former president plans to give a primetime address when he arrives back at his Mar-a-Lago home on Tuesday. We had heard from sources, security sources as well as member of President Trump's team that they wanted to get him in and out of Manhattan as quickly as possible. So he will be leaving the city right after that arraignment, coming back to his Florida home, where he will address the nation. Now this will be a chance for him to really give his side of the story and spin his own narrative. As we have heard, he has called this a political witch hunt and a hoax. But the difference between those remarks on Tuesday and what we have heard in the last several weeks, is it will be the first time we hear from him since those charges have been made public. Currently no one knows what those charges actually are, and they won't be revealed until his arraignment on Tuesday. Republicans have rallied around him. The former president spent much of the weekend calling his allies, calling his advisers and we saw a lot of them on the airwaves defending the former president. But the thing to watch as we head into this next week is how that messaging or it's that messaging actually changes, once we see what those charges actually are. Now on the legal front we heard from Trump's lawyer, Joe Tacopina, who said that they are waiting to see that indictment, but that's going to impact their legal decisions. They are have not seen what the charges are, and they cannot make any game plan at this point yet until they actually see that. But they did make clear or he did make clear that everything was on the table. Kristen Holmes, CNN West Palm Beach, Florida. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

CNN's Shimon Prokupecz reports on the preparations in New York.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SHIMON PROKUPECZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME AND JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): With an unprecedented indictment comes immense security challenges. The NYPD, along with court officers, U.S. Marshals, and the United States Secret Service, are running through logistics of how Tuesday's historic arraignment of the former president will go down. Law enforcement sources telling CNN officials are conducting a dry run of Trump's movements, including his motorcade route to the courthouse in downtown Manhattan where he is expected to be arraigned Tuesday afternoon. How he will get inside the courtroom flanked by Secret Service, and what will the arrest process look like. Will he be treated like any other defendant? The former president expected to be fingerprinted and photographed for a mugshot. It's a massive effort starting when Trump arrives by plane Monday, securing Trump Tower, the court, and the motorcade route. CHIEF KENNETH COREY, NEW YORK CITY POLICE DEPARTMENT (RET.): In this case, though, where you have a former president and certainly a president with as large a following as former President Trump there's a lot of unique concerns that are going to come into play. I think that the bigger unknown here is going to come in the form of protests or potential protests. PROKUPECZ (voice-over): Officials are also bracing for protests after Trump urged his supporters to protest his arrest when news of the indictment reportedly neared. So far, the mayor's office says there are no credible threats to the city. And out of an abundance of caution every member of the NYPD -- some 35,000 officers -- are reporting for duty in uniform and prepared for mobilization.",

He was sitting down. That had already been scheduled because of his knee problem. However, he did give a homily in which you could hear his voice was a little bit more horse than usual, showing some signs of tiredness. But perhaps that is to be expected. The Pope spoke about some of those themes that are closest to his heart. About people who are abandoned by society, the elderly, the sick people in jail, migrants. In fact, Pope Francis will be going to a juvenile jail on Thursday in Rome for the traditional washing of the feet ceremony. Francis also thanked the people in the square and the people around the world for their prayers while he was in the hospital. He was able to go in his Pope mobile amongst the crowds. Some 60,000 gathered in St. Peter's Square -- according to the Vatican -- waving and giving a thumbs up. It begins a very busy week for this Pope. On Friday he is expected to be in front of Rome's Coliseum at night for the Way of the Cross Ceremony. Then on Saturday, the Easter Vigil and on Sunday, Easter Sunday Mass in St. Peter's Square.
