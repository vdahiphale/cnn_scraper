Stand by for details on this very significant new development in how it could impact the war.Also tonight, Senator Dianne Feinstein's office just confirmed she suffered major complications while battling shingles including a case of encephalitis. But that's not what Feinstein is telling CNN amid questions about her ability to serve. And Disney is scrapping a $1 billion development project in Florida, the company's feud with Governor DeSantis clearly intensifying right now and apparently costing the state thousands of jobs just days after before the Republican is expected to formally launch his presidential campaign. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. We begin with a new U.S. message about the war in Ukraine. A significant development as President Biden is out there on the world stage right now and in a potentially very pivotal moment in the conflict. Phil Mattingly is with the president at G7 Summit in Japan. CNN's Nic Robertson is standing by in Eastern Ukraine, in the war zone. First, let's go to you, Phil. As the president prepares for this major summit, the Biden administration is also signaling right now a major shift on Ukraine. What can you tell us?",

As you noted, the president is just a few hours away from starting the first day of the G7 summit here, meeting with leaders, leaders that have been absolutely integral to the steadfast support of Ukraine since Russia's invasion over the course of more than a year. And Ukraine will be a central, if not, the central topic on the agenda throughout the course of today, including some participation in some form of capacity by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.But it's something that's happening behind the scene, not even on the agenda here at the G7 that is particularly notable. Our colleagues, Natasha Bertrand, Kylie Atwood and Oren Liebermann are reporting that, according to sources, U.S. officials have quietly made clear to their European allies that they will not block any efforts to transfer F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine. Now, the U.S., because it's U.S. technology, would have to sign off on any of those transfers. Wolf, as you know well, the administration has been very reluctant to consider sending U.S. F-16s from U.S. stock. That has not changed. There's still reluctance, there's no signal or plan to send U.S. stocks of F-16 fighter jets. But what they have signaled to European allies, several of which have acknowledged that they are looking into the idea given the scale of the Ukrainian pressure as well as allies, including congressional lawmakers from both parties trying to urge the U.S. and its allies to move in this direction. Now, it's important to note, according to officials, there have been no official requests from any European allies for that technology transfer to allow the export of F-16 jets and the stocks across Europe very, into some degree, aren't exactly significant. But we do know that Ukraine and Ukrainian officials have pressed the U.S. and the Biden administration for this repeatedly, lawmakers have as well. And now, according to our colleagues and the sources that they're speaking to, the administration has signaled they will not block the technology transfer, they will not block exports even if the U.S. will not send from its own stocks, Wolf.",

Thank you very much.I want to bring in our experts right now on Russia, Ukraine and their war strategies. General Wesley Clark, the former NATO supreme allied commander, what would it mean for Ukraine's defense if the U.S. were to give the European allies the green light to go ahead and start transferring these F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine? GEN. WESLEY CLARK (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: I think it's a very, very big step and it would give the Ukrainians the chance to have air cover for their counteroffensive so the Russians can't bring an air offensive against them. It would also give them the ability to use standoff weapons to strike behind Russian lines. It's a mobile reserve force. So, when the Ukrainians move, if the Russians have a countermove, the F-16s would be the right air to ground system also to take that out. So, yes, it's big. But, Wolf, I don't want to spoil the party, but every other transfer we've been concerned about, since the equipment, they get part of it, like with M1A1 tanks, but we got to read the fine print on this. And we've got to get this equipment in there with as much of the NATO equipment on it as possible, as soon as possible.",

However, I'm not sure whether we will provide them. Part of the problem is the funding.So, I think what they're doing is signaling to the allies go ahead and provide them and maybe even urging them. I mean, I know that you guys have been cautious based on your reporting, but it may be that the administration is actually being more encouraging and certainly President Zelenskyy is running around trying to get these commitments. The money that we have right now, my understanding is, it will run out in September or so. And if you start taking the money and buying F-16s with them, then you're going to run out a lot faster than you would if you're just buying ammunition, artillery, et cetera. So, I think the play here might be to have allies and partners step in with F-16s because they're really costly and we have a big fight coming up in Congress potentially for more money.

I just came back from Estonia, where I went to a security conference and also watched some of the military exercises by NATO outside of Thailand (ph). And I think the mood there, and there are a lot of military diplomatic experts saying that, eventually, this probably will happen, that it should happen. Of course, they believe that.

So, these storm shadow missiles have come in right on time, just when they're needed.But, Wolf, again, every action in war generates a counteraction and reaction. These are subsonic missiles, so they can be intercepted, they can be shot down. They're tough to jam. They've got redundant guidance in them. But there's no super weapon here.

And those have been previously undisclosed.Now, earlier, before the office told us that, I had caught up with the senator in the hallways here in the Senate and I had asked her about encephalitis, if she had had that. She told me, no, that it had never been properly diagnosed, that it was a really bad flu, but that she was feeling better. Now, as we've talked about on The Situation Room previously, there are questions surrounding her about her fitness to serve, to continue serving as senator of California. She has already said that she will not run for re-election in 2024, so she will be stepping down at the end of this. And she had just returned back here to Capitol Hill after several months being out recovering from shingles. And so she's just been back now and there's just been a fresh mound of questions around if she is healthy enough to continue serving. And one note, she does sit on the Judiciary Committee, and that's kind of at the crux of all of this. Because without her vote, the Democrats have had a hard time getting some nominees out of committee on to the Senate floor for a confirmation vote.

And in a very small percentage of patients, a fraction of 1 percent, inflammation of the brain can occur, and that's called encephalitis. And encephalitis is a very severe complication. In some series, up to 15 to 20 percent of patients who get this kind of encephalitis will die. Just as importantly, a study out of France last year showed that about two-thirds of people who have this kind of shingles encephalitis will have significant neurological sequelae, complications for an indefinite period of time. And the kind of issues that people have after encephalitis with the shingles virus include memory problems, language problems, difficulty walking, mood disorders.

This was going to be a move that was going to happen over the course of several years. Some people have already moved to Florida but now the employees get to stay in Southern California.

Donald Trump lost the national popular vote twice. He got a lower share of the vote than Mitt Romney did twice. And I think he's going to make a pretty persuasive case that anything that happened between November of 2020 and now make Donald Trump more popular among independent voters, general election-type voters.

And, certainly, look at the results in the midterms and DeSantis was one of the few bright lights during it but Donald Trump will out craven anyone in his comments.

So, until he is able to really, you know, see Donald Trump sink of his own weight, which I think as the -- in terms of legal issues and maybe other issues that we haven't seen yet, I think that's what he's relying on.

What is your reaction to this precedent that the state of Montana is doing as far as TikTok is concerned? I know you don't support an outright TikTok ban. REP. MAXWELL FROST (D-FL): I don't support an outright TikTok ban. And I want to be clear. I think it's important we remain skeptical and do what needs to be done to protect the data of consumers and Americans but that has to be seen the same thing amongst all social media. I have the same concern with Facebook and Google and different social media platforms and the internet. And I think what we're seeing now here in D.C. and now across the country in different states is that people are picking TikTok specifically because of its connection to China, which, again, we do have to pay attention to. But I think it's because it plays into this political -- hawkish political maneuvering that the GOP is doing as far as China is related and it connects to their political message that they're trying to get across. This is the same state that just banned Zooey Zephyr, Representative Zooey Zephyr, from being in the halls. And I think it's unfortunate and does infringe on people's rights.",

For these marchers, this is a celebration of when Israel took control of East Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 war, giving Jews access to their holy sites in the old city. For Palestinians, it marks the beginning of the occupation of East Jerusalem. But in recent years, the march has also become more like a right-wing nationalist rally and a pretext for violence between Jewish Israelis and Palestinians, who make up most of the population in this part of the city. While most marchers were peaceful, some groups sing songs about getting revenge on Palestinians, erasing their names. Others going even further chanting, \"may your village burn\". They were emboldened by the presence of right-wing government ministers like National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir who marched alongside them through the old city and to the western wall. Thousands of police showed how tense the situation was even before the marchers started, using heavy-handed tactics to clear the route, including on senior CNN correspondent Ben Wedeman.
