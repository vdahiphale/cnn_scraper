Jewish people should not have hatred set against them, should not be the victims of vile, antisemitism, racism, and so forth.Unfortunately, history tells us when there's a rise in tension in the Middle East, there's a rise in antisemitism. Those of us that aren't Jewish need to provide allyship to our Jewish friends, colleagues, and neighbors, say no to antisemitism. You can be a supporter of Israel existing, but be critical of the policies of Netanyahu. You can be supportive of your Jewish friends and colleagues and neighbors, but be critical of the policies of the IDF. I think what we don't want to see is Jewish friends, colleagues, and neighbors cowering, being scared to go about their business. And it's really important we understand, yes, of course, I'm critical of some of the policies of Netanyahu, what the IDF are doing. It's heartbreaking. There are hostages still being kept in Gaza. But actually, the IDF can't carry on indiscriminately killing people in Gaza. There is no excuse for antisemitism.",

The outer bands passing through. And the breaking news is this -- the National Hurricane Center just issued its 8This morning, one of the biggest concerns along the Florida coast, particularly the Big Bend area, is storm surge. It could reach up to 20 feet. The National Weather Service said that is un-survivable. Not just the storm surge that will be an issue here. The storm is moving quickly, which means it will bring hurricane force winds up past Tallahassee, into Georgia, 85 million people are under watches and warnings this morning. A tornado watch issued for 17 million people in Florida. That includes Tampa, Miami, Fort Myers, and Orlando. There is a whole lot going on as this storm pushes in. Let's get right to CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar with the very latest and this 8:00 a.m. update. Allison, what can you tell us?",

Forward movement still the same at 12 miles per hour, but that is also expected to increase as we go through the day today.And you mentioned one of the newer things we've had and issued is this tornado watch, valid until 8:00 pm eastern time tonight. And that includes most of the big cities here -- Tampa, Fort Myers, Miami, even Orlando. And we are likely to see more of these areas added on to it because we've had tornado warnings. We've got several active right now in Florida, but also one up a north, or up in South Carolina. So it's very likely believe we will see that tornado watch expand into portions of Georgia and the Carolinas as we go through the day and more of those outer bands begin to spread into some of these states. This storm is expected to strengthen even more, reaching major hurricane status once we get a little bit later into the day today before making landfall tonight near the Big Bend region. At that point, it should be moving at a forward speed of about 25 miles per hour or even faster. That's important because that means it can move pretty far inland before weakening back down to a tropical storm, impacting a lot of areas that are more than 100 miles away from the coast with hurricane strength winds. Now, another component of this is going to be the flooding, because we're talking a tremendous amount of rain. And for a lot of these areas, they had a recent cold front move through, so the ground is already saturated, which means that threshold for flooding automatically is a little bit different than it would be on dry ground. Most of these areas you're talking widespread, four to eight inches of rain. Some areas not out of the question, John, to pick up 10 or even 12 inches total.",

And you're taking a look at the reason why, because you see just how much flooding we're already experiencing well ahead of the storm.And to give you a sense of just how close the bay is, my photographer might be able to push in. You're going to take a look at kind of where that woman is walking there. That is a beat each volleyball court, and you can already see where the bay has started to come into that part of where we are right now. It's not going to take a whole lot more for that water to go ahead and cross over onto the street that we are. This part of Pinellas County, the Gulfport part of Pinellas County, is known to flood. We have been here covering two other hurricanes the past two years and this is pretty much how it's always looked. And we're talking about the fact that neither of those two hurricanes really had a direct hit. Now, over in Hillsborough County, just to the east of us, that is home to Tampa. There is also a mandatory evacuation order that went into effect yesterday. Folks that live around the bay we're told to go ahead and seek higher ground. Of course, this storm is to the west of us. It is expected to continue on the path that it's on. So this part of the Tampa Bay area is expected to get some pretty nasty weather, some tropical storms -- tropical storm force winds, but most of it is going to remain offshore.

I think the last time we spoke, the water level of the Steinhatchee River was a little bit lower, but it is increasing. It is rising with every drop of raindrop that we see falling. Why is this worrisome? Because there are a lot of homes right off the riverbank. There are businesses. We are actually standing on the dock of a motel. And we know that this stock could be underwater in just a matter of hours. Now, also right behind me, you see that there are some boats docked as well. They've been there all morning long.

What this has meant over the past week or so is that they have specific intelligence to target specific Hezbollah commanders and leaders. We don't know anything more at this stage, but I think that gives you a headline when we start to talk about the diplomacy, because although there is a discussion about a 21-day truce between the United States and France and a real push to move that forward, the prime minister is taking heat here for suggestions that he might have already agreed to it. He has been very clear and said that he isn't so far or hasn't so far made any comments about this 21-day truce proposal. He has said that he is giving full support fought for the military to go full force. We know that the IDF is poised, is ready to cross the border in an incursion if they get that order and what we've witnessed over the past 24 hours, although albeit a slight low in strikes overnight, there had been several rounds of Israeli strikes into Lebanon today, and along the border with Syria targeting Hezbollah. And also Hezbollah, firing dozens of missiles into Northern Israel, the medium and short-range missiles. So from a military point of view, we are nowhere near a truce; from a political point of view, it doesn't seem that that's anywhere near close either because the prime minister in Lebanon has also been taking heat for the idea that he might have agreed to this truce, and he says, he hasn't either. Politically, we are not there and I think from the IDF's perspective, they feel that they have the military momentum and this wouldn't be the time to cede that momentum into a truce. So, I think the diplomacy, if it is going to move ahead, is going to need a huge lift. It seems unlikely at the moment.",
