Brianna Keilar is just outside the New York courthouse for us.Stormy Daniels is still on the stand right now after testifying about her alleged sexual encounter with Trump back in 2006 and the 2016 payment she received to keep quiet about it, $130,000. This is such an unprecedented and bizarre moment in American history. First time ever a former U.S. president has faced a criminal trial. Right now a lot is going on and I want to send it over to Brianna who's joining us. Brianna?",

The judge did deny that motion, but acknowledged that some of the prosecution's questions about the alleged sexual encounter did not need to be asked.We have Phil Mattingly and Paula Reid who have been following every twist and turn in this. They are back with us now. And Paula, we're really at the heart of this. Exactly what the prosecution here alleges that Donald Trump wanted to conceal and from which the alleged crimes flow.",

I think you recognize right now this is - the contrast that we're getting from our people that are in the room, from our great team that's in the room, compared to this morning where it was very clear Donald Trump was agitated. It was very clear his attorneys were moving repeatedly to object, some of which were sustained.And now they're describing Trump is a little bit more kind of relaxed, laid back. And I think it goes to the content this morning was extraordinarily embarrassing on a human level. It was, I think, probably the worst thing you could imagine for a person who is always able to respond, is always able to clap back, is always able to attack whoever he feels like is attacking him. Obviously, he's not allowed to. He seemed to attempt to a little bit this morning with a truth posting that he 30 minutes later had to take down. But I think it's a recognition that this morning was bad. But now they're going through two things. One, what Paul laid out, and two, they're trying to front run, I think, what is about to come.

He listed the payment as a legal expense and they're saying that's a crime and we still don't really have any testimony or evidence about it.But second, I think even as salacious as those details were, it actually reinforces the narrative that he did not want Mrs. Trump or his family to know about it, which is what Hope Hicks testified to. So it's starting - it's creating that narrative. I think that the prosecution witnesses are actually creating the defense narrative for them.",

So there is that narrative that has been out there by someone very much in the know. I guess the question then would be the link, right, when it comes to Donald Trump being behind this falsification of the records and is that link being painted clearly enough for the jury.I do wonder, though, from your perspective, before court was in session this morning, the former president posted a Truth Social. He said, \"I've just recently been told who the witness is today. This is unprecedented, no time for lawyers to prepare.\" We have to be clear. The reason that there is this prosecutorial discretion on saying who these witnesses are going to be is because he tends to get on social media and talk about them or talk about things he's not supposed to. He deleted that post following the judge yesterday threatening jail time. Why do you think Trump deleted the post?",

So I'm not sure that they're shocked by it, but they're just basically, I think, waiting to see where do we - where are we finding this - the - that payments made in 2017 were to affect the 2016 election.I mean, I get it if he was investing in a time machine that might affect the 2016 election, but payments that are months and if not up to a year later after the fact, that doesn't really impact an election that's already taken place.",

They got her to admit right up front. She hates the defendant. I mean, you almost never see that. I had a case where one time the witness had sent a sort of negative letter to the defendant and that went - boy, that was used. Here she says - at least she's honest. At least she says straight up. I hate him. \"Am I correct that you hate president Trump?\" AnswerLater, they moved into her financial motive. They said, you want to make money? And she said, again, candidly, yes. I want to make money. People want to make money. And now the questioning relates to a lawsuit. It's important that people understand what happened in this lawsuit. Stormy Daniels brought a defamation case against Donald Trump. Stormy Daniels told a story about how she was threatened in a parking lot. And then Donald Trump sent, as he's want to do, a negative tweet, I think, at the time saying that it was a bogus story and attacking the mainstream media. She then sued him for defamation. And that suit was thrown out by the judge and the judge awarded Donald Trump attorney's fees in the range of half a million dollars. And Stormy Daniels was asked about that. And her testimony was, she said, quote, \"He prevailed, but I was not found to have lost.\" That's a lousy answer. I mean, the case was dismissed and now she has to pay a half million dollars legal fees. And one other detail, she also admitted that - she said that if he is jailed, she would dance and she laughed. And I don't think the jury is going to like that. I don't think they see this as a laughing matter or a matter for personal vengeance and retribution.",

So I'm not that stunned that they're sort of going after her in this way.But I think what the things that they're doing that's starting to shake out, number one, the bias to the points that we were talking about a moment ago, this idea of having - there's always a tweet, having tweeted pretty harsh things about the defendant himself. Now look, he's a public figure and we've been talking about this for quite some time, and a lot of people were tweeting things about the former president. However, when you're a witness in a criminal trial against him, it's going to come back to haunt you. Do you hate him and so on. And something - there was this back and forth over even Stormy Daniels laughing. She was chuckling in court. And this is something we were talking about a little bit earlier in this program, how that will play before the jury. Now look, some human beings are nervous laughers, right? Frankly, I am, too. But I'm also not testifying in front of a jury. And I think what the part of that cross-examination was, was saying that, why are you laughing? Like, do you find this funny? And I think that's the kind of thing that can get in the jury's head, thinking that, number one, this person has a bias, but also, number two, this person isn't taking this testimony seriously.",

And so he has people who are in his camp, right-wing social media influencers, who have millions of followers, who can blast out whatever they want about the witnesses.

They point out the fact that Stormy Daniels has said publicly that she would, \"Dance if Trump went to jail.\" So they're clearly establishing that Stormy Daniels does not like the defendant.Now they're going through some things that Stormy Daniels has said about him publicly, including a tweet where she's talking about money that courts have said that she owes Trump hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees. And she says, this is Stormy Daniels, says, \"I don't owe him (expletive) and I'll never give that orange turd a dime.\" Now, Daniels said that this tweet is in retaliation for what he says about her. Now, this is when it got really heated, because Necheles confirms: \"You call him names all the time.\" And Daniels starts to sort of yell, saying, \"Yes. Because he made fun of me first.\" I mean, this is pretty - this is devolving pretty quickly, right? This is pretty toddler-esque conduct and lack of accountability.

We talked before - before the cross-examination started about how Susan Hoffinger seemed to be trying to front run some things, get some things out there about the defamation case, about some of the things she said, about the people she's talked to, now you understand why.
