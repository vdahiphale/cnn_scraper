Both the NFL and NBA are warning players that their homes could be targeted for break ins by well organized groups. This follows a string of high-profile burglaries at some athletes' homes over the past few months, including Kansas City Chiefs superstars Travis Kelce and Patrick Mahomes, and multiple NBA players as well. Some are even turning to the public for help.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BOBBY PORTIS JR. NBA PLAYER WHOSE HOME WAS BURGLARIZED:  While I was at my game yesterday, I had a home invasion and they took most of my prized possessions. Any info that leads to the return of any of my belongings will be rewarded handsomely. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And what they indicate is that they were briefed on the FBI -- by the FBI saying that some of these burglaries are believed to have been the work of transnational criminal groups.We've covered these groups, so-called burglary tourism that will come in often from South America to conduct these high-end robberies. And what authorities have noticed is that so many of these have similar attributes. So, let's take a look at some of them that they're seeing with these robberies. Oftentimes, burglars are exploiting team schedules. These are people who are often away from home for extended periods of time. They're also conducting extensive surveillance at some of these residences and they go so far as to actually pose as delivery drivers or groundskeepers in order to get a sense of the coming and going of residents. They also will sometimes scale buildings to get to the top floors, often targeting the master bedroom and closets to try to steal money, to try to steal things like jewelry. Now, as I mentioned, these groups, you know, we've heard from law enforcement from coast to coast that this is a growing of concern, these so-called burglary tourists. I'll let you listen to one D.A. that we spoke with who said that, you know, these aren't keystone crooks. This is a professional operation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They were successful in getting the district attorney's office to agree to delay sentencing as long -- as far out as, you know, when Trump leaves the White House for the second time. But the district attorney's office said they would try to fight any effort to dismiss this case. But a couple days ago, Trump's lawyer said they are going to argue that as president-elect, Trump is entitled to the same protections as a sitting president, and under Department of Justice guidance, sitting presidents are immune from prosecution. They argue that this extends to things like sentencing, and they're going to use this argument, Pamela, to try to get the entire case dismissed. Now, they had asked the judge to give them until December 20th to make these arguments. Instead, the judge gave them until December 2nd, and then the prosecutors will respond by December 9th. So, it looks like the judge is going to try to possibly get an answer before the Christmas and New Year's holidays. But again, there's other outstanding issues. The judge is also weighing whether the Supreme Court's decision on presidential immunity would mean that this case would need to be dismissed. But as of right now, the only answer that we have from Judge Juan Merchan is that sentencing is definitely not happening next week. And we can expect more arguments from both sides over the next several weeks.",

President-Elect Trump's new pick for the top job at the Justice Department is former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, and she is already winning praise from some in the party.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. MIKE ROUNDS (R-SD):  My first impression was that it was a good pick. I do not believe that she is problematic. I did express earlier that I thought his previous choice would be problematic. And so, I don't think she has near the challenges that he would have had. So, yes, I think this is the right thing. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I anchored the show and then right after Gaetz withdrew and then Trump, our reporting, was didn't know who he was going to replace Gaetz with and then he announces Pam Bondi last night and she is receiving some praise already from Republican senators. But it is interesting, Lance, because Donald Trump, since he won the election, has been projecting this sort of invincibility, right? Does the Gaetz withdrawal sort of pierce that? LANCE TROVER, FORMER SPOKESPERSON, GOV. BURGUM'S 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN:  No, no, no. I mean, there's -- look, this is part of a process that happens and I think, obviously, she's going to get a much warmer reception in the United States Senate than the previous nominee, to say the least. My sense is she's probably a slam dunk for this thing based on what we see right now. She is eminently qualified. You see senators like that coming out right now. Elie Honig was on with Kaitlan Collins last night talking about her qualifications and how she is qualified for this job. I suspect we will see more legal analysts like that come forward. More senators are going to come out of the woodwork. And look, she's going to have to go in front of the Judiciary Committee like everybody else and answer the tough questions.

They recognize that, look, they have a lot to do on January 20th. They want to hit the ground running and they don't have a lot of time for this drama to play out. And so, they moved on.
