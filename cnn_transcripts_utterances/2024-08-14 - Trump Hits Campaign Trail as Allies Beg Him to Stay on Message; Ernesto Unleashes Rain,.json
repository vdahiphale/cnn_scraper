Those are coming from the far right fringes of Donald Trump's orbit and people who, yet, even though they are conspiratorial, continue to have a pipeline into Trump. And that is a concern for people in his orbit. And privately there are people telling him that he needs to stay on message, and lately those concerns are being made publicly as well. Take a listen.

She'll also be doing an event with Joe Biden tomorrow, talking about lowering prices for Americans, trying to make that direct argument. But, look, when J.D. Vance was picked for the ticket by Donald Trump, part of the argument that they were hoping he would make is a connection to working class, that are -- sort of the upbringing -- that's the upbringing that Vance had himself. Walz is coming at this, saying that he has actually had the full working class experience over his whole life and representing people and also connecting back to Kamala Harris, saying, as they've had an ads, that she worked in McDonald's when she was in college, and that's something, if we could take a look to how he talked about it yesterday, bringing up that McDonald's contrast.

The Walz campaign, or the Harris-Walz campaign and their aides, have been trying over the course of the last couple days to clean some of this up, saying he misspoke when he said that he carried the weapons of war happened one time.As for leaving before he knew his unit was going to go to Iraq, it's a murky business, but it does seem like a lot of it was because Walz was running for Congress that year and had filed his retirement papers, maybe knowing that it was a possibility. But Walz himself hasn't talked about this until just yesterday. And he said that it was not going to -- he was not going to make an issue of it. He was just going to thank J.D.

Wade was overturned. They say in this poll that about two thirds of women are concerned that they or someone close to them would not be able to get an abortion if they needed them to preserve their life or health. 64 percent are concerned that abortion bans may affect the safety of a future pregnancy. And, Kate, already 8 percent of people in this poll said that they had difficulty accessing and needed abortion, and that was 13 percent in states with abortion bans. Now, they also surveyed women's attitudes toward policy on abortion. 70 percent of women in this survey support a nationwide right to abortion. And across political lines, you also see a majority of women of reproductive age saying that this should not be left up to the states. That was up to more than 80 percent for Democrats.
