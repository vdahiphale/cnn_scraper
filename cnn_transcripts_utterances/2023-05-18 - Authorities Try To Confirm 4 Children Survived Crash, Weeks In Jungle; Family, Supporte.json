And the kids are alive, officials believe, after surviving a plane crash that killed three adults.Reportedly also including the kids' mother. So far though, there's been no direct contact with the young survivors that we know of. They are just 13, 9, 4 and 11 months -- 11 months old. The president of Colombia fueled some confusion when he first hailed their rescue in a tweet and then later deleted it. A government official says she is confident that the children will be found. They were first spotted after Colombian forces followed a trail of items, including baby bottles. Listen to what a survival expert told CNN earlier this afternoon. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

This brand is all about every day low prices. So, this is all just fine for Walmart. They just reported pretty strong sales growth. Sales in the first quarter, up by 7.4 percent. That's pretty solid for a company the size of Walmart. It's actually twice the pace of sales growth a year ago.And what's interesting here is where people are spending their money. Walmart reported strong growth for groceries, pets, wellness, pharmacy. And what do those things have in common? Those are all things people need to spend money on. Maybe not what they want to, but what they need to. But Walmart says there's been softer sales growth for more discretionary items including home improvement and electronics and clothes. And as you mentioned, Walmart also said they're starting to gain market share among higher income families. Again, that's more evidence that people are price conscious right now. I think that, Boris, you know, people are still spending money, they're just spending the money differently and perhaps at different places.",
