      "sentences": "It's October and I know the surprise. I'm Michael Smerconish in Philadelphia. The final day of voting is four weeks from Tuesday, and even without my showing you the latest polling, you already know the state of play. While Vice President Kamala Harris has a slight edge over former President Trump in the popular vote, the seven widely recognized battleground states are within the margin of error, this after a long, strange trip in which nothing has moved the nation from an intractable divide. When it began, there was a lot of talk about a third party factor, but they couldn't find a ticket to meet the moment.And the fresher face from Florida never got the traction that some had anticipated. So Trump cruised to the nomination without ever having to debate his opponents, and was actually bolstered by four indictments and suffered no setback among Republicans, even after being convicted. The general election field then took shape. Age was immediately a factor. The only thing these candidates could agree on was to debate at the start of summer and not at the end. It didn't go well for Biden. He yielded to pressure to step aside. Talk of a quick competition yielded to a coronation, the torch quickly passed. Another debate was soon scheduled with a clear Harris victory. And now the race returned to where it first began, a deadlock, which is the biggest surprise of all, that despite a storyline that, if pitched in Hollywood would have been rejected as too fantastical. Nothing has really moved the needle. Which brings me to October, the longshoremen strike has been suspended, but there's still war in the Middle East, war in Ukraine, the aftermath of a devastating hurricane, and the yet to be determined impact of an 11th hour legal filing by the special counsel. Plenty of time for events we could never forecast to unfold, featuring people whose names we might not even know and maybe even their pets. Anybody remember Kristi Noem's dog? Kristi Noem's goat? Bobby's brain worm? Bobby and the bear? Bobby and the whale? J.D. Vance and the childless cat ladies? And of course, the unsubstantiated claim of eating dogs and cats in Springfield. You can't make this stuff up. But here's the lesson. Yesterday on my SiriusXM radio program, Professor Allan Lichtman, he, with those 13 keys that allow him to predict the election winner this year, he says it's Harris. Well, here's what he said about an October surprise. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ALLAN LICHTMAN, CO-FOUNDER OF THE \"13 KEYS TO THE WHITE HOUSE\": One of the greatest myths of American politics is the October surprise. I have never changed my prediction in response to an October surprise because the keys gauge the big picture of incumbent governance and strength and don't sway by the events of the campaign.

In Pennsylvania, I hear from people that, you know, they're just not ready to commit to Kamala Harris. They haven't seen her enough, heard from her enough. You know, Trump's out there every day like on the hustings and Kamala Harris just hasn't made the -- hasn't made the pitch yet, hasn't asked for the vote out there. And if she does lose, I think it's because she's kept in bubble wrap on a shelf someplace. They're playing defense, not offense.

It's very easy for a contagious idea, contagious behavior, to race unchecked through the entire population, where you have, what your high school mind had, lots of different cliques and groups that are separated. It's very difficult for one idea to dominate the whole culture.And I think what's happened is that in certain parts of America, we've fallen in love with the idea that every kid ought to be -- ought to share the same values and be focused on the same goals. So in this town I talk about, it's a town of upper middle class professionals. Every parent wanted their kid to go to an elite school, to do really well in school, to be a sports star, to be happy and successful and dress really well and be attractive. And, you know, the pressure that put on the population was such that they became susceptible to this suicide outbreak. And I think it's, you know, sometimes when we talk about the benefits of diversity, we focus way too narrowly and we, you know, we talk exclusively in terms of ethnic diversity. And we forget there are broader benefits to all kinds of diversity. And that creating a society that has a home for all kinds of people with very different perspectives is part of what makes a society safe. Diversity is safety, it's not the opposite.

And what occurred to me as I read the book is every experience that you had in Park Ridge and thereafter is one not being duplicated by our kids today.I'm worried about them. You're worried about them. Who were the Park Ridge girls? I think that will help explain.",

The discussion of social capital of the sort that I'm sure the Rodhams enjoyed in Park Ridge, right, participation, belonging, volunteerism, that is so missing today.You cite Johnathan Haidt. You cite Jean Twenge. Here's what disappoints me. And it's not about you, Madam Secretary. I'm shocked that no person, no Republican, no Democrat is championing this issue. The social science is so clear. The political science is so clear. Our fabric has frayed as a nation. Our kids are disconnected. Too much time behind closed doors on devices and not enough time replicating the experience of their parents and grandparents. So, what do we do about it? What do we do about it for your grandkids?",

Actually, we can look at the state of California, the state of on New York. I think some other states have also taken action, but we need national action.And sadly, our Congress has been dysfunctional when it comes to addressing these threats to our children. So, you're absolutely right. This should be at the top of every legislative, political agenda. There should be a lot one of things done. We should be, in my view, repealing something called Section 230, which gave, you know, platforms on the internet immunity because they were thought to be just pass-throughs. That they shouldn't be judged for the content that is posted. But we now know that that was an overly simple view. That if the platforms, whether it's Facebook, or Twitter, X, or Instagram, or TikTok, whatever they are, if they don't moderate and monitor the content we lose total control. And it's not just the social and psychological effects, it's real harm. It's, you know, child porn, and threats of violence, things that are terribly dangerous. So, I couldn't agree with you more. We need to remove the immunity from liability and we need to have guardrails. We need regulation. We've conducted this big experiment on ourselves, and particularly our kids. And I think the evidence is in that we've got to do more. Take phones out of schools. I'm so happy to see schools beginning to do that where the kids turn their phone in when they walk in the door. And guess what, Michael? It won't surprise you because you're on this. Kids are paying better attention in class. They are talking to each other in the lunch room. Things that used to be part of your daily life when you were a child in school.",

But I also, obviously, talk about the threats to our democracy, to our freedom, to our liberty.Because, I think, if you're going to be an involved citizen you have to pay attention to what's going on. And we have to be focused on this election. We have to understand what's at stake. But finally, add to what you said, we've got to get back to being a community again. You know, having people interact with each other, find common ground together. So, hopefully the election will turn out the right way. The fever will be broken. And we can go back to trying to put our families and our communities on the right track.",
