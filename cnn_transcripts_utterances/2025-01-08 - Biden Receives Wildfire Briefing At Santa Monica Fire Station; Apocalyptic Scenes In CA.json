This hour, President Biden is set to get an update from officials as four life threatening wildfires tear through Los Angeles County, the most populous county in the United States. Right now, flames are spreading fast. Brutal wind gusts are fueling these fires as high as 100 miles an hour in some areas. And so far there is zero containment of any of these fires.This is a video now from a passenger on a flight arriving at LAX who says it felt like flying into the apocalypse. We know at least two people have died, a number of others are injured. Countless homes and buildings are now rubble and tens of thousands have been forced to evacuate.",

And when you look, you can actually see how fast the smoke is blowing off of this canyon area up here behind Sunset Boulevard, which dead ends into the Pacific Coast Highway. And the smoke is like hurtling past us with ash and little bits of debris coming off of there.But if you look at this building behind the 76th gas station, there was a taller structure there and we watched it burn away overnight just to show you how quickly things are escalating and being demolished out here. And that's just parts of what we can see. We've seen parts of fires burning along the side of the PCH going north and south. A little structure next to this Gladstone Seafood Restaurant. It's a pretty famous restaurant here. Along the highway here, there was a fire there. It looked like maybe in a rubbish bin, but the firefighters responded and shut it down. They're going back and forth through this area just to make sure that they're putting out hot spots. But let's be clear, this is not a fire that's anywhere near containment. This is a fire that has a lot of fuel and then along with these winds makes it very, very dangerous because those fire -- just a little bit of fire could get caught up in the wind and then it takes off and it can start a fire someplace else. We feel pretty safe where we are here because just on that side of me is the Pacific Ocean. So if need be we could go that way. But you can see here that fire truck right there that just went by us from Montecito, which is up by Santa Barbara. What they're doing here in this area is flooding the area with firefighters from other regions because the area here is taxed. They have asked all of the Los Angeles county firefighters if they're off to report to duty, to come back to work because it's an all hands on deck situation. Because it is, as you said, four fires that are really breaking down the system here. And on top of it yesterday I was on my way out about two-and-a half hours away -- actually, I did make it all the way out there to where President Biden was going to go. He couldn't make it out there because of these winds driving back. You could see this from very, very far away. That's how massive this is.",

Let's go ahead and listen in.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MAN #3: (Inaudible). Thank you for being here on behalf of the fire service. Last week, we began receiving reports from the National Weather Service about a significant wind event that was going to hit Southern California. This is not something that's a surprise to us in Southern California and it was something that we were well prepared for. Based on those predictive conditions of wind gusts up to 100 miles an hour east pushing offshore, we began increasing our staffing. Local, state and federal agencies. Hundreds of firefighters began moving on Sunday afternoon from Northern California into Southern California. My local partners began upstaffing their own fire stations, helicopters, fire engines, hand crews to be prepared for an incident like this that occurred. Those resources were pre-positioned in counties throughout Southern California for an event just like this. And on Tuesday morning, the Palisades fire began. I'd now like to introduce you to Chief Crowley who can touch on the Palisades fire. Chief. CHIEF KRISTIN CROWLEY, LOS ANGELES FIRE DEPT.: Thank you. Thank you so much, Mr. President. I'm here just to provide you a brief on three significant fires that have occurred within the city of Los Angeles. With that, I'm going to be focusing on The Palisades fire. That fire broke out yesterday morning around 10:30. We did pre deploy a number of resources. We knew this was there was a potential for a significant threat to our constituents due to the weather event. High, high, high winds. I've never seen the winds in my 25-year career. So we leaned forward as much as possible and pre-deployed. With that, we had a significant amount of fire that occurred. We had an aggressive fire attack. The fire has grown from originally 10 acres to 10,802 acres as we speak. It's an active, active fire fight with our firefighters and they're doing their very best to protect our people within this area. Interesting enough because of the winds and the low humidity, we had a second fire also break out and that was the Hearst fire, which is just north of that area. Again, this was close to 11,000 acres. This is close to 500 acres that also broke out. The information that I want to share with you is also the significance of multiple fires in the area within the city, but also the county. That's the second fire that actually came out and we're actively engaged in that firefight. The third fire then broke out this morning at 4:00 in the morning in which we have an active firefight there as well. We're working with our local jurisdictions, our state, regional as well as federal. So we're doing everything we can to protect life first and property next. We'll go ahead and then pass this off to Police Chief McDonnell. Thank you.",

It's impacting tens of thousands of homes not only in the city of Pasadena, but also the county area of Altadena. And we're doing our very best. We just had our out of state resources arrive from Arizona at the Eaton fire to assist us. Last night, as the Region 1 coordinator, I contacted the Governor's Office of Emergency Services. We requested two hundred and fifty additional engines into LA County with a thousand personnel. We also are using our inner -- our compacts with other states like Arizona, Nevada, Oregon and Washington.
