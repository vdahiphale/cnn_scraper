Renewed fears of flooding with watches in effect now for 8 million people. Good morning, welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world, I'm Christine Romans. The Chairman of the House Oversight Committee attacking President Biden and his team for mishandling the discovery of classified documents in his think-tank office in Delaware home. Republican James Comer announcing on CNN \"STATE OF THE UNION\" that he sent a letter to the White House demanding more information on what happened. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JAMES COMER (R-KY):  Well, we don't know exactly yet whether they broke the law or not. I will accuse the Biden administration of not being transparent. Why didn't we hear about this on November 2nd when the first batch of classified documents were discovered. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But we're hearing as you say this morning on the southern front from Ukrainian officials, the city of Nikopol which is just across the River, it should be said from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, over a dozen private homes were hit there, a gas main as well.To the northeast in the town of Zaporizhzhia, the regional capital there, more shelling, private homes were hit as well there. And injuries reported, a 9 and a 15-year-old among those taken to hospital. Separately, we had a Russian-backed official in the city of Donetsk which is occupied by Russia, saying that three rockets there hit civilian targets including a meat processing facility, a pharmacy, a residential building, those kinds of things. No casualties reported there as of yet. But as we talk about this, the death toll continues to mount in that very deadly attack on that apartment block in Dnipro, which is Ukraine's third largest city. We're now up to 36 who been killed there, including two children. Dozens remain unaccounted for. The mayor of the city there says that he thinks the target was probably a thermal power plant instead of that apartment block. And we're hearing this morning, Christine, we have the first reaction from the Kremlin on this, the spokesman, Dmitry Peskov saying that the Russian armed forces, he says do not strike at residential buildings only at military targets. And he says that this was the result of what he calls Ukrainian counter-missiles, essentially blaming missile defense systems for the attack on this apartment block.",

A string of atmospheric rivers, long narrow regions in the atmosphere that carry moisture thousands of miles, they are battering the state. Communities left flooded, highway systems crippled, thousands forced to evacuate their homes, 19 people have been killed by these storms. CNN's Natasha Chen has more from Sonoma Valley, California. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NATASHA CHEN, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera):  We're here at Johnson's Beach at the Russian River here in Guerneville, where there is as the name suggests supposed to be a beach. But with all of the storms, the water has now flooded up to what is supposed to be a driveway. If you look past that sign there that says no life guard on duty, local residents tell us that there are supposed to be a walkway for another 20 feet and a whole parking lot before the actual beach. So there have been locals coming up to the water's edge, taking photos, because as one woman told me, she's lived here for 30 years and is intrigued to see the water come up this far. And there was someone we saw trying to kayak in this earlier, not sure that's recommended. But definitely a sight to behold for the people who have lived here for decades. And that's what we're seeing around the whole bay area. People noticing that because there is so much moisture already saturated in the ground, it's not taking much this weekend for a lot of flooding and threats of mud slides like we saw on Saturday in Belmont, California. That's on the peninsula south of San Francisco. Belmont police shared these photos of part of a hill side coming down into a residential neighborhood. And that's the type of threat that county, city officials everywhere are warning residents to still please be careful as more rain is expected from Sunday night into Monday morning along with high wind gusts. In fact, San Luis Obispo County, Santa Barbara County warning people that they're having a wind advisory there. And there's still thousands of California customers without power at this point and millions under a flood watch. Natasha Chen, CNN, Guerneville, California. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The car then striking and coming to rest at this apartment building. Willock and LeCroy died from their injuries. Two others connected with the football program were hurt. According to the football roster, Willock was from New Jersey, an offensive lineman, he was a red shirt sophomore and played every game this year. Willock's head coach speaking out saying, quote, \"we're all heartbroken and devastated with the loss of Devin Willock and Chandler LeCroy. Devin was an outstanding young man in every way and was always smiling. He was a great teammate and a joy to coach. Chandler was a valuable member of our football staff and brought an incredible attitude and energy every single day.\" And take a look at this video showing the team celebrating their national championship victory just hours before on Saturday.

That's going to be very vital in the interrogations. We do know from the government in Nepal that there is a five-member committee that has been formed to probe this accident.And they have to submit a report within the next 45 days. Meanwhile, on the ground, it's day two of search operations. And we do know that cranes are being used, Christine, to recover those bodies from the gorge. About 67 bodies have been pulled out of the gorge as of now according to officials. They've been taken to the hospital where about 38 bodies have been identified by family members. Postmortems need to be conducted. Also 15 foreign nationals died in this air crash. Their bodies will be air- lifted to the capital city of Kathmandu, and then their bodies will be handed over to family members after the postmortem. But it's very important to understand here that, there could be any reason behind this air crash until it's not determined by the people who are probing this accident. The weather seems to have been cleared. So that possibly could be ruled out, but it's the black box that really holds what really happened inside that cockpit that led to the crash. There's this video that has been doing the rounds on social media, it appears to be of the moments before the air crash, where you do see the plane flying pretty low in a very populated area in Pokhara in western Nepal, and then it just rolls to its side and moves out of the frame. And moments later, there's a massive explosion that can be heard. For these families, we talk about 72 families of which four bodies have not been retrieved, 68 have as of now, but for these families they need closure, they need answers and hopefully, they will come once that probe committee goes ahead and submits their report to the civil aviation authorities and the government of Nepal, Christine.",

There was no manipulation of them, no markings on them, and he was not charged with anything. As opposed to say Army General Petraeus or National Security adviser Sandy Berger, both of those guys took these documents intentionally, then failed to cooperate fully with the  government when they were asking for them. Both of them had to plead guilty to misdemeanor mishandling of documents.

International experts are saying that number of 60,000, which was reported on the weekend from China's National Health Commission is still an underestimate of what the real toll is. But before that, it was 37 deaths in the last month.No one was buying that. And there was a great deal of international pressure placed on China to be more forthcoming and transparent about what the real COVID situation was in the country. Remember, China has lived with a zero COVID policy for the past three years. And then in December, the government did a complete back-flip following weeks of protests and obviously the enormous strain on the economy, and decided to end that strategy altogether. Now, officials have said that the cases have peaked, the wave has peaked, but you know, we saw that meeting on the weekend between the Chinese health minister as well as the W.H.O., and that is when they revised that number of 60,000. The concern, Christine, is that Chinese new year is coming up. People are already traveling. Experts say something like 2 billion people, the largest human migration on earth, will take place over the next few weeks. And while maybe there has been a peak in the cities, you know, in major capital areas, these people are going to migrate to the provinces, to the rural areas, to see family that they haven't seen now for almost three years. And they will bring COVID. And this is where, you know, we know there's a large elderly population that live in these rural areas. There is poor health infrastructure also in these areas. So experts fear, Christine, that there is going to be a severe spike in cases, but also in deaths.",
