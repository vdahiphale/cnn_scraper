And frankly, he believes that they got it wrong. So President Biden said that while Friday's decision closes one path, he is going to seek another.Now, that new path is grounded in the Higher Education Act of 1965, a different law that the White House believes provides President Biden with authority to do that widespread student debt cancellation that he has promised as a campaign promise. But they say that it will take a long time. It will take months, really, to get it off the ground, and they wouldn't say whether or not the 40 million estimated to be impacted by the struck down law would also be impacted by this new path. Still though, in the interim, for President Biden to get this new pathway off the ground, he says that he is doing two things. First of all, when it comes to repayment, he is going to focus on income-based repayments. And then secondly, he is going to provide a 12-month onramp repayment program, as you see on your screen here. That is really designed to give borrowers the ability to be reacclimated to paying down their student debt. It is expected to start again in October. And while interest will incur over the 12-month program, the theory that is if you miss a payment or you're not able to pay, you will not be penalized, you will not be sent to default, and your credit will not be impacted for that 12-month grace period. Another thing, though, that we saw President Biden do on Friday is he really slammed this growing Republican talking point that it was actually him who misstated what his ability and what his authority would be to actually provide that widespread debt relief. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But first, as you know, we have a massive black-white wealth gap in this country. White families have six, seven, eight times as much money as black families. And we know because black families have less resources, they take out more debt. So going forward, the cost of going to college, that debt actually exacerbates the divide between black and white families. It is very unfair.The second thing, as you know, is we have a massive teacher shortage that is going to get worse as we move forward, particularly as so many teachers retiring due to age and due to the challenges of the pandemic. Teaching, as you know, is not a lucrative profession. Many young people want to go into teaching, that's where their heart, that's where their passion is, but they can't afford that debt. Had we relieved that debt, that would have given them more hope. But with that option going away for now, that has a really chilling effect on young people thinking about going into education.

Citing multiple people familiar with the call, the former president claimed if enough fraudulent votes were found it would overcome his narrow loss in the state. \"The Post\" also reporting that Trump repeatedly asked then Vice President Mike Pence to pressure Ducey as well into helping him stay in power.Of course, Governor Ducey did not go through with that plan and certified President Biden's win in Arizona. Here with me now is \"Washington Post\" investigative reporter Josh Dawsey. Josh, good morning to you. Thank you so much for joining us here. So tell us more about what you learned, because there has been so much focus on that one call in January of 2021 when Trump called the Georgia secretary of state, but now we know about another phone call that Trump apparently made. Who did you talk to for the story, and what do we know about the details of the call? JOSH DAWSEY, POLITICAL INVESTIGATIONS REPORTER, \"THE WASHINGTON POST\": We know in that frenzied period right after the election, former President Trump was trying to pressure officials in multiple states to go along with his false claims that the election was stolen, Brad Raffensperger in Georgia being the most famous of those calls. But there was a campaign against Governor Ducey in Arizona that was pretty elaborate, actually. At the time Governor Ducey certified the results, if you remember, and the former president wasn't happy. He called him and laid out a whole range of unsubstantiated fraud theories and then asked Mike Pence to call several times as well to try to convince him to go along with his effort to overthrow the 2020 election. Governor Ducey did not do that. And if you remember, former President Trump was quite nasty to him on Twitter and on social media, and live on television, called him all sorts of names and attacking his integrity.",

There is from the University of California system, they conducted the study. \"Underrepresented minorities applicants became at least 40 percent less likely to be admitted to U.C.'s more selective Berkeley and UCLA campuses. The average underrepresented minority U.C. applicant, wages declined by five percent annually between ages 24 and 34. And by the mid-2010s, there was a cumulative decline in the number of early career underrepresented minorities Californians overall earning $100,000 by at least three percent.\"So when we see the impact of these policies, extrapolate from those what this means on a national scale for us societally.",

Here's that first cluster, again, raining in Indianapolis, Cincinnati, making its way through Fort Wayne. You also have other areas where we have some showers and thunderstorms popping up, Mississippi, Texas, even areas of the Carolinas.And then the secondary wave will move through later on this afternoon. And we have another potential for some strong to severe storms, damaging winds, large hail, even a few tornadoes possible anywhere you see these colors on the map. Also that secondary area located on the back portion of Texas, western Texas and eastern New Mexico. Here's the first round. The second round very much right behind it, this afternoon and into the evening. Then when we push forward into Sunday, the bulk of that begins to spread into the mid-Atlantic, the northeast, but we also have more showers and thunderstorms across the southeast as well. So a lot of areas here. If you're dealing with travel, you are likely going to experience some delays, mostly on the roads, but even in the air you could start to see some delays and cancellations, especially as those severe thunderstorms fire up. Two separate areas here dealing with heat, we're talking about excessive heat warnings and heat advisories across much of the south, especially the Gulf Coast region, and then to the west. We also have some pretty expansive heat starting to take shape there. Across the Gulf Coast, again most of these temperatures still hot, but we're starting to see light at the end of the tunnel having them come down. Dallas today, still in the triple digits, but finally back down into only double digits for the rest of the week. We'll get there too for New Orleans and Mobile, but likely going to take an extra day or two before we see that drop.

Now, we are told that this has really intensified over the last several weeks, these conversations about the cluster munitions, because of the battlefield conditions inside Ukraine.Apparently, according to U.S. official, the Ukrainians have been using a heavy amount of artillery ammunition in order to prosecute their counteroffensive in a way that U.S. officials are unsure whether it's actually sustainable. And so providing them with these cluster munitions could provide a way for Ukraine to keep up that offensive without having to potentially run short of really important ammunition here. Now, the U.S. has a lot of cluster ammunitions in the stockpiles because it actually started fazing them out in 2016 following an assessment by the U.S. that these could pose a risk to civilians. Essentially what happens with cluster munitions is they explode -- when the cluster munition explodes it scatters bomblets over a large area, and some of those bomblets sometimes don't actually explode. And so they could pose a long-term risk to civilians similar to landmines. And so the administration had not necessarily been considering strongly over the last several months giving these to Ukraine because they are so controversial, and because, importantly, many U.S. allies, including France, Germany, and the U.K., actually signed onto ban on these cluster munitions, that the Biden administration did not want to seem out of step with allies and so it was reluctant to provide Ukraine with these munitions despite Ukraine asking the administration for several months to provide them. Now we're told U.S. officials have had extensive conversations with allies about providing these munitions, and they do believe that they have managed to alleviate these allies' concerns in a way that will then allow the U.S. to move forward with providing these very controversial weapons. But this will really be welcome news to the Ukrainians who, again, have been asking the U.S. for these cluster munitions for quite some time, arguing that they will allow the Ukrainians to target Russian forces and equipment over a very large area, and essentially allow them to break through those fortified Russian defensive lines that they have had so much trouble breaching over the last several weeks of their counteroffensive.

I was on a spiritual pilgrimage at the time, and I was benefiting, doing some philanthropy for humanity, but I realized at that point when I calculated how many days I was going to be rowing in the blind that was about to join the likes of Jesus in the wilderness stories, or David and Goliath, because it was now 40 days on average that I was going to have to go 40 miles a day to reach the next point of land. And at that point I heard the words \"be brave.\" And of course, I'm brave. I'm in a rowboat. But when you think it is your higher being telling you to be brave, you better brace up for it, because it is going to be unlike anything you have been prepared for before, but probably nothing you can't handle, and that's exactly what happened.",

There were, from my understanding, another vessel that went missing that they still, unfortunately, haven't found. But I was making fish and harnessed to the deck, I was catching my breakfast, basically.And I looked to my right. I felt a presence that was just very different, and it was silent, and the sets of waves had coming at 13, and they increased by the time they got to 13. And this one had to be a 13th one. And the crest, the base of the wave was four meters. And I jumped in the hatch and braced for impact. And unfortunately, my ocean rowboat rolled. And they do self-right, but I was strapped to the hatch, the deck, and everything went up over and in two seconds, and by that point, it was all survival mode and quick thinking, and I swam out to the side of the boat and saw my roll up side down, bobbing up and down, and at that point when into a mode where, OK, raft, personal beacon, ditch bag, raft, beacon, ditch bag. And that's the things I had to worry about for the next minute.",

At that point, the waves were strong. I started to realize that I had a few options in this raft. It had water and it had a bailer, and the bailer was really important because now I had a leak in this raft at the time.And this journey was something that was making use of everything I had to my name at the time. So unfortunately, the secondhand raft worked, but it had a leak, and so I was bailing every five minutes for the remaining 30 hours that I was in the raft. WALKER: It sounds like you were counting the days when you were out there. Exactly how many days were you out adrift at sea? And how did you keep going? Did you have moments where you're like, OK, I surrender myself, I can't do this anymore?",

But you get into a routine, and for me, it was really just eat, pray, row. And it actually, it actually was going well, really well. I was on track, but I was missing, and I didn't know that at the time. And if it wasn't for the Facebook group that got together on social media, 3,000 people who were strangers, who came together and worked with the RCC, and just provided different feedback and expert advice, that plane and that ship really would have been in a different position at that time. And I believe that that was the end result is the humanity of strangers ended up actually saving me when it was my effort to save the world and show the humanity of other people.
