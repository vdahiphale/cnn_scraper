And I -- but I don't think that most Americans share them. So we'll just have to wait and see what happens. But certainly he's, you know, I grew up with him. So I've known all this for a long time.

Heather, thanks for being with us.Can you just start by talking a little bit about what it was about RFK Jr. and about the message that sort of swayed you to this position initially? HEATHER SIMPSON, FORMER VACCINE OPPONENT; INFLUENCED BY RFK, JR.: At the time, my ex-husband and I were trying for a baby, and, you know, we were bringing life into the world, and we have to be responsible for this life. So we were looking everywhere for answers on anything related to children and vaccines. And we stumbled upon a docuseries with RFK Jr. as one of the prominent figures in this docuseries. And I was like, wow, this series is full of doctors and lawyers and politicians. They must be telling the truth. And I listened to them, and I remember watching RFK Jr. and thinking, wow, he's not?e says he's only for safe vaccines, and that he's not anti-vax, so he must be middle ground, and he's still saying don't necessarily vaccinate. I really -- you know, I kind of trust this guy, and that just kind of snowballed into me becoming this anti-vax, quote-unquote, influencer after that and not vaccinating our child at the time.",

And I have always spoken out against RFK Jr. because he was so influential to me becoming anti-vaccine. And so the narrative, and just my friends, the narrative is horrifying. My friends are horrified about this potential situation with RFK Jr. I had someone call me yesterday and say, do you know he is going to go and watch vaccines? And I thought, I'm not sure that that is the case.So I started researching more of what he has said exactly. And I'm not as concerned. Now, hear me out. I don't agree with him at all. We have opposite views on vaccines. But he is for choice, he is for consent, and he is for holding pharmaceutical companies liable. And so I do believe in, you know, as someone on the left, I believe in choice and consent. And so I do think when we look at the facts, because that is what changed my mind with vaccines, when we look at the facts with RFK Jr., I don't believe that it's as catastrophic as we think. I do believe that he does hold views that are very different than my friends, myself, doctors. But I do not believe that he is as dangerous in his policy and the actual facts of what he's doing.",

But when it comes down to a position that initially, you know, won you over, or, you know, for instance, there's a story out today where he's talking about, you know, certain medications being so unsafe that certain countries don't even prescribe them when actually they do.So he's just stating something that isn't true.
