This morning, attention in the Middle East is focused on worseninghumanitarian crises in Gaza, as Israel faces growing pressure to take civilians more into consideration as it prosecutes its war against the terrorist group Hamas following its barbaric October 7 attacks on Israeli civilians. At Gaza's Al Shifa Hospital, doctors tell CNN the outlook for patients there becomes more desperate by the hour, low on food, water and fuel and largely without power, amid heavy fighting in the area. This morning, Israel said it opened a self-evacuation corridor from the medical center for people to move south. The civilian crisis has prompted a shift in approach by the Biden administration, which says too many Palestinians have died in the conflict, while Israel, yesterday, what we saw there were families of hostages taken by Hamas demanding that they be more prioritized, the rescue comes soon. Joining me now is Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Sir, thank you so much for joining me. Let's start with what's happening at that hospital. Israeli forces have said that they are engaged in intense fighting around Al Shifa Hospital, the largest medical facility in Gaza. I know that you say that the hospital sits on top of a Hamas command-and-control center, but, of course, there are also patients, civilians sheltering in that complex, getting treatment. So, how do you intend to go after Hamas without putting sick and injured civilians in that hospital at more risk than they already are?",

The French president has sent a floating hospital ship. I have asked the Emirates to send a field hospital. They have. And other countries have done the same. I expect the U.N. to build it soon. There's no reason why we just can't take the patients out of there, instead of letting Hamas use it as a command center for terrorism, for the rockets that they fire against Israel, for the terror tunnels that they use to kill Israeli civilians. Remember, Dana, let's keep this in focus. Just imagine what would happen if the United States were attacked viciously by 20 9/11s, 20 -- that's the proportionate number -- 50,000 Americans killed, 10,000 Americans held hostages, including babies, elderly, women, children, 10,000 rockets falling on your cities. That's the number of rockets that are falling all the time on our cities, may fall during this interview, in fact, and we will have to go to a shelter. That's what's happening. So what would America do? It would take all its force and go after these killers. And what if these killers embed themselves in hospitals, in schools, in U.N. facilities? You do everything in your power to get the civilians out, which is what we're doing.",

At the White House, President Biden expressed frustration over Israel's resistance to implementing humanitarian pauses inside Gaza. And, overseas, the U.S. secretary of state, Tony Blinken, said -- quote -- \"Far too many Palestinians have been killed\" and more needed to be done to keep civilians safe. Here with me now is President Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan. Thank you so much for being here this morning. I just want to be clear. Does Israel need to do more to limit civilian casualties? JAKE SULLIVAN, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER:  Well, first, Dana, every loss of innocent life, Palestinian, Israeli, anyone, is a tragedy, every single one. And we grieve for those who have been lost, those innocent lives who have been lost. At the same time, what Israel is facing is a terrorist enemy who hides among civilians, who uses civilians as human shields. And so it has an added burden of trying to prosecute this campaign against that terrorist group while distinguishing between terrorists and innocent civilians. That doesn't lessen its responsibility to operate according to the rules of war, and we have continued to make that point both publicly and privately, and we will continue to do so as we go forward.",

A Hamas spokesman on the front page of \"The New York Times\" said the entire objective of the group is permanent state of war with Israel. And so that is what Israel is up against. At the same time, as I have said and as President Biden and Secretary Blinken have said, we are democracies. And, as democracies, we have to be different and we have to abide by the rules of war. We have to do our utmost to protect innocent civilians. And that means being targeted and careful in military operations to try to reduce and to try to avoid any loss of civilian life.",
