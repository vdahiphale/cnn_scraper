Now this was back in September, before the Hamas terrorist attacks on October 7th that sparked the ongoing war with Israel.CNN's Brynn Gingras joins us now live with more details. So, Brynn, how did law enforcement find out about this alleged plot?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Pam and Boris, we've just learned that this detailed plan was posted online on the social media site Discord, and its actually people, analysts inside Discord who were tracking this sort of thing and then alerted the FBI. And from their local authorities were also alerted. And of course, that triggered a bunch of alerts to the local synagogue where the threats were being talked about and also this teenager's school.And so, the law enforcement basically said it caused a significant public alarm and then the teenager was arrested. Now it's very unclear exactly from the court documents because this person is a juvenile. There isn't much detail about what exactly this plan entailed. And also, really not much detail of what happened when the arrest took place. Were there any weapons? Was there -- how serious was this plan? Those are all questions that are still outstanding. However, that teenager has been charged with two misdemeanors, inducing panic and disorderly conduct. As you guys mentioned, this happened back in September before the October 7th attack in Israel. But of course, we know that the anti-Semitic incidents have been occurring and have been going on and certainly heightened prior to the war and then really a surge after it. Both anti-Semitic incidents and incidents against Muslims and Arabs as well. But for this particular incident, the ADL did release a statement saying that they were horrified by what they learned and also, for young people like this suspect, we hope this can be a teachable moment. Hate and threats on social media, as in real life, cannot and will not be tolerated. Now this teen is expected back in juvenile court next week and my understanding is the judge will then decide what sort of punishment they'll face, guys.",

That's the message today from Vladimir Putin. Speaking for several hours this morning in his first conference since invading Ukraine. The Russian President claimed his country is making gains in the war and that if Ukraine does not stand down and accept Russia's terms, Moscow will have to, quote, solve the problem by force. Joining us now with more is Steve Hall, former CIA chief of Russia operation. So, Steve Putin said solve the problem by force. What do you make of that? It just more tough talk from a strong man or more of a real threat for Ukraine. I mean, they're already using a lot of force.",

Much to the detriment I might add, of the Russian military, which has lost significant, not only personnel, but military armaments on the ground.I mean, and this is like in the bad old days, we used to watch these, you know, the Russian leaders, the Soviet leaders on top of Lenin's tomb and try to figure out what they meant by where they stood. This is a little bit like, it's the modern-day version of Putin trying to get the word out through himself and through his propagandists. And, you know, he's saying, yes, things are going pretty well in Ukraine. Not really true for Russia. One thing that is interesting is to watch his propagandists talk about what's going on in the United States and the perceived softness and the continued support for Ukraine, both in the United States and possibly in Europe. So those are the themes that Putin through himself in presentations like this, as well as through his propagandists on their news channels that are trying to get through to Russians.",

I think what is actually more reflective of is how difficult it is for the Kremlin these days, to try to filter out and keep the message on point. I mean in the bad old days, again, you know he would -- Putin would just pick up a phone and, you know, cancel the newspaper, or take a television station.But when you've got -- when you've got these Telegram channels and other stuff on the internet, it is much more difficult for the FSB, the Internal Security Service, to try to monitor and to try to track all those people down. It's really, really much more difficult. So, it's a -- it's a delicate balancing act to be trying to answer the questions he wants to answer. But also opening up the floor a little bit to stuff that he'd rather not deal with.",

You see him hugging his sister and niece as he begins a new chapter of his life.Back in 1988, Beals was a college athlete studying to become a police officer, and on one unlucky day, according to the Illinois Innocence Project, a local drug supplier in Chicago threatened him. And as Beales fled bullets that were meant for him struck a six-year-old boy and his mother, ultimately killing the child. In a twist of fate, Beals was convicted for that murder primarily on the mother's testimony, even though she was never shown any lineups or photographs. 35 years later, newly surfaced evidence and testimony finally cleared his name, and his conviction was vacated. Brian Beals joins us now live. Brian, thank you so much for being with us. First and foremost, I just wonder how you are doing. BRIAN BEALS, EXONERATED AND RELEASED AFTER 35 YEARS IN PRISON: I'm doing great. You know, last night I had dinner with three generations of my family.
