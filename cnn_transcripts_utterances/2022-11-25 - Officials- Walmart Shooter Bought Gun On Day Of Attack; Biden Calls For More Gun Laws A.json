Congressman Dent probably knows that better than anybody on this panel.But the fact is, when you have a mobilizing tool, take for example souls of the polls. You have seen Republican state legislatures particularly throughout the south eliminate that last day where individuals went to church and then went to the polls immediately after church, hence the name souls to the polls. Democrats have always been trying to open up the ballot box to make it free and fair and safe and ensure that everyone has access to it. I mean, I hear my friend Charlie on the other side but you had a Republican concerted effort in Georgia to eliminate Saturday voting, or the last Saturday voting in favor of keeping it close because of Robert E. Lee's holiday. And so when you have that juxtaposition, you really have to question how you are going to get voters mobilized when he tried to stamp out any effort to vote early, vote safely, and vote freely.",

Now, it doesn't change the fundamental vantage in the Senate, you still need 60 votes on most pieces of legislation.So you will still need bipartisan compromises. But this gives them the slightest bit of breathing room. If I were the Democrats right now, I would probably be feeling pretty good about Georgia given that camp is now on the ballot to pull Walker along. Walker doesn't antigen in his own.

So I would say that the U.S. team, if you look at the, highlights actually have the better of the first half or at least they had the better chances. Weston McKinney is well-known as a big Harry Potter fan. He had a chance. Nothing too magic about the way he handled it. But Christian Pulaski, the big U.S. star, he was the man of the match today. He hit the crossbar. He had the best chance. England though had their chances as well. Mason Mount drawing a good save from Matt Turner and then right towards the end, the England striker Harry Kane headed just wide off a free kick. So that is not finished, coolers, both teams had one more game to play. England, all they have to do is not lose too heavily to Wales in their final game.

And then, hey, guess, what they played really well. And as you see, some fans are filing out right now.

They had 5,600 study participants. They gave them water to drink. The water had isotopes in it so they could sort of follow it through and see how much of the water got used by the body and how much was excreted. They found a huge range. People -- how much water the body used, it ranged from four cups a day to 25 cups a day. The amount depended first of all on physical activity, more physical activity needed more water. It also depended on gender. Men seemed to be more water than women do, weight, and also climate. It depended on weight and climate. If you live in a hot and humid place, a really big range of what people need to the point where the CDC does not even give advice on how much water to drink every day. Now, let's look at this really interesting chart that the Cleveland Clinic has. They have a chart that says if your urine is pale in color, you are good. If it is amber or honey, you are mildly dehydrated more brown means that you are really dehydrated. A lot of experts say to look at your urine and that is what is most important -- Kasie.",
