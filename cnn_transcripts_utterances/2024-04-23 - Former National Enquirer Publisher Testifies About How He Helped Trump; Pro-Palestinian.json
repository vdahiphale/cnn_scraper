Pecker has admitted to caching and killing stories that might have been damaging to candidate Donald Trump in 2016. He testified he worked with Trump and Trump's former attorney and fixer, Michael Cohen to run negative stories on Trump's political rivals as well. Earlier, the judge heard arguments about whether Trump has violated a gag order in this case on multiple occasions, the gag orders so that he doesn't attack witnesses or jurors. The hearing was contentious with Judge Juan Merchan at one point saying the Trump attorney, Todd Blanche, you're losing all credibility with the court. It is not clear when the judge will decide will rule on the  matter, CNN's senior crime and justice reporter, Katelyn Polantz is with us now. And Katelyn, I believe today's events wrapping up momentarily if they haven't wrapped up already. KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME &amp; JUSTICE REPORTER: Yes, they're wrapping up right now. The jury is hearing from the judge, they're probably being told as we speak, don't talk about this case outside of court, don't look at any news reports about it. We're going to be back on Thursday morning to resume testimony. But the testimony of David Pecker wrapped for the day, and there are a couple of things that prosecutors really drove home today. That David Pecker's motivations, the actions he was taking, and his communication with Michael Cohen, specifically Trump's personal attorney in 2016 was all about benefiting the campaign. The second thing is they got testimony that would be evidenced -- witness - - evidence from a witness, spoken evidence of David Pecker recalling what he was doing to take stories off the market, two stories that could have damaged Trump because they were negative stories about his alleged relationships with women, which he has denied. But they were stories that David Pecker and the \"National Enquirer\" were purchasing to take off the market. That's the language he was using about them. And then finally, to connect this all back to Donald Trump's campaign, that is the point that we're going to hear over and over and over in this trial through the witnesses, and the prosecutors got this quote out of David Pecker on the witness stand. I made the decision to purchase the story because of the potential embarrassment it would have to the campaign and Mr. Trump, his long-time friend. Jim?",

Former \"National Enquirer\" publisher David Pecker. Returned to the witness stand. Pecker said he agreed to use his tabloid to boost Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, squash scandalous stories about him, publish critical stories of his opponents. This comes after a heated hearing this morning to determine whether Trump should be held in contempt of court for allegedly repeatedly violating a gag order. The judge scolded Trump's attorney, told him, \"You're losing all credibility.\" He did not, however, immediately rule on that motion. Joining us now is Republican strategist Rina Shah. Rina, good to have you on this afternoon.",

These are former opponents of Trump's who again, who now support him.

It's been said many times over, just to see an ex-president, an American president sitting in a court, facing criminal charges with this trial underway does feel as if it demands everybody's attention. But those voters who are more moderate Republicans have felt not like those who are on the fringes. That this is a weaponization of the justice system. That this is an unfair targeting of Trump. They want to see how it plays out. And when we talk about how this plays out, I think we have to talk about the outcome, which will get, of course, weeks from now is what we are expecting. But we should think about the long game because that's what Trump does.

So, on the one hand to the everyday observer, Trump is yelling election interference. Saying that this case and the other indictments against him, the three other cases in other jurisdictions are all election interference. And yet at the core of this case in New York is election interference, the allegations that he played unfairly in 2016. The important part, I think, to divorce from all of this is again, the ability that he could have and is missing to walk and chew gum at the same time. To really lay forth a more positive vision for this Republican party. I see this past week. It seemed his influence is dwindling in those areas in which he could have a positive imprint. He didn't get through to Speaker Johnson, who put foreign aid on the floor and passed it in the House chamber against Trump and MAGA wishes. So, he could go into other areas that other Americans deem very important and necessary issues, economy, crime, public safety, immigration. Yet he takes the bait and goes for the lowest line fruit, which is to, again, appeal to the emotions of voters while crying victim.",

Pecker was back on the stand earlier today, in fact, just left a few minutes ago. And explained how the tabloid carried out these catch and kill operations. Hadas Gold joins me now from New York. And catch and kill is really central to the prosecutor's case here. And what they're attempting to do is to show that it was a pattern beyond the Stormy Daniels case, which is of course the core of these criminal charges but to say that they did this multiple times with other stories that would have hurt him.

In fact, over the past, I would say, day and a half ago, it appears as though there's a Ukrainian front line in the east of the country that has, to a certain extent, collapsed. And the Russians made some significant gains there. Not strategic gains, but yet there was a front line. They were able to break through. And one of the things that we have been hearing from the Ukrainians is that in many cases, they're sitting there with their artillery guns and are unable to fire back as some of these Russian advances take place. So, the Ukrainians believe that that in itself could make a big difference. The other big thing, of course, is air defense to try and keep the cities in the infrastructure safer than it has before. And as far as the other question is concerned, the Ukrainians believe, and it seems to us also, as though the U.S. has prepositioned some of the arms that they're set to deliver to the Ukrainians, at the very least in the eastern part of Europe. So, they could actually come here to Ukraine very quickly and then hit the battlefield very quickly as well, especially if you're talking about ammunition, for instance, which is, of course, is the biggest need of the Ukrainians. They believe that that is something that they could get their hands on quickly and then also, of course, disseminate quickly onto the battlefield. Paula.",

You have them winning in some villages. In fact, the, foreign -- the defense minister of Russia came out today and said that on all areas of the front lines, the Russians are the ones who have the initiative. So, holding that up is really the first order of business for the Ukrainians. They do believe as some more of that aid gets released by the U.S. and of course also by some of the European and other allies around the world as well, that they might be able to mount a counteroffensive. However, we've also already heard from the head of the military intelligence service that they believe that especially in the months of May and June are going to be key and very difficult because they believe that the Russians are going to try and mount another push then. However, they do say with the aid that will be coming in from those around $60 billion, that they will, at some point, they hope be able to also mount a counterattack as well.",
