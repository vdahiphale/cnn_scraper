He understands that Israel is now waiting for a response from Hamas, which could take a few days.

The head of the agency calling the move outrageous, saying it is stopping, quote, \"lifesaving assistance\" during a man-made famine. CNN has reached down to the Israeli military for comment. Meanwhile, the Gaza Health Ministry says more than 80 people have been killed in the past 24 hours in Israeli operations, which now puts the death toll in Gaza since October 7 at more than 32,000. The ministry doesn't distinguish between fighters and civilians in its data but has said the majority of deaths are women and children. CNN cannot independently verify the figures. And as the death toll climbs, some experts are also accusing Israel of causing widespread long-term damage to Gaza's environment, also known as ecocide. Open Global Rights, an independent organization, says Israel has systematically transformed Gaza's agricultural land to dust and caused the collapse of wastewater systems.

      "sentences": "Black pants, black socks, well-polished shoes and a tie or bow tie with a jacket. That's traditional and Parisian. HOLMES (voice-over)The rules are simple: no running. That would just be gauche. And no spilling anything on the tray, which must be held in one hand. LOUANE MOREL, WAITRESS (through translator): I've been doing this job since I was 16. I don't necessarily expect to be the first, because I don't necessarily have the best cardio. But I hope to at least arrive with a tray in good condition at the finish line. HOLMES (voice-over): The race began in 1914, with servers balancing a bottle on a tray in the earlier days. But 13 years ago, organizers couldn't find any sponsors, so the race was put on the back burner. Until the Paris city hall and water authority fired up the event again this year. ANNE-SOPHIE BLANCHET, SPECTATOR (through translator): I find it wonderful that we're reviving this race, which highlights a very beautiful profession and which above all, is very difficult, I think, on a daily basis. So congratulations to them. And may the best win. HOLMES (voice-over): So while this might not look like a typical day at the cafe, the men's and women's winners -- who completed the circuit in 13 minutes, 30 seconds; and 14 minutes, 12 seconds respectively -- say it's an expedited version of what they do every day. With a healthy serving of stamina getting them across the finish line. Bon Appetit. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
