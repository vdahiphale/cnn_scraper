It's 25 percent. That 25 percent looks an awful bit like - like that 28 percent up there. It doesn't look anything, anything like this. Forty-two percent doesn't look anything like this 28 percent.So, the bottom line is, very few Americans think the country is on the right track at this particular point. It tracks much more with when the incumbent party loses than with it wins. In fact, I went back through history. There isn't a single time in which 28 percent of the American public thinks the country is going on the right track in which the incumbent party actually won. They always lose when just 28 percent of the country believes that the country is on the right track, John.",

We spoke about it before a few months ago, big Republican Party registration gains versus where - where - from where they were four years ago.

I grew up in a country that was recently trying to recover cover from a colonizing system where people - black people could not vote. I grew up right next door to South Africa, where Nelson Mandela was still imprisoned. So, my growing up years were very defined by that and by wanting to see South Africa free and see apartheid ended.And so - and I grew up with a parent who had met Martin Luther King and he'd signed a picture that was sitting in my living room my entire life. So, that understanding of, it comes at a cost, a democracy, a thriving democracy, and be able to participate in it. I returned to the United States as a young adult very much with that inside of me, an understanding that looking at America my whole life from Zimbabwe, I really - we all admired aspects of how this country handled its democracy, how smoothly power was transitioned, time over time, and how everyone had a voice.

We're talking about tens of millions of people every year who develop these foodborne illnesses, hundreds of thousands who may be hospitalized. The basics really do apply. And as you look at this - this list of things that you should always think about every time you're cooking at home, keep in mind that just a small amount of these bacteria can actually lead to illness. And the longer that food is left out, that bacteria can multiply rapidly.So, just sort of keep that in mind. I mean we're seeing more foodborne illnesses. Investing in a thermometer for your meet, making sure you're washing your hands and surfaces completely. And again, even a few hours of this food outside can cause that bacteria to really multiply. There's something else I think is important, is that what we're learning, when you look at this data, Kate, is that most of the foodborne illnesses are actually occurring outside the home. So you're talking about restaurants and banquets and delis and things like that. There is a thing that food experts will refer to as the danger zone. That is sort of the temperature of food that is going to be the most dangerous. And you could take a look there. So, you want your cold foods cool, 40 degrees or less. And you want your hot (INAUDIBLE) and your hot food, it should be actually steaming hot.

Today his program provides free pet care and peace of mind to help dog owners succeed with their sobriety. Idaho native Payton McGriff is helping girls in the African country of Togo stay in school. Her non-profit provides tuition, tutoring, and an innovative uniform made by local women that's designed to grow with the students. From Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, immigration attorney Rachel Rutter is helping unaccompanied migrant children heal from trauma, start new lives in the U.S. Her non-profit provides free legal support and helps fill in gaps in housing, food, and education.
