Happening this hour from aCrypto King Sam Bankman-Fried is set to find out how much time he will spend in prison for one of the largest white collar crimes in history. Authorities are moving from a recovery to a salvage operation after Tuesday's Baltimore bridge disaster. And the Georgia election subversion case involving Donald Trump resumes next hour in Atlanta and Fani Willis will be back in court for the first time since the judge ruled she can continue to prosecute the case. Plus, you will hear from Britain's King Charles who just released a heartfelt Easter message. It's his first since his daughter in law, Princess Katherine began chemotherapy. And welcome to the show. Let's check in to see how the New York market is set to open. It's around 30 minutes from now. We're looking at a positive start all the way through. Now the DOW futures are pointing to a positive side why we're keeping a very close watch on that the big question is will the DOW Jones hit that key milestone of 40,000? Keeping in mind it is a shortened trading day today and of course, markets will be closed for Good Friday tomorrow but investors are going to be looking out for that we'll be very closely watching liquidity levels as well that's going to be very telling in terms of where the numbers are set to go. But look, later this hour former crypto King Sam Backman-Fried is set to find out how much time he will spend in prison. The FTX Founder faces sentencing in Manhattan Federal Court. He was convicted in November on fraud and conspiracy charges for his role in the collapse of the company he founded. If the prosecution gets its way he could spend potentially most of the rest of his life in prison. CNN's Kara Scannell is in New York and joins us now live to give us a sense of what we're expecting today. Look, Sam Bankman-Fried will be learning his fate. He's at the center of this historic crypto fraud. They are asking the team is asking for just six years in prison versus what the federal prosecutors are looking for up to 50 years in prison. Give me a sense of what we're expecting today.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, that's a big gap between the number of years that Sam Bankman-Fried could potentially face in prison. He's 32-years-old. But as you said, he was the face of the crypto industry and the collapse of FTX really sent shockwaves through it, as well as the prosecution of him that followed. Prosecutors are asking for 40 to 50 years in prison because they say he committed one of the largest financial frauds in U.S. history, and the biggest since Bernie Madoff who went to prison for a Ponzi scheme. At the trial last year, they prove that Sam Bankman-Fried had stolen more than $10 billion from customers and investors in FTX as well as lenders to elevate a research that sister hedge fund. They also say he spent $150 million in bribes to Chinese officials and put more than $100 million of illegal campaign donations into the U.S. political system. You know, they really want to send a message with the sentencing not just to other crypto players or financial people, but also to Sam Bankman-Fried himself. Because they say that they are concerned that when he comes out, he could continue to try to commit fraud again. Now Sam Bankman-Fried's lawyers are saying he's not Bernie Madoff, he's not Elizabeth Holmes, the Founder of Theranos. They've seen that he should get only as much as six and a half years in prison. Part of their argument is that some of the victims will be made whole through the bankruptcy recovery efforts. So saying that their loss is not quite as large as the government is saying. I mean, the big thing today is that the judge -- you know will hear these arguments from both sides in court. It's possible there will be at least one victim who will address the judge and tell him what the impact of this fraud has been on his or her life. And then the big question will be does Sam Bankman-Fried himself speak to the judge? You know, he was convicted last year. He is expected to appeal. But will he show any signs of contrition? Or what will he say to the judge? And how does the judge receive that? You know, obviously a lot at stake. Sam Bankman-Fried has been in federal custody since August when the judge revoked his bail after he found that he was involved in some witness tampering. So he has not walked the streets freely for months. The big question here is how many years will it be before he does again Eleni?",

So two families may have found us a bit of closure now that two bodies have been recovered they have been identified as Dorlian Castillo Cabrera, a 26 year old from Guatemala, one of two Guatemalans who died in this incident and also Alejandro Hernandez Fuentes, 35-year-old Mexican national, also one of two Mexican nationals who died. We don't have a lot of information about him because Mexican authorities have told us that these families have asked for privacy and they are trying to respect those wishes. But Dorlian Castillo Cabrera, you know, we spoke to some of his family members. He didn't have any children.

And he will be sentenced just a short time from now. In fact, that sentencing hearing getting underway in Manhattan federal courtroom at this hour, prosecutors have been pushing for as much as 50 years in prison for Sam Bankman-Fried. His attorneys, however, call that quote, medieval a death in prison sentencing recommendation. They're hoping for something far shorter in the range of six or six and a half years. Former State and Federal Prosecutor David Weinstein joining us now with more on this story so as this hearing gets underway, there'll be a number of things that will be taken into account walk us through what will not only be hearing in court today, but what will be considered in deciding this sentence? DAVID WEINSTEIN, FORMER STATE &amp; FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: Well, the judge is going to be looking at the advisory sentencing guidelines, which is where these enormous numbers are coming from the government's asking for so the first thing he'll have to do is you'll have to decide, is that calculation appropriate. But you know, quite frankly, the guideline range is upwards of 100 plus years based on the conduct based on the amount of money that was defrauded, and after a verdict in his trial. And so he has to sort through those numbers first. So they'll spend a good deal of the portion of the beginning of the hearing doing that and coming up with what these advisory guidelines are that set sort of the guardrails for what a reasonable sentence will be. From there, the defense is going to focus on who Sam was? His upbringing, his background, his education, what he done his charitable work, what he had hoped that this platform would turn out to be? And despite a jury finding him guilty, what he believed was happening here. And they'll talk about, as you mentioned, the draconian function of these guidelines, and the fact that they're looking for a sentence in excess of 30 to 50 years, at least the government is, and so they'll try to get the judge to focus on his character and who he is and what took place here. On the other side, the government's going to point out that a jury heard the facts, they found him guilty. And in fact, they heard from Bankman- Fried himself. He testified. The jury didn't give much belief in their opinion, to what he had to say. And they'll bring out the stories of the victims, in this case. People who lost their life savings who believed in him who invested in him and who lost a great deal of money they'll also compare his conduct to the actions of others who have been sentenced to far more time in jail than what the defense is seeking here. People like Bernie Madoff, you'll he'll hear his name. You'll hear about other people who took far more money and more sense to at least the amount of time that the government is looking for. And then last but not least, you're going to hear from the defense about the efforts of the bankruptcy trustee and the people who were trying to recover the funds and what was there and how that the victims will be compensated for their loss. The government's counter to that argument is that this case is not about what's recovered after the fact long after Sam Bankman-Fried committed his actions, but rather what was taken from these victims at the time that this all occurred. And that's what's going to be going on. And then the judge will have to decide what an appropriate sentence will be.",
