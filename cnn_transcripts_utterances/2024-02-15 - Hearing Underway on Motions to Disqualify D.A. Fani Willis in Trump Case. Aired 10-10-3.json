The person who is on the witness stand right now is the former law partner of Nathan Wade, who also was his counsel in his divorce proceeding. The attorney who is trying to get Fani Willis disqualified is trying to establish any communications outside of an attorney-client relationship.Why you're hearing a back and forth right now is all about when it started and whether communications, in general, are going to be covered or they're very limited in scope. Now, remember, the privilege means for communications that you have in furtherance of legal advice. It's not everything that is covered. If I were to have an observation as an attorney, if I were to say, what color shirt was that person wearing, what are they a fan of in terms of music, because you're the person's attorney does not mean that it's all communication that's now covered. The attorney you're hearing right now is trying to establish that all the conversations that she's asking about are outside of the scope of an attorney-client relationship. There's a lot of pushback, including from the bar, the Bar Association, who often gives advice to attorneys about what they can say and what they cannot. They're hearing a lot about a thing called Rule 1.6. That's about confidential communications. Bradley is saying that he had advice from the bar that said he is not allowed to give out any information and has a very wide scope he's talking about. Now, it strains credulity to suggest that everything you have ever said to somebody before and after an attorney-client relationship has been established would be covered. But that's the argument in the court today and the judge is trying to get the parameters in place right now. Now, remember, this testimony is so crucial. This witness is supposed to be the one to tell you about the existence of a relationship, the beginning of a relationship, when it started and whether the affidavits and filings that were made to the court were truthful or not. If he is not able to give information in, if that attorney cannot through this witness get it in, let's find another person to get it in or they cannot make their case. It's a very important moment.
