But with just four days until the South Carolina primary, time is running out. So, joining us now is Asa Hutchinson. He was the Republican governor of Arkansas and also ended his presidential run just last month. He has endorsed Haley. So, Governor, you, at one point, had to walk away from a race. We heard that -- governor -- former Governor Haley saying she won't walk away from this one. So, how should she spend time on the speech she's planning to give today? ASA HUTCHINSON (R), FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR AND FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, I think it is important that she convey that she's in this to the finish. That she's going to go on to Super Tuesday. She ought to be outlining her schedule, which is public, but going to Michigan, going to Texas, that tells the story that South Carolina is the first step to a long march in this campaign. People want to know that she's going to stick with it. And I encourage her in that way. I think it's very important for her voice to stay there through this primary campaign. This is unpredictable what's going to happen. And even though she might not win in her home state of South Carolina, I think people understand the dynamics. She needs to show strength there. She needs to beat expectations and move on to Super Tuesday. And she needs to showcase her staying power in the race. And she has the right message. Whatever you look at Donald Trump converting the Republican Party into the Trump party, you're seeing what a presidency under Donald Trump would be like.",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIKKI HALEY (R), 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, first of all, I think you have to look at the fact that you can't look at Joe Biden and think that he is in good -- in a good mental, stable state to be able to lead this country. We can look at him from two years ago. He's very different than he was two years ago. He's mentally diminished. I think Trump is mentally diminished. You can talk and give me scenarios all day long.

And, of course, anybody who's seeking to be the nominee of the party has to look forward and say, we've got to come together to beat Joe Biden in the fall.And so she's trying to set the stage for that. She's being as tough as nails in regard to Donald Trump, and she's keeping her options open for the future. I think that's important. And that's the balance that she's got to maintain right now.

Nearly a third of Republicans believe this cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs conspiracy theory that somehow there's a covert government effort that -- for Taylor Swift to help Biden win. My goodness, gracious. Although I will point out that the majority of Republicans say, no, there is not. Now, I want to put this into some context in terms of other conspiracy theories. All right, so, conspiracy theory belief, 18 percent of the public believes the Swift -- the covert Swift operation. My goodness, gracious. Faking the moon landing. The moon landing was faked by NASA, at 12 percent. The earth is flat at 10 percent. I sort of call these the Mendoza line of conspiracy theories. If you're getting above that, then maybe, you know, there are a few more people than probably should believe a conspiracy theory. So, slightly more on the covert Swift conspiracy theory, but not much. And the truth is, all these three belong together because these are Nutter Butter types of stuff.",

ENTEN: Yes, you know, I think there's this real question about whether, if you tie yourself to Taylor Swift will it somehow be bad for you? And, you know, there was no person or organization that tied themselves more to Taylor Swift than the NFL. So, I want you to take a look at these Super Bowl ratings. And this is the growth from 2023 to 2024. Look at this. Females 18 to 24, a core Swift demographic, the ratings were up 24 percent. Females 12 to 17, up 11 percent. That is all more than the overall viewers at 6 percent. So, it seemed very clear to me that the NFL knew what it was doing by tying themselves to Taylor Swift. And more than that, is there any potential for a backlash? That's what John was asking me just before we went on the air. So, I want you to take a look here. Football fans on Taylor Swift, mostly positive for the NFL, 71 percent of those hardcore NFL fans, such as myself, said that Taylor Swift had a mostly positive impact on the NFL. Just 25 percent said mostly negative. So the fact is, if you tie yourself to Taylor Swift, there really isn't much of a downside except perhaps that you bring in some of these Nutter Butter folks who believe in these cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs conspiracy theories.",
