And fresh out of prison, Steve Bannon says he's got some advice for Donald Trump. That's all tonight on \"Laura Coates Live.\"All right, buckle up, buttercups. The final sprint begins right now, seven days to go until the election. And tonight, Kamala Harris delivering a speech billed as her closing argument, and she did it at the same place where Donald Trump rallied his supporters on -- you guessed it -- January 6th, moments before they stormed the Capitol. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS (D), VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: America, this is not a candidate for president who is thinking about how to make your life better. This is someone who is unstable, obsessed with revenge, consumed with grievance, and out for unchecked power. Donald Trump has spent a decade trying to keep the American people divided and afraid of each other. That is who he is. But America, I am here tonight to say that is not who we are. (APPLAUSE) That is not who we are. It is time to turn the page on the drama and the conflict, the fear and division. It is time for a new generation of leadership in America.

Now, in my phone, I've got a lot of those disaffected Republicans that are looking for a home, trying to figure out where they're to live.

Congressman, good to see you in these last seven days before an extremely important day. I want to get right into what everyone is talking about tonight in our last block. Also, the comparison point that some have made is that, look, Trump has said plenty of hateful things about Americans before. Biden said that he's talking about the comedian, not supporters. What's your response? REP. BYRON DONALDS (R-FL): My response is that the first statement from Joe Biden is the one that he truly believes. He does not think that people who disagree with him or his party, who support President Trump, are -- you know, are Americans. He thinks that they're garbage. That's a fact. And what I go back to is four years ago, around this same time, it was Joe Biden that went on the Breakfast Club, and he famously said that if you couldn't vote for him, then you weren't Black. It's the same Joe Biden. He made the same type of statement four years ago. So, this is consistent with who he is. Look, I think right now, what we have is a contrast in presidential campaigns. Donald Trump has been on the campaign trail talking about fixing our country, ending a lot of the travesties from the Biden- Harris administration, making America great again. Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Tim Walz for that matter, they're running around talking about the rally in MSG was a Nazi rally. Well, Laura, I spoke at that rally, so did Harry-O, the founder of Death Row Records, so did Vivek Ramaswamy, so did Tulsi Gabbard. I don't think the Nazis will let us speak at their rally.

Are you going to attribute the comments to Trump to -- because a comedian said it, now Trump has said it, in their minds? We attribute what Biden has said to Harris.

There are still others who have suggested that he did.But moving on to women in particular, you said you were at the rally and you actually spoke at the rally at Madison Square Garden. Out of the 30 or so speakers, only six were women. I mean, Trump's former rival, Nikki Haley, actually criticized those very optics, congressman. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIKKI HALEY, FORMER SOUTH CAROLINA GOVERNOR, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This is not a time to have anyone criticize Puerto Rico or Latinos. This is not a time for them to get overly masculine with this bromance thing that they've got going. You've got affiliated PACs that are doing commercials about calling Kamala the C-word, or you had speakers at Madison Square Garden, you know, referring to her and her pimps. That is not the way to win women. That is not the way to win people who are concerned about Trump's style. (END VIDEO CLIP) COATES: There is reporting that the campaign was aware of at least the C-word reference and edited that out, and then the rest of the statements not talked about.

Okay, that's fine, but Donald Trump is focused on all of the American people, whether you are female or male, whether you are Black or white, because fixing our economy helps all Americans, securing our borders helps all Americans, I will add, especially women, because we could talk about the travesty to Laken Riley, to Jocelyn Nungaray and their families who are grieving. Those tragedies fall at the feet of Kamala Harris. She could have done something and stood up for those women. She did not. What about the young girls who are not Americans, but who are falling prey to the drug cartels, being sold into sex slavery, who are raped on the journey to our southern border? That affects women as well. So, securing the southern border is something that helps all people in our country and, frankly, around the world. And, of course, making sure that we have a sound government and a sound foreign policy getting us out of conflicts that supports everybody. That is why Donald Trump is going to fix the mess of Kamala Harris and Joe Biden.

I think that's sort of a false narrative about the vice president. Ever since I've met her, that's all she has ever talked about. I mean, that's how she has represented herself. And again, brought those busts of those Black leaders into the White House to diversify the artifacts in the White House, to make sure that there was representation within the White House.But nevertheless, I think the reason why she's going to close out there is because, again, I think it drives the point that this is who we are as a nation, that we invest in each other, that we create opportunities and environments in which we can all thrive. That's what Howard represents, that's what it was for her, and I think that's who she's going be as our next president.",
