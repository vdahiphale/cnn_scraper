She didn't just beat him. She humiliated him. She humiliated him. He has been the Pac Man of American politics. He has eaten up, gobbled up politicians, spit them out, went through 16 Republican governors and senators like it was nothing. And even when he does badly, he usually has something he can point to. She whooped him so badly that I think he's literally afraid to come back. And so now, I agree the last 20 minutes, she could have stopped with the elder abuse at that point and then turn more to her program, I wish that she had, but she's got plenty of time now. And now the funk is off. I think she's going to do a bunch of interviews. I wanted to do interviews. I agree with you. She needs to get her program defined.

Because what seems to be clear on all sides, and this is nobody thinks the details matter, right? Trump certainly doesn't think the details matter. Details ain't really his bag. That's not what he's going for. There's been plenty of opportunity for her to spell things out with far more detail. And I think they've drawn the conclusion ultimately for who, for what? Let him crash out. Like they put them on T.V., I'm just like, watch this. I can make this old man lose his mind. And she did it in this. So, what does it matter what the details are? I think to your point, it matters to a degree, there are people that have things that they want to hear.

JONES:  I'd love for her to talk more about fracking for a couple reasons, and I'm glad we have time to talk about this stuff. Kamala Harris needs fracking. She needs fracking. The idea that she's got -- they spent four years, they did nothing to stop fracking, the idea she would stop it now is literally ludicrous. Why does she need it? Fracking is giving us a geopolitical weapon against Putin. The reason that we've been able to hold the European coalition together is because when Putin said, if you back Ukraine, I'm going to cut gas off to Europe. I'm going to freeze Europeans in their beds. The United States said, no, you're not. You know why? We are now the biggest exporter of natural gas in the world. We sent a liquid natural gas to Ukraine and where did it come from? It came from fracking in Pennsylvania. So, Pennsylvania fracking is key to our geopolitical strategy. So, if you ever want to have a conversation, I don't trust her, she's going to do -- first of all, for four years, she didn't do anything against fracking. Why? The entire Democratic Party shut up about fracking. Why? Not for this election, but because that's how we're going to beat Putin.",

It's been that way for almost a decade now.

So, every question started with him defending some comments she made, whether it be about his rally sizes or his wealth that he had when his father passed away. And that threw him off tremendously. There is signs of aging, as there is with everybody, but I don't think it is clearly not at the level that Joe Biden was during his debate where he said he defeated Medicaid. I mean, that's just, it's not even close to the same exact comparison. BOMANI JONES, PODCAST HOST \"THE RIGHT TIME WITH BOMANI JONES:  But to me, the problem is, if you watched what he said in 2016, I was like, wow, this sounds a little cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs too.

TikTok really has become that in some ways for Kamala Harris. When she first burst onto the scene, she was kind of like this, you know, underestimated vice president that nobody really heard from, and suddenly she's everywhere. It's Brat Summer, it's -- and all that stuff actually helped to create this energy, this kind of vibe around her. So, she used TikTok really well.

Their algorithm feels more like a black box than just about anybody else's does. And anybody that's had to do stuff that involves your work going on TikTok, you drop it in, and you just hope the algorithm picks it up in a way that you don't hear people talk about being the case with other platforms.
