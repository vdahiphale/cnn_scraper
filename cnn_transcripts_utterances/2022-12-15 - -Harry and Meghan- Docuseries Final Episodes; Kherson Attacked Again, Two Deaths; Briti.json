And a deadly situation for some who end up in the pathof these shelling attacks or rocket attacks on the front lines, both to the south in Kherson and the east in Donetsk. The Russians are accusing Ukrainians of firing 40 rockets and hitting a cathedral, hitting residential buildings, commercial buildings, setting a major intersection ablaze. They are accusing Ukrainians of targeting civilians. Of course, it's exactly what the Russians are accused of doing --  not just accused; we see it for ourselves they are doing here in Ukraine. The city that they once occupied, once they retreated, they turned from occupiers to attackers. And Human Rights Watch earlier this week issued a report, accusing them of using cluster munition warheads that potentially put the lives of civilians, had killed young people in that city, in Kherson, according to Human Rights Watch. But it's not just the cluster munitions that is the major concern. There has been a deadly wave of shelling that has been going on. You had, of, course that administrative building, a huge portion of that building destroyed. The power situation is just dire. UNICEF says these Russian strikes in Ukraine -- critical infrastructure are essentially putting the physical and mental health of every single young person inside this country at desperate risk. Not only do they have to live with the fear of bombardment but they also have to live in conditions where they are spending hours or days in darkness and in cold. So even though CNN can't independently verify the reports of the Russian- backed authorities in Donetsk, the situation that they described there, the Ukrainian shelling, of course, Bakhmut, the town that the Russians have been trying to retake, that has been reduced in many places just to piles of rubble. It is extraordinarily difficult to convey just how dire the situation is for so many people on those front lines. But everybody here in Ukraine, when they're dealing with regular power interruptions, when they're dealing with this constant fear, just here in central Kyiv, yesterday these Iranian made Shahed drones, 13 of them were fired by Russia. People, including some of our CNN staff, woke up to the sound of explosions very close to where I'm standing right now. Even though those drones did not hit the power grid,  didn't cause widespread blackouts, it did cause a huge hole in the side of the building. It caused a fire. Again, it just stoked fear with some of those parts of those drones actually landing on a children's soccer pitch just hours before a major tournament.

As the chaos spreads, Peru's congress is meeting this hour todiscuss moving up elections to next December. Rafael Romo has been covering the upheaval in Peru and joins us now live. It has been an incredible week. You see Pedro Castillo trying to dissolve congress to avoid that impeachment vote. He has now been pushed out. He is currently behind bars. And I guess the question is will the new president be able to create calm on the ground? Or are protesters' voices that loud that it is indicating just how the populace is feeling about the new president? RAFAEL ROMO, CNN SR. LATIN AFFAIRS EDITOR:  Hi, Eleni. Yes, her name is Dina Boluarte and, yes, she is trying very hard to bring the situation under control. And I can tell you that former president Pedro Castillo is being held in a cell at the national police special operations directorate building in Lima, Peru's capital. A judge is expected to rule any moment now, whether Castillo will remain behind bars for the next 18 months as the nation's attorney general has requested. As you may remember, Castillo was impeached and arrested on December 7th as he announced plans to dissolve congress and install an emergency government. Apparently he was trying to get ahead of a congressional vote on his impeachment. Castillo is accused of conspiracy and rebellion. He denies those allegations. The hearing to determine whether he remains in jail was scheduled for Wednesday but had to be postponed because he changed his defense attorney. Some of his supporters say he is a political prisoner. Peru is still a country in turmoil today. As you said, no more than a week after Castillo's impeachment, the government declared Wednesday a state of emergency that will be in effect for more than 30 days. Defense minister Alberto Otarola said the national police and armed forces are responding to acts of vandalism, violence and seizure of roads. Peru's national police have confirmed that at least 14 highways across the country have been blocked by protesters, demanding the immediate return to power of former president Pedro Castillo. International flights are operating normally in and out of the international airport in Lima, Eleni, Peru's capital, even though multiple regions are still in turmoil across the country. Some regional airports remain closed. What this means is that many international tourists are stuck without a connecting flight to the capital and must stay in Peru for now.

The bill still has to be approved by the House. And this comes after several similar state bans were passed. Now growing fears, TikTok could relay data to the Chinese government, as the app is Chinese owned. TikTok says those concerns are being driven by misinformation and offered to meet with policymakers about the company's practices. The collapse of crypto giant FTX has put the spotlight on celebrities who endorsed cryptocurrencies. Big names like Tom Brady, Jimmy Fallon, Madonna and David Ortiz are now facing lawsuits from investors. They claim the celebrities did not disclose their own involvement with these digital exchanges.

They're among some named in a class action lawsuit filing against Bankman- Fried last month after his company suffered a liquidity crisis, collapsed and filed for bankruptcy. At least a million people can't access their funds. He is denying defrauding customers. The lawsuit alleges they did not properly disclose the scope and amount of compensation they personally received in exchange for the promotion of FTX. One of the plaintiffs in the proposed class action suit, Michael Livieratos, says, \"As a New England Patriots fan my entire life, you can imagine the influence that Tom Brady would have,\" claiming he moved nearly all his money from another crypto exchange to FTX. Adam Moskowitz, the lawyer representing the plaintiffs, told \"The Washington Post,\" \"You have very rich people we all love telling us that they checked this out and it was OK. \"Why shouldn't they be held responsible?\" This is just the tip of the iceberg for the crypto fallout. Another lawsuit was filed earlier this month by cryptocurrency investors against the NFT series Bored Ape Yacht Club.",
