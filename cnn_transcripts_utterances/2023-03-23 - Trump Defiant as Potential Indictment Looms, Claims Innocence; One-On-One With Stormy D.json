Sources tell us the Manhattan grand jury panel met today, but did not take up the case. It's expected to reconvene on Monday, possibly to hear additional testimony. Tonight, my exclusive conversation with the attorney for Stormy Daniels, his thoughts on where the case is heading and whether his client wants to see the former President indicted. Mr. Trump has been seeking donations, as you know, from his supporters, fundraising off of his claims he was going to be arrested this past Tuesday and in a new series of statements on his social network, is calling the Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg a \"danger to our country\" and an \"animal.\" He has also linked to an article with a photo of Bragg next to a photo of himself with a baseball bat looking like he is ready to take a swing. Bragg's office meantime sent a letter to House Republicans who are seeking to investigate the investigators. A letter says House Republicans only got involved, \"After Donald Trump created a false expectation that he would be arrested the next day and his lawyers reportedly urged you to intervene.\" \"Neither fact,\" the letter continues, \"Is a legitimate basis for congressional inquiry.\" Here is House Speaker McCarthy's reply. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA):   He doesn't prosecute anybody, so I don't understand why. He only does political ones. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

You know, the statement and you can indict a ham sandwich, it's a probable cause thing. It is not beyond a reasonable doubt, not that you want to be dismissive of that ultimate burden.

What's more, the Russians didn't even try to cover up what they were doing. Quoting the chief prosecutor again, he said, quote, the simple reality said these crimes have not been hidden. CNN's David McKenzie traveled close to the front lines and spoke to Ukrainians who risked their lives to try and stop what appear to be war crimes. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Approaching the southern front line in Kherson. In the liberated city, many have fled. It's deceptively quiet, until the relentless terror. The often indiscriminate, almost daily Russian shelling. We've come to investigate a very deliberate horror of the Russian occupation. (on-camera): So the children who stayed here were under five years old mostly. This orphanage had more than 40 children here. (voice-over): Elena (ph) was a nurse here for 17 years. Not a single child is left. I feel emptiness, emptiness. Everything has just stopped, she says. The children had everything. They were so happy. The children were happy. Now it's just silence. And small reminders of them. Their names still on each locker. The Kherson Children's Home is now a crime scene. They warned us to collect their clothes, says Elena (ph). The Russians and collaborators called in the evening and said to prepare the children for the morning. The buses arrived at 8:00. The heartbreaking scenes captured for Russian propaganda shared on a Russian MP's telegram channel, the bewildered children taken from their beloved nurses in October, transported to Russian occupied Crimea or Russia itself, say Ukrainian investigators. But instead of hiding this alleged war crime, Russians advertised it. Children will be taken to safe conditions in Crimea, he says. I'll definitely go and visit. Investigators say it was part of a premeditated Russian mission, to take Ukrainian children. They even targeted hospitals. (on-camera): There was a lot of pressure by the Russians to take these children. Weren't you afraid? It was scary. Very, very scary. So much pressure, says Olha Pilia'ksa. Twice a day, they demanded. We show them lists of the kids to take to Russia. So Olha and her team came up with an extraordinary deception. They hid orphans in the ICU. And they forged medical assessments, saying healthy children were severely sick. They even faked an emergency ventilation, she says. We understood that the Russians and collaborators would not forgive us, she says. We knew there would be serious retribution. We understood this. But they took the risks and managed to save children. And a critical care nurse took it a step further. Tetiana says she fell in love with one of the orphan children. She worked desperately to keep the child off the list. (on-camera): How are you? (voice-over): Now, she's adopting Kira (ph). (on-camera): Nice to meet you. (voice-over): We met them at home. A Ukrainian mom with her treasured Ukrainian child.",
