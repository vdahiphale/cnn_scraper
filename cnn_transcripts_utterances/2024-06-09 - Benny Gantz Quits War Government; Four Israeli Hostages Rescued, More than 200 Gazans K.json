      "sentences": "You're in the \"CNN Newsroom.\" Hi everyone, I'm Jessica Dean in New York, and we begin with breaking news and a major blow to Israel's emergency government. Just a day after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu celebrated the rescue of four hostages inside Gaza, Israeli opposition leader and War Cabinet member Benny Gantz announced he's resigning from the government.Back in May, Gantz gave Netanyahu an ultimatum, calling for a plan to end the war in Gaza and bring all the hostages home, or he said he would quit. Well, that deadline came yesterday. It was, of course, the same day Israel's military conducted a special operation to rescue those hostages from Gaza. And today, we're learning new details about that surprise mission. CNN's Paula Hancocks is live in Tel Aviv. She's been tracking the latest developments. And Paula, let's start first with what's happening inside the Israeli government. How is Prime Minister Netanyahu responding to this?",

      "sentences": "Well, Jessica, he has already effectively asked Gantz to come back. He has said on X, formerly known as Twitter, that now is not the time to abandon the campaign, saying it is a time for unity, not division. So this is something that we were expecting Gantz saying that there wasn't a day after plan, that there wasn't a decisive plan to get the hostages back, and there was no decisive plan to calm things down on the northern border with Hezbollah in southern Lebanon.So it had been threatened. Now, what this means going forward is it doesn't mean the coalition and the government is going to collapse. Netanyahu still has a majority within the government itself. What it does mean is that this government has lost really what many saw as a counterweight to the more far-right elements. Gantz was really seen as that counterweight to some of the far-right elements, for example like Ben-Gvir, who has said that he will leave the coalition if there is a ceasefire agreed to, and it does not meet his expectations. In fact, he has already said that he should be part of the war cabinet now that Benny Gantz is not. So there is this concern that there could be a further push to the right and what this will mean for the day-to- day decisions when it comes to the Gaza war. Now, we know that US officials were concerned about what this would mean if Gantz were to go for the hostage ceasefire deal as well. Benny Gantz was a strong proponent of President Biden's proposal from last week, which he said was an Israeli proposal, for this hostage deal, which they are currently waiting for Hamas to officially respond to, Jessica?",

He's also the politics and foreign policy reporter for \"Axios.\" Barak, let's start first with Benny Gantz quitting the emergency government. This was not a surprise. This was long anticipated. It also allows Netanyahu to stay in power. So what does this move actually do, and what is the fallout from this? BARAK RAVID, CNN GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST: Hi, Jessica. I think first what this move does is that it takes away from Benjamin Netanyahu this sort of bulletproof vest that he wore in the last eight months that was called Benny Gantz. And this bulletproof vest defended Netanyahu around the world because it gave his government, let's say, a more moderate appeal, if you can call it this way. I'm not sure that it's even an accurate description, but a more or less radical right-wing aroma, okay. And now it's gone. And I think this will change the way many governments around the world, first and foremost, the Biden administration, but also governments in Europe, governments in the Arab world, the way they look at the Israeli government. And this is something we haven't had for eight months. And I think this is a whole new chapter now with how the world looks at this war.",

They want to rebuild settlements in Gaza. They want to destroy and topple the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank. And they want to invade Lebanon.So if you take all of that together, I think we're looking at, you know, quite a lot of potential for moves that will escalate the situation. And Netanyahu, day one of his government said, I'm the guy with the hands on the wheel. I'll make sure that sound decisions will be taken. But we already have the track record, and we know that he cannot really control the government, and he cannot really stop them from pushing for their own policies.

On the other hand, it gave a sort of opportunity, because what some eyewitnesses in the Nuseirat refugee camp said was that some of the special forces who were part of this operation came there as displaced Palestinians. This was their disguise. And others came as if they were part of Hamas's military wing. Those were the two covers that the special forces used. And in this specific area, it worked. But I think that, you know, as the National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told Dana Bash just this morning, a lot of the reason we saw so many civilian casualties in this operation was that those hostages were hidden in civilian homes inside a refugee camp. And when you go on such an operation and there was quite a robust firefight after those hostages were rescued, and the result is a lot of civilian casualties.",

That's it. You did this operation, we're not negotiating.On the other hand, in the more interim, this could be a way for the more sinking in among Hamas leadership of the notion that they might lose more hostages that will be rescued in more of the special operations. And every hostage that the Israelis rescue is taking leverage away from Hamas. So there are people who think that this operation may be actually, you know, sort of encourage Hamas to say, we can get this deal now. Let's get this deal now.",

You're in the \"CNN Newsroom.\" (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [17:16:23] DEAN: U.S. officials are racing against the clock tonight to finalize a deal for $50 billion in a loan package for Ukraine using profits from frozen Russian assets. Sources say this is a top priority ahead of President Joe Biden's meeting with G7 leaders in Italy next week. But the nations haven't agreed on the deal just yet. And meanwhile, Russia continues its relentless invasion into Ukraine. Joining me now is Oscar winning actress Hilary Swank. She's also an ambassador for Ukraine's United 24 and also joining us, the CEO of the Legacy of War Foundation, Giles Duley. It's great to have both of you here with us to talk a little more about this. Hilary, let's start first with you. The Ukrainian government started United 24. Tell us about its mission. HILARY SWANK, AMBASSADOR, UNITED24: Yes. So it was an honor to be -- it is an honor to be an ambassador. It's great to be here, by the way. Hi, Jessica. And United24 is this wonderful way to raise awareness with a bunch of different ambassadors so that we can get out there, get our voices out there, make sure that everyone knows, understands what's happening so we can raise critical funds to help that country.",

One of the statistics that I just learned, which is really harrowing, too, is that thousands of mothers are having their babies prematurely because of the stress of the war. And when they have those premature babies, there's no incubators. So these babies are dying. So as a mother, and I know there's millions of other mothers out there who hold their babies tight, love their babies. These mothers aren't able to hold their babies anymore because of war. And we've got to do something about it. As people, as all one people, we need to stand united and help. So there's also more than 1,000 schools destroyed. Another statistic that I just learned that I think is important for people to know, which I had no idea, 20,000 babies and children have been abducted or legally deported from Ukraine into Russia to help them raise their population. This is just criminal. And we have to raise awareness. We have to do something about it.",

And one of the things I've seen in all the Russian wars of aggression is the attacks on health care facilities. So in Ukraine, over 1,600 health care facilities have been destroyed by Russia. This is what they did in Syria. It's what they did in Chechnya. It's a pattern they continue to follow.And so for my work, as well as being a photographer, I also have a foundation, the Legacy of War Foundation. We work in partnership with United24, providing health care facilities in what's known as the gray area, the areas very near the front line. Whereas Hilary said people are going out without basic medical health care. So if you imagine a young mother, it's impossible to get to a hospital, which can take days to get to. There are dangers of doing that. The local health care facilities are damaged. And what doctors and nurses are telling me is that, sadly, they only see patients when it's too late.",

I fly to Poland and then catch a train.And you become very aware that literally two hours, one and a half hours from London, and then I'm on the border with Ukraine.

My father, who passed away recently, was in the Air Force in World War II. It was only when the world came together to stop Hitler that we had victory. And that same has to happen again with Putin. It will only happen when the world comes together. And that involves all of us getting involved. And I'm just very proud to have Hilary as a friend. I've worked in Ukraine for over 10 years.

One, he is going to use retribution, going after Democrats, having misled people into believing that all the charges against him in a series of trials, most of which haven't occurred yet, are somehow the product of political retribution from Democrats. Utterly untrue. President Biden has had nothing to do with these charges. But, of course, he tells his supporters and they all go along with it. But I think the second thing that really is most disturbing is that Donald Trump has now proven to us that he really does follow through on what he says he's going to do, at least in his area of priority, which in this case is hurting our system in order to benefit him and possibly to extend his rule. So, we have -- we have a crisis in democracy, not just a crisis because of this specific election or the people in his base who will use violence to get their goals accomplished. This is a major long- term problem for the United States created by one Donald Trump.",

So, when I was growing up, I actually was growing up knowing that my grandfather, my great-grandfather, was a very important man, but at the same time, he was sort of a secret important man because anything that the Soviet Union did during his leadership from 1953 when Stalin died to 1964 when he was ousted was done by the Communist Party. But the Communist Party at the time supposedly had no leader.So, I grew up as a secret Khrushchev, in a sense. I wasn't -- I wasn't an open Khrushchev, and we talk about his legacy and his achievements that is denouncing Stalin, most of all, only in our kitchen or with my mother's friends who were the Moscow intellectuals at the time.",

I mean, I actually originally studied literature because only literature you can speak freely, you can write things, kind of between the lines. You can -- there's such thing as -- George Orwell used this writing his dystopia in 1984, the Doublespeak. You think one thing and you speak another thing.And that what made me interested, this kind of Russian intersection between art and politics. And from then on, I became very interested in it, not only in politics, but also how art influences and actually becomes politics in the absence of open politics, so to speak. And if we look at Russia today, who are the greatest enemies of the Putin state? The greatest enemies are the musicians, the writers, the actors, those who spoke against the war, those who spoke in defense of Ukraine. These are the main -- the main actors, the main -- the main evil people in Putin's state. And that's in many ways is a very -- is very reminiscent of what was happening under Stalin. And I really feel that in this sense, I'm better prepared to understand Putinism because I studied Stalinism to a great extent and also art under Stalin.",
