Take a listen to what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  When this happened, people would ask whose fault is it? I think, to a certain extent, it's Biden's fault and Harris' fault. And I'm the opponent. Look, they were weaponizing government against me. They brought in the whole DOJ to try and get me. They weren't too interested in my health and safety. I would be if I were in their position, but they weren't very interested.

The positions that you are talking about, Sara, were four years ago, five years ago when she first ran for president. And I think a very compelling argument that she can make is that as any strong, smart, competent public servant does, they learn from their lived experiences.She has had 3 1/2 years of a lived experience of being vice president and understanding how key policies affect the American electorate. So hence, she has learned, she has evolved. She has changed her positions as she has come into new knowledge -- as she has come into that lived experience. And so she has talked to voters for the last 3 1/2 years, as she has focused on what she now understands really helps them. Really helps these American families -- middle-class voters, working-class voters -- and understand how to really help them take that step to again, like she says, not only get by but to get ahead. I think that's an incredibly compelling argument versus Donald Trump who says one thing today, flip-flops tomorrow depending on who the last person was to whisper in his ear. That is not a way to govern. That is a way to continue with the chaos and continue with the crazy. And so I think that is a true contrast that I think she can really use to her advantage as she talks about where she is now on the policies that she is going to push, along with Tim Walz, on issues that really expand the middle class, protect our rights and freedoms, and focus on giving Americans a better life for themselves and their children.",

Maybe. But let's be frank. Those negotiations are quite sensitive right now. It's not clear that they are making progress on the most intractable issues. So any increase in hostilities, particularly in the West Bank, are ones that you have to treat as a risk.

Nearly two million tickets have been sold. They are some of the bravest and most inspiring athletes. All right. An environmental group is calling for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to be investigated over an incident where he allegedly beheaded a dead whale that washed ashore near his home. The story shared by Kennedy's daughter in a 2012 interview with Town &amp; Country magazine, says he used a chainsaw to cut off the whale's head. Now the Center for Biological Diversity Action Fund wants some answers. And it's been a huge business week for two famous football brothers. Jason and Travis Kelce signed off on what a source tells CNN is $100 million podcast deal with Amazon. It's for their \"New Heights\" podcast -- that's what it's called. And Travis just bought part ownership in an up and coming racehorse after attending the Kentucky Derby back in May. The 3-year-old horse is named \"Swift Delivery.\" It is set to make its stakes debut at the Toronto Cup this Saturday. But before you get too excited, no, the horse wasn't named after Kelce's popstar girlfriend, although I'm sure that's why he bought it. I'm just saying maybe. I don't know -- John.",

It is going to the moon. It's a meteoric rise that we've rarely ever seen before, and it's being driven by the fact that INVIDIA makes chips that power the AI revolution. And that has made this company one of the most valuable on the planet. Even though it's not a household name it is now valued at more than $3 trillion -- $3.2 trillion. More than Microsoft, more than Alphabet, more than Amazon, more than Saudi Aramco, and just behind Apple for the number one spot. And the higher the stock price goes the more important it is for the overall stock market, right? It accounts for a huge part of the tech sector. It really sets the tone for the whole market at large. And the bar has really been set very high for today's earnings report. Analysts are expecting triple-digit growth from NVIDIA across the board, saying that revenue, profit, free cash flow -- all of it will more than double from the year before. Veteran tech analyst Dan Ives -- he told me that there's such high demand for INVIDIA's share price that it's been -- essentially become the new oil and gold in the modern world. And he said that they \"expect another drop the mic performance from INVIDIA as of right now, Jensen and Co. are the only game in town.\" Now, investors are going to be living and dying at everything that INVIDIA's CEO Jensen Huang says.
