I'm Lynda Kinkade with CNN's breaking news coverage of Israel at war.Take your belongings and go south. That's the message from Israel to the residents of Northern Gaza as it prepares to launch a military ground operation at any moment. The U.S. is now sending a second carrier strike group to the Eastern Mediterranean, as well as additional fighter jets. The move is intended to deter Iran, Hezbollah and others from entering the conflict. On Saturday, Israel declared it's ready to open a new phase in the war with a focus on significant ground operations. The IDF says it struck more than 100 Hamas targets in Gaza overnight. A CNN team close to the Northern Gaza has been hearing heavy machine gunfire near the border fence as well as loud explosions. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met soldiers on the frontlines offering words of support and telling them to be prepared. Palestinian authorities in Gaza say the death toll from the Israeli airstrikes is now more than 2,300 people with more than 9,000 injured. According to the Health Ministry, 300 of those deaths were in just the past 24 hours, most of them women and children. Israel claims it has already killed two senior Hamas leaders who were behind last weekend's massacres. Earlier, I interviewed a spokesperson from the IDF about one such operation in the past several hours. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. COL. PETER LERNER, SPOKESPERSON, IDF:  I can inform you that over the night, we attacked and killed one of the nukhba commanders, leaders from Khan Yunis. His name is Bilal al-Kidra. He was the leader that conducted butcher and attack in the nearing kibbutz. And this just goes to exemplify that we have the intelligence in order to take out Hamas' leadership from (INAUDIBLE), the mastermind of the massacre all the way down to the terrorists that breached, penetrated, and butchered our babies in their bedrooms.

It's a kind of a warning to both Hezbollah and to Iran and, to a lesser extent, to Syria, where we've also seen rockets being fired towards Israel.I think it's pretty clear the U.S. is not going to have boots on the ground at any stage here. It's providing additional military aid to Israel since this particular war began, and perhaps it may increase that involvement at some point. But no one really is expecting boots on the ground. For now, it is support, both in terms of political support and in terms of military aid and the presence of those two aircraft carriers really designed to send a clear message to Hezbollah and its backers in Tehran that they should not get involved if they don't want to suffer the consequences.

      "sentences": "I think to begin with, there was quite a lot of support rallying around Israel from the international community, really shocks at the barbarity and savagery of this terrorist attack by Hamas in the early hours of last Saturday morning. But, of course, as the civilian death toll has risen in Gaza, which was inevitable, sadly, given how embedded in the civilian population Hamas is, that has generally been a sense this has generally been shift, that there's been more calls naturally for concern for Israel to take greater care with civilian lives.And, of course, we've seen this play out in the past, that when there are wars in Gaza and the civilian death toll rises, that this kind of -- calls for more care to be taken with civilians kind of moves over into potential condemnation of Israel, whether it's the United Nations or by international bodies. Now, we've heard from other countries in the region, such as the United Arab Emirates, calling for Israel to take more care with civilians. And there are, of course, discussions under way to try to get some kind of safe passage for American civilians and also for other citizens of Gaza out of the Rafah in the south of the strip. But, for now, aid is not able to get in and it seems that, for now, people are not able to get out either. So, I think that we will, over the coming days, see more criticism of Israel and perhaps leading to some kind of condemnation in various bodies of the United Nations. I think Israel knows that that is likely to happen at some point. But I think given the gravity of this terrorist attack on Israel, which has been described by the president of Israel as the darkest day, the biggest loss of Jewish life since the Holocaust in a single day, that Israel is perhaps less concerned about the optics now than it has been in the past.

But it is responsible, actually.So, as we see the impending ground, sea, and air invasion of Gaza and we see calls for 1.1 million Palestinians, most of whom have absolutely nothing to do with Hamas, move from one part of this incredibly densely populated area, one of the most densely populated areas in the world down south, it's quite extraordinary. The U.N., the E.U., international rights groups, Israeli rights groups, have all expressed tremendous concern for the civilian casualties that are already ongoing. We've already seen hundreds, perhaps almost thousands of Palestinian civilians killed over the last week and we're likely to see many more than that. That's just, you know, at the moment.

It's a much more -- it's a much easier sort of route to traverse. They're not being bombed by one of the most sophisticated militaries in the world as they try to flee.

But we're asking 1.1 million people to leave within 24, 30 hours to a territory that there is nowhere to go. There are no shelters. U.N.'s shelters have been actually closed down or bombed, as well as hospitals and others. This is simply not tenable.

They should be able to go wherever they can seek refuge, safety and security. And, again, the responsibility for Gaza is reserved for Israel as the occupying power since 1967. The second point is, indeed, Palestinians and also many Arab neighbors are very concerned that if the borders were to be opened with Egypt, that the Palestinians would cross the border and then never be allowed to come back. Israel's current defense minister, Israel's current national security adviser, Israel's agricultural minister, all members of Benjamin Netanyahu's center-right Likud Party, have all talked about removing Palestinians from the country during the past few years. You can see them in Peter Beinart's excellent essay for Jewish Currents entitled, Could Israel Carry Out Another Nakba? That was written six months before any of this took place, okay. You have people like Smotrich, who is a senior member of the Israel Knesset, tell his own Palestinian-Israeli colleagues in the Knesset, in the Israeli parliament, that they were there by mistake because the founder of Israel didn't finish the job and throw them out in 1948 when the state was founded.

So, I know something about what that's like. I saw so many terrible pictures this week of children suffering, Israeli children and Palestinian children. And it took me back to a really horrible, horrible place. And, you know, no one in this world deserves to suffer like that, you know, especially not kids. I don't understand it. I really don't and I never will, but sometimes comedy is really the only way forward through tragedy. My heart is with everyone whose lives have been destroyed this week. But tonight, I'm going to do what I've always done in the face of tragedy, and that's try to be funny. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
