And this is really the very early beginning phases of it. Brianna, the company, Intuitive Machines, is now saying that the Odysseus spacecraft has successfully landed on the moon, that it is standing upright. And we just got this latest update from the company. They say, \"Odysseus is alive and well. Flight controllers are communicating and commanding the vehicle to download science data. The lander has good telemetry and so low charging.\" So according to Intuitive Machines, everything is looking good. But I think the big question now is, the south pole of the moon is a tough spot in terms of getting communication from earth to the moon. We knew that was going to be a challenge. But it seems to be taking a bit longer than even the company had anticipated.",

FISHER: So there were -- there are two options for cameras. There is a camera actually on the Odysseus lander itself. We think that that will be where the first images will come from. But then there's something called the Eagle Cam. And this popped off the Odysseus lander shortly before landing. And it should be able to provide us with some really cool third person vantage point views of literally the moment that Odysseus touched down. And that's the Eagle Cam right there. It was actually made by Embry- Riddle Aeronautical University. But listen to how long it may take to get images from that. They put out a statement that says: \"Space Technologies Lab has confirmed that they are receiving telemetry data and are working through the next steps with Intuitive Machines' Mission Control. So we remain hopeful to have an image today or in a week. It's hard to say due to the number of other failures on board.\" Now before you're going --",

Now, Boris, she was a frequent guest on \"The Wendy Williams Show.\" I worked with her for years on her show. And in the final season, when Wendy was not coming to work because of health issues, which now we know the diagnosis, I was a fill-in host. And the reason why they needed so many hosts to come in was because Wendy was not there. She was having health issues. And again, now we know what those health issues are.
