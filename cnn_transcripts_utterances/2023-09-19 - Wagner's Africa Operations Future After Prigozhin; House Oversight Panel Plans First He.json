Those who remain, including his top lieutenants, have agreed to work for the Russian Ministry of Defense. Fighters have already been pulled back from frontline outposts to population centers in an effort to cut costs, the source says. What's less clear is what becomes of Wagner's civilian presence here. This is one of the last places that Prigozhin was seen alive, during his final tour across Africa. It's called the Russian Cultural Center. Only it has no connection to Russia's official cultural agency and was run until recently by Prigozhin's closest associate here.

So today, CNN is learning about new testimony that raises doubts about claims of political interference in the Hunter Biden probe. Those allegations come from IRS whistleblower Gary Shapley, but some IRS and FBI officials are painting a very different picture. So let's bring in CNN's Kara Scannell. Kara, what exactly are these officials saying that refutes what Shapley presented to Republicans on Capitol Hill?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Brianna, this is going to be the first public facing step that House Republicans take since they launched their impeachment inquiry one week ago. We know this hearing is going to be held by the House Oversight Committee on September 28th. And we also know it's supposed to focus on allegations of corruption and of abuse of public office. That is how they're framing.And as you mentioned, the witness list is not yet finalized, but Chairman James Comer said he wants to bring in two different witnesses. One, a financial expert that they hope can speak to the bank records pertaining to some of the Biden family business deals. That's been a big focus of their committee work and investigation so far. And two, they want to bring in a constitutional expert to try to make the case for why they believe an impeachment inquiry is still warranted. An argument that is not only being aimed at the public but perhaps at some of their own members at well -- as well, who still do not support this impeachment inquiry going forward. But the committee is also taking some other steps. They want to issue their first subpoenas, potentially as early as this week. They want to get their hands on some bank records and personal records from both Hunter Biden and James Biden, which would be the first direct outreach routine Republicans and members of the Biden family. But the White House is emphasizing here that Republicans have yet to link President Joe Biden himself directly to any of his son's foreign business deals. And the White House also really sees this as nothing more than a distraction from all the other chaos that's happening in the House Republican Conference right now. In fact, Brianna, I should mention that just moments ago, they were -- failed to advance a defense bill. It failed on House floor. Because the number of hardliners were in opposition to that funding bill. But I want to read you the statement from Ian Sams. He is a spokesperson for the White House. He said: Staging a political stunt -- staging a political stunt hearing in the waning days before they may shut down the government reveals their true priorities. To them, baseless personal attacks on President Biden are more important than preventing a government shutdown and the pain it would inflict on American families. And no doubt Congress is barreling towards a government shutdown right now, which Kevin McCarthy has warrant would slow down, if not halt, all of their investigations and their impeachment inquiry. But as of right now, Brianna, it is full steam ahead.",

But these were all class-A mishaps, according to the Marine Corps, the most serious type of accident that results in a death or in the destruction of more than two and $2.5 million of property.And because of the severity of these incidents and how seriously the Marine Corps is taking these, General Smith ordered this two day pause in flight operations. During which these different aviation units -- and it's not just the F-35 units such as those that flew the plane that crashed on Sunday -- it's across the Marine Corps. So F-35s FA-18s, V-22 Ospreys, all of these will take this two day pause to go over safe and normal operations, review policies and procedures. Essentially go over the working order of how to fly and operate airplanes just to make sure that this is done as safely as possible. There's obviously an inherent risk to military aviation.
