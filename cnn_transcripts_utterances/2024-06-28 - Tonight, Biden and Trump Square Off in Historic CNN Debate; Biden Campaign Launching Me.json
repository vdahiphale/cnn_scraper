Would he -- well, actually, I should say he they thought he would be a much stronger performer on the debate stage. They had been planning and expecting that he would deliver a speech similar to the State of the Union, where he was largely applauded by members of his party. That was not the Joe Biden that they saw last night. So, that was one part of it. The other part is that they had extensively prepped Donald Trump on trying to keep him on message, hoping that he wouldn't go rogue, to stay away from personal attacks. And for the most part, Joe Biden did that -- or excuse me, Donald Trump did that. And so they were very happy with his performance. They've also been very closely monitoring Democrats' responses on social media, their comments on television, seeing the panic that has set in and they've been relishing that as well.

So, he is used to clean up after natural disasters, which last night was a natural disaster. Let's not make any puns about it.Bakari, if Joe Biden had a cold and was really concerned about his cold, he went to the waffle house and just infected like a whole bunch of people, wasn't wearing a mask. So, I'm not so sure the cold thing, anybody's buying the cold thing, right? Look, it was, it was just a terrible performance by the guy. But the big question now is that, is he not just fit to run for president for next term, is he fit to serve the balance of his term?

You know, the second half was when there was a lot more just outright dishonesty, election denialism, all those things. That was there. If you're a middle of the road voter inclined not to like that aspect of Donald Trump, you saw it last night.",
