He is expected to point to new data showing the economy bounced back in the third quarter and grew -- it grew at an annual rate of 2.6 percent. Biden has recently called the economy strong as hell and he is trying to convince voters who believe the opposite, that Democrats deserve to stay in power in Washington. The president is expected to slam Republican's economic plans in these remarks which we will bring you live. CNN White House correspondent Jeremy Diamond is live on the scene in Syracuse.

The president is going to be warning voters about the consequences of a Republican majority in Congress as it relates to the economy and to inflation, talking about these proposals to repeal key provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act, for example.And the president is also going to be doing a very delicate balancing out here, John. He is going to be touting some of these strong new economic numbers out this morning. At the same time, he wants to show Americans that he understands the pain that they are going through.

Annie Grayer, Zach Cohen, Whitney Wild, all working on this.We have learned that the January 6 committee is wrapping up its review of more than a million pages of Secret Service documents and it has now begun to schedule interviews, to bring in to top Secret Service agents, former agents and officials from the agency. They're expected to testify in the coming weeks. We know that the committee has said it intends to call back two key witnesses, former Secret Service Assistant Director Tony Ornato, who you see there, the Trump's lead Secret Service agent on the day of the attack, Robert Engel. But in addition, we're told the following other witnesses are under consideration, Kimberly Cheatle, the new Secret Service director, Anthony Guglielmi, I hope I pronounce that correctly, who is the Secret Service's chief of communications, he was just appointed in March and was not at the agency at the time of the attack, but he has handled key responses to the committee. Also Timothy Giebels, who was the head of former Vice President Mike Pence's detail on January 6th and finally the driver of former President Donald Trump's SUV in the motorcade, his name has never been publicly disclosed. So, John, our understanding is that committee has a lot of questions for these potential witnesses including, of course, what the Secret Service knew about those threats to Vice President Mike Pence and lawmakers ahead of the attack. You may remember in the October 13th hearing, the committee had found out that the Secret Service received an alert of online threats. These were made before the attack against then-Vice President Pence including the words that, quote, he would be a dead man walking if he doesn't do the right thing. And, finally, CNN has learned according to a source familiar, John, this is quite incredible, pence and his team were never briefed on those threats I was told today, and they only learned of them when they were made public during this month's hearing, John.",

Cassidy Hutchinson gave us her perspective on that. And we'll see and I believe they will, whether the Secret Service testimony will support that. And the other big question is, what was done with all these threats that the Secret Service was alerted to? You hit the nail in the head, why on Earth would Mike Pence's team not have been alerted?
