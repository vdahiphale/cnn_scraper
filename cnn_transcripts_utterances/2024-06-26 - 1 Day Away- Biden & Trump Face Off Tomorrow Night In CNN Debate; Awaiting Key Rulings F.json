For Biden sources say that means going on the attack against Donald Trump but also not announcing any new policy. For Trump that means perhaps not interrupting so much during the debate, and instead allies are pushing him to focus in on issues they believe he has the upper hand on like inflation and immigration. CNN's seen as Arlette Saenz and Kristen Holmes, they're speaking to the campaign and joining us now. Kristen, let me start with you. Talk about the approach and plan for Donald Trump.

No one has played our moderators, Jake Tapper and Dana Bash. It has been just a series of interviews and what they call, quote unquote, policy sessions, discussions. That is how Donald Trump picks up information.Now, it was interesting, because he did a series of interviews of last several days, in which he has been very candid about his debate prep. At one time, he actually said the debate prep was hard. Yes, he did some reflections saying that in 2020, he thinks he was too aggressive with Joe Biden. He also talked about how he believes he's been preparing for this debate his whole life. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I think I've been preparing for it for my whole life, if you want to know the truth. And I'm not sure you can lock yourself into a room for two weeks or one week or two days and really learn what you have to know. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But we are told by advisers that there was some concern, particularly around the fact that Biden was going to be really in this intensive prep. What did that mean for Thursday's debate? And it led to a lot of tempering of expectations from Trump's senior advisors after months of saying that Joe Biden was incompetent that he couldn't string together a sentence.Yesterday, we had a call with reporters and senior advisors who essentially said that they believe that Joe Biden was going to show up on Thursday. So clearly, they are trying to manage the expectations while still getting at least attempting to get Donald Trump to stay on message particularly to talk about inflation, immigration and crime.",

You know, we've got social policy dilemmas over abortion, homelessness. But, you know, the probably the weightiest case that we've got going is, you know, the one over former President Donald Trump's immunity, should he be shielded from criminal trial for some -- trying to subvert an election back in 2020. We know that Special Counsel Jack Smith is trying to bring that prosecution on behalf of the U.S. Justice Department, essentially, on behalf of the American people. And that trial has been delayed. And we're expecting a decision on whether President -- former President Trump has immunity starting today or possibly tomorrow. We know the justices will be in, John, and also on Friday. And there's a chance that they will bust deadlines here and not finish up until early next week. But we do not know yet what they're going to do just as we do not know how are they are going to rule on these cases, as well as other important pending ones on federal regulation of social media, and the environment.

I expect maybe as soon as today to hear another dissent from the bench. So far, the only one we've had is when Justice Sonia Sotomayor really protested how the justices overturned a federal prohibition on machine guns that would have included bump stocks, dangerous bump stock.

He was denying that there was any of the violence or the really extreme violence, the beheadings and the rape that took place on October 7th on Hamas's part. He doubted all that.It really just set a very, very bad tone with, it's not a huge Jewish population in Westchester County, but it's a very moderate district. And George Latimer been around for decades. He's the county executive, a very powerful position there. Very, very well known. Here's how he put it to CNN last night. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GEORGE LATIMER (D-NY), CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE: When you lose touch with your district, when you're not on the ground enough, and when you're more concerned about your national profile that you're on, you know, the major media outlets, but you're not in the neighborhoods that you need to be in, all the neighborhoods you need to be in, then you lose the focus and you lose support in your district. Well, let's be clear, I'm a progressive. I have done a number of things in my home county. We've passed a Clinic Access Law. We've done a wide range of things to help the LGBTQ community. We've had a Black Maternal Health Care Initiative. We've lowered the cost of childcare for people. We've electrified a bunch, all those are progressive goals. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But what was most interesting is that both these candidates, none of those ads, none of those mailers mentioned Israel and Gaza, they talked about Biden and whether or not Jamaal Bowman could work with Biden. Latimer said he could work with him better.What came back to haunt him was his vote against the infrastructure bill that Biden put forward because the Squad wanted something bigger, if you remember, so they voted against it as a way of gaining leverage in the House.
