Tomorrow, or today if you're in Russia, marks 300, 300 long days for Evan Gershkovich, the American journalist wrongly detained in a Russian prison. Ahead, the latest attempts by his employer, \"The Wall Street Journal,\" to try to help secure his release and the pushback they're getting from Putin.Plus, CNN's Laura Coates one-on-one with Vice President Kamala Harris, the VP's comments on abortion rights and what she says is at risk with the potential second Trump presidency. The first clips of that interview will roll out this hour on \"The Lead.\" And leading this hour, one day left before the New Hampshire primary. Nikki Haley has a bit more momentum with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis now out of the race. But are DeSantis voters willing to back her or are they going to side with the GOP front runner Donald Trump. Governor Chris Sununu, Haley's biggest backer in New Hampshire is going to join us this hour. But first we start with CNN's Kristen Holmes who is in Laconia, New Hampshire where Trump is expected to speak tonight. CNN's Kylie Atwood is in Salem, New Hampshire for a Nikki Haley rally that will begin in just an hour. Kristen, let me start with you. A big three days for Donald Trump. He picked up the endorsements of former competitors, Tim Scott, Ron DeSantis. What is the Trump campaign's message today and has Trump spoken to DeSantis since DeSantis dropped out of the race yesterday?",

And that's what you're going to see tonight. When Tim Scott, when Vivek Ramaswamy, when Doug Burgum, all former opponents take the stage with Donald Trump.The idea is, look, Republicans are joining together. These were my opponents. Now they have endorsed me. It is time for Nikki Haley to drop out and make sure that I am the Republican nominee. Now, the one person you're going to note is not going to be on that stage is, as you mentioned, Ron DeSantis, who, former opponent, did endorse Donald Trump but isn't going to be here. And I am told that the two of them have not spoken since DeSantis dropped out of the race and since he endorsed Donald Trump. I did hear that senior advisors on Trump's team reached out to Ron DeSantis' team, giving them an open invitation to campaign with the former president some point in the future. Obviously, that time is not going to be tonight, but something to look for on the campaign trail.",

You just interviewed or showed Nikki Haley. They had about seven people on the stage at first. They were generating countless hours of primetime TV energy, introducing themselves to the country, and Democrats have been silent. We need competition. Right now, it's Marianne Williamson and me competing against Joe Biden. And the sad truth is Joe Biden won't debate. He won't show up. He won't face voters. I've not seen him answer a question from the press that was not unscripted. And look it, democracy dies in that kind of silence. And there's a lot more going on here, as you already noted, with the writing campaign, including, including a letter that was just issued by the New Hampshire Secretary of State to the Democratic National Committee. A cease and desist for the unlawful suppression of voters. Jake, there's a lot going on right now that people are not aware of and it's got to be called attention to.

When they turn 18, if they graduate high school, they get an account that would -- could be worth upwards of $20,000 so that we actually have the equality of opportunity in this country. Early child care, early child education, child care. I want to have health care for all, a national health insurance program that will actually save us money. Build seven million homes so that every American has one and we put downward pressure on pricing. Education, from pre-k to college without debt. And then most importantly to so many right now, chaos in our cities and our neighborhoods, the southern border, Jake, the Middle East, and Europe. People are really fearful. And I'll tell you something, last night, I saw a Trump rally outside of mine. I walked up to the line of people a mile long. And I simply said, hello, I was met with 50 people going to the Trump rally who were friendly, hospitable, thoughtful, and some who said they voted for Barack Obama, some said they were Bernie Sanders supporters, about half of whom had never been to a Trump event before.

Governor, this new CNN poll shows that without DeSantis in the race, 54 percent of likely Republican voters in New Hampshire will support Donald Trump, 41 percent will support Nikki Haley. If tomorrow's results show similar numbers, will that be enough to justify her staying in the race? GOV. CHRIS SUNUNU (R-NH): Oh, of course, look, there's only been two things, number one, anyone who says this is a must win for Nikki Haley, I heard someone mentioning that in the studio, tell them they overpaid for that online political science degree. There's only been three goals here, right? One, was to make sure she got a second place, we got that. Two, was to make sure there are only two candidates left in the race. And we're ahead of -- we're head there. She's wiped 12 candidates off. And then she wants to build on that momentum out of Iowa. She got 20 percent. She's going to more than double or exceed that here. The last point is their polls. Last time I checked, they're always wrong, right? So you never know. The same poll on the day I got elected governor said I was going to lose by 11. And we won by a couple percent. So, you know, it's all about the voter turnout. It's all about the enthusiasm. Where's the energy, not just what people say on the phone or how they, you know, respond to an online text or something. It's really about the energy of that campaign. Trump has no energy.

So there really doesn't seem to be movement. But I guess one piece of movement in the puzzle that keeps Prime Minister Netanyahu where he is in government and doesn't bring about the collapse of his government that would trigger the type of election you were talking about just now. Itamar Ben-Gvir, the very hardline right wing politician who is the security minister here in the government with the Prime Minister has once again said if you, Prime Minister, cut a deal and stop the war, I'm out of the government.

So it's a very strong block and a view there, this divergence to United States are setting out a position.You know, Europe's diverging here a little bit from where President Biden is.

He's mentioned as much that he was talked about there are states at the United Nations that don't have a security, don't have a security apparatus.
