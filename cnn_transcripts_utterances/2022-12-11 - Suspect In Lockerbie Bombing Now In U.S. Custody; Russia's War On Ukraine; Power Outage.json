One of the men accused of one of the deadliest terror attacks in American and British history is now in custody in the U.S. The Justice Department confirming they have arrested a Libyan suspect for allegedly making the bomb that brought down Pan-Am flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland back in 1988, that attack left leaving 270 people dead. CNN's Senior Justice Correspondent Evan Perez joining us with more on this. Evan, what do we know about this arrest, how it happened, and what more about the suspect?",

We expect that he's going to be making an appearance in U.S. federal court here in Washington on Monday and we're going to learn a little bit more about exactly how this came down. Certainly, you know, he emerged a few years ago as the person who was the bombmaker, the one who made the bomb that was put on this flight that ended up in the Pan-Am flight that ended up being -- that blew up over Lockerbie in 1988 and killed 270 people.This was -- this has been one of the most interesting and certainly painstaking investigations by the FBI, by Scottish authorities. If you remember, this flight blew up 31,000 feet over Lockerbie. 300 tons of wreckage was strewn over 845 miles. They managed to find a piece of clothing that was wrapped around the bomb that they traced back to a clothing store in Malta, and that's how they were able to identify, you know, how -- who was behind the bomb. And so, all of these years later, the FBI now has this man in custody, and we're expecting him to be presented in court to face charges that include destruction of an aircraft resulting in death. Of course, federal crimes here in the United States, using explosives in a death, and a number of other criminal charges that we're expecting to hear from the authorities here in Washington in the next day or so. But Fred, just real quick, you know, there is a bit of a mystery as to how the U.S. got him in custody. The last we heard when these charges were first made public back in 2020 by then-Attorney General Bill Barr, we had been told that he was in the custody of Libyan authorities. I will say just in the recent days, there have been some reporting out of Libya that he may have been kidnapped. So, that suggests, perhaps, he was not in custody any more. And then somehow, he ends up in U.S. custody. So, those are questions, of course, that we're going to be putting to the U.S. authorities. Right now, the Justice Department is only saying that he is in custody and that he will be facing the court in the coming days. Fred.",

They were able to redeploy troops onto the Bakhmut frontline, as indeed have the Russians been able to. So, that has been a real problem for the Ukrainians in trying to maintain momentum as they try to recapture territory. It might appear too, we don't know this for sure, but there have been hints coming, particularly, from U.S. based diplomats that the Ukrainians may have started to develop a longer-range missiles or drones that they're now putting to use in attacks, like this one seen in Melitopol, also in Donetsk. And I think, perhaps, more importantly also in the Crimean Peninsula, which is also, according to social media reports anyway have been hit in the last 24 hours for these longer-range missiles. I think also, one of the problems for the Ukrainians is that they had started to think that these Iranian-supplied drones that were given to or sold to the Russians were running out. They were running down or completely used them up in the Russian armory. Clearly, that isn't the case if 15 were fired at Odessa, and five were able to get through. These are designed really to just overwhelm air defenses with sheer volumes of -- volume of numbers. Fred.",

In just over an hour from now, in this country, NASA's historic Artemis I mission will splash down off the coast of Baja, California, that's about 300 miles south of the original splashdown location near San Diego. NASA says a concern over bad weather and large waves prompted the move. The uncrewed spacecraft took a 25-day trip around the moon as a test run for future flights with astronauts on board. Let's bring in Adam Frank, he's a professor of astrophysics at the University of Rochester and the author of \"Light of the Stars: Alien Worlds and Fate of the Earth\". So good to see you, Adam.

Because it's a pretty rough ride for the astronauts coming in, right? I mean, they're coming in at MACH32 and it's a pretty bumpy and dangerous ride.And this way, by bumping off the atmosphere a little bit, and then, you know, hopefully, coming back in, they can -- they've shed some of the velocity and it's just a safer way to re-entry.

In total, likely to pick up about three to five inches of rain from that area between San Francisco all the way down to San Diego. And the concern there, obviously, is going to be the floods. Not just flooded roadways, but especially the areas where you have burn scars from the wildfires over this past summer, those could also potentially flood in the next 24 to 48 hours. Then the system begins to make its way off to the east. By the time we get to Monday and Tuesday, the focus now becomes the central portion of the country. Potential blizzard conditions in the Northern Plains, and then to the south, we're talking severe storms.The storm system will continue to make its way across over towards the eastern seaboard by the end of the week, also, bringing the potential for rain and snow there. But the early half of the week, the main concern is really going to be severe storms. For Monday, the target area is going to be safe from Wichita down through areas of northern Texas. By Tuesday, it shifts a little further east. We also see that threat increasing on Tuesday, as well. So that's another concern.

Sources tell CNN, the Committee is considering referrals for former President Trump and four close allies. CNN's Annie Grayer joining us now.So, Annie, what more are you learning? ANNIE GRAYER, CNN CAPITOL HILL REPORTER:  Well, Fredricka, sources tell me a number of individuals, in addition to former President Donald Trump are being considered for criminal revel referrals from the January 6th Committee to the Department of Justice. And that list includes Mark Meadows, who was Donald Trump's White House chief of staff. John Eastman, who was an election lawyer, right wing lawyer, who is responsible for many of the schemes that Donald Trump tried to enact to try and overturn the 2020 election. Jeffrey Clark, who's a former Department of Justice official, who Donald Trump, at one point tried, tried to insert in the top job of the DOJ. And Rudy Giuliani, Donald Trump's long-time lawyer. Congressman Adam Schiff, who's a member of the January 6th Committee and part of the subcommittee tasked with putting together recommendations on criminal referrals, just said on CBS that list of recommendations is going to be presented to the full meeting -- to the full member meeting later today. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA), JANUARY 6 SELECT COMMITTEE:  You know, I think we are in common agreement about what our approach should be. I'm not ready or authorized at this point to tell you what that is. We are, as a subcommittee, several of us that were charged with making a recommendation about referral is going to be making that recommendation to the full committee today. (END VIDEO CLIP) Grayer:  So, after those recommendations are made, Fredricka, the full committee still needs to sign off on that. But let's take a look at the big picture here. A criminal referral from the January 6th Committee to the Department of Justice is largely symbolic in nature. DOJ does not need Congress' permission or invitation to investigate criminal activity. And it already has ongoing criminal probes into January 6th. But January 6th Committee members feel like criminal referrals are an important part of their work, particularly if their investigation has found evidence of criminal activity. So, members will be meeting later today virtually to view the official recommendations. And we won't see those recommendations until the committee releases its final report, which is expected for December 21st.",

Think about all the errors, and then they -- then you hear, please place item in the bagging area, or unexpected item in the bag. It just slows everything down. But stores really like it.

And this -- and we're talking about real Christmas trees here.Luckily though, there are a few ways that shoppers can save. Big box stores like Walmart, they often offer discounts on Christmas trees. They use them as loss leaders, try to get shoppers in the stores and then spend on gifts and decorations and everything else they need. And the larger trees, they're going to be a little bit more expensive. So, maybe consider switching to a smaller tree or switch to an artificial tree. The retailers, they bought the artificial trees about a year ago, and that was before inflation really started to spike. And so they locked in those prices.",

City council meeting where members, like Kevin de Leon, you can see there, and others were making flat-out racist comments. They weren't racially charged. They were just racist. They were anti-black and anti-indigenous, against black people in a community, against one of the city council member's black sons, and against the Wahaca Community, a community of indigenous people from a particular area in Mexico.And so, those comments were laughed at, condoned by the people who were in that room, according to the recordings that we've all heard. And so, this is why people are calling for Kevin de Leon there, that council member and others to resign. Now, some of them have resigned but he is refusing to resign. And he is saying that he was going to give people time to heal. And this was one of his first public appearances since those recordings were released back in October. But you can see there in the video what happened when protesters and activists told him, you're racist, you need to resign over and over again. Of course, there's different views on what happened. You can see it for yourself. But let's look at these statements here. One coming from Kevin de Leon, himself, saying, once we were able to push back, he says in that statement, we were able to push back, open a door, try to get out, but Reedy, the activist, launched a pelvic thrust followed by a headbutt. My response was in self defense. Now, let's look at the attorney for Reedy, the other gentleman who was involved. And he was saying that, that's not what happened. What you're seeing there is de Leon's supporters initiated physical contact by shoving him. He then grabbed Mr. Reedy and he had his hands up. He didn't initiate physical contact. Fred, this is just part of a really bigger issue in L.A. County. And this has been sent over to the police department, we're waiting to hear back from them.",

More than 69,000 fans packed in the stands at Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia to witness one of the best rivalries in sports.Americas game as it's known, brought all the tradition and pomp and circumstance we've come to expect. Not many highlights and regulation but freshman Noah Short from San Jose, California, blocking a punt and another freshman, Jabril Williams from Joliet, Illinois barely standing bounds to recover it for a touchdown. Eventually tied at 10, they would head to overtime, where the fun began. Very first play, army's Markel Johnson motoring in for the touchdown, so navy just has to equal and they do. Xavier Arline completing his first pass of the game to Maquel Haywood to tie it, but in double overtime. Navy fumbles. So, all army had to do was kick a field goal to win and Junior, Quinn Maretzki, from Punahou, Hawaii does just that. Aloha, a 20-17 win for the army. The corps of cadets storming the field. Valiant effort by navy. But it is army's fifth win in the last seven meetings. We caught up with the black knights after the epic win. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
