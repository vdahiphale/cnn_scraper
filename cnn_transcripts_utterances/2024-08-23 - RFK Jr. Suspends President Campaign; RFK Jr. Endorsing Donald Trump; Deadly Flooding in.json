Kennedy Jr. suspends his presidential campaign and says he's now endorsing Donald Trump. Dozens of people have died and millions have been impacted by heavy rains and floods in India and Bangladesh. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell signals that the time has come to start lowering interest rates. And Swift style, the Taylor Swift exhibition taking visitors through her career with memorabilia and iconic outfits. That conversation and plenty more coming up. But first, new twist in the U.S. presidential race. In the past few hours, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has announced that he's suspending his presidential campaign and will now back Donald Trump. Kennedy, who had been running as an independent candidate, says Trump has asked him to play a role in his administration should he win in November. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR., FORMER U.S. INDEPENDENT PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Last summer, it looked like no candidate was willing to negotiate a quick end to the Ukraine war, to tackle chronic disease epidemic, to protect free speech, our constitutional freedoms, to clean corporate influence out of our government, or to defy the neocons and their agenda of endless military adventurism. But now, one of the two candidates has adopted these issues as his own, to the point where he has asked to enlist me in his administration. I'm speaking, of course, of Donald Trump.

And basically, he frittered some of that away through some odd maneuverings on his part, and strange things came out about him, like the bear cub story. But it's much more than that. Essentially, he was a real candidate because Americans disliked the two old white male candidates who were running for president. They were both unpopular. As long as they were the two candidates, he was going to receive leftover support. Well, one of them, Joe Biden, dropped out. And a very attractive candidate, Kamala Harris, came in. And suddenly. there wasn't any great need for RFK Jr. anymore. He's now down to a minimum of 2 percent in one poll, 5 percent or so in a couple of others. And he's falling like a rock. So, he's not going to be able to transfer much of anything to Trump. Most of those supporters will go their own way. Some will go to Trump. Some will go to Harris. Some will go to one of the other third-party or independent candidates. And some will vote for the couch. They'll sit there and not vote. So, this doesn't amount to much.

She capitalized on it. She was ready for the convention. The convention was terrific. And I've been to a lot of these conventions starting in the '70s. I would rate this as one of the best. And her speech last night, acceptance address for the presidential nomination, was absolutely the best speech she's ever given. So, I'd say she's doing very, very well. And the current polling has her a bit above Trump. It's too early for celebrations. It's too early to conclude anything and it's going to be a very close race.

      "sentences": "Well, a new Israeli proposal regarding one of the key sticking points in these ongoing negotiations isnow on its way to Hamas. This is a proposal regarding Israeli troop presence along that Philadelphi Corridor, that strategic route along the Egypt-Gaza border. And this is significant because this latest proposal would reduce the number of Israeli troops along that corridor and also reduce the number of military positions that the Israeli military would maintain there during the first phase of a ceasefire agreement. And what this shows us is that, first of all, the Israeli prime minister is willing to show at least some flexibility regarding this issue, even as he insists Israeli troops must remain along this corridor. And it also shows us that Egypt seems to think this is a more serious proposal. That's because earlier in the week, the Israeli government submitted a previous proposal regarding the Philadelphi Corridor with a map showing where the Israeli troops would be positioned. And the Egyptian government effectively rejected that, they wouldn't even submit it to Hamas because they said that it was a total nonstarter for these negotiations. But now, Egypt is actually going to submit this latest proposal with the map, the updated map from the Israeli government to Hamas. The question now is whether it will be enough for Hamas to accept and whether it will be enough for Hamas to actually get to the negotiating table. And that is now the hope from the Israeli side, at least, is that with this new proposal, if Hamas is at least willing to negotiate over that, then Hamas might actually attend the next round of negotiations set for Sunday in Cairo, Egypt, where all of the top players will once again assemble. The last time they assembled in Doha, Hamas didn't actually participate in the talks. They met with the mediators after the rounds of negotiation. But this time, there is a hope that they can once again engage in these proximity talks, meaning the Israeli delegation is in one room, the Hamas delegation is in another room, and the Qatari and the Egyptian mediators are going back and forth. One thing is clear, though, the urgency of a ceasefire is being made clear every single day in Gaza as we continue to see as strikes in northern, central, and southern Gaza, but also now a potential breakout of polio. A 10-month-old baby, according to the United Nations, is now paralyzed due to polio. This is the first such case in more than 25 years in Gaza. U.N. officials say a ceasefire is needed to vaccinate the children of Gaza. Jeremy Diamonds, CNN, Tel Aviv. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

It has this dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices. The stable prices part of it is well on its way, the Fed thinks, to getting where it needs to be. That is inflation has cooled quite a bit and is heading in the right direction. Now, the concern is about the labor market. There was a slight uptick in the unemployment rate in the United States, in the most recent report in July. We'll get another report coming out pretty soon in a week or so, for the month of August. And I think that will play a big role in answering that question. How big will the rate cut be? Will it be the normal sized change in rates, which is a quarter point -- quarter percentage point, or might the Fed decide that they have been behind the curve and need to do something a little bit more aggressive, something like a half a percentage point. Markets are mixed on this. It seems like the consensus is still more like, you know, the smaller, more normal increase -- excuse me, decrease in interest rates.

They are supposedto do whatever they think is right for the long-term health of the economy regardless of what the political impacts will be. And I think it would be wise if Kamala Harris continues to respect that independence and say, she will not interfere with it. That doesn't mean that Donald Trump won't proclaim falsely, in my view, that the Fed is cutting rates precisely to do what you say, to help Kamala Harris. I don't think that's what this is about. And again, the reason why the Fed is contemplating rate cuts is because they want to keep the job market on track. They don't want things to, you know, cool further to potentially have the unemployment rate go up, or heaven forbid, have net job losses. So, the fact that they're cutting rates, you know, is good I guess if you're borrowing, but it also implies that there is some underlying concern about the health of the economy, which would of course not be good for Kamala Harris, given that she represents the current administration as well.",

But I think there are concerns because one of the things that's written out in the, you know, agreement to hire him is that there's also the ability to set up an office in Southern California closer to where he lives, having some of the workers there. So, I think it does beg the question, you know, Starbucks is really synonymous with Seattle. I don't ever think that they will move. But let's remember, Chipotle was a company that was based in Denver. Brian Niccol then moved it to Southern California. So, he clearly loves where he lives.

Police are not ruling out terrorism and say the attacker is on the run and a manhunt is underway. The attack occurred at an event to celebrate the 650th anniversary of the city's founding. We are expecting more information on that soon. Right now, we are hearing from the mayor of that town, Tim Kurzbach, who expressed his sadness over the stabbing. Saying, this evening, all of us in Solingen, are experiencing shock, horror, and great sadness. We all wanted to celebrate our city's anniversary together and now, we have to mourn the dead and injured. It tears my heart apart that there was an attack in our city and I have tears in my eyes when I think of those we have lost. I pray for all those who are still fighting for their lives.

It's also wonderful to have the dress from \"Willow,\" the Evermore Era, and we've juxtaposed that within our paintings gallery. Something that I've noticed fans are really, really touched by is the cardigan. The cardigan moment feels pretty epic. We've kind of created the exhibit so it feels like Taylor's just left the room. So, the cardigan is presented on a piano stool with a piano installation. And you hear the music, you see the cardigan, that's pretty powerful. But I think people are also fascinated to see some of her red carpet looks that she has become so iconic for. So, whether that's the Oscar de la Renta dress from the Era's premiere or the amazing highly sequined Oscar de la Renta dress from the Midnight's announcement. So, we've got different moments of her career. We've got her stage costumes, which are brilliant. The Reputation stadium tour, amazing black and gold bejeweled costumes. And that moment alongside the microphone. But the cowboy boots seemed to be really inspiring fans too. So, wonderful to be able to kind of present Taylor's cowboy boots from 2006, 2007 alongside her guitar. Because it was really important in this installation, not just to show her looks, but to show her creative process. So, to bring the instruments, to bring the act of performance, to bring the storyboards, to bring the whole kind of picture to her sort of multi-faceted career.",

Friday, Leverkusen going to Monchengladbach and a dream start for the champs, how about this, from Granit Xhaka there putting them ahead. Absolutely thunderbolt of a strike. Shortly before the break, that lead is double. It's the talented youngster, Florian Wirtz, there with a swish of his left foot making it 2-nil. M'gladbach trying to play spoiler. And they make things interesting, they get one back and then, five minutes from time, Tim Kleindienst levelling at two apiece, but Leverkusen in the 11th minute of stoppage time, Lynda. It's a penalty, Wirtz sees his initial effort saved, then he tucks it away on the rebound. 3-2, the final. It is three more points in the bag for them already. Here's a look at some other key opening weekend fixes in Germany. We got Borussia Dortmund. They got to the Champions League final last season. They host Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday.
