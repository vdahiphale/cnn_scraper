Earlier, cheering crowds holding Russian flags and chanting welcome Putin line Kim Il Sung Square for a lavish ceremony. It's the Russian leader's first visit to North Korea in 24 years, building on the growing partnership between the two countries. TASS also reports that Kim expressed his support and solidarity for Russia's military operation in Ukraine. So, let's go live out to CNN's Ivan Watson, who's following developments for us from Hong Kong. Good to see you again, Ivan. So, what is the latest on Vladimir Putin's visit to North Korea? And of course, what is likely to come out of his upcoming meeting with Kim Jong-un?",

In the face-to-face meeting, we've picked up some lines there. I think one that jumps out is hearing the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un basically asserting his government support for, as he put it, Russia's special military operation in Ukraine. Just a full throated kind of show of support for Vladimir Putin's full scale invasion of Ukraine more than two years ago, and that has been echoed by the Kremlin and by Putin himself, who have said thank you multiple times to Pyongyang for its support when it comes to this ongoing war in Ukraine. And if you look at it, it is that war that has, in many ways, pushed Putin into Kim Jong-un's embrace as Putin was isolated from his traditional trading partners in Europe and isolated by sanctions in the West. He has had to look elsewhere, not only for trade, but also we're hearing for weapons. It is the White House that accuses the White House and South Korea's government that accused North Korea of supplying Vladimir Putin's military with ammunition that is being used allegedly on the battlefields in Ukraine. That's an accusation that the North Korean government denies. But that is one of the areas where we're looking closely to see what kind of potential further cooperation could be developed between these two leaders during this meeting.",

The video appears to show sites in highly populated Israeli cities close to the Lebanese border, hinting that Hezbollah could strike major targets there. [02:05:04] Now, this comes after months of cross border strikes between Hezbollah and Israel since the October 7th Hamas attacks and Israel's military campaign in Gaza, but the attacks have ramped up this past week, after an Israeli strike killed a high ranking Hezbollah commander in Lebanon. Israel says it's preparing for the possibility of an offensive in Lebanon if diplomatic efforts to reduce hostilities with Hezbollah fail. America's top diplomat is confirming an ongoing pause of a heavy bomb shipment to Israel as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tries to ramp up pressure on the U.S. Antony Blinken says the Biden administration is reviewing the 2,000 pound bombs shipment that was paused last month over concerns they may be used in densely populated areas in Gaza. In a video message, Netanyahu says it's, \"inconceivable,\" the U.S. has been withholding weapons and ammunitions from Israel, and added that Blinken had assured him the restrictions would be lifted, but Blinken declined to say if he made such a promise. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: I'm not going to -- I'm not going to talk about what we said in diplomatic conversations.

There should be a little bit better wind and weather conditions as the day progresses.
