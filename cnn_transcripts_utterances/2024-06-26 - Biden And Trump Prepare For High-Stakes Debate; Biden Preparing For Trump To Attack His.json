There's no clear leader in our latest poll of polls, and there's been no shortage of dissatisfaction for months now with both candidates.Tomorrow night will be a chance for them to reach millions of voters at once. In the hour ahead, we're going to take a look at how they've been preparing for the moment. We'll explore the different challenges they face and the unique problem that incumbents have had during their first debates. First though, CNN's MJ Lee and Kristen Holmes with the latest from inside both campaigns. MJ, what more are you learning about what President Biden wants to accomplish tomorrow night?",

      "sentences": "Well, Anderson, if you put all of the policy issues aside for a second, there's one specific category of incoming from Donald Trump that the President is preparing for and bracing for, and that is personal insults that are directed not only at the President, but members of his family as well.I'm told by one Biden advisor that at these debate prep sessions at Camp David in recent days, something that the President has been readying for are the potential insults and attacks that are thrown his way aimed at specific members of his family. And this advisor wouldn't elaborate. This is obviously a very sensitive issue. But something that is, of course, still very fresh for the Biden family is the news from earlier this month that his son, Hunter Biden, was convicted on three separate felony gun charges, a saga that has been incredibly, deeply painful for the entire Biden family. And what is incredible is that the President has already experienced Donald Trump going after his son, Hunter Biden. This was back in the September 2020 debate when President Trump said that Hunter Biden had been dishonorably discharged for using cocaine from the military. To be clear, he was administratively discharged, which is different. He also mocked Hunter Biden, if you'll recall, saying he couldn't get a job until President Biden had become vice president. So the defense, if you also remember, that President Biden gave at the time saying, look, yes, like a lot of American families, our family is one that has dealt with the problem of addiction. But I'm proud of my son and I love my son. Aides had said at the time that that ended up being actually one of the most resonant moments coming out of the debate. But I think all of this just goes to show the Biden team's broader strategy of trying to prepare for anything and everything that Donald Trump might throw his way Thursday night.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Anderson, we've actually heard Donald Trump, even as recently as last week, say that he believes Hunter Biden and his legal issues were actually going to come up in the debate. And likely he means because he would bring them up. We know this is something that he often brings up at rallies, at various events, and even with donors talking about Hunter Biden, talking about his legal issues, linking it back to President Joe Biden.I have talked to a number of people in Trump's orbit who are hoping that he stays away from this line of attacks. They understand that Donald Trump himself can be increasingly nasty, that he tends to go very, very personal. Obviously, President Biden, from MJ's reporting, is preparing for that. But what they are hoping he does is stays away from that and instead focuses just on their messaging. They want Donald Trump to show up at the debate on Thursday and focus on a contrast between his former administration and that of Joe Biden's, particularly when it comes to the economy and inflation, crime and immigration. If you look at all the recent polling, that's what they're going off. It shows that Donald Trump is ahead with voters on those issues. They don't want him to dive into personal attacks nonstop. Now, obviously, a lot is going to depend on what happens on that stage Thursday. They cannot control that. But what they are hoping and telling him to do, that his best options are to stay on message and focus on the issues.",

The Trump base would absolutely love it. He has the Trump base, right? If Donald Trump steps on that stage worried about the Trump voters, you know, he's already lost. He doesn't have to worry about them. He has them. That's why he has a slight lead in this race.So what is the point you're going to make about Hunter Biden that's going to address any of your weaknesses or fortify your strengths, right? He is ahead in polling right now, on the economy and on immigration. What can he say about these issues to talk to the American people to say, you want me, not him. You've had three and a half years of him. You want me. He has these giant weaknesses. He needs to help. In this stage, these two can talk about a lot better than I can. It's changing by the minute, becoming a more diverse, more suburban, more college educated state. That's Donald Trump's kryptonite. That's why he lost Georgia in 2020. Because they - does he have the character? What about January 6th? What's your commitment to democracy? That's what they want to hear him talk about. They want to see if he's learned any lessons. They don't want to hear him talk about Hunter Biden. And the President has a giant challenge. He's an incumbent president in a country that's very unhappy with the direction we are heading. So number one, he has to put on a vigorous performance to quiet any doubts about his age or at least turn the volume down on those doubts about his age. But I would argue, most importantly from my travels, he has to look the American people in the eye and talk about cost of living in a way that is relevant to them. I say cost of living, not inflation, because people are talking about rent. They're talking about, my house is worth a lot more money than when I bought it. And I actually refinanced at a good rate. I'm great. But I've had a kid or two since then and I want to buy a bigger house, but I can't. Because all the prices have gone up and the mortgage rates have gone up. Groceries are still high. Even a lot of Biden supporters complain about supermarket sticker shock. He sometimes gets defensive and says the numbers are good. The numbers are better. The economy is great. That's the wrong strategy. People don't feel that. So I - they should focus on fortifying their strengths and addressing they both have glaring weaknesses. Hunter Biden, to me, 60 voters I've talked to in 10 states, they would view it as a waste of time.",

How can President Biden appeal to more people like you?REP. JEFF DUNCAN (R-SC): Well, first of all, welcome to Georgia, the home of the safest, fairest, the most legal elections in the country. We can prove it and we have proved it. And the answer to that question is Donald Trump's in a box. Forty five percent of this country loves to hear what he says. But it's appalling to the rest of the country. There's really no opportunity for him to build a bridge to that 10 percent in the middle that actually are paying attention, that care, that are trying to come to grips as a Republican, lifelong Republican. They're trying to come to grips with showing up and vote for a Democrat for the first time.   I think Joe Biden has a better opportunity to do that. As John talked about this economy, this is the tale of two stories. Some people wake up and this is the worst economy they could possibly imagine trying to afford a house or rent or groceries. Some folks are waking up and this is a golden time for them. Their 401Ks are overflowing, their houses, their jobs are secure. I think President Biden has to extend an olive branch to those folks in the middle and talk with a very high articulate voice as to where the economy - because if you're one of those folks sitting on a bunch of assets, you don't want somebody to rip the scab off really quickly and change the deflection.

First, Biden is older, you can see it. And in his debate prep, he may get overwhelmed. Reagan in 1984 was overwhelmed by his debate advisers and at one point, he even said to David Stockman who was playing Walter Mondale, will you shut up, which is what -- remember, what Biden said to Trump in 2020. So, he might get overwhelmed. Another thing is Trump has been more disciplined, if you can believe it, in this campaign. In 2020, he didn't listen to his debate advisers. And then third is there is a history of incumbent presidents being cocky in their first debate and losing the first debate. It has happened to Obama in 2012, Reagan in 1984, Ford in 1976, Carter in 1980. It's a recurrent thing. And sometimes, the presidents are just not ready to go mix it up with someone the first time.",

How critical, I mean, do you think this debate is for a lot of those undecided voters?KING (on camera): I think it's enormously important because they're kind of stuck. Lieutenant Governor Duncan made the point earlier, a lot of people don't like either one. There are a lot of people who are soft Biden or soft Trump, a lot of people who are still looking around at the third-party candidates. So let me start with the president. Young voters, Black voters, Hispanic voters, those are the biggest cracks in his coalition. He needs to do something. You hear it, especially when you talk to the young voters, on our Vegas trip from Latino voters. They want to hear the president speak in a way relevant to them, not talk like a Washington politician. And then if he can shore up the Democratic coalition, then he can reach out to those Republicans like Linda Rooney. She said she cannot forgive Trump for January 6th, but she might vote for him because she's a Republican by DNA and it's really hard to vote -- to re-elect a Democratic president. For Trump, I think it's really how we comports himself because there are a whole lot of Republicans, even Republicans Haley voters, other Republicans who voted for Biden in 2020, who again don't want to vote to re-elect Biden. They're Republicans; they want to be Republicans. They want the lower taxes; they want -- they think Trump would close the border, but they can't stand the chaos of Trump. And so, on the debate stage, can he hold himself together? I am fascinated to hear from them after tomorrow night, and I'm fascinated to see, do support for the third-party candidates go down after this debate? Do people feel more comfortable with their choices, or does it go back up? If it started -- if the third-party numbers start to go up again, this race gets even more and more complicated. Right now, it's static, if look at the polling, mostly static. But just beneath that, Anderson, COVID hangover, inflation concerns, there is so much volatility just below the surface. I think the debate might pull that up.",
