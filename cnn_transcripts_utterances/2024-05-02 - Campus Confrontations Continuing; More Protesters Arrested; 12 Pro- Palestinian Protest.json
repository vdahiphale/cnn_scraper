Twelve pro-Palestinian protesters are arrested in Oregon after police arrest more than 100 at UCLA. Donald Trump claims he's not allowed to testify at his hush money trial as the court hears his former fixer Michael Cohen had nearly 40,000 contacts in one phone. And Apple announces its largest ever share buyback as iPhone sales decline in China. All that and much more, coming up. But first, the latest on those college protests across the U.S. In Oregon, police cleared the library at Portland State University, arresting 12 people. Authorities say only four of them are students. Pro-Palestinian protesters have been occupying that building since Monday. In California, a cleanup is underway at UCLA's campus where police broke up an encampment and made more than 130 arrests. The total number of people arrested on college campuses nationwide since mid-April has now surpassed 2,000. Our Stephanie Elam is live for us at UCLA now. And so, Stephanie, this afternoon we saw that encampment was being pulled apart, cleaned up after some pretty dramatic scenes this morning when police turned up. What do we know about those that have been arrested?",

And I should notethat they were given several warnings that law enforcement was going to move into that camp and that they were going to break it up. And even when they did start to do it around 3:00 a.m. local. They moved in, they backed off, and then they moved in again. So, this was something that had given people plenty of time to leave if they wanted to. But where I'm standing right now is right in front of where the encampment was. I'm going to step out of the shot so that you can see what it looks like now. And we do have an update from Los Angeles PD saying that actually it was more than 130 people that were arrested. It was 210 people who were arrested after all of this this morning. And just look at how quickly they have cleaned this up here on the campus. I mean, there were tents that were just thrown about earlier. There was debris. There were water bottles. There was all sorts of refuse. They've come in here with a massive crew of people to come in here and clean it up. The chancellor is saying that while they wanted to have -- let their students have free speech, ultimately, it became a focal point and just of serious violence. And so, that was a huge disruption to class, to the students and ultimately, they had to make the decision to bring it down here. I can tell you where I'm standing, there's a barricade here blocking off from where they've been working. And there's another barricade behind us where they are keeping people off the grass except for the media here. So, really a much different energy on campus now, now that they've separated this out so that they could clean this all up.",

We were there to bear witness to this violence and to be able to talk about it today so that the decision makers at UCLA, at the University of California, and in the City of Los Angeles can be held accountable for what happened over the last two nights, which was to not keep our students safe and to interrupt our educational mission, which the students were carrying on in their conversations about the war in Gaza and our role in that -- at UCLA.",

And I think that the UCLA administration needs to recognize that. And they also need to recognize that our students have the right to talk about ideas on our campus, and they need to provide them immediately with a promise of amnesty of any charges and to not put them through student administrative procedures. And just to be crystal clear, students should not face suspension or other charges. I was just walking around the quad this afternoon and I think a lot of people have been talking about the graffiti there. And you can see - - I have a video from just a few minutes ago of the power washing of that graffiti and it's almost all gone now. And so, really no reason to charge these students who were simply there talking about one of the most important issues of our time which is the war in Gaza and the tens of thousands of deaths that are taking place there, important in their view with complicity from the U.S. government and even our campus here at UCLA.",

That could be detrimental to his political prospects. So, Trump, who was out on a campaign trail on a day off court yesterday, has every reason to try and create as much noise around this as he can. But this fits into his core political strategy, which is to say that Biden is old, he's weak, he doesn't know how to control the country, and what the United States need is a strong man.

One essence that they were really trying to underscore here throughout the cross-examination was to suggest that Davidson was a shady lawyer who was trying to extort Donald Trump.

SCANNELL (voice-over):  Keith Davidson, back on the stand on day 10 of Trump's trial, cross-examined by Trump's attorney who attempted to discredit Davidson by painting him as a shady lawyer. Meanwhile, prosecutors tried to show how Davidson's arrangement with a tabloid and Trump's ex-lawyer Michael Cohen to kill two bombshell stories about Trump's alleged affairs directly impacted the 2016 election. Trump denies both affairs. In his testimony, Davidson recalled texting National Enquirer editor Dylan Howard on election night in 2016, as results came in in favor of Trump. Davidson said he texts Howard, what have we done? Oh, my God, Howard replied. Davidson testified, there was an understanding that our efforts may have in some way -- strike that -- our activities may have in some way assisted the presidential campaign of Donald Trump. Prosecutors played an audio recording of Cohen saying Trump hates that they paid off adult film star Stormy Daniels. Cohen was heard saying, I can't even tell you how many times he said to me, I hate the fact that we did it. And my comment to him was, but every person that you've spoken to tells you it was the right move. The payment and conspiracy of Trump's involvement in Daniel's hush money deal is the crux of the prosecution's case. Prosecutors also questioned Davidson about Daniel sitting down with Jimmy Kimmel in January 2018. Before the interview, Daniels and her attorney released a statement denying an alleged affair with Trump. But hours later, she told Kimmel it didn't look like her signature.",

The deal between Karen McDougal, ofcourse, the Playboy model, in addition to Stormy Daniels. And the interaction with Michael Cohen, of course. Michael Cohen being Donald Trump's fixer. And so, I think it was very important to lay out the scheme. Remember the prosecution's theory. It's about a cover-up according to the prosecution, right? And about the fact that it's a conspiracy. And so, to the extent that this witness laid out the interaction with Michael Cohen, laid out the deals that he engaged in, laid out the level of, really, frustration that Michael Cohen -- he was having with Michael Cohen in terms of getting this done, I thought that was effective. The issue though, Lynda, is going to be whether it ultimately can be tied into Trump, right? From a cross-examination perspective with the defense was saying, hey, great, you dealt with, right, in substance. They cross- examined him, but just in boiling it down, what they were saying was, OK, that's nice. You dealt with Mr. Cohen. You had a deal with Mr. Cohen. You had interactions with the with Mr. Cohen. You certainly had text messages and exchanges. What interaction did you have with Trump again? Oh, nothing. And so, that's what they are attempting to do. The Trump team needs to distance him, that is Michael Cohen, from Mr. Trump. Maybe he was acting on his own volition. Maybe he was doing this because of respect for his boss, that is Michael Cohen's respect for Donald Trump. Maybe he thought that Donald Trump would just be pleased and happy that he was doing this. But you have to tie in Donald Trump himself in order to get the conviction. And so that's why, I think, the defense was really going. Whether it succeeded will be a jury determination.

So, when he says testify, does he mean he can't speak to the public regarding certain things? He certainly can. He just can't violate the specific provisions of the gag order, which, by the way, also, Lynda, includes staying away from attacking the jury. And so, that is a misrepresentation. Last point. Remember, this is in the context of a presidential election. So, you're going to come out and say everything's going great. Very pleased with my team. Nothing to see here. The fact that I'm here is ridiculous. You have to do that. There's a political imperative and there's a legal imperative. The one that counts is going to be what the jury says, that's the legal part.

The U.S. president has now addressed the campus unrest gripping the UnitedStates, saying that the right to free speech and the rule of law must be upheld. Some of the most intense scenes Thursday were at UCLA, where police moved in to clear a pro-Palestinian encampment. More than 100 people were arrested. A cleanup operation is underway there. The situation on campuses across the country remains deeply strained. And in a rare breakthrough, Brown University has reached an agreement with student protesters. The school says it will consider whether to divest from companies that \"facilitate\" the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory. In return, demonstrators agreed to dismantle their encampments at Brown. Divestment has been a big demand for many protesters across the U.S. A vote at Brown University is expected in October after talks with students and advisers.

Seconds later, the missile hits the street below, landing in the middle of the road, just a few feet away from the foosball table where Shahed and her friends were playing that day, delivering certain death. Against all odds, these children have returned to play at the very same foosball table, including some of Shahed's friends. I miss her a lot, Sama says, wearing a necklace Shahed made her. She says she was nearly killed with her friend, going home moments before the strike to drink water. Others were not as lucky.

Services, not a surprise at all driven by iCloud, driven by growth in Apple TV Plus, and driven by payment services. All those things help sort of float it up. But this is increasingly Apple's business, you know, relying on services to drive growth while other things are sort of pulling back. One thing that was really interesting that Tim Cook said during the earnings call afterwards was he was really touting what's about to happen next week. So, he's looking forward. You know, next week is supposed to be what we believe is the iPad launch, where you have a number of new iPads that may show up on Tuesday of next week.
