What tends to happen when someone can't work what happened with Nazanin when she came out, it takes a long time to feel safe. Again, the Iranian regime is very cruel, and does some very terrible things to mess with your hand as well as with your body. And those don't magically go away. And it takes a long time to decompress and to let go of the traumas, and we still get them. The nightmares will continue for a long time. People don't like to talk about it, but they're there.

First, let me be very clear that this process and the engagements necessary to bring it about the freedom ofthese unjustly detained Americans has always been a separate track in our engagement or, for that matter, lack of engagement with Iran. So irrespective of what was happening, or not happening, for example, in pursuing the effort to return to the nuclear agreement, we've been focused on working independently to bring these Americans home. So it doesn't speak to anything else in the relationship. We continue to be determined to take whatever step is necessary to deal with actions by Iran and a whole host of areas that are profoundly objectionable, and that many other countries find objectionable. At the same time, when it comes to perhaps the number one issue of concern, which is Iran's nuclear program, we continue to believe that diplomacy is the best way to get a sustainable effective result, one that we had previously with the Iran nuclear agreement. And we'll continue to see if there are opportunities for that in this moment. We're not engaged on that. But we'll see in the future if there are opportunities. But President Biden has also been very clear that one way or another, he's committed to ensuring that Iran never acquired nuclear weapons.",

Having said that, as I mentioned, two countries, in particular, played an absolutely vital role in helping to get us to this day, and that is Amman and Qatar. As for the other members of the GCC, I've had occasion over the past many months to talk to them about the relationship with Iran, which is a challenge for each and every one of them, including for us. And to discuss in that context, some of the efforts that we were making to bring home our wrongfully detained Americans. And again, I don't want to speak for them. But I think everyone is supportive of that, of that effort. With regard to the resources, I think it's very important to be very clear about exactly what this involved. As you know, this involves the access by Iran to its own money, money that had accumulated in Korean bank as the result of oil sales that Iran made, which were lawful at the time those sales were made. And from day one, our sanctions have clearly and indeed, always exempt the use of resources for humanitarian purposes, because our aim is not to harm the Iranian people. Our problem, our profound problem is with the Iranian regime. So from day one, these Iranian monies that were in a Korean bank have always been available to Iran to use for humanitarian purposes. But for a lot of technical reasons, they weren't able to access those funds where they were. So the funds were moved to another bank, where we have absolute oversight of how they're used, and they can only be used for humanitarian purposes. And we have absolute confidence in the process and the system that's been set up. By the way, the previous administration, administration prior to ours had set up a similar mechanism that was never used, but exactly for these kinds of purposes. So we're very confident that the funds the Iranian funds that had been made more easily available to Iran as a result of the actions that we've taken will be used exclusively for humanitarian purposes. And we have the means and mechanisms to make sure that that happens.",

And he said that the Biden Administration has worked to free 30 Americans wrongfully detained during the course of this administration. And we also heard earlier that the Biden Administration will issue new sanctions following the release of those Americans targeting Iran's military of intelligence as well as Iran's Former President Ahmadinejad. Now, just before Antony Blinken spoke, I was speaking to Richard Ratcliffe. This is the husband of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who was held in prison in Iran for some six years to get his perspective on the release of these prisoners today. He joins us again now, Richard, thanks so much for standing by for us, we appreciate it. We did hear the U.S. Secretary of State allude to other Americans wrongfully detained.

But after his father had become a hostage, and he was shown videos of his father being taken into custody in the airport, a couple of weeks later, they came in and told him that his father had died of a heart attack.

The point that the United States will be, you know, reacting to this agreement by imposing further sanctions against some Iranian officials indicates and suggests that the Iran and U.S. problems cannot go overnight and just walk by one click.

However, let's not forget that this can contribute to a process where a positive atmosphere can be created. In order to push other let's say this further discussions on other issues, including the nuclear negotiations, as well as lifting Iran sanctions.
