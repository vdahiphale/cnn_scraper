You know, any time you see a major bank down by that much in a single day, it is, of course, very concerning.PacWest confirming that it's exploring all options, that is basically code for they need some help right now. Importantly, though, PacWest, they say that they have not experienced any, quote, \"out-of-the ordinary deposit flows\" after the failure of First Republic. But this is not just about PacWest. Another regional bank, Western Alliance down sharply as well today after the \"Financial Times\" reported that it, too, is up -- potentially up for sale. Western Alliance, though, pushing back very strongly, saying this is categorically false, they are not exploring a sale. All of this weighing on the broader stock market. We see U.S. stocks down again several days in a row at this point. U.S. officials, they are stressing that the banking system is sound. We heard that from Jerome Powell just yesterday. It's important, Jim, to emphasize there's a difference between what's happening with bank stocks and banks deposits. Deposits, according to officials, have stabilized. Stocks not so much.",

And this is not a full-blown financial meltdown.But there are clearly major weaknesses in parts of the banking system. And this is happening, in large part, because the Federal Reserve spiked interest rates to try to get inflation under control. History shows that when they do that, something tends to break, and we have seen something break in the banking system. But here's why I think this is really important. The risk is a credit crunch that really slows the economy. Because the more nervous bankers are, the less likely they are to lend to all of us. And that can have a real impact on the economy.",

Shocking revelation from a government investigation and how the fast-food giant is responding. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [13:45:24] DEAN: Homeland Security Chief Alejandro Mayorkas is on the U.S.-Mexico border today to oversee preparations for the end of Title 42. You'll remember that is the public health policy that allowed officials to turn away certain migrants from the U.S. during the coronavirus pandemic. It's going to end a week from today. As a result, the government is anticipating a major surge in border crossings. President Biden has already deployed 1,500 troops to assist federal agents. And just yesterday, two busloads of migrants from Texas were dropped off in New York City. Local officials say the city has been averaging roughly 200 arrivals a day. And it's running out of space to house them. More than 50,000 migrants have arrived in New York since last spring. CNN White House reporter, Priscilla Alvarez, is here. Priscilla, there are some preparations under way. Walk us through what those are.",

In the long term, setting up a regional processing center, recognizing that migrants continue to traverse up to the U.S. southern border. So setting up centers where they can apply to come to the United States instead of coming all the way up to the border. But still, officials I've spoken with and even Homeland Security secretary Alejandro Mayorkas recognizes that this is a challenge. So today, he is observing that in south Texas. So to give you a bit of a sense of what's happening, let me tick through some numbers. A Homeland Security official I spoke with said that, as of Wednesday, there were over 5,000 migrants in custody in just this portion of the border. And they are also dealing with around 2,000 daily encounters. What do these numbers mean? They are already under strain. The numbers are creeping up, even though we're days away from this Covid-era restriction ending. And it's already causing challenges for each of -- each part of the sector. That is what Mayorkas will see. He's also going to review CBP and ICE operations as well as work with and talk with the work force on the ground. So all of that happening as we speak and as they continue to see these numbers creep up.",
