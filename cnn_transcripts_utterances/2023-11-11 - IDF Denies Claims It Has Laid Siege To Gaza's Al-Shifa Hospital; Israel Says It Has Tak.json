      "sentences": "Hey everyone, thanks for joining me. I'm Omar Jimenez, sitting in for Fredricka Whitfield. We've got a lot to get to. We're going to start with Israel's war against Hamas. Hospitals in Gaza are facing a critical situation amid growing calls for an end to the bloodshed.The IDF says fighting is intensifying across the enclave, including near one major medical center. Today, the IDF denied claims by a senior official at the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza that the Al- Shifa hospital is under siege and surrounded on all sides by Israeli forces. The Red Cross says that Gaza's health care system has passed the point of no return. Many of Gaza's hospitals are now out of service amid Israel's ongoing military operations. And earlier today, Israel opened another evacuation corridor for civilians to move south. Meanwhile, in an emergency summit in Saudi Arabia, Arab and Islamic leaders today demanded a complete ceasefire. Opposition to the war is also being expressed on streets around the globe. Pro-Palestinian protests were held today in London, Brussels, Paris, and even near President Biden's home in Delaware. We have a team of reporters covering all of these developments. Ben Wedeman is in southern Lebanon, but let's begin with Oren Liebermann, who's live in Israel near the Gaza border. Oren, what are you hearing about the situation on the ground there?",

But the northern border, although certainly not the sort of fighting we're seeing here, there has been constant back and forth, constant sort of lower level of conflict, as one official described it to me, somewhere between a simmer and a boil over the course of the past several days. And that continued into today with fire coming from Lebanon and Israeli fire going back across into Lebanon. At the same time, the IDF is also watching for long range strikes coming -- strikes from the Houthis in Yemen.In fact, they intercepted an incoming projectile with the Arrow 3, that's their most advanced long range air defense system. That was used operationally for the first time within the last 24 to 48 hours or so. So Israel essentially looking at combat of different levels on multiple fronts here.",

It's Hezbollah's Martyr's Day commemoration. So that was -- he was really addressing a wider audience than just the summit.But what he did say is that the exchanges between Israel and Hezbollah are becoming more intense and they're reaching further into one another's territory. During this speech, he mentioned that Hezbollah for the first time is using attack drones to strike deeper into Israel. And they're also using an Iranian-designed Burkan missile, which is a short-range ballistic missile with a payload of 500 kilograms. That's just over half a ton. And in fact, Hezbollah put out video of that strike using the Burkan missile. And it is massive. Right on the border, they struck about a week ago. In addition to that, of course, he's warning the Americans that they've got to put more pressure on Israel to end its war on Gaza. He said that if the Americans, for instance, and he's referring to multiple attacks by pro-Iranian militias on U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria, he said that if the Americans want to avoid that sort of attack, if they want to avoid a regional war, they have to force Israel to stop its war on Gaza. Now, in terms of the actual action, just adding to what Oren was saying just a moment ago, what we have seen today is some pretty intense exchanges between Hezbollah and Israel, perhaps 30 individual incidents. In addition to that, according to the Lebanese official news agency, there was an Israeli drone strike on a truck near the town of Zahrani. That's 40 kilometers or 25 miles north of the border with Israel. It represents the deepest strike of its kind inside Lebanon since the 2006 war between Hezbollah and Israel. And this afternoon, the Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, commenting on the fighting on the border with Lebanon, made a rather ominous warning. He said, what we're doing in Gaza, we can also do in Beirut. Omar.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, it was a sizable protest, Omar. Hundreds of people, Palestinian protesters, getting very close to the President's house. They have dissipated mostly now, and the President arrived back at his home. He did not drive past them in any way. So we didn't necessarily see them firsthand. But it does mirror what the President has been seeing over the last couple of weeks, protests near an event he held in Illinois this week. He has been interrupted during a couple of his speeches by people calling for a ceasefire, and it does reflect this anger among a certain portion of the American population at how he is handling this conflict and this dissent is growing overseas as well.For example, we heard today from the French President Emmanuel Macron saying that Israel's bombing of women and children has no justification in saying that a ceasefire would benefit Israel and calling on leaders, including in the United States, to join him in that call. We also saw this week a majority of the Democratic caucus in the Senate writing to the White House asking for more information about the $14 billion request that President Biden has made for emergency military assistance for Israel and asking for guarantees that Israel would take steps to mitigate civilian casualties. And so all of this is applying pressure on President Biden on his position on Israel. Of course, he has to shoulder to shoulder with Israel throughout this defending its right to defend itself, saying that it, in fact, has a responsibility to go after Hamas. But at the same time you do hear the shift in tone, for example, from the top diplomat Antony Blinken saying that far too many Palestinians have died and saying much more needs to be done to protect civilian lives. What President Biden has been doing is applying pressure on the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to enact what they call humanitarian pauses. And the White House did say this week that Israel had agreed to four-hour pauses each day to allow aid to flow in and allow civilians who want to flee to get out. But when President Biden was asked about this this week, he did say that he had hoped that Netanyahu might have agreed to that a little bit sooner. Omar.",

There was national polling from Quinnipiac University last week in which Democrats were divided basically 50-50 over whether they supported the military aid to Israel as compared to three quarters of Democrats supporting aid to Ukraine.Now, part of it is that there are not a lot of Democratic leaders who have a lot of trust in the instincts of the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who has identified as overtly with the Republican Party, as any foreign leader has identified with any political party in the U.S. in my lifetime. So there are a lot of cross pressures on President Biden here. But it is worth noting that his approval rating among voters for handling this, while not great, is better than his approval rating on almost any other issue. I mean, of course, that he's trying to set a basically supporting Israel, but putting up some yellow light, some warning signs about not, you know, don't -- don't proceed past this line. That's what they're trying to hold to, their enormous pressures from the left and the right from that course that he's trying to set.",

That there are lots of Americans who are unhappy about the economy, who are disenchanted with Biden's performance, and a majority, significant majority, consistently say in polls that they are worried that he is too old to execute the responsibility to the presidency for another term.But what the election of 2023 showed us, which is pretty much the same thing the election of 2022 showed us, which is that there is another side of the ledger. And that is when Democrats can run campaigns that focus on what Republicans, Trump-era Republicans, would do with power, there are a critical slice of voters who are disappointed in Biden, unhappy about the economy, and still will vote for Democrats because they don't want to empower Republicans to do what they want. And we saw this most clearly in Virginia, which I thought was the most revealing result this week. Because Biden's approval there, even though he won the state, is under 50. Voters in polls gave Republicans double-digit advantages on the economy and crime, similar to what we've seen nationally, real kitchen table issues. And yet Glenn Youngkin, the Republican governor, failed in his goal to unify control of the legislature, largely because there were too many voters, particularly in big suburbs outside of, in Northern Virginia and outside of Richmond, who did not want to go along with the Republican cultural agenda on abortion and other issues. And if there is a path to reelection for Joe Biden, that is exactly what it looks like on those issues in those places.",

Well, look, there are questions about whether he would have wonreelection to begin with, whether he stayed in the race. But no question it would make it harder for Democrats to hold on to the Senate. Manchin also hinted he may be open to a third party run for president, at least just based on actions he's done. Should Biden be worried about a Manchin presidential run?

I mean, one of the macro trends of modern American politics is it's become virtually impossible for either party to win Senate seats in states that usually vote the other way for president.You know, there are 25 states that voted for Joe Biden in 2020. Democrats now have 48 of their 50 Senate seats. There are 25 states that voted for Trump. Republicans hold 47 of their 50 Senate seats. And the only three that Democrats hold are all up in 2024. Joe Manchin was one of those three, always I thought the one most likely to lose the Democrats. Hopes of holding the Senate are largely -- will largely pivot on whether the other two last remaining Democrats in Trump's seats can hold their seats, which are Sherrod Brown in Ohio and Jon Tester in Montana. You know, in the last two presidential elections, 2016 and 2020, there is literally one senator over those two cycles who won in a state that voted the other way for president. And, you know, since about half the country leans toward blue and leans red in presidential years, what this means is that we have a Senate that is now always on the knife's edge, Omar. It has become almost impossible for either side to get a big majority that can last for more than a few cycles.",

But the big picture here is this is a non-starter in the Democratic-controlled Senate who doesn't want to take up government funding in this way. But what we now see based on what Johnson just told his colleagues is that he is embracing what the right wing of his conference wanted and not going ahead with what the more moderates wanted.
