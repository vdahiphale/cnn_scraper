Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. It's been a week since Ukraine launched its surprise incursion into Russia. President Zelenskyy's military chief says their troops now control about a thousand square kilometers of Russian territory, and Russian authorities say they have evacuated around 120,000 civilians. Today, President Vladimir Putin again framed this as a battle of survival against the west, saying that Kyiv's move is a negotiating tactic. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  It appears that the enemy with the help of the western masters is fulfilling their will, and the west is fighting us with the hands of the Ukrainians. So, it looks like the enemy seeks to improve its negotiating positions in the future. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And now, they're paying the price, they're paying the consequence. And -- but I would also add, just as we saw last year with the Prigozhin mutiny, Putin will respond as decisively as he can to push the Ukrainians out.

And the thought occurred to me that this was a position for a variety of reasons that I might -- I would like to assume. And I've been a lifelong Russell file. And so, it was a way for me in one way to get off the hot seat as deputy secretary of state. And I know that saying moving to Moscow is not what people would think of as getting off the hot seat, but I explain in the book why I wanted to do it. But as you know, President Trump -- this was in August of 2019, when I saw him, we were coming out of a meeting in the cabinet room at the White House and he'd been asked by a reporter whether he was going to nominate me to be ambassador to Russia and he said, yes. And then, he later, after that media scrum, came up to me and said, you really want to do this? And he thought at the time, he thought, that then-Secretary Pompeo was forcing me out as deputy secretary, which was definitely not the case, because he couldn't understand why anyone in their right mind would want to leave a beautiful office on Mahogany Row at the State Department to go to cold and hostile Moscow.

But supplying -- continuing to supply arms and support to the Ukrainians under sort of a lend lease arrangement and, you know, approaching the conflict from that perspective. One thing I'd keep in mind, I know there's lots of speculation about what President Trump would do, he doesn't like to lose. And if he's perceived as the person who lost Ukraine, that would not be good for him either. He was asked in the in the debate in June with Biden, I think essentially, do you want to see Putin win in Ukraine or gain -- or defeat Ukraine? And he answered without hesitation, no. The question is how he's going to go about doing it using our allies, I hope.

So, Putin is going to get a vote in this, and this war, his war in Ukraine is going to continue. So, my expectation is this will have to be, no matter what the policy instincts are of a new administration, whether it's Trump or Harris, the Ukraine war is going to have to be a priority for the new administration, no matter who is president, because Putin won't allow it to slip off the agenda.",

So, the west has paid a significant price for getting these detainees out. It's always a very difficult, emotional decision, and it ultimately comes to the president of the United States. And I've seen now both President Trump and President Biden have to make these decisions. But, you know, it was a great, joyful moment to see. Paul Whelan, for example, released. I'd spent a lot of time visiting Paul when he was in prison in Russia. That was a great moment for those United States citizens and for all of us to be happy for them and their families.

And thereseems to be an Israeli report that's saying the defense minister, Yoav Gallant, who also was speaking like that at the very beginning, has now said that total victory or absolute victory against Hamas is, quote, a nonsense. He's criticizing the prime minister. And I just wondered how you view it. I'm not asking you politically, but do you see areas that are so-called cleared of Hamas? Is there -- is it getting any less Hamas or what? Because from what we gather, obviously the evacuation orders, the striking of this, the striking of that means that these people are still there. It's like whack a mole. DR. ABDELMONEIM:  That's how I see it because the evacuation orders and the areas where you're getting strikes are repeating themselves. So, even in Gaza City in the north where we had a clinic, there were more evacuation orders. Now, in Khan Younis, back and forth. Khan Younis was cleared much earlier this year. So, them coming back to Khan Younis to have to do any more military action was a surprise. And if that's an indication that Hamas are coming back, well, then it's an indication that Hamas are coming back when they were cleared. The consequences that somewhere that was deemed safe or cleared, people moved back and then when there's a strike there again, that's why nowhere is safe.",

Do you hear -- what do you hear from Gazans? Who do they hold responsible as well? DR. ABDELMONEIM:  I do hear, sort of, in an evacuation moment, where you see, you know, people moving, you do hear -- and I speak Arabic, so I understand. So, you do hear complaints about Hamas, but you hear complaints about the U.S., you hear complaints about the U.N., you hear complaints about life. People feel that they've been left.

One of at least 255 people who have been tried or at least charged under this article, spreading false information about the Russian armed forces, most of us are charged for reporting on the war or talking about the war, and particularly talking about war crimes.

So, that's always been the bait. Vadim Krasikov, the assassin who was sentenced to life in Germany, was an exception. Now, that he is home along with probably five Russian spies who were released as part of the swap, now that they're all home, Russia can say, OK, this, we will always make good on this guarantee.
