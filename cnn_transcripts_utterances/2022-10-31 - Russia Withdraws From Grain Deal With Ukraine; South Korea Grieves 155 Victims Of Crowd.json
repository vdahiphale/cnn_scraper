      "sentences": "A very warm welcome to the show everyone, I'm Isa Soares. Tonight, Russia pulls out of the hard woninternational grain deal, what it means for global food security. Then 155 are confirmed dead in a crowd crush in South Korea. We're live in Seoul where the grief is tuning to anger. And Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva will be the next president of Brazil, but we are still waiting to hear from Jair Bolsonaro. But first, tonight, hundreds of thousands of people in Ukraine's capital are without power as well as running water as Russia presses its relentless aerial attacks on civilian infrastructure. This comes as Moscow also is threatening the global food supply. It is suspending its participation in a U.N. broker deal to allow grain shipments to leave Ukraine through the Black Sea. We'll have more on that in just a moment. But first, Ukraine's Air Force says Russia fired several waves of missiles across the country early on Monday. At least, a few hit their targets. In Kyiv, a missile struck a facility supplying electricity to 350,000 apartments. Ukraine says it's running out of equipment to make repairs to the damaged power plants. And the attacks have cut off 40 percent of Kyiv's population from the city's water supply. Salma Abdelaziz is monitoring all this from Kyiv and she joins me now. So Salma, talk to us about this barrage of missile strikes, clearly hitting energy infrastructure. How bad is it and can it be repaired quickly enough?",

Salma Abdelaziz for usin Kyiv there this evening, thanks very much, Salma. Well, as Salma was saying, Moscow has decided to suspend participation in the critical U.N. brokered grain export deal. Which basically means it will not guarantee safe passage for ships carrying grain from Ukraine through the Black Sea. Russia walked away after it accused Ukraine as Salma was saying of attacking its Black Sea fleet off the annexed Crimean peninsula. That happened this weekend. And Russia's president says Ukraine is misusing cargo vessels for military purposes. Ukraine, the U.N. and world leaders say those are lies. They're all urging Russia to rejoin the deal. German officials saying it's despicable to use world hunger as a weapon. Meanwhile, Ukraine vowing to carry on despite the risks, saying 12 ships with hundreds of thousands of tons of grain left its ports on Monday. Let's get more on this and what  this all means, Tymofiy Mylovanov; adviser to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy joins me now.  Tymofiy, always great to get your insight, to get your time here on the show. Talk to us about this deal, whether this deal can stand.

Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva won by an incredibly close margin. He's vowed to overturn the legacy of outgoing far-right President, Jair Bolsonaro. Let's get some perspective on this from Eric Farnsworth. He's a Vice President on the Americas society and Council of the Americas. Eric, great to have you back on the show. And watch a political comeback, isn't it, for Lula, but let's first start with the silence.

And so, they've really boxed in President Bolsonaro in terms of what his next steps could be.

He's been accused of a lot of things, but with the immunity, you really can't pursue those charges, necessarily. So it's possible that this is part of what he is trying to get through right now.

What that means is Brazil at that time was a very wealthy, growing economy that was doing really well with commodities, prices very high. The world community recognized that with the World Cup and the Olympics for Brazil, so that was a different time in a different place. What he faces now is there's no longer commodities boom, China, Brazil's top trade partner is slowing. He, as you mentioned, he's got a divided electorate, and he's got a Congress that isn't necessarily in his corner. Plus, he also has a record where he served time in jail, he was accused of corruption. And so he's got some baggage as he comes into the presidency for the third time. And a lot of people are going to be looking at that and many won't be forgiving him for that. So, I think we can anticipate there won't be much of a honeymoon, if any.
