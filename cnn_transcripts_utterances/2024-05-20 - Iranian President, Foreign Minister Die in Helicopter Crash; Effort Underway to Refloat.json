And it was pretty clear by late yesterday, just from the silence of the Iranian officials, that they had very little hope that there would be any survivors. Raisi himself was a very conservative cleric who came in very close to the supreme leader of the country. The president of Iran is the No. 2 official. Obviously, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, is the -- the most important decision-maker. But the two were very close, and he came in to basically run the crackdowns that we have seen on dissent and human rights. He accelerated the support for terror groups, including Hamas, Hezbollah, the arming of the Houthis. He became -- made the decisions, along with the ayatollah, to support Russia in the war in Ukraine. And of course, Iran has now become a major supplier of the drones and many other weapons systems that they're using. And he has accelerated, but not put into overdrive, the nuclear program. So the question for the United States now is, does the ailing ayatollah Khamenei, who's now in his mid-80s, choose somebody or designate -- there will be an election, but it's obviously not an open one. Choose somebody who will follow in that same path?",

But that also seems to be the story that is being pushed forward on Iranian state TV, which is something our other national security analysts have noted as remarkable and important.

They understood what the impact of that would be.Even last week, there were some indirect talks in Qatar with the United States, just to make sure that this didn't all spin out of control. So as soon as this helicopter went down, obviously, the country was rife for all kinds of conspiracy theories. And I'm sure we will hear some, particularly from the right-wingers in Iran. But all you had to do was look at the photos of the rescuers trying to make it up that mountainside in this, you know, pea soup of a fog, and it seemed pretty clear that weather could well have had a lot to do with this. HUNT: Yes. David, stand by for me for a second. I want to bring in CNN's Frederik Pleitgen, who is live for us. He's actually reporting on assignment in Poland right now. But Fred, you have traveled to Iran recently. And I wanted to get your perspective on these unfolding events and also kind of just check in with the latest on what we know at this hour.",

The death of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi.He was one of nine people onboard a helicopter that crashed over the weekend in a remote part of the country. Iran reports there were no survivors. Matthew Chance looks back on Raisi's life. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN CHIEF GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): He was a staunch critic of the West, even seen as a possible successor to the Iranian supreme leader. Ebrahim Raisi came to power in 2021, winning an election with a record low turnout. And for three years, enacting policies that made him a polarizing figure at home and abroad. His presidency saw a dangerous escalation in tensions with Israel. In April, he supported a major attack against the country in an unprecedented response to a suspected Israeli strike on the Iranian consulate in Syria, which killed several Iranian commanders. Throughout Raisi's presidency, Iran pressed ahead with its nuclear program, violating an international agreement, while blaming the U.S. for withdrawing and European states for not living up to their end of the deal. Tehran also supplied lethal drone technology to Russia, fueling the conflict in Ukraine, allowing Moscow to strike deep behind the front lines. Meanwhile, at home, Raisi oversaw a brutal crackdown on dissent, suppressing a 2022 uprising sparked by the death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman in the custody of Iran's religious Morality Police. It all cemented his status as a loyal hardliner, potentially in line to succeed Iran's 85-year-old supreme leader. President Raisi's sudden death plunges that succession into chaos. Raisi died along with his minister of foreign affairs, Hossein Amir- Abdollahian. The top Iranian diplomat took office in 2021 after a long career with the foreign ministry. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "I think those messages explain the axis of power that Iran has created, not just throughout the Middle East, but its closer relationships now with Russia; the way it's factored into Putin's campaign in Ukraine, with the supply of drones and everything like this.I don't think we should expect any change to Iran's policy domestically or internationally, or indeed to American policy. Raisi was a very repressive figure domestically, as you pointed out. The lesson of history is that, when there is political uncertainty in Iran, that leads to more repression. Having said that, this has been a time of great upheaval. You talked about those demonstrations. There was an Islamic State terror attack on Iran, which was a great embarrassment to the regime very recently. We had this shooting war, unprecedented, between Israel and Iran. And this will factor in, I think, to the succession of the supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei. Raisi was seen as a potential successor. That was going to happen anyway. The ayatollah is 85. He's very sickly. This could kind of bring all that forward, and we could see a front-loading of that succession crisis.",
