The Israeli military reports a fierce battle with a militant group in Khan Yunis, it says it has breached Hamas defense lines and carried out raids against Hamas strongholds. Meanwhile, the U.N. Secretary General has invoked a rarely used clause in the group's charter, referring to the situation in Gaza to the Security Council. Antonio Guterres is calling for a ceasefire and urging the Security Council to avert a humanitarian catastrophe. Israel's U.N.

He was released in 2011, one of the more than a thousand Palestinian prisoners released in exchange for Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit and is believed to be the key instigator of the October 7th attacks. Hence why he's such a prime target. His hometown is Khan Yunis, that will explain to some degree why that has been such a focus of this phase of the fighting after the end of the truce last Friday.And the IDF has put out some footage, they have blurred the faces of soldiers in this footage. And obviously we can't verify the exact details. But it shows, you can see here the type of fighting that we're talking about in Khan Yunis, this kind of urban combat, house- to-house on the ground, incredibly risky. The IDF has also said on Wednesday that two of their soldiers were killed in various locations in Gaza and four seriously wounded.

He's really looking pretty weak right now in New Hampshire. I think it's entirely plausible. Still, after those first two states, Haley will be seen as the principal alternative, and she'll get a month in effect in her home state of South Carolina to see whether she can beat Trump there and make it some kind of race. I think if he wins South -- Trump wins South Carolina, the race will probably be over. Haley's problem is that she has -- I think her strategy has made more sense so far than DeSantis. But ultimately, you know, she is at this point mostly consolidating the voters or most resistant to Trump, more moderate voters, more suburban, college educated voters. Eventually, she's going to have to go beyond that if she's really going to be a serious threat to Trump. And tonight, as I said, I think she was kind of weak on both fronts. She didn't make a strong case against Trump. And she didn't have good answers. Other than that, you know, you're lying over and over when DeSantis basically and Ramaswamy tried to build a ceiling.

You know, whether he stays in the race all the way through New Hampshire, whether he gets out presumably after tonight, you would think if he got out, he would support Nikki Haley. He made the case against Trump's fundamental fitness to be president, but not only because of his faculties, and, you know, his acuity, but also because of what he has done more concisely and directly than he has so far.

Its owners left some time ago, but it has new residents. These are soldiers from the 47th Mechanized Brigade. SASHA, COMMANDER OF GRAD UNIT, 47TH MECHANIZED BRIGADE: This is where we keep our missiles. COREN (voice-over): And they're part of the fight for Avdiivka, one of the most fiercely contested battles on Ukraine's eastern front. Camouflaged under the thicket is a Grad, a multiple-launch rocket system from the Soviet era.

Venezuela has long claimed this oil-rich heavily forested territory as its own, and disputes the boundaries set by international arbiters in 1899. On Sunday, Venezuelans voted in a referendum, symbolically approving an annexation. But in a bid to make it real, President Maduro announced a new map showing the disputed territory marked as Venezuela's. Guyana's leadership says this is unacceptable.
