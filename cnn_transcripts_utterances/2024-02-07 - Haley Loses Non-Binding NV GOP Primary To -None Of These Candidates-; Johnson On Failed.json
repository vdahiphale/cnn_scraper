That was the intent to drive voters to the polls to get them engaged, knowing that Nevada is going to have an impact on the national level from an early start.We saw an engagement yesterday that I think says Nevadans want to participate in a primary process. I was not involved in the decision of the state Republican Party. They made that decision for specific reasons, which I don't know. Their leadership made those decisions.

MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA): The United States threatened to veto on the Israel funding package. Chuck Schumer then said that he would put a blockade up in the Senate. He had 166 House Democrats who followed leader Hakeem Jeffries off that cliff. They took that lead, and they blocked the funding. Let me -- let's be clear about this. That bill provided exactly the amount of funding that the president himself had requested. It was $14.3 billion that we passed, many -- you know, three months ago. And that we added to it to replace our stockpiles and up our munitions on what's happening in that region. There is no reason whatsoever for them to object to the contents of that bill. They're doing it for political purposes. It's bad for national security. It's also terrible policy and terrible politics. The president of the United States has a 37 percent approval rating. If they're going to follow that lead, I think they did it to their detriment. And it's a very shameful thing at a time when our Israel -- our ally Israel needs the help desperately.",

Congressman, thanks so much for being with us. You heard -- I think you were actually just feet away from the House speaker when he said democracy is messy. How accurately does that describe what you saw on the House floor last night? REP. GREORY MEEKS (D-NY): Incompetency is not messy. Incompetency is incompetency. And trying to -- what we need to do, as had been tried in the Senate and working together is to try to figure out how we can come together as members of the House in a divided government and work something out for our national security, as well as for the benefit of the American people, as opposed to just trying to go and utilize political stunts that the speaker was trying to utilize yesterday.

And they know that there are always -- generally in negotiations you start with extremes, certain things that are -- have to be put off the table.And I think some of those items would be off the table because you have to talk about the security of Israel. And we've heard time and time again that, you know, number one, there was a ceasefire on October 6 that Hamas broke. And we know that their position, and especially the military leadership, that Israel does not have the right to exist and that they will do this time and time again.
