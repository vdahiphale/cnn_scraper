      "sentences": "Good morning. You are live in the CNN Newsroom. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.In just a few hours from now, Vice President Kamala Harris will pitch her economic vision to the nation. And this morning, we're learning about some of the policies she is set to unveil in just a short time from now, including tax cuts for lower and middle class Americans, an expanded child tax credit, a four-year plan to lower housing costs, and a federal ban on price gouging. Let's discuss with CNN Political Commentators Shermichael Singleton and Democratic Campaign Consultant Tim Hogan. Guys, I want to get to the battle over the economy in just a moment, but, first, I want to talk about this comment. That Trump made last night as he was praising one of his donors. He said the Presidential Medal of Freedom for Civilians was superior to the Medal of Honor because those recipients of the Medal of Honor are often wounded or dead soldiers. Let's listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: We gave Miriam (ph) the Presidential Medal of Freedom. That's the highest award you can get as a civilian. It's the equivalent of the Congressional Medal of Honor, but civilian version. It's actually much better because everyone gets the Congressional Medal of Honor that soldiers, they're either in very bad shape, because they've been hit so many times by bullets, or they're dead. She gets it, and she's a healthy, beautiful woman. That's right. And they're rated equal. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Yes, Tim, obviously there's a lot of discussion about what Trump said last night. He has spent the last four years, as you know, saying he never called fallen soldiers, quote, suckers and losers, even though it's been confirmed by CNN. But here he is on camera expressing pretty much the same sentiment, saying the Presidential Medal of Freedom is superior to the Medal of Honor because Medal of Honor recipients are often wounded or dead. What did you make of that?Tim, are you there? TIM HOGAN, FORMER SPOKESPERSON, HILLARY CLINTON'S 2016 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN:  I mean, look, it is -- yes, it is exactly what we expect from Donald Trump. Like you said, he's someone who has called veterans suckers or losers. He is someone who has dodged the draft over bone spurs. He is someone who has said that his personal Vietnam was avoiding STD. He downplays the contributions of veterans, and it's reprehensible. On the other side, you've got someone now on the ticket in Governor Tim Walz from Minnesota, who is a veteran who served 24 years in the Army National Guard. He's someone who, when he was in Congress, half of the legislation that he was working on was to help veterans. So, I think there's a really clear contrast for people who care about those who served our country.",

There's a group called Battle Buddy Three Gun. It's a group of veterans that allow veterans who've been wounded to compete in competitive shooting.And I've done a lot of stuff with them to sort of help the guys with their PTSD and other things to show them that despite whatever physical limitations they now have after serving, we support them, we stand with them and we can still have fun shooting guns, which is something a lot of them enjoy doing. You cannot compare this. It is an unnecessary blunder to make statements like that because a lot of veterans do support the former president. I'm not -- I get the compliment to Miriam, but I just think there was a better way to make that compliment without potentially insulting veterans who have their lives, ultimately losing limbs for the freedoms of this country that a lot of people sometimes take for granted. So, I don't think it was the best choice of words.",

He also said he was entitled to personal attacks on his political opponents.How should the vice president respond? She's going to be out in front of the cameras today, obviously talking about her economic policy.

He may read a topper talking about economic policy for ten minutes, but then he veers into personal attacks.I think for the vice president, it's stay disciplined, keep doing what you're doing. She's going to roll out an economic policy today. She was with the president yesterday talking about how, for ten drugs, ten very popular drugs, they reduced costs by 40 to 80 percent, saving $6 billion by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices. She's turning today in North Carolina, by the way, a state that we only lost in 2020 by 1.3 percentage points. A new polling from a couple days ago puts Harris in the lead there. She needs to focus on the economy. It's exactly what she's doing. She's going to roll out a policy that shows that there's a possibility of an expanded earned income tax credit $6,000 for new parents, down payment assistance for housing. She has a message to drive today, and she needs to get in front of the cameras, deliver it, and keep doing what she's doing.",

But then he also said the workers should also be happy with the companies. And so I found that to be an interesting duality that we don't always see from Trump in terms of policy, a different type of cleanup, I suppose.But it's interesting, some of the policy positions that the vice president I outline. I just saw several days ago. J.D. Vance talked about expanding the child tax credit for families. J.D. Vance talked about making housing affordable for Americans. And so I think this gives Trump and Vance an opportunity to say, wait a minute here, here goes the vice president again, adopting policies that we've rolled out several days before her. And I do think there's some legitimate criticism on trying to fix prices via the FTC, the Federal Trade Commission. How do you do that? I mean, do we all of a sudden just discard supply and demand economics? What would be the long-term outcome of allowing the federal government to dictate what the prices of a good should be today compared to tomorrow? How does the federal government predict that? And so there's some very serious structural issues with our economic policies, Jim.",

I think that's why you saw three guilty pleas or at least two guilty pleas, one going to plead guilty, right, that is the doctor, in addition to his assistant having pled guilty and the other drug supplier, I think, because it's the evidence is compelling. Imagine you being in front of a jury and hearing a text message about what is this moron going to pay now, right? The sum and substance of what they said, I don't think that lands very well.You go to doctors for care, for quality care. And when you're a person who's in the throes of some kind of addiction, you're very vulnerable. And so to be preying upon a person like that, Matthew Perry, who was in a very difficult and weakened state, that's problematic. You add greed to the mix, and then to Stephanie Elam's point, and great reporting, it relates to $2,000 you're charging him when you can get it for less than $20. Are you kidding? And so the other issue is going to be, Jim, that you have those three, right, who really on the box of having pled guilty, who are going to turn state's evidence. Everyone's presumed innocent until proven guilty to have not yet pled and they, of course, have their right to go to court. But remember that they are going to, with the three have pled guilty, be facing that narrative, that testimony in addition to everything unearthed in the search warrant. So, it's a very going to be a very difficult case for them and a tough road to hoe ahead.",
