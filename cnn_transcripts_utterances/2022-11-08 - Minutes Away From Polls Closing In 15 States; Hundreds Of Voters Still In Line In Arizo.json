      "sentences": "All right, John King.We are just moments away from the biggest round of poll closings this evening, including that critical Senate contest in the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania that could go a long way toward deciding control of the US Senate. As of right now, CNN is projecting that Senator Marco, the Republican from Florida will be reelected, defeating Congresswoman Val Demings. In Alabama, CNN is projecting that Katie Britt will win her Senate seat, defeating her opponent. She is a former staffer for the retiring Republican Dick Shelby in that Alabama Senate seat, so that's a hold for Republicans. In Oklahoma, CNN is projecting that incumbent Senator James Lankford will win in the Special Election in Oklahoma. Well, CNN is projecting that Markwayne Mullin will be elected, defeating Kendra Horn. And then in Kentucky, CNN is projecting that incumbent Republican Senator Rand Paul will be reelected. The big Senate race in Pennsylvania, CNN is declaring to be too early to call in the big Senate race that's between Lieutenant Governor John Fetterman and TV's Dr. Mehmet Oz, too early to call as of right now. And in New Hampshire, a competitive race between incumbent Democratic senator Maggie Hassan against retired General Don Bolduc again, too early to call. Let's look at the map in general right now. Right now, we have no projection in Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland, Missouri, and then as I said, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania. Too early to call right now. The overall balance of power in the US Senate, Democrats have 36 of the Senate seats. Republicans have 35 Senate seats. There are 29 seats remaining. That's what the rest of the night is about. Remember, Republicans only need to pick up one net seat from the Democrats in order to regain control of the Senate, but we have Governors races for you as well and Boris Sanchez has those.",

Governor Ron DeSantis, winning reelection by a considerable margin.Right now, DeSantis is up nearly 16 percentage points. That's notable because Donald Trump won the State of Florida in 2020 by about three and a half points. DeSantis of course widely speculated that he may run for President. Trump certainly thinks so with some of his recent attacks on the Florida Governor who earns a return trip to the Governor's Mansion in the Sunshine State. We also have a projection to bring you from ruby red, Alabama, a State that Donald Trump won, earning about 60 percent of the vote in 2020. There, incumbent Republican Kay Ivey, a staunch Trump supporter, she defeats rehabilitative therapist, Yolanda Flowers to win another four years in Alabama. We also have a key race alert to bring you now from the Peach State in Georgia. Right now, Democratic activist Stacey Abrams 44, it just changed 38,000 votes ahead of incumbent Republican, Brian Kemp. The lead thinning there with the last update, still only 31 percent of the vote in in Georgia. We will see where that winds up as the night moves along. Let's take a step back and look at the big picture. States where polls have closed, but where it is too early for CNN to make a projection. We're talking about Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, as well as Rhode Island and the Volunteer State of Tennessee.

Watch the libertarian numbers we get later into the night. Is it big enough to pull the two leading candidates under 50 percent? We'll have to watch. That's one of the calculations at the moment. Senator Warnock is above 50. I just want to check over the Governor's race because we're watching this ticket splitting dynamic all night long. So, the Democrat leading, it is early.

The size of the circles is the biggest percentage of outstanding vote. If it's blue, that means the Democrat is leading in that area.You see the circles down here, that means we are outstanding vote. It's larger over here. That means the Republican is leading in that area. And so you come right in here. You come in to Central Atlanta. You come in here, there's Cobb County, right? So we've still got a sizable percentage of the vote out. But, Jake is making the important point about the fight for the margins in the suburbs. It is unlikely the Republicans will carry Cobb County. The question is, can you be competitive enough in Cobb County? Can you be competitive enough in Atlanta and the suburbs around it? That's Fulton County, and you come over here to Gwinnett County, and you come down here, where we have no votes yet. See the gray? That means we have no vote yet in DeKalb County. So, that's the whole competition. The Democratic base is here. The suburbs decide statewide races. There are other suburbs as well, as you pull out, you can come down around Columbus, you can go up here around Augusta, over here around Savannah. You see again, this is a Democrat leading here in Chatham County, which is Savannah. But we've still got a lot of the vote out there. They say about 49 percent. Again, you see, let's just test it again. Over here in this part of the State, a very different part of the State over here on the seacoast, Senator Warnock at 66 percent, Herschel Walker at 33 percent. You take a peek here at the Governor's race again, Stacey Abrams, about four points, a little shy of that below -- percentage points below. She is underperforming Senator Warnock. And you look at Governor Kemp at 37 percent right there, you come back to the Senate race, Herschel Walker just shy of five points underperforming the Republican Governor. So what you're looking for here is ticket splitting, in the sense. We saw it in Ohio, we've already projected Mike DeWine, the Republican Governor winning. Does he help JD Vance? There is a lot of ticket splitting that helps Tim Ryan. We're going to watch that play out in a number of States as we come out. Let me turn this off now and just come back to what we're seeing live in the field in the race. Senator Warnock is ahead, but we're at 36 percent. Very important to note, early in the night here, we have to keep counting. Let's come out and just take a quick look at some of the other Senate races. And again, let's check in Ohio again, just to see the percentage, right? This is a state where Tim Ryan has run a very competitive race. He is not going to win Ohio with fixed 57 percent of the vote, even if he holds that lead and wins, it is just too competitive a State. That tells you disproportionately, early vote that we're looking at. We're waiting for Election Day votes, only 23 percent reporting there. One of the key races. Again, let's just check in to see in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, a few more votes in, again coming in, in Democratic areas. The first votes came in in Allegheny County. Remember, Braddock, Pennsylvania where John Fetterman was the Mayor is right out in this area, 84 percent right there, but a long way to go, Jake, in your home state, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.",

She formerly worked at Turning Point USA, a pro-Trump youth organization. In Florida, Republican, Laurel Lee is the winner in a newly drawn Tampa area district. She is a former Florida Secretary of State. Let's look at the balance of power now in the House of Representatives, 19 Democrats have been elected, 45 Republicans including three pickups, there are still 371 seats remaining. Needing to control of course is 218. What's the state of play in the 83 competitive US House seats that we've isolated? Well, Republicans need to win 27 of them. That's down from 30, so they are on their way. Democrats need to win 53 of those competitive seats. That's the same number we had before. So we do have right now, Republicans having some momentum.

There is a ton of outstanding vote in the Republican areas of North Carolina, that will be Election Day vote and that will be disproportionately, you know, Ted Budd is leading in these places, you just pop went up to take a peek at it. You see Union County, he is leading now with just early vote where, you know, Cheri Beasley again, a lot of Democratic votes among the early vote, she's getting 39 percent. Let's see, will we get up to seventy-five, eighty percent? Let's revisit some of these places and see what happens when that comes in. So if you look at this map, you see the big circles and you say there are a lot of Democratic votes out there, but just remember, that means the Democrat is leading in that area right now. And so when the Election Day vote comes in, the Democrat is likely in the big urban areas to stay ahead, to stay leading. The question is can Ted Budd narrow the margins? If he does, that will change.",

Meantime in the state of South Carolina, not a competitive race there the incumbent Republican Henry McMaster, defeating former Democratic Congressman Joe Cunningham to win another four years. An update now from Tennessee another reliably Red State, Donald Trump won 60-ish percent of the vote there in 2020. Bill Lee winning reelection, the incumbent Republican defeating ICU physician Jason Martin.Let's get a look at some key race alerts now, beginning with that all important race we will not stop talking about in the state of Georgi. The last time we checked, Stacey Abrams had the lead now that has flipped, Brian Kemp, the incumbent Republican leads with roughly 40,000 votes with 42% of the vote. And notably Kemp above that 50% threshold, meaning he could avoid a runoff. Let's get a look at Texas now. Former Democratic Congressman Beto O'Rourke with a 60,000-vote advantage right now over incumbent Republican Greg Abbott, about 26% of the vote in, in Texas. An update now a key race alert from the state of Michigan. incumbent Democrat Tudor -- Gretchen Whitmer, I should say locked in a tough reelection battle against conservative commentator Tudor Dixon. Right now, Whitmer sitting 55,000 votes ahead still very, very early in the night in Michigan, only 3% of the vote in there. We also have a key race alert to bring you from the state of Pennsylvania where Attorney General Josh Shapiro has a 287,000 vote advantage over Doug Mastriano. Remember, Mastriano is an election denier who tried to overturn the 2020 election results in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Still early there, though only 8% of the vote in.
