We're keeping a close eye on that event for any new reaction to the arraignment.This is a special edition of The Situation Room, the federal indictment of Donald Trump. Let's get straight to the breaking news, the arrest and arraignment of Donald Trump on 37 federal criminal charges. Our Senior Crime and Justice Reporter Katelyn Polantz was inside the room for today's proceedings, and CNN's Kristen Holmes is outside the former president's golf club in New Jersey, where we expect him to arrive shortly. First, let's go to Katelyn. She is joining us from the courthouse in Miami. Katelyn, you watched all the drama unfold inside that courtroom. Walk us through what happened. KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME AND JUSTICE REPORTER:  Well, Wolf, this 50-minute proceeding, Donald Trump sat slumped over for some of it or his arms crossed, apparently scowling, for much of the rest of it, as he was faced with these criminal charges for the very first time before a judge in federal court and in the same room as Special Counsel Jack Smith and much of his team. Both of the men were there today. So, it really made for one of these moments that it's extraordinary, with Donald Trump sitting with a plate in front of him saying, defendant, in a hushed courtroom, as the proceedings went on. Through this proceeding, it was quite procedural, right? Donald Trump needed to say he was not guilty, to enter that initial pleading into the court. His attorney did it for him, Todd Blanche. His attorney stood up and said, we most certainly enter a plea of not guilty. Donald Trump himself, he was never directly addressed by the judge in a way that required him to stand up and address the judge himself. So, we never heard him speak during this proceeding. But he was given some guidelines. He was there with his co-defendant, Walt Nauta. Walt Nauta has not entered a plea yet at this time because he does not have an attorney yet lined up to represent him or at least allow his attorneys to represent him in the state of Florida. But both of these men left with some restrictions. They're not going to have to put up any cash bond. They're not going to have any travel restrictions. They don't have to turn over their passports. But they are not able to speak to one another or to any witnesses or victims in this case, potentially that the Justice Department is going to identify to them in a way where they would be discussing the facts of the case themselves. So, a little bit of restrictions that Donald Trump's attorneys, Wolf, initially tried to oppose.",

There may have been kind of a circus atmosphere around the courthouse, but for the country and for history, I think it's a day we look back on in sorrow.No one wants to see a former president of the United States indicted in a federal court, having to say not guilty. This, of course, comes after he was indicted in a state court on something entirely different. And we also know from our reporting that there may be other indictments coming down the road. The Justice Department has been criticized by lots of Republicans. And I think that, at some point, a jury is going to have to decide the president's -- the former president's guilt or innocence in all of this.

And I think it did not benefit -- it would not have benefited the Justice Department to dig in and say they needed to lock the former president up in a cell while he was pending trial. So, this was as straightforward as a legal proceeding is.

He was already doing much better than his opponents in the polls. He's up by something like 40 points on Ron DeSantis at this point. It will be interesting to see what his opponents say about this. Primarily, they've been sort of rallying to his defense, saying that this is essentially a witch hunt, it's a hoax and it's an example of unequal justice by the Department of Justice, which, of course, now you have Donald Trump calling the Department of Injustice. [18:10:03] We'll see what he says tonight, right? He's sort of framing this as this sort of election interference. I'm sure he'll strike similar tones with that tonight. And we'll see just sort of more broadly what Republicans on the Hill, particularly on the Senate side, did they sort of change their tone in terms of how they start to talk about Donald Trump? But he is in a commanding place in terms of running for the nomination. It will affect, obviously, when this hearing or when the court appearances in the trial actually happened. Is it going to be next year? Probably not, because that might be too close to the actual voting. So, listen, I think he clearly, I think, feels sad about this moment, because who wouldn't?

So, we're going to have a fight over almost every piece of evidence.This is the classified processes that protect the information. We do that because it is very likely there is information that was found at Mar-a-Lago that, in fact, is not included in the indictment because it was so essentially sacred that the court -- that the prosecutors were willing to say, we have enough already this stuff we really need to protect. And this is going to be followed not just by our enemies, I keep saying, it's our allies. We live in a world in which we are sharing classified information to figure out what these global threats are. None of these threats are domestic. We have terrorism and we have threats from abroad, we have common enemies with our allies, like Russia and North Korea. The sharing of intelligence and what their intelligence agents are acquiring and accumulating is shared with us. They're going to be following this. What might have gotten out of their intelligence and what might have been violated in terms of human assets? That's the biggest fear here. We can't draw a line between what was found at Mar-a-Lago and whether someone got killed because they're an agent for us or a human asset within, say, a terror group. But why are we gambling? Why are we even asking this question? He was the president of the United States. And that's the point that we just have to keep making.",

And, in fact, even things like the classified -- the unclassified cover page and summary, whether you can show that to a jury instead of a document, is a big legal fight that requires a lot of expertise from attorneys, a lot of expertise from judges, and that's going to take some time between now and whenever.",

Republicans in both chambers have been planning a multi-pronged strategy to defend the former president and undermine the findings of the special counsel, even as they mostly refuse to engage on the substance of those charges.One area where House Republicans are looking at using is the upcoming spending bill season in order to target DOJ and FBI, and specifically there have been calls on the right to defund the special counsel's office. Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene told me and my colleague, Annie Grayer, that she brought that idea up with Speaker McCarthy in a meeting today. She also said she raised the idea with former president Donald Trump over the weekend, and she said he was very supportive of that proposal, although we should note it would go nowhere in the Democratic-controlled Senate. And then the other area where Republicans are looking to target DOJ and FBI is through oversight. House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan is considering a subpoena to try to force Jack Smith, the special counsel, to either turn over documents or testify about his ongoing probe, although that would very unlikely succeed. And then, finally, over in the Senate, you have J.D. Vance who announced today that he is going to be blocking all DOJ nominees from Biden going forward in retaliation for how the agency has been dealing with Donald Trump, although that is likely to have a minimal impact because of the number of nominees that are actually in the pipeline. But, Wolf, all that really amounts to an extraordinary effort to intervene in an ongoing criminal probe. And not everyone in the GOP is on board. Just take a listen to Senator Lisa Murkowski.

Let's talk about timing and jury selection and the evidence that that jury will eventually get to see.We know the first tension here is going to be timing. Special Counsel Jack Smith said last week that he wants to make it clear he is looking formal a speedy trial. But former President Trump and his lawyers, they have every incentive to try to delay this as long as possible, hopefully until after the election. And a judge, through decisions big and small, can really have a big impact on how long it takes a case to get to trial, everything from how long it takes them to make decisions to how much time they put between various hearings. And there is really no oversight of that. She could have a huge impact there. Then when it comes to jury selection, as you might imagine, it will be difficult to assemble a jury that has no opinion of the former president, but a judge has a lot of sway over who gets dismissed for cause and can make things potentially very challenging for prosecutors in the jury selection process. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, evidence. Special Counsel Jack Smith was very aggressive in pursuing evidence, getting around executive privilege, attorney-client privilege, but all those battles were fought in court in D.C., before a different judge. And Trump's attorneys, a source close to the legal team tells me they're going to try to challenge all of those questions again in front of Judge Cannon. So, even if they don't win on the merits, that still has the win for Trump of delaying this that much longer. Wolf?",
