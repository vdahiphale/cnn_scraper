Finland, of course, also shares an 800-mile land border with Russia, raising many concerns about Putin's moves in this area of the country. But as the president is about to sit down with the president of Finland, he is also looking ahead to a summit with Nordic leaders from five countries, including Sweden. Of course, the president got a big win this week, heading into that summit, after Turkey dropped its objections to now allow Sweden into the alliance. Now, Turkish President Erdogan has said that it still needs to hold a vote in the Turkish Parliament, and that will have to wait until the Fall. But Sweden could soon now be entering the alliance and expanding the strength that the president is trying to show against Russian President Vladimir Putin. Now, this all comes as the president has really built a trip around trying to relay that message. He went into that NATO summit trying to rally more support about Ukraine. Yes, there was some tension between the president and Zelenskyy and other allies at the start, but at the end of it, the president did offer some long-term security commitments with G-7 allies to Ukraine. And it also speaks to the president's broader world view, that he believes that Western democracies do have a hand in influencing and helping other countries. He's been stressing this message about democracy and freedom, saying that that fight for freedom is a lifelong calling and, in this trip, has been trying to message to Russian President Vladimir Putin that the U.S. and its allies aren't going anywhere when it comes to Ukraine.",

Bush administration with me, someone who is well-respected in law enforcement circles. I mean, you know, he was confirmed with all Republican votes voting in favor of him at his confirmation, right?It's amazing how much this is boomeranging to turn around and attack him, because it's politically convenient right now in this moment. I think it's a disgrace. I also think that, in the eyes of the international community, I watched that hearing yesterday, and all I kept thinking was, for our national security and our homeland security, both domestically, to undermine the confidence like that in a federal law enforcement organization. And internationally, our foreign adversaries must have been laughing at us yesterday. Because they were watching Republican leaders destroy the credibility of our own agencies in such a manner that it's very -- you know, it's eroding at the fibers of what our country is based on, which is rule of law and our democracy.",

From the oversight perspective, if you look through the Durham report, if you look through some of the surveillance issues on FISA-related issues, if you look through January 6th, frankly, if you try to dig in on some of the Hunter Biden stuff and how long that investigation took, there are legitimate questions that should be probed by Congress. ELLIOT WILLIAMS, CNN LEGAL ANALYSTAnd so, with respect to Hunter Biden, ask the questions about whether the Justice Department is politicized, the FBI is politicized. And it's a fair question to ask. The Durham report, same thing. A fair question. But what happens here is that the current majority then takes it the whole government is stacked against you, there's a conspiracy between Pfizer and Google and -- and vaccines and all kinds of nonsense that really gets away from the core function that they ought to be performing, which is making sure that law enforcement is serving the American people.

Law enforcement skews pretty conservative at the federal level. And the idea that it is this deep-state cabal of people who are out and colluding to go after Republicans is nonsense. You talk to FBI agents or work with them, and talked about politics at all, which people don't, it's -- it's a truly mind-boggling allegation about sort of the rank-and-file and where their orientation is. And the fact that they're working hand-in-hand with political leadership at the White House to go after Republicans. It's simply nonsense.",
