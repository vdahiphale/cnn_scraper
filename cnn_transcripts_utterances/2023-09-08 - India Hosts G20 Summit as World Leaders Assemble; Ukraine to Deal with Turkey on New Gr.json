U.S. President Joe Biden left Washington late Thursday for the long flight. Soon after he arrives in Delhi. He's scheduled to sit down with Prime Minister Narendra Modi for one-on-one talks. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will be the first British Premier of Indian descent to visit India when he touches down. Downing Street called his trip historic. But Vladimir Putin is a no-show, just as he was at the Bali summit last year with an international arrest warrant hanging over him. The Russian leader also skipped last month's BRICS summit in South Africa. And while Putin's absence isn't a surprise, a last-minute decision by China's Xi Jinping not to come was unexpected. It's the first time Xi has missed a G20. No official explanation was given. CNN's Kevin Liptak joins us live this hour from New Delhi. So, Kevin, walk us through what we're expecting here.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, President Biden is really coming here trying to convince members of the developing world that the United States is a better bet to invest with than China. And he does have an opening with the absence of the Chinese president from these talks. And in a way, it's a lost opportunity for President Biden. You'll remember at last year's G20, President Biden and President Xi were able to sit down for several hours for a summit. That's clearly not going to happen here.But in the view of White House officials, President Biden really does have an opportunity to talk to other world leaders with Xi not on the stage, really talk about these investments that the U.S. is hoping to make in the developing world. And he is coming armed with certain proposals to reform institutions like the World Bank. He is coming armed with ideas to promote American infrastructure projects in places around the world. The White House says that this isn't necessarily an effort to counter China, but they do say it will provide an alternative to nations who may be experiencing coercive lending practices by Beijing. And certainly, one of the big questions that's looming over this summit, this economic summit, is the state of the Chinese economy, and certainly President Biden will want to contrast that with the relative strength of the American economy. Now, the other big question that is looming over these talks, of course, is the Russian invasion of Ukraine. President Biden has had a lot of success in rallying the West around support for Ukraine, but he hasn't necessarily been as persuasive with some of the countries in the so-called global south, countries like India, but also South Africa, Brazil. And certainly, President Biden will want to talk to them about punishing Russia for its invasion. One of the efforts that's underway now behind the scenes is work on a communique or a joint statement that might come out of this summit. Those talks we're told have been quite difficult, so it will remain to be seen whether the leaders can agree to any communique that would have language that condemns Russia's invasion. Russia, you know, is, remember, is a member of the G20, so any kind of language sort of remains uncertain on that front. But really the centerpiece of this is Prime Minister Modi. You see his face everywhere you go here in New Delhi. He is really trying to build himself up as a global statesman. And as you said, President Biden's first order of business when he arrives here will be meeting with Modi at his residence, Ken.

There have been occasions recently in which disagreements over Ukraine has meant that a communique isn't possible. So that will be the basic hurdle to clear.

So, there are some technocratic things which come out of the G20, but the problem is the scale of the challenges that the world faces in areas like the green transition and debt reduction and a whole host of other things, the regulation of artificial intelligence.Whatever you might think, the scale of the challenges is huge and it's very, very difficult for a multilateral body like the G20 to do anything much about it. Contrast it with the G7, the group of rich industrialized nations like the United States and Canada and Britain, they get quite a lot done because they all agree with one another. The problem with the G20 is that one half doesn't agree with the other half and it's just really hard, unfortunately, to get things done when that's the case.",

Now, Kyiv also announced it started exporting grain through Croatian ports as it explores alternative shipping routes. And U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is also on his way to the G20 summit following a visit to Ukraine.

Now Ukrainian military sources say their troops overran several Russian positions south of there. Meanwhile, Ukraine says Russia no longer has enough troops in Belarus to launch an attack from there. According to Kyiv, Moscow has pulled out most of its troops that have been training in Belarus. Some independent analysts believe those units are now deployed in Ukraine. Russia says it intercepted two more Ukrainian drones over its southwestern Bryansk region on Thursday. It happened hours after multiple drone attacks in two other parts of Russia.

BELL (voice-over):  And beyond the two drones that targeted Rostov-on- Don in the early hours of Thursday, a third was intercepted on its way to Moscow, according to the city's mayor. The people are suffering because of Russia's special military operation in Ukraine, says one resident. Let Putin come here and see what is going on, she urges. For civilians in Ukraine, meanwhile, the war is all too familiar. A Russian drone attack in the Odessa region killed one on Wednesday as Russians targeted agriculture infrastructure and port facilities for the fourth day in a row.

There is what North Korea is telling us that it has achieved and is unveiling, and then you have the other side, officials in the region and also experts trying to pour over images and footage to find out if it is exactly what North Korea says it is.So, Pyongyang has said, and Kim Jong-un was there at the unveiling as well, giving a speech, that they have launched a Korean-style tactical nuclear attack submarine. Kim calling it the beginning of a new chapter. And we have seen in recent months that there is some kind of revival when it comes to the Navy in North Korea. There is a lot more focus being put on it. And he also said that he wanted to make sure that all medium-sized submarines will be converted into nuclear- capable versions. Now, on the other side, what we have heard from the South Koreans, the Joint Chiefs of Staff have said that it appears, quote, \"not capable of normal operation.\" Now, they of course are pouring over these images as well to find out exactly what they can from any possible images showing the capabilities saying that they're paying attention to signs that suggest Pyongyang is attempting to deceive or cover up or exaggerate capabilities. Now it hasn't been tested although we have seen in recent years some submarine launched ballistic missile tests from North Korea although officials and experts do believe that all, if not the vast majority, were actually launched from an underwater platform as opposed to a submarine which Pyongyang claims. But it comes one day ahead of the 75th anniversary of the founding of North Korea which is going to be an important day in the calendar. North Korea has already said that they will carry out a parade. There will be extensive celebrations and of course as you mentioned, it also comes as there is speculation that there could be possibly a meeting between the leaders of North Korea and Russia, but certainly a push towards a potential arms deal between the two countries.

The eye is very clear there on the last couple of frames, which means that the storm is likely even getting stronger at this hour.Hurricane hunters have been flying back and forth to see how strong this storm is. And, still moving towards the northwest, but the models are really turning this hard to the right at the very, very end of that five-day period. Turning it hard, this is the American model. All of the ensembles of the American model, turning it hard to the right. Now, when does the turn happen? That is always the question. Does it happen 12 hours early and turn here with this line, or does it turn 12 hours later and turn over here? Big, big story for the northeastern part of the United States and even into Atlantic Canada. Where the storm is right now is at three to five degrees Fahrenheit, two degrees Celsius above normal. But, look at this blue area here. There was a hurricane here last week, hurricane Franklin, also a major hurricane. And it mixed the water up, it took that warm water from the surface and used it to make the hurricane and then mixed water from down below, the colder water, up to the surface. So Lee has to run through and into this colder water. That may slow it down just a touch. At least that is what everyone is hoping for.",
