The Dow Jones is down, 0.42 percent. As you can see, it's red all day. Those are the markets and these are the main events: SpaceX's Starship explodes just minutes after liftoff. Elon Musk calls it a learning opportunity. Janet Yellen says the US will continue to respond to China's unfair economic practices. And Google wants to help you reduce your carbon footprint. Its Chief Sustainability Officer joins me later in the show. Live from Dubai, it is Thursday, April 20th. I'm Eleni Giokos. I am in for Richard Quest, and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. A very good evening. Tonight, Elon Musk is assessing the damage as his two biggest companies face major challenges. Earlier this morning, SpaceX launched its Starship spacecraft using the most powerful rocket ever built. About four minutes after liftoff, it exploded over the Gulf of Mexico. No one was on board. Meanwhile, Tesla shares are down sharply after the company's earnings call on Wednesday. Its investors are worried about a possible price war with EV competitors, and we begin with Tesla, whose shares are currently down around 10 percent. The company reported its lowest profit margin since 2020. Elon Musk said recent price cuts have led to higher demand. Faced with growing competition, Tesla has slashed its prices this year in the US. The Model 3 is selling for 11 percent less, the cost of its base, Model Y has been lowered by 20 percent. Tom Narayan is the lead equity analyst for Global Autos at RBC Capital Markets. Great to have you on. You know, the strategy behind the pricing is fascinating. If you just dig deeper, and you take a look at the gross profit margins, you see Elon Musk saying, look, we need to gain market share, and then the big question is, are we in an EV price war?",

      "sentences": "Yes, I mean, I think a lot of folks are looking at the results today andworrying about what this means in terms of overall demand for Tesla, like is he worried about demand? And is that why he is cutting prices so much? But I think folks are maybe overanalyzing things a little bit. You have to put things in context. Pricing has been escalating for the past three years. You know, from the year 2016 to 2019, pricing is only up nine percent from 2019 to 2022. Global, industry-wide, auto pricing is up 37 percent, and during 2022, Tesla actually was raising prices. So a lot of this is adjusting for the reality of the economy that we're about to head into today. Higher interest rates, lower affordability, and what he is also trying to do is not just look at other EV makers, I think that is a mistake that a lot of us, you know analysts tend to do. We tend to pit them against other EV makers. He is targeting ICE regular petrol cars, and trying to convert them to EVs. Today, if you look at the pricing of the Model 3 with a $7,500.00 IRA credit, it's the same price as a Toyota Camry, and everybody is worried about the gross profit margin they posted today. But their overall operating income margin is like thirteen, fourteen percent, the same level as Mercedes or BMW, and they're selling a car at the same price as a Toyota Camry. So I tend to think that folks are maybe over analyzing one day's quarter. It's going to happen with Tesla, obviously. Everybody loves to talk about it, but I think longer term, bigger picture, there are bigger plans that are in front of us.",

      "sentences": "I really am. I mean, you just have to look at the math behind what we already can see what some of the prices people are paying for. Thingslike FSD and autopilot, you know, a couple of hundred bucks a month, you know, over a thousand bucks a year, over a lifetime of a car, that's several thousand dollars. How much is he cutting the prices by? Less than that. And when you pay for service like autopilot or FSD, you know, it's a great product, you're willing to pay for that, and Tesla only has to spend on research and development one time. It's a software expense. If he can scale and get as many Tesla's on the road as possible. It makes it all the more profitable. So, that's really the game plan here, the long term vision here, that Level 2+, Level 3, you know, the car doing a lot of the driving for you, people are going to be willing to pay for it. How many times have they been stuck in traffic, and needed to stop and go with yourself, would you rather have the car do it for you? You know, this is where the industry is headed. People are willing to pay for this, and if you're getting a $7,500.00 credit for Uncle Sam, maybe you'll be willing to pay a little more and get some of these self-driving type services that you didn't before, and that is much more margin accretive than selling a car.",

Buthere is the thing, costs are coming down, which is a positive. Look, Ford and GM still making money on their traditional businesses. I guess Tesla doesn't have that buffer, but costs are coming down for EVs. I guess where are margins heading for Tesla and the EV space realistically?",

But, he is looking -- we're looking at pricing being lower for maybe this year, and then he clearly said on the earnings call that once macroeconomic situations, the conditions are reversing, he will raise prices again. He said that long-term targets are 25 percent of gross operating profit margins. That is demonstrably higher than 19 percent they just posted. You know, that's meaningful. And remember, they're doing the same operating margin as a Mercedes and a BMW today. What happens when battery prices, which is the main cost of an EV, starts coming down and it already has. We're talking about lithium, because the main cost of lithium ion battery, the main raw material is down 60 percent since November. So battery raw materials are coming down, chemistries are improving. You know, EVs actually have less parts than a regular combustion car. So in a few years, we could get to the point where cars cost less to make an EV than to make a combustion car, and you have all these services and features you can offer to a consumer, and there are consumers who may be willing to pay more. So these can become wildly profitable, even exceeding the 25 percent level that he has envisioned.",

The Federal Aviation Administration here in the United States says they will oversee this mishap and this explosion and that future flights will be awarded and allowed based on the insurance of public safety. So they do have a lot to go through here.

Elon Musk has been talking about this for a long time wanting to reserve blue checks, only for people who pay $8.00 a month for it subscription platform. He is really trying to drive Twitter's revenue growth that way. But the checkmark system has long been a way of preventing impersonation for high profile users and in that way, attracting high profile users to the platform.

China's Social Security system will likely come under strain. Beijing is addressing this.

Local governments have even offered cash to encourage people to have more babies. But so far, these measures have done little to stop the downward trend.

So I want to read you a statement from Alec Baldwin's attorneys, Luke Nikas and Alex Spiro. It reads, \"We are pleased with the decision to dismiss the case against Alec Baldwin and encourage a proper investigation into the facts and circumstances of this tragic accident.\" Remember, I sat down with Alec Baldwin last summer at CNN and he told me this was an accident. \"I have no idea how the live rounds of bullets got into the gun. I did not pull the trigger,\" he maintained. Now the FBI report said that the trigger had to have pulled -- been pulled for the gun to go off. So, you know, we remember the original special prosecutor Andrea Reeb, who stepped down about a month ago, which is significant here. You know, she had said that we may never know. She said it on CNN's air. We may never know how the live bullets got to the set and that it didn't really matter. But clearly the district attorney's office in New Mexico, they have more information in order to drop these charges against Alec Baldwin. So the filing has not yet happened. It will be happening sometime this afternoon or potentially tomorrow. Now this is all ahead of a scheduled status hearing and a preliminary hearing for the trial, which is currently scheduled for May 3rd. So this is still moving to trial. There is still someone else that faces charges. That's the film's armorer, Hannah Gutierrez Reed. She faces two counts of manslaughter with up to 18 months in prison. So look, really significant. We have not heard from Alec Baldwin. But we do know where he is today. He is on the set of \"Rust.\" More than 18 months later, today, they started filming, right, of all days. They started filming again today in Montana, at Yellowstone. And they have about 20 days of filming. And, you know, this is all breaking and we're all waiting to hear what Alec is going to say.",

It was published over the weekend by a German magazine, which called it \"Michael Schumacher, The First Interview.\" Schumacher hasn't been seen in the public since a 2013 brain injury and he wasn't involved in the process at all. Instead, the magazine used AI to mimic what his responses might have been. It included made-up quotes and discussions about his family as well as medical condition. The magazine has declined to comment. Anna Stewart is in London for us. He was on the front cover of this magazine. I mean, it is deceptive. It is absolutely hurtful, I'm sure, to the family as well.

He hasn't been publicly seen since. It talks about his family life. And only if you read really almost through toward the end of the article do you find out that this is fake.

And so here at Google, we have a great feature that we call eco friendly routing in Maps. When you're using Maps to navigate to a restaurant or to a play date for your kids, you can type in your address and you'll see a green leaf next to one of the routes. And that's going to be the most fuel efficient route, even if it doesn't have -- even if it has a slightly longer time associated with it. And we estimate that this has already saved people about half a million metric tons of carbon emissions, which is the equivalent of taking about 100,000 fuel-based cars off the road.
