CNN has learned that the special grand jury in Fulton County, Georgia has completed its investigation now into Trump's efforts and all of those around Trump to overturn the 2020 election results in that state.We do not yet know the results of this special grand jury's findings, but we do know that there is now a hearing on the books. The judge has scheduled it for later this month to decide whether the grand jury's reports should be made public. The final decision on whether to bring any charges against Trump or anyone for that matter, will be made by the Fulton County District Attorney, you see right there, Fani Willis. Sara Murray has been tracking this. She's been tracking this investigation from the very beginning. She joins us now. Sara, what are you hearing about this? What is this judge saying?",

They were seated in May of 2022. They had the power to subpoena witnesses. They had the power to gather evidence.They have been doing this and they have now completed this final report that again, prosecutors will get to see. But it's an open question whether the public will get to see it. That's something we're going to be talking about later on this month in that hearing. But look, this is an investigation that started with the now infamous phone call that former President Donald Trump made to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, asking Raffensperger to help him find the votes. Take a listen to a portion of that call. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: All I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more that we have. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

You know, everyone's very eager to see what's in their final report and also to see if they recommended any indictments. If so, the District Attorney can then pursue those charges, Kate.",

      "sentences": "Yes, well, I'm glad to be with you both. I think it's likely that there are charging recommendations in the report. Remember that the report is really an instrument not just to the grand jury, but that the DA and the prosecutors have had their hands all over it.The grand jury is not sitting in there with notepads, you know, listed out, everything they want to have, and somebody's typing this up at night. This is something that's done in conjunction with the prosecutor's office getting down by the wishes of the grand jury and any specific questions or comments they may have about the evidence that was presented to them. So, the prosecutor knows what's in the report, no question about it. But at the same time, I also want to kind of put the cautionary instruction out there, and that is that, you know, this is just the beginning of the process. The evidence presented to this grand jury, the witness testimony presented to this special purpose grand jury has not been challenged, has not been tested by cross examination or other defense counsel efforts. And so, this is the beginning of what we would see in a normal case that is that the prosecutor now has to make a decision about whether or not she's going to seek actually a criminal indictment from a regular grand jury in Fulton County. Again, I don't think that we're going to see a special report with no recommendations in it. The question will be, who have they recommended that she charge and on what charges?",

But, you know, we know that Rudy Giuliani was one of the people who showed up before the grand jury.We know that Boris Epshteyn, who is an attorney to -- another attorney to former President Donald Trump was there. South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham fought this tooth and nail. He appeared before the grand jury. Brad Raffensperger was there. Brian Kemp was there. Mark Meadows was ordered to appear after he had been fighting a subpoena for his appearance as well. So, look, they got information from a number of these people. And one of the things we heard from witnesses is that the grand jury was very involved in sort of asking these witnesses follow up questions. They had very clearly been read in on the materials. So, you know, as Mike was saying, they work with the District Attorney to pull together this final report. But witnesses have described a very active grand jury throughout this process.",

So it's pretty simple to call together a grand jury. She could do this in a regular criminal term and make a fairly concise presentation to a grand jury.To make a case before a regular criminal grand jury, she didn't have to lay out every witness and every piece of evidence. She could do that in the summary presentation. So she can bring in a couple of witnesses and some recorded statements if she wants to, some documents if she has them, and basically lay out the findings that were made by this special purpose grand jury and any other investigative finding that she's made. She could really get an indictment within a couple of days, I think. And my guess is, you'll see, her team will take a month or two to develop their case a little further once the decision is made about the reports. And then if indictments are going to come out, I think you'll see them certainly by spring.",

We now know a lot more about the scope of that DOJ investigation.And also that was before the Mar-a-Lago investigation became a problem, that Donald Trump was at the center of, you know, sort of hoarding these sensitive documents at Mar-a-Lago. I do think one thing is very clear, though. Donald Trump has always been at the center of the District Attorney's case in Georgia. You know, the federal case may reach to Donald Trump, and Merrick Garland may have a decision to make.

They stand with Brazil, and they will continue to -- or they look forward to working with President Lula. Now, this is the type of unrest in Latin America that has contributed to mass movement across the western hemisphere landing at the U.S. doorstep, and it has become a major political liability for President Biden, who, as you mentioned there, went to the U.S.-Mexico border just yesterday for the first time as president. And he is now in a position where he's trying to find solutions at home while also seeking assistance in Mexico. And that is what we're expecting to hear while he is here for the summit. Now, the U.S. has historically looked to Mexico to try to stem the flow of irregular migration, looking to them to also enforce their own borders. So we'll hear about that today. Administration officials that I've been talking to leading up to this say that they have been emphasizing the coordination between the two countries and hoping that the discussion between the two presidents will reinvigorate that type of coordination. But really what these two stops do here in Mexico and yesterday at the border is really show the predicament that Biden is in. It is a very tough issue to solve, that issue of migration, especially at a moment like now when there is unprecedented to seek those -- domestically, particularly in Congress, and trying to call for reform, but also down south and with partners like Mexico.
