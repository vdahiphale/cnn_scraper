Officials tell us the gunman accused of killing five people and injuring more than a dozen others at an LGBTQ nightclub in Colorado refuses to talk. Investigators say, even without his cooperation, they're looking into whether this was a bias-motivated crime, in other words, whether he acted because of hate. And, if so, he could face hate crime charges. We're told those charges won't be formally filed until the suspected shooter is out of the hospital, however. He's been there since the attack. It appears the suspect was injured by two heroic club goers who took him down. Army veteran Richard Fierro says he grabbed onto a loop on the back of a flak jacket the shooter was wearing to pull him to the ground. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RICHARD FIERRO, U.S. ARMY VETERAN:  I proceeded to take his other weapon, the pistol, and then just start hitting him where I couldn't get. But the armor is in the way. And I just started -- I found a crease in his -- between his armor and his head, and I just started wailing away with his gun. And then I told the kid in front of me, kick him. Keep kicking him. And we were -- I was guiding people. I was telling people, call 911. Call 911. I brought him down. I -- I was in mode. I was doing what I did -- I do downrange. I trained for this. I don't want to ever do this. I didn't even retire because I was just -- I was done doing this stuff. It was too much. I told him while I was hitting him, I said: \"I'm going to kill you, man, because you tried to kill my friends.\" My family was in there. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Those cases were never adjudicated and the file was sealed. Now, the -- according to the DA, what we know is that if he would have purchased a weapon after that, it would have not come up in a background check. So that is the key point there, because those records were sealed. Now, we're also learning that the suspect changed his name back in 2016. This was just before his 16th birthday. His name was Nicholas F. Brink. And he changed it to his current name, Anderson L. Aldrich. And all of this is according to court documents out of Texas. Now, what we're learning is that, the year prior to that -- and this is according to some investigating that our CNN investigative unit has done -- they found that he was subject to vile bullying online. Now, all of this was pulled from Web sites that show that he was bullied. This Web site shows that he was mocked for his weight. He was accused of illicit activity. They were making fun of his grandmother for raising money for him. It was just very vicious, very insulting. And, Ana, we have to share that we don't know if any of this is related or even relevant. But, again, it just speaks to some of the background leading into this tragic incident -- Ana.",

This is the first hearing since the appointment of special counsel Jack Smith.And while he will not be here today, he has personally approved all of the arguments that prosecutors are going to make in this building behind me as they try to convince a panel of judges to do away with this requirement that a so-called special master review thousands of pages of documents that were obtained in that Mar-a-Lago search. The former president asked for this special master because he claimed that privileged material may have been swept up in that search. A lower court judge surprised a lot of people by granting that request. But, today, prosecutors are here to try to convince this panel to remove the special masters, so they can move this investigation along a lot faster. Time is, of course, of the essence, as they do not want this to extend too far in to the 2024 presidential cycle. We even heard the attorney general on Friday try to assure people that the appointment of a special counsel was not going to slow this down.",

The Supreme Court said he did have to appear, they were not going to get in the way of this. But they did carve out some areas where he will not have to answer questions. The courts have said that, if he's being asked about activity that would be related to his legislative activity, related to his decision about whether to certify the 2020 election, that is off the table. But they can ask him questions about his coordination with the Trump campaign. They can ask him any questions that might have to do with him cajoling election officials. And that's what the district attorney they're really wants to know. They want to know about Graham's calls to election officials, including one to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. Raffensperger came away from that call believing Graham was suggesting he should throw away ballots, perhaps in a way that would be favorable to Donald Trump. Graham has denied this. So that's really the heart at what the district attorney wants to get to before the grand jury today. And, again, we will see how far she gets with this testimony. Graham still has the opportunity to challenge specific questions, and we suspect he's doing exactly that before the grand jury.",

And I think, given what they said before there, there's a pretty good chance that they will reverse that order. For Smith, he's just come in and, like for everything else, quickly getting up to speed and has authorized, checked the box, saying, you may go in and do that. Everybody has a first day.

So we have an intersection of three viruses that are happening right now. And two of them actually, RSV and influenza, are peaking and coming very high earlier than we usually see them. So, RSV impacts the littlest children. We saw really high numbers of RSV earlier than we generally do. We are -- in some of those areas where he's seen high numbers, in the South-South Central region, even in the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest, we're starting to see some of those numbers come down and plateau, so we are hopeful for those continued trends. Influenza also peaked very -- is peaking earlier this year. We haven't seen influenza rates as high in a decade as we're seeing right now. So, in the big picture, what this means -- as we also worry about the contribution of COVID-19, in the big picture, what this means is to have really a three-pronged approach, first being get your vaccines for which you can get vaccinated, influenza, as well as COVID-19. Second, take those measures that you can take to protect yourself. Avoid people who are sick. Don't go out if you're sick yourself. Wash your hands. Consider wearing a mask, improved indoor ventilation. And then, if you are sick, present to your clinician, so that you can get those antivirals that you need.",

It's also the case that, right now, the viruses that are -- that -- are impacting children more frequently than some of our older adults. RSV is well-known to cause challenges with children during respiratory virus season. What we have seen is that, because of COVID, because of all the mitigation strategies that we have had over the last several years, many of those children did not get exposed to RSV. So we have several years of children who've never seen RSV before.
