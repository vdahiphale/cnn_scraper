OurWhite House Reporter Priscilla Alvarez joins us now from Washington.

      "sentences": "Well, he's still expected to tout these numbers and use as an example of an economy being on the righttrack, because as you point out, the expectations by economists were that these numbers were going to be around 170,000 -- they ended up over 300,000. And so, this is an opportunity for the President. And one of these he's going to use to try to tell Americans that the economy is on the right track, that the jobs market is strong and push a message that has been one that he seized on over the last year, which is Bidenomics and push that message through. Now, this is a message that could still be under strain and one that voters remain skeptical about because of high interest rates, nationwide labor strikes, as well as this month, resuming the repayment of student loans. So, it's still up against some cross currents. And really while the jobs work it, is signaling that it is strong and that it is adding jobs, a lot of Americans are really looking at their pocket and seeing these high interest rates and inflation is what makes them nervous about spending and the economy overall. And that is really the message that the President and the White House is trying to break through, is explaining the different dynamics that play here and that in the end, there should be confidence in the economy. So, that's a little bit of what we're expecting. Now, again as you mentioned, the Americans just based off surveys are skeptical of this and this is going to be an issue for the White House if they can't break through that messaging because it is a centerpiece of Biden's 2024 election. But the bottom line in what we're going to hear in these remarks is that the President reminding Americans of his Bidenomics strategy, which is focused on the middle class and trying to raise and elevate these numbers as a positive sign and one that Americans should have confidence in moving forward.",

You know, I think for the Federal Reserve, it's a bit of a complicated picture because it is alot stronger than I think even the Fed would like to see. But there were some sort of silver linings here, and I'll get to that in a moment. But I want to put in context, $336,000, Zain. If you look at job growth over the last year, we're talking about an average of about 267,000. And even that is above what we tend to see pre-pandemic. So, this is a very strong labor market. When we look at sectors and industries that add at the most, we're talking about leisure and hospitality. We saw some gains there that are even above the average monthly gain over the last year. Government employees also adding a nice job gain, 73,000, and healthcare adding 41,000. Here's the silver lining. When you look at wage growth, which has pretty significant inflationary impacts. That actually cooled a touch. So, we had been expecting on a monthly basis average hourly wages to increase 0.3 percent. They actually only increased 0.2 percent. So, this is important to the Fed and here's why. If you think about wages increasing, that's great news for workers. Everybody wants to make a little bit more, but the concern is if that becomes a vicious cycle. So, you're making more, you are spending more. You are -- companies have to pay you more, obviously, and so then they raise their prices and it becomes a sort of vicious cycle. We haven't necessarily seen a ton of evidence that that is happening, but that is the concern. So, for the American worker, you look at a report like this and you're like, great, job market is strong. But hey, by the way, inflation is still there and so it's hard to pay for certain things, hence the pessimism that American voters sometimes feel -- Priscilla laid it out really well there. If you're the Fed and you're looking at this report, it's -- the economy is hanging on strong, but perhaps a little too strong.",

Because you do have that divide, this idea that wages are rising, this idea that the economy -- the labor market is really strong right now. But again, as Priscilla was just talking about, ordinary Americans are just not feeling it. I mean, you touch on inflation, but just to give us more detail as to why.",

And this is a group, this is a committee that would ultimately decide when, in fact, we are in a recession. They date the recessions. And when I asked him to explain the disconnect between what we see in the data and the pessimism that we see in polling, the pessimism that we hear from voters, he said what's been really remarkable to him is just how significant inflation has been on the perception of the broader economy. And so, in terms of the President and the administration, I think this is going to be a real challenge for them. One thing that may be helping the administration moving forward is that gas prices have started to come back down. That was a pretty big concern for a lot of economists because, one, I mean, it's what a lot of us spend a lot of money on, but two, that has inflationary impacts and that has started to come back down. So, perhaps we hear the president. speak about that. That would certainly be something that might help him a bit. But in terms of inflation, people still feel it. People still feel pretty sour about the larger economy, even when the labor market remains red hot.",

So, you know, as a scientist, the scientists like that, you know, have a problem to solve, and, you know, it is -- we ask a questionand then we usually not get the answer, but with the experiment, but we get more and more questions. And actually, it was this messenger RNA is a fragile molecule. And at the beginning, like in the 1990s, other scientists started to use it. They tried to develop to therapeutic purposes. But you know, this RNA is a blueprint to produce protein, but when we deliver to the cells, very small amount of protein was produced, very short period of time and it seems like it will be not useful for anything. But what kept me going, that during the experimentation, changing certain elements, introducing new nucleotides, composition aid, purification and so on, eventually constantly the performance of this mRNA increased. And that's why it's important. You have to see the progress.",
