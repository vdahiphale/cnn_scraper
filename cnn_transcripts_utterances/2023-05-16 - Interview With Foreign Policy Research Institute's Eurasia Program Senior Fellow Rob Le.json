I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York Sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. CNN sources say Ukrainian forces are now using long-range storm shadow missiles from the U.K. to strike Russian targets. Their use comes just one week after the U.K. announced that it ahead and deliver them to Ukraine and at a time of increased pressure in the war-torn country. Russia launching a barrage of rockets on Kyiv just overnight, an attack Ukrainian officials have described as \"the maximum number of attacking missiles in the shortest time possible.\" However, they also say that the strikes did not hit their marks thanks to the U.S. made Patriot missile defense system. One U.S. system was likely damaged, but not destroyed as a result of the Russian attacks on and around Kyiv, a U.S. official tells CNN. Meantime, the Russian mercenary company army known as the Wagner Group is claiming an American citizen has been killed in the battle for Bakhmut. Joining me on all of this is correspondent Sam Kiley who is in Eastern Ukraine. Sam, good to see you. So, first, let me get you to weigh in any more insight into this claim from Yevgeny Prigozhin that an American citizen has been killed.",

But we do know that a person identified as an American and Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of the Wagner mercenary organization, released a video reporting to be in Bakhmut, reporting to show his identification documents. Those have been shared separately with me, with other foreign volunteers fighting in Bakhmut who have fought in Bakhmut. It is understood that he was, in all probability, actually fighting alongside Ukrainian special forces as part of a special forces' contingent there. And the Prigozhin statement is quite extraordinary by his standards. He actually shows a good, considerable respect for the dead fighter whom is shown in this video saying that he fought to the end and that he deserved to be covered in his national flag and his remains treated with respect and returned to his home nation. Now, as we say, we are waiting to officially confirm his nationality and his name, but it does appear that an American has been killed fighting in Bakhmut, by no means the first foreigner, by no means, sadly, the only America who has been killed there, but credit being given by his enemies in this remarkable video posted by the Wagner mercenary group.

Reporting for us from Eastern Ukraine.And many, including my next guest, believe that that counteroffensive that we have been anticipating from Ukraine, is now underway the past few days. I want to bring in Rob Lee. He is a veteran of the U.S. marines. He's a senior fellow in Foreign Policy Research Institute's Eurasia Program and a leading expert on Russian military affairs. He has recently co-authored a new insightful piece for \"Foreign Affairs\" magazine along with Mike Kaufman on the war in Ukraine that is getting a lot of buzz right now. Rob Lee, welcome to the program. It's good to see you. Let's first start talking about and picking up on the conversation about the Wagner Group and Yevgeny Prigozhin. And I'm just curious, given that the majority of casualties surrounding the fighting in Bakhmut are from Wagner, are you surprised by this latest leak of information from the U.S. intelligence, the discord leaks, suggesting that he offered Kyiv information on Russian troop positions in return for commanders, Ukrainian commanders, withdrawing their own soldiers from the area? ROB LEE, SENIOR FELLOW, FOREIGN POLICY RESEARCH INSTITUTE'S EURASIA PROGRAM: Yes. So, yes, I think it's not fully clear if that was a genuine proposal or not. But one thing to keep in mind, there's clearly by a (INAUDIBLE) command issue in this war for Russia where Prigozhin, Wagner kind of had their own incentives in what they were trying to pursue and it's kind of the broader war effort, and the two things don't always necessarily always intersect correctly. And so, at times, you know, the interest of Wagner may not kind of be aligned with what the Russian military wants. And a lot of time we hear this kind of bickering between Prigozhin and senior Russian defense official, I think that's kind of emblematic of that.",

And so, since then, the winner -- Russian mobilize, they have a lot -- they have a large mobilized military, but a lot of it is with trains, at the same time, they are more kind of public (ph) considerations about mobilized soldiers being killed, where's, you know, Wagner kind of started using convicts very early on, they use in a lower scale kind of way and they're using a more disposable way you can use Russian soldiers. And so, yes, the Russian military is now using convicts too, but basically, Wagner kind of developed a new system of doing this during this offensive when the Russian military lacked a lot of defensive capability and Wagner kind of stepped in and had its own way of kind of making up for that -- those kinds of weaknesses.",

And so, you know, to some extent, you know, maybe the situation is getting better. I think the big emphasis we are trying to make is that we are all focused on this upcoming Ukraine offensive. Ukraine will likely have success, although, you know, it probably won't end the war. And so, the big question is, you know, what happens, maybe in the fall or the winter, because the ammunition situation may become more difficult? We know that the U.S. has tapped into stockpiles to provide artillery ammunition for Ukraine for the last, you know, year, and that isn't a sustainable way of going forward. And so, there will be a question of, is there enough ammunition for Ukraine? Will that affect how they operate in the fall and winter and, you know, how can the West kind of support them properly enough so they can end this war on their terms?",

So, I mean, there's always been this kind of question, at least from the U.S. and other countries, whether or not there's this escalationrisk if Ukraine does make substantial gains and threatened, say, Crimea, to take back Crimea or other parts of the pre-February 24th borders, you know, is there an escalation risk there from Russia? I think that's always a concern in Washington and elsewhere. And so, I think there's been a balance there between the aid that Ukrainians receives where, yes, you know, there is a hope that Ukraine will take back territory but also concerned about where the potential escalation risks. And ultimately, you know, there is a question about, is there a gap between, you know, the political goal assault (ph) and the military equipment and other kinds of support being provided, and it seems that there is a bit of a disconnect. And, you know, again, going forward, maybe this will -- we'll figure this way out. The new aid packages from European countries kind of signal that direction. But again, I think it's something we have to think through and especially as expensive (ph) is how can we support Ukraine probably for the rest of the war so that they can still win?",

And you and Mike make a point in your piece that longer- term this could actually benefit Russia, not having a specific plan in place, even if this counteroffensive proves to be successful for Ukraine.And write, for Ukraine to sustain momentum and pressure, western states must make a set of commitments and plans for what follows this operation rather than maintain a wait and see approach. Otherwise, the West risks creating a situation whereby Russian forces are able to recover, stabilize their lines, and try to retake the initiative. I think that that's the point that we don't hear nearly enough. Talk about why that is so important to reinforce.",

But, you know, ultimately, thus far, it seems Putin's rule is still quite strong. I don't know if it's a great idea to expect something will come up, maybe something will, but I don't know if we can plan on that. And so, if you can't kind of make that assumption, then it has to be, well, you know, Ukraine is probably not positioned well for attrition of war with Russia, because Russia is a larger country, Russia can produce, you know, things, it doesn't have the same issues with defense industry (ph), while in Ukraine, which is obviously being targeted. And so, basically, you know, I think the West has kind of looked through and say, if Ukraine is not well positioned for an attritional fight, then, you know, Ukraine, you provide the kind of weapons or arms or equipment that they can give them the right advantage to overcome, you know, the natural advantage that Russia has long-term, and that might, you know, make sense to provide more systems in -- you know, sooner rather than later so that Ukraine can have that success as soon as possible.",

That having been said, are you surprised at the speed with which these soldiers, these Ukrainian troops, are able to train to use western equipment, more sophisticated equipment? This war began with their amusing Soviet weapons similar to that the Russians have been using and this Patriot system. I mean, they've been trained in just a matter of a few weeks. And from what we have seen, at least overnight, they seem to be operating this material quite well. Does that surprise you and are you encouraged that perhaps that could inspire more deliveries more quickly of additional western aid?",

Let's just leave it there. But are you seeing a change in that strategy? Just this week, we see President Zelenskyy touring through Europe, Germany signing off on another $3 billion in military aid, more tanks.

I think the U.K. mentioned also some long-range drones will be provided. All of those systems will provide Ukraine with qualitative advantage over Russia because as this war goes on Russia is increasingly tapping into older and older weapons and they're having difficulty producing new systems. So, all of those kinds of things will help Ukraine long-term, particularly the long-range weapons because that's something that Russia had a significant advantage on throughout this war and they've been able to do this kind of missile campaign without, you know, Ukraine being able to respond. But if Ukraine is getting those long-range weapons, it means that, you know, Russia's less kind of sanctuaries where it can have logistic hubs, command and control and Ukraine can now target those things. So, overtime, I think they will give Ukraine a greater quality of advantage and it gives them better chance for winning this war and retaking all their territory.",

You mentioned that Russia is now being forced for a litany of reasons, perhaps, just going through their artillery quickly, but alsobecause of western sanctions that they are now being forced to rely on 1950s and 1960s Soviet gear. There is talk, perhaps, of another Russian conscription coming sooner rather than later. We know last year Vladimir Putin was trying to hold off as long as he could on 300,000 Russian men being conscripted. How long do you think it will be before he is forced to do another round?",

TheRussian military setting up specialized kind of convict units, you know, the prospects of those are probably not great, as you can imagine. So, you know, during this counteroffensive, it -- you know, we'll see what kind of man power situation is, we learned how bad the manpower situation was in Kharkiv when Ukraine made those significant gains. If Ukraine is able to make some, you know, fast gains here again this upcoming counteroffensive, it might be clear that Russia's lacks in manpower. The problem though is that it's not just having enough manpower to having people who are trained, having the right weapons, equipment. So, things of that nature. So, you know, just, you know, in their mobilization rounds, it wouldn't necessarily fix all of the problems. And so, a lot of these problems are growing for the Russian military, and, you know, at what point does become a critical issue, you know, not fully clear. But, you know, one thing we can kind of point out is that Russia's winter offensive fails, and it's very clear that they didn't have the conditions to do an offensive operation successfully, but it's easier to defend. And so, defending -- especially when you trench, if you build sophisticated defense network and you have enough people to manage and also enough artillery, it's -- you know, you can still defend quite effectively, even with all of these issues. And so, it's still going to be important for Ukraine to really find a kind of weak points, execute their plan very effectively, and to use all of this kind of qualitative advantages that they're receiving as effectively as possible.",

ONDI TIMONER, FILMMAKER, \"LAST FLIGHT HOME\" AND DAUGHTER OF ELI TIMONER: Thank you, Bianna. It's great to be here. My father was the most extraordinary man that any of us ever knew. He founded an airline, the fastest-growing airline in the history of the world, when I was born. And by the time I was 10, his neck was cracked in a massage and he suffered a massive stroke, which caused him to be ousted from the airline that he created. But he never complained. He stayed positive. He stayed whip, smart, intelligent, funny, kind, generous. He just worried about all of us. And I think that's actually one of the greatest things I learned from him, was just to really focus on the people and loving and respecting the people around you, which something he taught all of us. So, when he made this plea after 48 years of living as a hemiplegic paralyzed and having lost his fortune and, you know, still positive and I'll be there, tenacious, when he finally said, I've got to go, it's my time, and he was terminally ill, he had COPD, he could have -- you know, he would die eventually, soon, probably within the next six months, but he really felt he needed to go right then. It was shocking, frankly. It was scary for all of us, for our family, but we had to support him. We had to stand behind him. He had done nothing but stand behind us all our lives. And so, we united as a family, and my brother, David, found that there was a law in California. We didn't even know that because we don't talk about death and dying in our society. And this law allowed him the right to choose a day upon which he would die, thanks to Medical Aid in Dying. And he chose March 3, 2021. And we had a 15-day waiting period where he had to prove he was making this decision of right mind and for all the right reasons, and it gave us a chance. Honestly, as a family, it gave us a chance as a family to come around him, to tell him and show him what he gave us and what he provided and to -- and we got closure, you know, even the grandkids, as you saw in the film --",
