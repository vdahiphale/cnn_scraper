      "sentences": "So, get this. A man was arrested Sunday after boarding a Delta flight with a boarding pass that was not his own. How he pulled it off is this -- by surreptitiously taking a photo of someone else's boarding pass waiting for the flight. Investigators say he took pictures of several people's boarding passes, actually, at the Salt Lake City Airport. He then used one of those photos to board a flight to Austin, Texas.He made it past the gate agent and then tried to hide in the plane's bathroom since he really didn't actually have a seat. The plane was taxiing when flight attendants realized what was happening and realized this. And now, the man claims that he did this because he'd been bumped from another flight on another airline and just really wanted to get home. A new toxicology report about Mitch McConnell's sister-in-law who died in a tragic accident shows that her blood alcohol level was .233, well over the legal limit, when this happened. The Blanco County Sheriff's Office says Angela Chao mistakenly backed into a pond at her home after dinner with friends on her family's ranch last month. Despite efforts to save her, she died after being submerged in the car for more than 20 minutes. And Sen. McConnell has cited this family tragedy is one of the reasons that he is stepping down from his leadership post. The longtime friend and interpreter of Los Angeles Dodgers superstar Shohei Ohtani has been fired. The reason why is wild. According to reporting from the L.A. Times, Ohtani's attorneys now accuse the man of massive theft after he allegedly used Ohtani's bank account to fund his gambling to the tune of millions of dollars -- bets he allegedly made with an illegal bookmaking operation. The now-former interpreter told ESPN though he did bet on sports, he never bet on Major League Baseball and said that Ohtani was not involved. Ohtani is the highest-paid athlete in North American sports history with his $700 million contract with the Dodgers -- John.",

      "sentences": "So, he's hoping or looking for any of two things to happen.First of all, Donald Trump has gone to the appellate division -- the appeals court in New York -- and asked them to either delay the bond or to reduce the amount. He writes in his brief that he has tried -- he has tried 30 different companies and he writes that posting a full bond here is, quote, \"a practical impossibility.\" Now, the A.G. filed a response last night and said we disagree. He needs to try different ways to do it. Appeals courts do, sometimes, come in and reduce the amounts of bonds -- sometimes, substantially. The other potential development that could bail Donald Trump out here is he could get a cash infusion. Someone could come along and give him -- loan him cash. We won't necessarily know who that is. That's a private transaction. Of course, journalists are going to press on figuring out who it is. So maybe he'll get a cash infusion. People have said well, how about his real estate? That's not going to work. He's not going to be able to sell off real estate between now and Monday. And I talked to bonding companies yesterday. They don't want real estate. It's too encumbered. It's too difficult. Not going to bail him out. The third thing -- keep an eye on this. Truth Social, Donald Trump's social media company -- they are likely going to go public tomorrow based on a shareholder vote. If that happens, Donald Trump owns somewhere between $2 billion and $4 billion -- with a \"b\" -- dollars of Truth Social stock. The problem is there's some skepticism about whether it's really worth that, and he can't sell it off for six months unless he gets a special waiver. So, maybe something about Truth Social can help him. Bankruptcy is a possibility. Now, bankruptcy -- people need to understand it's not a magic wand that makes every debt go away, but it would buy him time. Because if he declares bankruptcy, whatever the political embarrassment might be, it would put a stay -- a pause on all this collection.",

They could write reports, craft PowerPoint presentations, come up with song lyrics. They could even generate movie-quality videos or write news articles like the one I wrote on this report today. And it's awe-inspiring, but from the perspective of a worker, it's also kind of scary. So this report shows that White House officials -- they are thinkingdeeply about what AI means for the workforce, as they should, right? Because like any technology, this is going to help some workers by making them more efficient and it's going to hurt others. And so, they found that 20 percent of U.S. -- they are in jobs right now with high exposure to AI. These are the ones who are going to be most affected, either positively or negatively. But they had to really drill down on who is most vulnerable. They looked at which of those jobs have the most complex tasks. The thinking is that the more complex the job is the harder it is to be replaced by a robot. And they found that 10 percent of U.S. workers are in jobs with high exposure but low complexity, and those are the ones who are most vulnerable. And I talked to Jared Bernstein, the White House economist. He rejected the notion that all those jobs are going to go away. I mean, he pointed out that we still have humans flying planes even though autopilot has apparently been around for a century. But still, a large number of those 10 percent of those jobs, they're going to be vulnerable here.",

Compare that to six percent of people who have a bachelor's degree. There's also some interesting findings around income. High earners -- they have high exposure to AI but those jobs tend to be more complex. So again, they tend to be safer. What they found was that it's really the lower and middle earners who are most vulnerable to AI. And so, that's why this report found that there is the risk that AI could, quote, \"exacerbate aggregate income inequality if it substitutes for employment in lower-wage jobs and complements higher- wage jobs. Now, that warning is not really coming out of left field. We've heard similar warnings from the IMF. And the White House says listen, it's too early to say that AI is definitely going to make inequality worse, in part because that risk should inform policy. Jared Berstein -- he flat-out said we're not going to let technology worsen inequality. But we should note AI is moving really, really fast and no one really knows exactly how this is going to play out -- not the Fed, not the White House. Not even ChatGTP knows.",

Eva Burch shared a deeply personal story underscoring the real impact of abortion legislation on people's lives.Senator Burch told her colleagues that she recently discovered she was pregnant -- a pregnancy that she wants -- her family wants. But after hearing -- after a recent checkup, she's learned that she has to get an abortion because of her health and because of the condition of the baby. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) EVA BURCH, (D) ARIZONA STATE SENATOR:  After numerous ultrasounds and blood draws, we have determined that my pregnancy is, once again, not progressing and is not viable. And, once again, I have scheduled an appointment to terminate my pregnancy. I don't think people should have to justify their abortions but I'm choosing to talk about why I made this decision because I want us to be able to have meaningful conversations about the reality of how the work that we do in this body impacts people in the real world.

So thank you for coming on.You made very clear why you decided to speak out about this. That you're hoping to move this fight -- this debate around reproductive care and abortion into a conversation -- a more meaningful conversation than what you're seeing right now. What have you heard from people since telling your story this week? BURCH:  The response that I have had has been really overwhelming and honestly, it's been overwhelmingly positive. So many people who coming forward with their own stories and their own experiences. And I think that the most important thing that we can really get out of all of this is what should we be doing different. What should we be doing better at. And how did we get where we are now? And how do we go somewhere that's a more honest and accurate picture so that patients are having the experiences that they need and deserve in the clinical setting instead of having this mandated rhetoric that is really souring the experience and leading to potentially worse outcomes and just worse quality of care?",

But for whatever reason, I have had some difficulty. I know a lot of it probably has to do with my age. I didn't meet my husband until a little bit later in life and we have tried. But we've decided we're not going to try anymore. And I know people can be a little bit reluctant to ask about where I am in the process but I did have my procedure yesterday and I'm very comfortable talking about that if anybody has any questions about it. But that's something that -- it's the second time now that I felt like that was the right decision for me. And I think that we have this stigma that certain individuals try to push about who the abortion patient is and we need to have a more honest and accurate conversation about the abortion patient.",
