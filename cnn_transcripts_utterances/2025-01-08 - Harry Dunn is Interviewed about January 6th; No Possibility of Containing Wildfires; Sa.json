There were several more who showed up and defended the Capitol bravely. And those are the ones - the 140 that were injured, those are the ones who just reported. There were several other officers who just showed up the next day, rubbed some mud on it, as the saying goes, and just showed up and toughed it out. But it just goes to show that Donald Trump is, one, either misinformed, or, two, which I believe, is lying about what happened that day. He still calls - he calls it a day of love. The people that are sitting in jail now, they're not people who were peacefully protesting or were trespassing or, you know, milling around the Capitol Building. Those are the people - the people that are in jail are the ones that are - savagely attacked police officers, that beat police officers viciously. The ones that he's talking about, the peaceful protesters, they're not hostages. Those people got hit with misdemeanors, fines and probation. So, it's really - it's delusional. It's - it's - it's just - it's just flat out lying about what happened that day. And he's been doing it since January 7th.",

But when it comes to putting people who attack police officers back out on the street, I would love to know their thoughts on it or if they condemn it.I was glad to see that my former chief - chief manger put out a statement saying that he's against the pardons. Former Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund did the same also. But it's just always pushing back against it. That's what they do. They keep on pushing the narrative that nothing happens. It's their attempt to rewrite history. But we need to have people that are out there always pushing back against it and saying, hey, you know, this is what - this - this isn't what happened.

Shoring up Ukraine's security assistance and what they need in their urgent battlefield needs, both in the short term and the long term.

The defense contact group allows countries, partners, allies to come together to pool together resources. And it's not just a common cause, it's a common understanding of like-minded countries shoring up support for Ukraine to rush security assistance to the battlefield.Post January 20th, look, that is a decision that the incoming administration has had to make. But I will say, the Ukraine defense contact group has been one of the most successful, critical alliances in the last 30 years when it comes to getting assistance to a sovereign country in defending itself and proving to be successful on the battlefield. So, what the Trump administration, you know, continues to do, I think we've seen, within Congress at least, there is bipartisan support for shoring up Ukraine and continuing to get security assistance to Ukrainians on the battlefield.",

This town hall took place in January of 2024. President-elect Donald Trump was set to sit down with Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum. And the book says that his advisers were actually a little bit nervous about this because those two anchors are known to be a bit more of tough questioners to the president-elect, but he wanted to do it.But then, they hit the jackpot. Just about 30 minutes before they were set to go on stage, this book says that the team managed to get their hands on the questions. I'm going to read to you part of this excerpt. They say, \"about 30 minutes before the town hall was due to start, a senior aide started getting text messages from a person on the inside at Fox. Holy expletive the team thought. They were images of all the questions Trump would be asked, and the planned follow ups down to the exact wording. Jackpot. This was like a student getting a peek at the test before the exam started.\" Then they say that the team then had some time to workshop their answers about things like political retribution, and Trump ended up having like - was pretty cool about it in the town hall. Now, we of course, asked Fox News about this, and they say that, \"while we do not have any evidence of this occurring, and Alex Isenstadt has conveniently refused to release the images for fact checking, we take these matters very seriously and plan to investigate should there prove to be a breach within the network.\" Alex Isenstadt told me he has multiple sources on this.
