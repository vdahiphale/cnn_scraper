Sources say a list of names has been given to Israel and families have been notified. Hamas released 12 hostages at the Rafah Crossing on Tuesday -- 10 Israelis and two Thai nationals. Here is Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator):  We are committed to completing our missions -- freeing all of the hostages, eliminating this terrorist organization above and below ground, and, of course, to ensure that Gaza not return to being what it was and will no longer constitute a threat to the state of Israel.

Thank you so much for being here.Can you help us understand how this temporary truce is being seen and viewed in Israel? Is there public support for it as long as hostages keep getting released? SHLOMI ELDAR, ISRAELI JOURNALIST, HAS INTERVIEWED HAMAS' LEADER (via Webex by Cisco):  Of course. This is the main mission for the Israelis to release the hostages, but there is a dilemma. When Benjamin Netanyahu promised the Israeli audience that he can aim -- he can bring two missions. One of it, eliminate Hamas, and releasing the hostages. And I can see this all targeting -- all target can be -- goes together because Yahya Sinwar, the head of the Hamas in Gaza Strip -- he knows how to play the game. He promises well, OK, I release the civilians but he asks for ceasefire. And a ceasefire -- tomorrow, again, a ceasefire. And he tried to get the permanent ceasefire. And this is a dilemma. If you declare a permanent ceasefire you can forfeit the second mission -- eliminate Hamas. HUNT:  Right. That makes sense. As you point out, the hostages released so far have been women and children, by and large. You've interviewed Hamas leadership before. How much more complex will the negotiations be when this shifts to a different population of hostages -- to men and soldiers?",

Then they have about 80 soldiers.And I following Hamas for many, many years and now I am researching Yahya Sinwar's personality. And as I can understand, when he tried to negotiate the Israelis, he will ask two requests. One of it, permanent ceasefire. And the second, releasing all the prisoners from the Israeli prison. I don't see Israeli now can fulfill this request because when you declare ceasefire -- permanent ceasefire, this is the ending of the war. And I don't see Israelis release all the prisoners -- the Hamas prisoners from the Israeli prison. For example, one of them -- his name is Abdullah Barghouti. Abdullah Barghouti was sentenced for 46 life prison in the Israeli jails because he murdered 46 Israelis during the Second Intifada. I don't see Israel just releasing all of them. And, you know, for political reason, Netanyahu will refuse for it because if he released all the prisoners and declares a permanent ceasefire, this is the end of his political career.",

That's the advantage.And what they are likely to do, according to a memo that AFP released, is provide contact through voters and outreach on the ground, and money to support Haley. But beyond this, this is also just helpful to Haley because it builds momentum and hype. This has been a major talker in political circles over the last day or so, which is what Haley needs. We're at a point in this primary cycle where the real danger for any candidate is to disappear into the back of a voter's mind and be forgotten, and that's one advantage that an endorsement from AFP gives to Haley.",

Suffice to say that we are getting some interesting tidbits about the dynamic between the former president and House leadership at the time. I want to read you this exchange about Kevin McCarthy's now-infamous trip down to Mar-a-Lago in the wake of the January 6 attacks. Remember, before he did this, of course, he had condemned Trump on the House floor. Basically, he was being sent into political exile. So, Cheney says to him: \"Mar-a-Lago? What the hell, Kevin?\" And then McCarthy says, \"They're really worried. Trump's not eating, so they asked me to come see him.\" Cheney says, \"What? You went to Mar-a-Lago because Trump's not eating?\" McCarthy: \"Yeah, he's really depressed.\" Let's just pause there for a second. So we learned that McCarthy has gone down to Mar-a-Lago because Trump is not eating. I mean, this basically -- I mean, for context, this basically revived Trump in the eyes of the GOP.",

So, Kasie, good morning to you.So, what happens in any criminal case is you want if you're defending your client anything and everything that may possibly shine light on the potential innocence of your client. So as a practical matter, number one, there's something called Brady material -- Brady material. What is that? It's named after a case that says that anything that helps the accused must be turned over by the prosecution. So, step one is prosecutors, if they have something that could be helpful to the defendant, need to turn it over. I'm presuming that prosecutors have done that or they could -- you have a continuing obligation and you will continue to do that if you uncover it. Separate and apart from that, Kasie, is the defendant and their attorney's responsibility to try to get anything else that may potentially be helpful. So there's a distinction between a fishing expedition and something that may be relevant and material to your defense. A judge will ultimately conclude if there is any relevance at all with respect to this request. But I am one for broad discovery. Give me anything and everything and we can make a determination as to whether it assists, right? The last point, and that is that if you don't do it and you're the judge then it leads to the narrative oh, this is a witch hunt. I told you they're being unfair.",
