The victims bodies were found in two different locations at the school, five other people were wounded. They are hospitalized in critical condition right now. We know that this suspected gunman is a 43-year-old male, who is not affiliated with the school. Police say he took his own life last night after being tracked down by police off campus. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHRIS ROZMAN, INTERIM DEPUTY CHIEF, MSU DEPT. OF POLICE &amp; PUBLIC SAFETY:  The suspect in this incident was located outside of the MSU campus. It does appear that suspect has died from a self inflicted gunshot wound. It is confirmed that he is deceased. This truly has been a nightmare that we are living tonight. But we have remained laser focused on the safety of our campus, our students and our surrounding community. We are relieved to no longer have an active threat on campus, while we realize there is so much healing that will need to take place after this. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I work with a lot of colleges and universities. There is a lot of training in planning, in what we call a unified command, an incident command.The university believes are the first to know what will be going on. Most of these cases, obviously, it is not like this. In most cases on colleges and universities, you would have locals, and other surrounding areas join the effort, and then state, as we saw last night, even the federal government. I really do want -- we are living in a post-Uvalde world, and when there is an expectation that nothing good can happen in these incidents. I think that the quick reaction, the notification in real time to the community really did help save lives. The kids got inside, they locked down. And the consistent messaging once we sort of knew what was going on with the press conferences, and then also to families and parents, so for parents, they were rushing to the campus, they want to find the kids. And I felt they handled that very well. So, so far, I don't like saying that we have practice in this, we obviously do, but they had an expectation that something like this could happen, and they seem to have performed about as well as you can expect them to in those -- when it actually does happen.",

Remember, these reports at all yesterday, state media reported the Chinese have spotted the UFO out there, off an own coast and preparations underway to shoot it down. That seem to have vanished as well. So, a lot of this narrative from Beijing very much directly, and an audience at a time when nationalistic sentiments are very strong, on both sides, when tensions are high between the two governments. But that is the concern now, according to many analysts. That is, for example, this could embolden the Chinese military down the road to target U.S. reconnaissance assets in the region, and especially unmanned craft. But there is also a glimmer of hope now, this coming weekend, there is a narrow window and both countries, top diplomats, Secretary of State Blinken and his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, both men will be in Munich, Germany, for a security conference. So there is some speculation that they could meet on the sidelines. Obviously, that's no substitute for the now canceled Blinken visit to Beijing, but anything that kind of face time, at least the very constructive at this critical juncture, to prevent this relationship from going into a freefall -- Christine.",
