Drug use, sex for hire and allegations of violating state laws on statutory rape, all included in a house ethics committee report against former congressman and Donald Trump's first choice to become attorney general, Matt Gaetz. According to the 37-page report, the ethics committee finds that Gaetz, quote, regularly paid women for engaging in sexual activity with him. They also claim that in 2017, Gaetz, quote, engaged in sexual activity with a 17-year-old girl and that the congressman, quote, used or possessed illegal drugs, including cocaine and ecstasy. Now, to back up their findings, the committee also released pages of documents including text message screenshots between Gaetz and unnamed women and one of the exchanges. The committee says that Gaetz is asking a woman to get him drugs by referring to, quote, a full complement of party favors before asking her what will she be wearing to his hotel. Another screenshot shared by the committee an unnamed woman and Gaetz seemed to be arguing over pay when she says the Gaetz quote, so I'm not to be taken care of for last week? Gaetz responds saying, quote, I gave you 250 today and about last week says, quote, you gave me a drive by. Now, Gaetz denies paying women for sexual favors and lashed out at the committee for releasing the report. In a post on X, writing in part, they did this to me in a Christmas Eve-Eve report and not in a courtroom of any kind where I could present evidence and challenge witnesses. Lawmakers from both parties, now weighing in on the allegations against their former colleague and Trump's former pick to become attorney general. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And we've seen it more in terms of the nominees. In fact, Gaetz had been the nominee briefly for attorney general. And, so he's wanted to test like, will his party look at his win and see it as a mandate and see the threat of them facing primary opposition as a reason to fall in line.And in a couple of cases, we've seen the limits of that. One has been Gaetz nomination itself. There were too many Republicans in the Senate who just weren't going to go for it. But the House is a different story. The house districts tend to be much more gerrymandered. It's really hard to be a moderate, a Republican, moderate in most congressional seats around the United States. So, but the margins are going to be so narrow. The Republican majority is going to be so narrow as Donald Trump takes office, in part because he has pulled some House members in to serve in his administration, that really all it takes is a couple of Republicans to -- in the House to sort of fall out of line to halt him overall with legislation. And at the committee level, I think were also seeing the boundaries of that. There are some things and some people, and I think Matt Gaetz is one of the rare forces who unites most members of Congress. Not all, but most members of Congress. There are some limitations to that loyalty or following up on what Donald Trump has asked for.",
