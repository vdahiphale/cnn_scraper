We have had some resources come in. The federal government brought in their search and rescue teams. I heard overnight that more are coming in. We're looking for places to put them. The problem is there's just not a lot of real estate to put these teams in.Asheville sits inside of a bowl, inside of a mountain, so there's no flat ground to put them in. We can't put them in our hotels because there's no electric and no running water anywhere. So it's very, very difficult to find places for these teams. We need to find a flat ground so that we can build basically base camps to put as many of these responders in as we can. So we've got real problems here in Asheville and we're - I could say that the staff here in the city of Asheville are extremely dedicated, and we put together the infrastructure that we need internally to bring the aid and care to our residents. We just need the equipment and the food and the water from outside to get into here so that we can start giving it to our residents.

I knew that the increase will be ministries on the ground with the governor. They're bringing in more National Guard helicopters, Florida, sending helicopters up to the state. A lot of these areas are going to fly supplies in, so that's going to be a - it will be a short term solution. The big solution is getting more of those roads open up so you can get the supplies in there, not to mention the areas that are still cut off and I think that's why it's going to be a combination of getting roads open, but also using helicopters to get some of those outlying communities that the roads are just gone.",

Rather, I'd say it's the emergence of a new voter that is defying the stereotypical view of what we believe non-white or minority voters to be. It's not like people are saying, well, now maybe I'm pro-life and I was pro-choice or maybe I'm anti-tax and I was more pro-tax. It's simply this populism that is emergent as a function of youth.
