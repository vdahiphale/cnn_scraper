So, from the very beginning, the Marion County sheriff kept alluding to this idea that detectives were looking into whether or not at least one of these three teenagers that were killed were involved in some type of gang activity.I interviewed the sheriff earlier this week and I asked him, look, is this one -- is this going to be a case where possibly some of the folks that were in the car, some of the teens that died may not have known that one of their friends was involved in a gang. He said they were looking at that possibility. However, we now know this morning that, at least according to the sheriff, as well as the detectives in Marion County, it is now clear that all three teenagers that died were involved in some type of gang in Marion County. The one thing that was asked a couple of times throughout the news conference was exactly why these three suspects, the three people that are being charged in deeds, that's at least two that have been arrested, why did they turn on the three teenagers. We know they were all in this car together. We know that they knew each other, even if it was for a brief period of time, and at least, according to the sheriff, if they were all up to up to no good, if they were all doing -- breaking the law in Marion County, why at some point last Thursday that something happened inside of that car that would lead half of the group to kill the other three. The sheriff said that because they are still looking for that third person. He did not want to get into the specifics. But as he outlined in his news conference, they are -- at least two of the -- at least the two people that were arrested, these minors, have confessed to killing that third person that was found inside of Layla Silvernail's car.

As for the timeline, we know this happened last Thursday, Friday and Saturday. The last time this car was spotted by some surveillance cameras in Marion County was around 10On Friday, they find the body of a 17-year-old boy about a half mile from where they found Layla's body. And then on Saturday, they come across a third body that was about a few miles south of where the two other victims were found. The body of this 16-year-old, we now know, was found in the trunk of a car. The car in question here belonged to the first victim, Layla. So, again, we're waiting for that probable cause that should give us a little bit more information, some more names and some details. But, again, John, three -- two arrests have been made, and they are looking for a third in this investigation.",

And so far, since those air -- the Israeli airstrikes in Southern Lebanon this morning, things have been calm here but tense. The Israeli military is saying that it was striking and they're making pains to make this clear, Palestinian targets in Southern Lebanon, where they believe those dozens of rockets were fired from yesterday. They were trying to strike those. Lebanese security sources telling CNN that the places that were targeted were more open areas, more agricultural places where these militias were holding their weapons.And one thing that's been essentially made clear from both Lebanese politicians, not necessarily Hezbollah, of course, the militant group that controls Southern Lebanon, but Lebanese politicians as well as the Israelis, is that they have no interest in escalating this further because a bigger confrontation with Hezbollah, who has much, much greater arms and capabilities than a militant group like Hamas, well, that will be a huge, huge escalation. Take a listen to what the Israel Defense Forces international spokesperson told CNN just in the past hour. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. COL. RICHARD HECHT, INTERNATIONAL SPOKESPERSON, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES:  We want to deescalate. I mean, there's a very, very sensitive weekend ahead with Passover, Ramadan and Easter, all aligning. And we're looking for a -- hoping for a quiet weekend, although we had another attack right after the prayers in Jerusalem, in the Jordan Valley, but we're looking to deescalate. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The Israeli police saying that this was a Palestinian terror attack. No suspects have been caught yet.Meanwhile, most of the action, the cross-border, action actually between the Israeli military and Palestinian militants, have been down south in Gaza, the Israeli military carrying out several airstrikes overnight, they say, targeting Hamas targets. Militants have responded with more than 40 rockets fired back, material damage on both sides, including to a pediatric hospital in Gaza, but, thankfully, no injuries yet reported on either side. So, clearly, the situation may potentially be calming down, although Israeli reservists have now been called up, specifically to the air force, but citizens who live, Israeli citizens who live near Gaza have been told they no longer need to stay close to shelters.",

He is also a distinguished fellow with the Atlantic Council. Thank you, Ambassador, for coming and talking about this. There is a lot of fear right now that these exchanges of rockets between Israel and Lebanon might escalate into a full scale war that we saw back in 2006. Do you share are those concerns and are you heartened by what you just heard? You heard the lieutenant colonel with the IDF saying, we want to deescalate. You're also hearing some of that from Lebanon. DAN SHAPIRO, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO ISRAEL:  Well, this series of events has the feel of kind of kind of a coordinated assault by the network of proxies and terrorist organizations that Iran sponsors in the region, some Palestinians, some Lebanese, some Shia based in Syria. There have been attacks against Israel now from Syria, Gaza and Lebanon, all within the last week, as well as today's terrorist attack in the West Bank. That doesn't often happen at once. So far, the Israeli response has been relatively restrained in both Gaza and Lebanon, and that suggests that they are looking to avoid an escalation if at all possible. There was a helpful statement from the prime minister of Lebanon criticizing those who would use Lebanese territory to spark conflict, conflagrations in the region. So, hopefully, this round will be contained. I would certainly, though, not assume that even if it is contained, and that is the hope that we get to a quiet weekend for the holidays. I would not assume that Israel would not later find opportunities to strike at Iranian interests elsewhere in the region.",

People saw Israeli police beating people inside of that mosque, the holiest place, and police were faced with firecrackers coming at them.I think in 2021, there were clashes there at the mosque, and that was kind of the catalyst for the 11-day war.

Certainly, Israel has responsibilities to do its best to promote calm, especially at those holy sites, and it's, of course, always debatable that every single decision, if it's the right one, the operational decisions dealing with extremist groups who are positioning themselves in the mosque to try to provoke clashes. Sometimes you can find cause to try to do those things differently. But even if you can find fault with certain operational decisions, that's no justification for the array of attacks against Israel on three different fronts. That clearly means that somebody is behind all of this trying to strike a different tone and it's trying to actually escalate things in the region. So, now Israel has the responsibility to defend itself, and it has strong support from the United States to do so while still trying to deescalate and get back to quiet as soon as possible.",

We heard over and over again that people didn't like the way this played out. You're talking about three members who went to the floor to talk about gun violence, and the fact of the matter is they admitted they broke the rules. There was that bullhorn that was used on the floor of the House, but no one thinks that they should have been thrown out because of that move and in terms of when I say, no one, part of the Democratic Party. The Republicans have been very clear. They knew what they wanted to do yesterday. They saved the one member. Even she rubbed the fact that maybe race played a role in all of this that made a lot of people feel uneasy.

For those watching out there who know what that is, that's a very old programming language.A lot of the documents don't even get scanned in. There are workers who manually type digit by digit, the numbers from the paper return into the computer, which, as you can imagine, can result in a lot of human error, even if people are as fastidious as they can be. So, they need these I.T. upgrades. They have been asking for these I.T. upgrades for a very long time.
