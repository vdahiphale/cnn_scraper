Israel's military says it's preparing for combined and coordinated strikes from air, sea, and land. But we still have no word for on when. It's a response to the surprise attacks by Hamas on October 7th, in which Israel now says more than 1,400 people were killed. In Gaza, tens of thousands of people are moving southwards, despite the threat of aerial bombardment. Palestinian health authorities are accusing Israel of directly targeting medical staff, and their families. They also say that the death toll has now passed 2,600 lives. As aid groups say that they are rapidly running out of food and medical supplies. And on the diplomatic front, the U.S. secretary of state says he believes the Rafah border crossing between but Gaza and Egypt will be open to allow aides to reach those in desperate need. Israel also says it's working with the U.N. to establish a humanitarian zone in Gaza. But for many, time is running out. The U.N. say it's, quote, we only are on the verge of the abyss in the Middle East, and he's calling for immediate humanitarian access in Gaza and for the immediate release of the hostages being held by Hamas. CNN's Scott McLean has this report on how one city in Gaza south of Israel's evacuation line is coping. And I should warn you, this report does contain distressing images. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This is the frantic scene in front of the hospital in the city of Deir al- Balah. Constant wailing of sirens, and a steady stream of children carried desperately inside. Some bandaged, some seeming alert. Others, not moving at all.",

The U.N. says most people already lack access to water. Foreign aid is being sent by the plane load and truckload to Egypt in hopes of getting it into Gaza. But Egypt and Palestinians on the ground say that the roads near the border are too badly damaged from airstrikes, for trucks to pass. Sunday, CNN asked the IDF whether it was coordinating with the neighbors to ensure that supplies get in. LT. COL.

For years, they have been paying money to help their friends and neighbors in Gaza because they advocated peace, and all of a sudden, life was shattered, and the same, life was shattered for the Israeli nation.
