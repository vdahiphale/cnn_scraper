It follows an unprecedented attack on Israel, where at least 70 people and maybe more according to officials there are dead, and 985 wounded. Again, those numbers are probably already higher and expected to rise. The attack catching Israel by surprise. At sunrise, the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas launched their offensive by air, sea, and land. The fighters infiltrated Israeli towns and launched more than 3,000 rockets into Israel, according to officials there. Scenes of urban warfare as gunfights unfolded between Israel and Hamas. Israeli's president, Isaac Herzog, reacting in a statement saying, \"Today, we saw the true face of Hamas. A terrorist army whose only goal is the cold-blooded murder of innocent men, women, and children. I call upon the family of nations -- this war waged against us marks a line in the sand.\" Israel is now striking back launching its own airstrikes into Gaza, where Palestinians say hundreds have been killed. New video from CNN shows a tower collapsing in Gaza City following an airstrike. Israel also mobilizing its troops and calling up tens of thousands of reservists. We also heard just moments ago that major U.S. airlines including Delta and American Airlines are now canceling flights into Israel this weekend, according to FlightAware. CNN senior international correspondent Sam Kiley is joining me now. So, let's get the latest from what you know and some of the context, Sam.",

      "sentences": "Well, Christiane, what we know in terms of the death toll is that the Israelis are saying that they have now lost 70 people and some nearly 1,000 injured after this very complex attack that was launched completely unexpectedly by Hamas outside of the Gaza Strip, using rocket as largely as cover for very complex series of infiltrations by land, by sea, and in the air.Now, according to the Israeli Defense Forces, gun battles are continuing, Christiane. In a number of villages in Kibbutz's, on the outskirts of Gaza, that's inside Israeli territory. And we also saw earlier in the day, the militants able to attack a police station or attacking near a police station opening fire on civilians as well as attacking military bases. Two military bases have been under attack or the IDF said earlier on today, they'd even lost contact with one of those relatively small military bases down the side of the Gaza Strip. The Israelis have also lost a tank and the Hamas has claimed to have taken a number of people hostage. These hostages have been somewhat confirmed by the Israeli Defense Forces, saying that they are prisoners of war. That's an emphatic decision to take to describe them as such to make sure that they are treated properly under the terms of the Geneva Convention. And there's some video evidence too -- of civilians that have also been captured and taken hostage. Hamas says that they've all been taken many of these hostages have been taken inside the Gaza Strip. All this adding up to a catastrophic failure of intelligence for the Israelis. The likes of which haven't been seen since the Yom Kippur War, which perhaps by coincidence is almost 50 years ago, almost exactly too today. But on top of that, this is an ongoing operation where the pledge to strike back coming in -- coming from the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is saying that they will be -- Gaza will be hit by -- Hamas will be hit back in ways that they could not imagine. Now, the problem for the Israelis is that if indeed there are significant numbers of hostages inside the Gaza Strip, that kind of military operation is going to be extremely problematic. Inevitably, they will be described and probably used as human shields. This is Israeli soldiers and civilians in all probability. And on top of that, they've got the wider problem of a possible conflagration spreading into the West Bank and possibly even into South Lebanon. Christiane.",

It is probably inevitably what that Hamas group and other militant groups in Gaza have planned for. Their assumption will be that the Israelis want to go in on the ground, and they will have planned to counter measures at the very least to try to deal with that, firstly. Secondly, you've got the problem of the hostages. And thirdly, you have the problem of Israeli troops coming face to face with Hamas militants and other militants inside the Gaza Strip, making it an incredibly messy, very problematic environment to operate in militarily. You can't just go in and flat an entire area. There are many millions of -- 1-1/2 millions, I think, from memory, citizens, people living in Gaza. It's very densely populated, there are tower blocks all over we've seen the Israelis striking at what they say are Hamas headquarters and other locations in numerous strikes already around the Gaza Strip. But inevitably, I think there's going to be call for a ground incursion. That is probably what Hamas kind of wants. That is part of their trap and planning, I suspect. Christiane.",

NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (voice over): Yes, Christiane. We just landed in Ben Gurion Airport a few minutes ago. Quite safe, touchdown and landings. We got off the plane onto buses. Heading across the tarmac, the siren sounded. The bus stopped, everyone got off the bus and lay on the on the tarmac, try to hide behind bits of airport equipment out there. And overhead, we could hear above the sound of the sirens we could hear the sound of what seemed to be Iron Dome intercept missiles, banging in the sky above us. I didn't lose count of how many there were, perhaps, I would say, 50 -- more than -- more than 50 banging from the sky above us.

There could be an eruption in the West Bank. More terror attacks there that have been occurring off and on. There could be an explosion in Jerusalem, highly sensitive for religious reasons. And then, of course, the Arab sector in Israel could well explode in this situation. So, it's like five France, that could develop as a result of the starting of this war. And Israel's response, because Israel is going to go in with great anger into Gaza. And I was fear that thousands of Palestinians will die in the next week or so.

That -- that's going to fall on deaf ears.So, he's got to work the others as well.

But yes, also, there has to be connection with the Palestinian Authority, and to actually talk to people there about peace. You also may have heard Mustafa Barghouti, very senior Palestinian in the West Bank, talk about, this is a 56-year occupation, and we too, have our right to self-defense.

And indeed, straight afterwards, Henry Kissinger was able to launch a peace negotiation, because there was an Arab partner, leader of Egypt that was capable and intent upon making peace.Here we have Hamas, which is intent on destroying Israel, and the Palestinian Authority, which has no legitimacy before this crisis erupted. And certainly, now, will have no legitimacy if it holds down an olive branch to Israel. So, the circumstances are very different and much more difficult to say, how a political process can come out of that. Having said that, Israel doesn't have a solution, other than to try to restore to turrets, which obviously just broke down. That will probably require Israel to going on the ground in Gaza, and you've already been discussing the consequences of that. Once Israel gets into Gaza, the question is, who do they get out in favor of? Who will take control of Gaza, if they destroy Hamas there, if they can? And that is an impossible situation for Israel. They don't want to occupy Gaza, but they can't make peace with Hamas. And so, you have a situation here, which is not ripe for any political process for the time being. AMANPOUR: And it has ever been so, ambassador, because each time we've seen these, and this, obviously, is the most daring and deadly attack by Hamas in all the decades that this standoff has been going on. But in every time we've seen this, we've had war, we've had Israelis killed, we've had, you know, the Israelis repeating or rather retaliating into Gaza. Then, as even, you know, Ehud Olmert said, you know, then comes the public opinion, because so many civilians are killed inside Gaza. And then, the whole cycle continues, and nothing is resolved. It just keeps getting kicked down the -- down the road. Do you think that's what's happening? Or is this a much more serious threat to Israel than you've ever seen?",

Afraid of the impending Saudi-Israeli peace, which may result in Saudi nuclearization. It could -- they're afraid of Donald Trump returning to the presidency.

And indeed, I don't think anybody's talking very much about the Saudi- Israeli peace today. And yes, this could escalate.

Those rockets are buried underneath 200 villages in South Lebanon. In houses, and those houses are occupied by families. And the Israeli army has been training to go into South Lebanon and fighting village, house to house. We are been talking about a potential regional conflict. This is the beginning. It is not even the end of the beginning. And people in Washington, I believe have to be thinking about, a: how the United States will stand behind Israel in this conflict?

He doesn't run again, because he knows that Hamas would take over the West Bank in any open election. Now, imagine if there were a Palestinian state in Judea, Samaria, and the West Bank. Imagine if this has happened not in these relatively sparsely populated Israeli border settlements along the Gaza Strip, but it happening in Jerusalem. I live in South Tel Aviv. I see Hebron from my back window. So, Israelis is -- and again, I can't speak for a government, I think I can speak for the majority of Israelis saying we would very much desire to have a solution to the Palestinian problem, to have peace with our Palestinian neighbors. Of course, we want that. But right now, what does it mean to have a Palestinian state that's going to turn into Gaza?

We prevent Hamas from knocking them off. And it's very disturbing to listen to his interview, and say, we have a right to defend ourselves.

I watched a picture on Twitter this morning of a Palestinian terrorists making a V sign over, probably a 90-year-old Israeli woman in a -- in a wheelchair.

And I want to read this to you from the Israeli Civil Aviation Authority that they sent to the FAA here in the United States: \"The ongoing conflict in the region between Israel and Gaza-based extremists militants, operators are advised to review current security threat information and notices to pilots.\" The thing they are underscoring here is to expect delays and maybe even carry extra fuel because of what is happening in the area. We just checked FlightAware, that 43 flights into the Tel Aviv airport, Ben Gurion, the main international airport there in Israel, have been canceled, 15 percent in total, 21 percent delayed. What's happening now here in the USA is that airlines that operate flights to Israel are canceling those flights. Delta and American Airlines both have flights from JFK planned for today and tomorrow. Those have both been canceled. United Airlines has canceled a flight tomorrow. In fact, it had a flight in route to Tel Aviv from San Francisco today. It's a 13-hour journey. About seven hours into it, the airline decided it was simply too risky and turned the flight around and on the way back to San Francisco. So really a flight from hell for folks in route to Tel Aviv.

And actually, until recently, they had said, look, I think we are -- at least indicated, I think we are close to getting this across the finish line, if Israelis would be OK with some of these concessions that we are pushing forward to be made it to the Palestinians. Again, we are in a completely new world now, given the scenes coming out of Israel, given the scenes that are coming out of the ground over there, and given just sort of the scale of the attack that we are seeing that, again, Israelis just seem completely unprepared for and unaware of were coming their way.",

He's a former CIA operator. Bob, welcome to the program. You have spent a lot of time studying and even meeting members of Hamas. This is a very sophisticated operation, am I right? BOB BAER, CNN INTELLIGENCE &amp; SECURITY ANALYST: It is extremely sophisticated. They've gotten better over the years. One, they've gotten off telephones entirely, no cell phones, no land lines. They know the exchanges, for instance, in Gaza are run by Israeli intelligence. So they listen to everything. That Palestinians have figured this out. They've moved all of their operations out of bases, what we may call bases, into apartments, into basements. They are scattered. They depend upon the strength of weak ties. That means messages are sent by courier and guerrilla warfare cells that don't know each other. So effectively, they defeated Israeli intelligence. I will not call this an Israeli intelligence failure as such because Gaza progressively, over the years, they've gotten out of touch with the Palestinians there. For instance, Israeli intelligence officer wouldn't dare go into Gaza because they would get caught and put in a basement.",

What they would like to do is draw Hezbollah into this. Apparently, it has 150,000 rockets buried in southern Lebanon. They would like Hezbollah to open up on Israel. And also in Jordan. They want to destabilize the Jordanian government, too, and get the Palestinians there to react. And then, of course, there's Syria. So Israel is in a very bad neighborhood. And Hamas' hope -- and I don't know what's going to come about -- is to really, you know, inflame this thing all through the Middle East, and especially break any relations between Saudi Arabia and Tel Aviv.",

So this has become a very disciplined organization. I mean, you go back to the engineer who was killed with a cell phone that exploded. They learned a lesson from that. But more than that, the Israelis don't have any good human sources inside Gaza. Otherwise, they would have found out about this. So it's very much a black hole for the Israelis. And there's no easy out. What Netanyahu is left with is simply bombarding Gaza, but that is going to risk, as we've been talking about, a regional war.",
