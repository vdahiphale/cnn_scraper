      "sentences": "Yes, Poppy. The stakes are so much higher now for Hunter Biden. Now, you may recall that back in July, Hunter Biden walked into a federal courtroom expecting to plead guilty to two tax misdemeanors with a probation sentence attached. That deal fell apart at the last minute.Now, let's look at how things have changed. Now, Hunter Biden is looking at nine separate charges, tax evasion, tax fraud, and non- payment of taxes. And really importantly, these two, there's one count of evasion, two counts of fraud, these are felonies now, much more serious. Tax evasion carries a max sentence of five years. Fraud carries a max sentence of three years. Nobody gets the max, but much more serious than before. Now, if we look at the indictment, this alleges a scheme covering four years, 2016 through and including 2019. The allegation is that during that time, Hunter Biden made around $7 million in income primarily from foreign companies in Ukraine and China. It doesn't allege that those were bribes, does not allege Hunter Biden was engaged in illegal influence peddling as a lobbyist, but makes clear he did not do actual work meriting $7 million worth of income. And the allegation is that he failed to pay and committed fraud with respect to about $1.4 million in taxes owed. Now, the indictment lays out in detail the way Hunter Biden would allegedly commit this fraud. For example, he took false business deductions. The indictment alleges as one example that in 2018, he claimed he had $388,000 worth of business travel, but, in fact, the allegation is he was doing no business, no real work. So, he writes that off and that's a fraud. The indictment also details lavish personal spending by Hunter Biden, $4.8 million worth of money that the government says he could have easily paid back instead of used on personal expenses ranging from cars and clothes to quote unquote, adult entertainment. One other interesting thing from the indictment, the sources of evidence that DOJ uses, they use Hunter Biden's memoir. They use things he says in his book against him. It's quoted extensively in the indictment. That's fair play. It's a statement by Hunter Biden. And they used certain texts from Hunter Biden, including one that references taxes. It's not exactly a smoking gun, but they say, well, look, he knew he had to pay taxes. He knew he owed these.",

But that's not the crime. The indictment makes clear, there is no charge. There could have been a charge of bribery if there was bribery. There could have been a charge of foreign lobbying if that was the case. There is no such charge. The crime here is the tax part of that.

I don't think anyone would consider Ken Cheseboro a household name, but he was at the center of a key part of Donald Trump's effort to overturn the 2020 election, that was this effort to put forward fake electors in seven key battleground states. And as you've mentioned, he's already pled of guilty to a related crime in the Georgia state level investigation into Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election.And now prosecutors in at least four other states also want to talk to Ken Cheseboro. They're conducting their own investigations into the fake electors that were put forward in their states. They want to know how those electors were organized, why they signed these fake certificates that were submitted to Congress and ultimately rejected by when Mike Pence declined to overturn the election on January 6. But it remains to be seen really how much help Ken Cheseboro can be to these state level investigations. We've already seen criminal charges be brought down in two of them. Nevada recently, just as recently as this week, indicted all six of their fake electors after talking to Ken Cheseboro. So, we're going to have to wait and see what the ultimate result of these state level investigations is. But that's not even to count in Jack Smith's federal indictment that does list Ken Cheseboro as an unindicted co conspirator. Of course, Donald Trump is the only one indicted and charged in the federal probe, but Ken Cheseboro could be involved down the line in that one as well. MATTINGLY:  Yes, a key player.

Fortunately, he was only lightly wounded. So, they've really analyzed every aspect of this incident, and they've come to the conclusion that they were targeted by an Israeli tank. Now, we were also that day on the border in a different location, essentially doing the same thing. We were out in the open wearing flat jackets, marked press with a car, marked T.V., as they were in the open. They were in that location for about an hour, and then they came under fire, first with one tank round and just about 45 seconds later with another. Now, this investigation says that these investigations say that the Israelis deliberately targeted the journalists because it was obvious that's who they were. Now just give me one more second. The IDF says they're investigating, they haven't reached a conclusion, but it's important to keep in mind that this is not the first time the journalists have died as a result in this conflict. And the Israeli human rights group, B'Tselem, has investigated all the IDF investigations and said they tend to be, this is their words, organized cover-ups aimed not to bring about truth and accountability, but on the contrary, to prevent that.
