And that number, unfortunately, will no doubt grow. Already we're seeing water tall enough to brush away cars and submerge storefronts already.

But we are coming out of a low tide cycle.Now according to the Mayor, and our own internal CNN projections on tides, this area has high tide about 2 pm. So there's a combination of factors here that are going to help increase the water over this flooded roadway. That's a major thoroughfare by the way for Tampa, which is just directly over my right hand shoulder. You can see the flooded roads directly behind this have been a very active kind of chaotic scene through the course of the day because people don't typically see the water over both avenues. Both parts of this Boulevard it actually started to make its way earlier this morning and to some of the first few blocks inland from Tampa Bay, which was extremely angry earlier today. The factors here for storm surge have all come together, unfortunately, because we have this full moon that's also coinciding with king tide. And then also that surge of water behind an incredibly powerful hurricane and the inland flood threat that's kind of working together to create this increasing storm surge threat right along the Tampa Bay region. Now the forecast was four to six feet that was realized, in fact, some preliminary records were set for storm surge in and around this area. And you know, look, you don't have to live here to necessarily understand how impactful this can be. This was lapping up against people's doorsteps, their front yards, and you know that was threatening your home threatening your property. The storm means business and it's not exactly over just yet even though the water has receded somewhat. We still anticipate that secondary surge with another high tide cycle coming around 2 pm this afternoon. So Dana, we're going to monitor that very closely. Not to mention the feeder bands from this hurricane that continues to impact this area. We will get this occasional tropical storm force gusts that just basically slapped us over the face with stinging rain and powerful wind gusts that are just going to help continue to push that water on shore along the Tampa Bay, Dana.",

The Epicenter the eye of the Storm less than 20 miles to our north so it could have been a lot worse, we actually went down to the sea hag marina where John Berman was doing his live shots yesterday. [12:05:00] They had significant flooding a little higher about a foot higher than the 2016 record, but not nearly as bad as it could have been too early to assess the damage here.

You can see behind me some of the trees that line these streets all around this area, you know, trees, much bigger than this much bigger than this have fallen down and blocked the roads. It's going to be very hard for some of the recovery teams to get there where they need to go at least in the short term Dana.

It hasn't stopped businesses from trying to get ready. As you can see, they put sandbags out. And I'm trying to seal some of these doors with tape. That's what they're worried especially in the low line areas, in terms of just how much water could be coming through here because everyone's worried about storm surge. You can hear the wind gust of course that is happening. We're getting 30 to 40 mile per hour wind gusts throughout the day. A little further south from here in Richmond Hill, they've been dealing with a lot of water as well in terms of rain. But as we walk down this way, and we go toward the bridge, you can tell how amazingly dry it is because it hasn't started raining yet. But they're trying to get everyone prepared for this because in low lying areas where they deal with storm water, and heavy rains all the time. It's all about preparation to make sure people are off the roads, make sure businesses are prepared. Now we've also been told that city operations have slowed down to a certain extent they brought in all necessary staff just in case they have any sort of situations. But as of right now it's dry.
