They woke up confident this morning that ultimately their candidate was going to win, that Donald Trump would win this race. But when I was talking to them about what they thought the next few days were going to look like one, they thought that this would go on for several days.They did not think that the numbers would be as generous as they are. As with the numbers have been coming in, as they have been reported. And they also had counseled Donald Trump that there would likely not be any kind of decision within the next 24 hours or so. Donald Trump himself was frustrated about that, and was saying that he wanted to know what the outcome of this race was going to be tonight. And he said, Kristen, that he had not prepared a speech. And obviously, we are seeing now the Trump campaign in real time, as we've been talking to them, are adjusting to what they've been watching play out over the last three or four hours or so.",

He was watching those results come in, but as you said, he still couldn't understand why they weren't going to get the results tonight.Now obviously we're seeing a lot more of these states being called right now than even his own team anticipated. I was told that they were looking very carefully at Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, and they thought that maybe they would have some idea by tomorrow what those results would look like. But as we're seeing those results coming in, there's so much more of that vote counted in these states than they even anticipated. So, clearly that shifted their entire mentality around this.

And you just think of -- I was there at Trump's victory party in 2016 when he first won, and the entire room was shell shocked after he won Florida, that he had actually won that election. He himself was stunned by winning.And it was kind of surreal moment to see Trump and his family on stage as he was speaking. Then, of course, we all know what happened four years ago, when he came out and spoke and declared victory that was not his and never would become his, which belonged to Joe Biden. And so, I think the question for a lot of people watching now is what he is going to say tonight, as he's going to come out and the race has obviously not been called yet?

The difference between now and 2020 is that their internal polling was showing them a lot of these kind of numbers.Maybe not exactly obviously, as you said, they were even surprised by how generous some of the numbers were but they did believe they had a real path towards winning, unlike in 2020 when that seemed a lot more uncertain which meant that Donald Trump went into this in a very different way. So, his speech that he gave, obviously in 2020 declaring victory when he did not win the election. We'll see what he says tonight because we know that again, he was in a different place.

He could get a congressional vote there. There's another one at Maine he could possibly get. But if you just look out here, he is almost certain to get this. The State of Alaska has a vote Democrat forever. That would get him to 268.So, you're at the point right now, Jake. We're picket, right? Just picket. Let's be one congressional -- he could possibly win both in Nebraska. That would get him to 270 assuming he wins Alaska, which I think is a pretty safe bet. And you just look at the map, right? Unlikely to get, you know, any of these over here. He might could possibly get an electoral vote out of Maine. But he's leading here, leading here, leading here and leading there. And he needs two. He needs two. So, you know, if he gets that one and that one, he's way up. And if he holds -- keeps holding these. Now that's where he was, you know, when he won, he was at 304, 306, that would be 310. 310 if he sweeps. There's no guarantee he's going to sweep, by any means, but he's leading in enough states right now. Plus there's a couple other congressional districts on the board where he could -- he could, could, emphasis on, could, pass 310 electoral votes. You come back to where we are now, though. He's just in a commanding position. And let's do the math the other way. OK? Which is what gets interesting, right? This -- so this is where -- this is now red in our count. There we go. That gets Donald Trump there. Here's the challenge. When you do the math the other way. You assume that stays for the Republican. Let's just, for the sake of argument, big comeback for the Democrat. Big comeback for the Democrat. Democrat holds New Mexico. Holds Minnesota. Excuse me for that one. Wins Wisconsin wins Michigan. See this count? See this count? It's New Jersey. There's Connecticut, there's New Hampshire. Pop it out. What do you want to pick? You want to go state? Well, you could even go statewide. It's not going to happen, but let's say statewide, right? You do all the Maine, you come back out. What does that get you? Right? So, it comes down to this, if she wins everything, if she wins everything. The Pennsylvania is what makes Donald Trump again -- we're not done until we're done. But Pennsylvania, in every path she had, any reasonable, plausible path to 270 included the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for the Vice President of the United States. So, you get to a place now where, as you come back over here. You're just looking at this map, and you're saying, you know, is she going to win Alaska? No one's going to Vegas on that one. So where is she in any of these? Do you start coming back? You know, is there any way to come back? 73 percent of the vote? It's 266,000 votes. Again, you know, let's just look at the live outstanding vote. Move this up so you can see it better, yes, yes, the outstanding vote in Michigan is disproportionately Democratic but there are a fair amount. See those big red circles? Fair amount of Republican votes out there. We have a 266,000-vote lead, and a map that looks like that of what votes out, again, I don't do impossibles but I do improbables and that's improbable. You come over here to Wisconsin again, 119,000 votes ahead. That's come down a little tiny bit. It has, but it's a state won by 22,000 votes in the last two elections and Donald Trump is ahead at the moment by 119,000 votes. And so again, you're looking at what's left. You're at 92 percent. Sure. The biggest is here. But look at those are modest circles for Republican votes as well. [02:10:03] Essentially, in chess, she's blocked. Donald Trump is not across the line yet, because we have more states to go through but she is essentially blocked from getting to 270.",

And when it came to the performance of Joe Biden, it was 41 percent to approve to 58 percent disapprove.So, she had an enormous burden and, you know, people are unhappy with the way the Biden-Harris administration has run this country for the last four years, and she did not succeed. I'm not sure it was possible for her to succeed in somehow positioning herself as an agent of change and distancing herself from Biden. There's another part of the story that we got to talk about which is Donald Trump. The fact is that when you go back to January 6 of 2021 to today, it is an extraordinary comeback. He was a pariah when he left town on January 20th. Refused to even go to the inauguration. There was -- the vast majority of members of his own party wouldn't be seen with him. He, you know, over the course of the four years, he proceeds to win himself back into the party. Declares, right after the tremendous defeat of the -- of the Republicans.
