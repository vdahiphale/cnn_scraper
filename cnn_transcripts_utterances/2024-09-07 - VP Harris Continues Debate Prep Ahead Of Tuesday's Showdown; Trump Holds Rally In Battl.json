It will be a pivotal test for Harris as she attempts to win over undecided voters and prove she can prosecute the case against her Republican rival. Right now, she's in Pittsburgh with a small team of advisers where she's been in debate prep since Thursday. That's where we also find CNN's Eva McKend, who's been traveling with the vice president.

She visited a spice shop today where she gave hugs and shook hands. One woman got very emotional, tearing up at the opportunity to meet her.

He said for the first time, I haven't heard this before from him, that he would look into modifying the 25th Amendment. I want you to take a listen to what he said and then I'll break it down for you. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: And finally I will support modifying the 25th Amendment to make clear that if a vice president lies or engages in a conspiracy to cover up the incapacity of the president of the United States, if you do that with a cover up of the president of the United States, it's grounds for impeachment immediately and removal from office.

So as you heard him say there it'd be grounds for impeachment or immediate removal from office.Of course, this is part of Donald Trump's effort to paint Kamala Harris as being responsible for what they are arguing is Biden's inability to serve as president. But to move away from that, I want to give you more insight into why he was in Wisconsin today. First of all, we know how important of a battleground state this is, not just for Trump's campaign for, but also for Kamala Harris'. It's even more important though now that Harris is the one at the top up of the ticket. Prior to Joe Biden ending his campaign over the summer, Trump's campaign was very confident about his chances of securing the state, even though he had lost it to Biden in 2020. They really see this as being key to his pathway to securing 270 electoral votes come November. But now recent polling, including our own recent poll, released last week shows that Harris has actually doing better than Donald Trump. It's very close, of course, but she has made up a lot of ground here. So you're going to see a lot more of Donald Trump in the weeks to come. And one other notable thing from today, Jessica, is that Donald Trump spent a lot of time talking about the economy. We know that not only does Donald Trump believe that it is the most important issue to voters, but that he's also polling better than Harris on the issue. We actually saw him on Thursday, walk through for the first time the specifics of what his economic policy would look like if elected. He talked about gutting regulations, about lowering the corporate tax rate further to 15 percent, about imposing sweeping tariffs on imports. Although I will note that during that speech, he did not necessarily address some of the implications of those policies, including how many economists argue that such tariffs would create inflation. But again, the economy is such an important issue for Donald Trump. He talked about that a lot today here in Wisconsin and you're also going to hear a lot of those same messaging points on Tuesday on the debate stage, Jessica.",

Thanks so much for being here with us. You were also in Pittsburgh where we just talked to Eva McKend, where Vice President Kamala Harris is preparing for her debate. We're going to get to that in just a moment, but we just heard from our colleague, Alayna Treene, of course, Trump campaigning in Wisconsin today, back in a swing-state. We've seen him go to places just like new jersey over the summer, not necessarily battleground state. What does it tell you that he's back in Wisconsin and do you think he had effective messaging there at his very long rally today? TOLUSE OLORUNNIPA, WHITE HOUSE BUREAU CHIEF, \"THE WASHINGTON POST\": It was a very long rally. The former president is trying to carve out a path to 270. He realizes that going to places like Montana and New Jersey is not going to really help him. So he is focusing on swing states. His aides say he's getting much more serious about the effort to win another term in office and we're going to see how serious he is when he gets on the debate stage with Kamala Harris, whether or not he will prosecute a message that is clear and concise; or whether or not hell go off on tangents, a lot of which he did today during his rally. That is going to be a big question about whether or not he can put together the kind of coalition that he's going to need to defeat Kamala Harris. So far, it seems like he is vintage Trump playing to his base, not really expanding the tent. And whether or not he is able to go beyond that on the debate stage, I think is going to a big question for how the rest of the campaign looks.",

She's going to have to wait her turn.

But it also showcases that Kamala Harris is trying to broaden her tent. She is trying to make outreach to some of these Republicans, while also unifying and keeping Democrats behind her. And so she said today that she was honored to have Dick Cheney's endorsement, which was sort of a strange moment hearing that from a Democratic candidate. But it's clear that she is trying to turn the page on Donald Trump. She used those words exactly. She's trying to present the country with a path forward that would allow them to say, we can go back to our normal Republican versus Democratic battles, but we have to leave Trump in the back, in the dustbin of history and allow this candidacy of Kamala Harris to turn the page from the Trump era.

What hasn't been fully explored are the pressure points, both in terms of the threats that could be used for either party if they are unwilling to agree to the deal. But also in terms of creating a more pressurized environment. Burns and others have done yeoman's work trying to negotiate this. But it may be time for shuttle diplomacy at the highest level. As the correspondent reported, the issue is of the highest importance to President Biden. He recognizes that he's going to be leaving this issue to his successor, whether that's Kamala Harris or Donald Trump. And as a responsible public leader, he wants to put them in the best possible position. It is time for the president to consider going out himself and potentially shuttling between Israel, Egypt and Qatar to create the pressure-cooker environment in which it might be easier to get both sides to make the necessary compromises. It's difficult, given that Sinwar is in Gaza and difficult to reach. But he still would be in a position to move between the Israelis and Qataris and Egyptians, as the mediators, and seek to mobilize as much pressure on them to come to a decision. And it's much harder to say no to the president of the United States, when he's standing in your presence, than it is saying no to a sheet of paper that is disconnected from the White House. So in his last months in office, one of the greatest contributions he could make is using his remaining political capital, using his prestige and putting them on the table in service of a ceasefire so that we can move on to a different phase. And hopefully, rebuilding both in Gaza and rebuilding more generally in the region.",

And they think that they know exactly what the problem was. They think that they know what the fix is. It's going to be a question of how long that takes and how much money they have to spend a fix it. Both NASA and Boeing have said they're going to press ahead. So hopefully, they can get this thing redesigned and fixed. And the next flight will be with astronauts on a normal operational mission. But that's still to be determined.",

Ended up being a month. So I went from six to seven months, which isn't too terrible. They're going from eight days to eight months. So that's a little bit bigger -- a little bit bigger of a change. Now they're astronauts. I'm sure they're enjoying their time in space. You know, they've both flown long-duration missions before, so they know what to expect.

He wrote that he wanted to, quote, \"kill as many Jewish civilians as possible.\" Now, Khan had been communicating on an encrypted messaging app. And while he was using that app, talking to people, he was actually in communication with two undercover law enforcement officers who were tracking his plans, his messages, and his movements. And the timeline of the alleged -- of the alleged plan to make this attack said that he contacted them back in November, instructed them to obtain guns. And by August, he was discussing the possibility of coming to New York City and making New York City the place of where this attack would take place. He specifically wanted to target the Jewish community here, talking about how it is one of the largest in the world. He also talked about wanting to attack on October 7th, as you mentioned, the first anniversary of the Hamas attack on Israel. Now, we have tried to determine if Khan has secured a lawyer.
