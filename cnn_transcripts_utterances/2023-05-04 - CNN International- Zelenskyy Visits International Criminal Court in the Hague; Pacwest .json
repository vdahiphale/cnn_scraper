U.S. national security officials call the allegation ridiculous. There has been no independent verification for Wednesday's alleged strike which Kyiv vehemently denies. But overnight, Russia unleashed a barrage of attacks on Ukrainian cities.Kyiv says that drone shot down over Odessa had the words for the Kremlin and for Moscow written on them. Let's go now to CNN's Nick Paton Walsh, who joins us now from Dnipro, Ukraine. Nick, tell us more about the attacks that have happened overnight. Obviously, there's concern that the Kremlin could use this alleged attack as a pretext for escalated attacks.",

      "sentences": "Yes, we didn't last night see anything particularly worse than the previous ghastly four nights or so. Remember, Ukraine has been being hit heavily, pretty much every night with missiles drones trying to get through increasingly sophisticated air defense.Now certainly Kyiv, its city officials are saying that this is the worst few days they've had since the beginning of the year. Odessa, it appears, I think about 15 out of 18 drones were taken down over there, so increasing success of anti-aircraft systems. And no clear reading as to last night, whether any casualties were caused by that, that we do know that before Moscow had even made this unsubstantiated claim of an assassination attempt of Vladimir Putin we do know that people were being shelled civilians are being shelled in Kherson, recently liberated area from Russian occupation. 24, the last count there a railway station, a hypermarket, many lives lost. And this is important to point out has been the regular flow of life here over the past months possibly intensifying in these past days, the Kremlin coming out very clearly today and yet escalating yet further their claims, not just saying that Ukraine was behind the assassination attempt, saying and in fact, they were following the explicit instructions of Washington, Ukraine and Washington both denying that. Also saying the Kremlin spokesperson that the damage to the dome, the Senate dome in the Kremlin will be repaired imminently that only two copper sheets were in fact damaged, suggests a very minimal explosion if indeed, there was one there are some videos that seem to provide unverified evidence to back up the Kremlin's claim, but that's just about it. And when pressed by reporters as to when we might see more details as to what kind of drone, who they think may have launched it, where it launched from, what explosive it was carrying, that was referred by the Kremlin for the investigative authorities for a later date. So very tall, serious rhetoric from the Kremlin, you can't get much more serious than blaming two of your most serious enemies for trying to kill your head of state, little evidence to back up that particular idea. And here in Ukraine, yes, absolutely concerns continuing that this may be part of some broader or be used as a broader Russian pretext to escalate the war. I should point out though; conventionally there seem to be throwing everything they can at this to limited success. So many deep concerns as to what really, Moscow might be looking at, Bianca.",

Israel says it has killed two gunmen behind a deadly attack on a British Israeli mother and her two daughters in the occupied West Bank last month. The IDF say that they were among the three men killed in a raid Thursday in the West Bank city of Nablus.Hamas said their militants had killed the three settlers praising them as heroes of the Jordan Valley operation.

      "sentences": "Yes, so this raid took place morning time daytime, such raids are such daytime rather rare for the Israeli military. They tend to prefer to do these during the night or in the early morning hours. But we received word this morning that in Nablus, the Israeli military was raiding the old the Cosmo, the old city of Nablus.And that is afterwards we learned that they Israeli military saying that they had killed who they believe to be the two gunmen responsible for the death of those British Israeli women, Lucy, Maia and Rina Dee. Lucy Dee, the mother and Maia and Rina, her two daughters were killed in a shooting attack in the occupied West Bank last month, while they were driving in their car during the Passover holiday. And the gunmen had been essentially on the run now for almost a month. The Israeli military saying some 200 forces were used in this, they say that when they surrounded the house where they believe the two gunmen to be hiding, they engage in exchange of fire and kill them as well as a third person who they said they believe what's helping the two men hide over the past few weeks. Now, as you noted, Hamas, the militant organization that runs Gaza, did claim the three as their members calling them they said heroes of the Jordan Valley and acknowledging that at least the two of them were responsible for the Dee women's death. We are hearing from Leo Dee, the father and husband, he says that he and the rest of his kids are delighted he says to hear that the tariffs were eliminated today. He said most of all; he says that it was done in a way that did not endanger the lives of Israeli soldiers because that was one of the most important things from their family's perspective. Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli Prime Minister also issued a statement saying our message to those who harm us and those who want to harm us is that whether it takes a day, a week or a month, you can be certain that we will settle accounts with you. Bianca, it's already been a very deadly opening to 2022 to this year, potentially on track to be the deadliest year for both Palestinians and Israelis in two decades. Last year was already a record year, we are already on path, on the path to beat that record. It seems almost every day there is some sort of incident usually in the occupied West Bank or else elsewhere, Palestinian on Israeli, Israeli forces on Palestinian and so forth, very, very concerning as this sort of cycle of violence just seems to continue with no end in sight, Bianca.",

And community banks are the ones that seem to be looking the weakest here right now. And don't have the kind of cushion at least from the, from the investor's standpoint as some of the big bank, so you're seeing quite a shame here, the stock was at $26, just before the failure of SVB.And then has really, really stumbled along with other community banks. It's down by another half overnight here. And the company saying its exploring strategic options as you reported, and that is sort of Wall Street lingo for SOS, you know, we need some help here. So watching this one, as investors punish it, it's down again, in the pre-market, we'll see if we can find some footing. But the company issuing a statement yesterday saying nothing has materially changed. That's what's so confusing about, this is almost like Wall Street hunting around for the weakest players here, and nothing has changed. The bank has not experienced out of the ordinary deposit flows following the sale of first Republic Bank and other news. And goes on to point out that even since you know that in recent weeks, its deposits have even risen a little bit. So that's sort of a little bit of the mystery here. It seems as though Wall Street investors are trying to find weak links here in the banking system. Yesterday, we heard from the Fed Chief Jerome Powell, who basically said that the successful and calm sale of first republic drew a line under this recent period of banking, banking uncertainty. And Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase earlier this week told investors and journalists that the worst was behind us and the banking system was still strong. So you're hearing from, you know, top voices in banking, that this is a healthy moment overall, for U.S. banks, even though they've had these spots of weakness and now, three big bank failures. But Wall Street's kind of now listening and still watching some of these community banks and punishing them, quite frankly, Bianca.",

I mean, this is sort of part of the narrative that we've been hearing from the Kremlin from the outset, to explain perhaps why it is suffering such setbacks in this war against Ukraine. And also to add justification to why it launched the war in the first place, you know, basically saying that this is all intended to prevent Ukraine falling into the grip even further of the United States and the Western nations in general. And this is a, you know, a further example of that, that the Russians are seeking to, you know, shift responsibility for this drone attack towards the United States. And of course, it doesn't do anything at all to improve relations, which already very patchy, indeed, between the two countries. In fact, you know, it reiterates that idea that this is really a battle. And this is something that Kremlin wants to perpetuate.

Basically, the Russians are doing it in order to allow them to, you know, in some way step up their military operations in Ukraine as a response.Although it strikes me as very odd that first of all, I'm not sure the Russians would really need to do that. I mean, they've already leveled entire cities in Ukraine, I'm not sure they need something like this to further escalate, if they wanted to do so. And secondly, I mean, whoever did this, whether it was the Russians or an outside player, it clearly has exposed, the Kremlin shattered the myth around the Kremlin, that it's invincible, that it's not vulnerable, that it's secure. I mean, this is quite a potent image, I think that we're seeing now on our screens of the vulnerability of Russia with these drone attacks, really striking at the heart of the Russian state.",
