Right now, Vice President Kamala Harris is on the trail in Pennsylvania campaigning in two counties today that former President Donald Trump won in 2016 and 2020. It comes as Harris looks to keep her wave of momentum going following Tuesday's debate.Meantime Trump just wrapped up speaking to reporters in California and repeated his vow to launch the largest deportation of migrants in the nation's history. Let's take you there now live with CNN's Kristen Holmes. Kristen, let's walk through some of the former president's claims. You got to ask him a question. Take us there. What happened?",

He was clearly trying to talk about the economy and immigration, but often went off track. He talked about Kamala Harris' record as a prosecutor. He went on and on about how she had ruined the state of California, which is where we are currently. He tried to link the fact that here - we were here in California to these conversations about crime about immigration.And to be clear, he is here because he is doing two major fundraisers one last night and one later today. That's where he's on his way to right now just outside of San Francisco. He did take questions. The question I asked was about Laura Loomer the far-right conspiracy theorist who has been traveling with him, who has been a staunch supporter of his. And he said, one, he didn't know why I was asking the question. I was asking him specifically to respond to the Republicans who have questions or have expressed concern about their relationship. And two, he went on to say what a great supporter of his she was. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, CURRENT PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Laura's been a supporter of mine just like a lot of people are supporters and she's been a supporter of mine. She speaks very positively of the campaign. I'm not sure why you asked that question, but Laura is a supporter. I don't control Laura. Laura has to say what she wants. She's a - she's a free spirit.

Other polls coming out since then have showed the same thing.But let's just take a look at the horse race numbers right here, all right? So this is Harris versus Trump margin. This is late July. What do we got? We got Kamala Harris up by two, August Harris up by four. And then we got our first real look at the post-debate number here and we got Harris up by five. Now, that's not much of a difference, four and five points. But it's part of a longer, larger pattern. That is the longer that Kamala Harris has been in this race, the better she has tended to do. Now, I will note that the Reuters-Ipsos poll is one of the more friendly results to Kamala Harris among all of the pollsters. But the bottom line here is, if there's anybody who gained after Tuesday's debate, it's not Donald Trump, it's Kamala Harris. At worst, she held her ground. But my guess is, as we get a few more surveys down the road, we'll see bumps like this, one, two, three points, which might not seem like a lot. But you guys know this country, it's so, so tight nationally and in those key battleground states, even a movement of just a single point could make all the difference in the world.",

And I think they kind of translate very well what Ron was saying in terms of that split between the national popular vote, which Harris is most likely going to win, and then how close it is in those battleground states.But let's take a look here, right, pre-debate, Wisconsin and Michigan, which I think are the two best bets for Kamala Harris. She had a 56 percent chance of winning in both. But in Pennsylvania, it was just 45 percent. Now, if we look post-debate, we see these gains in Wisconsin and Michigan. Still close races, right, with a 60 percent chance to win. But then the key nugget here, the key nugget, Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania, get used to keep hearing that commonwealth over and over and over again, because it is such an important state in building up to 270 electoral votes. We see that slight movement, again, from a 45 percent chance of winning to a 50 percent chance. That's not exactly a lot. But this election is so close that these small little movements, any movement, can mean everything. And that's what I think we're going to be talking about with the weeks and months ahead is there's a reason Kamala Harris is in Pennsylvania. It's because it is so, so tight there.",

I mean, I remember one Republican saying to me even before the debate, there are two tracks in this campaign, one centered on Trump that isn't particularly helpful on many days and another in which we are just running this kind of textbook Republican campaign against a Democrat in those, you know, in those swing states. The reality, Boris, is, as you know, the big three states that were in the blue wall, that fell out of the blue wall in 2016 and came back to Biden in 2020, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin have voted the same way in every election since 1980, except 1988. And even more dramatically, they have voted the same way for governor in every election over the past 30 years, except for one in 2014. So it is possible that Pennsylvania and does look as though Pennsylvania is a click or two harder for Harris than Michigan or Wisconsin. But these are demographically, economically, culturally pretty similar states. They have tended to move together.
