It's one of those groups where anything could happen and everything is happening. I guess we'll come to the Stephanie Frappart history bit in just a moment, but I need to tell you about this.So, there's currently Costa Rica, 2, Germany 2. And in the other game in this Group E, Japan beating Spain which means that as it stands, Japan and Spain will go through. Germany, the four-time world champions look like they're going out. So that's that. The Stephanie Frappart news is extraordinary. She's ended up refereeing a really, really important game where the tension and anxiety are now just off the charts. This is a huge moment for women in professional football. She is already known as a trail blazer. She's a 38-year-old French referee. She's refereed a lot of important club games in Europe and in France. She's been known trailblazer for some time. But for and all-female crew to take on a men's World Cup match is a first. It is historic and remember the part of the world that it's happening in, so that is hugely important too. And she's spoken to CNN in recent years and she said she's just doing her job. She doesn't really feel like she's just making history, she's just getting on with it. You may know this phrase about referees in soccer. When they're doing a good job, nobody notices them. That's what they want. But it's really hard not to be noticed when you're out there making history like she is right now. CAMEROTA: It definitely sounds high stress. Meanwhile, tell us about Christian Pulisic. So, he's a team USA midfielder. He was hospitalized were this pelvic injury. Will he be back for the game this weekend?",

It's very big, but it is up deep on the South Lawn.The menu tonight, you know, the trick to a good state dinner is that you've got to complement both countries. You have to do so sort of organically and seamlessly and not too hokey. So, on the menu tonight, caviar, poach Maine lobster, beef for the main course, and an orange cake -- a chiffon cake for dessert. But things like champagne flutes made France will be used but American sparkling wine will be served in them. There'll be a cheese course, but the cheeses will actually be American cheeses. So, there are things that are sort of cross cultural. The decor, we caught a glimpse yesterday. I got a sneak peek. It's red, white and blue, the shared colors of our two flags. Kind of a tricky color palette for an event but it looks lovely. The table costs are blue, the candles are red, the flowers are mostly red roses. So, there's a nice, you know, nod to both countries here as this goes on. And you mentioned the stage and the dance floor. John Batiste, the Grammy award-winning singer will be performing tonight, for I hear about 400 guests. It's significantly larger than the state dinner that Trump had for the Macrons back in 2018. That was about 120 people. This is going to be closer to 400. I think' we're going to see a lot of VIPs, a lot of donors, a lot of people who have been anxious for this Biden administration to finally be able to hold its first -- and I hear not its last -- state dinner of his tenure so far.",
