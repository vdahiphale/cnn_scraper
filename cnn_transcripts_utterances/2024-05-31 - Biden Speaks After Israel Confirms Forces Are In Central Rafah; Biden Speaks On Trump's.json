And we've reported that Hamas had actually demanded that the first phase actually, in effect, be 12 weeks and then the permanent ceasefire starts.So this could be a good deal for them. Because the major sticking point has been this question about an end to the war. Israel has not been willing to commit to language that would end the war because they feel like they still have to dismantle Hamas. So my question right now is, is Prime Minister Netanyahu willing to agree to a deal that, in effect, could end this war in Gaza?",

      "sentences": "Well, I think the very fact that President Biden is coming out and laying out, in more detail than he ever has, a proposal that is actually on the table here is notable in and of itself.And it tells you, the fact that American officials clearly believe that there needs to be enormous public pressure brought right now, not only on the Israeli leadership, which he talked about in talking about Israeli please, this is a good deal, and talking about the way in which this can set up a long-term path to security for the Israeli people. But he also focused on the people who are out protesting in the streets around the world calling for a ceasefire. And he urged them to now turn their attention to pressure Hamas to accept this deal. And so he was clearly trying to pressure both parties at the negotiating table to try and -- and accept this proposal. We should note, of course this is Israel's latest proposal based on the way that the president was describing it. The second thing is, I think Alex is right to focus on the kind of -- the way in which phase one would go into phase two. And what seems to be the newest part of this proposal is the fact that negotiations to lead into a permanent end to the hostilities, to lead into that phase two, would continue and the ceasefire would continue along with it until there is an agreement. And that appears to be perhaps an elegant way of trying to get a lasting ceasefire without forcing Israeli -- Israel's political leadership to agree to that at the very beginning of these negotiations. Which is something that they have refused just to do, something the Israeli prime minister has refused to do. And this allows them to do it at a point in time where hostages are being released. And also where for the ceasefire is already dragging on to the point where starting up the war again is going to be very challenging for the Israeli military. We should note, though, that that's still does not Hamas' position. Hamas wants an end to the war at the very beginning of this agreement or wants Israel to at least agree to that at the very beginning so that it carries directly into that phase two without any negotiations. And we should also note that Hamas this week has been entrenched in its position even further, saying that they won't even agree to negotiate right now until Israel stops its military operations in Gaza.",

      "sentences": "Well, and this was notable because it is the first time that we heard directly from the president about this verdict.I think it is important here to note exactly how he laid this out. He was quite technical in his language in describing how the justice system works, and how this verdict was reached, noting, for example, the jurors. And also going on to say, quote, \"No one is above the law. That principle has been reaffirmed.\" And it's important to note that, because that is been the fine line that this White House has had to walk over the course of this trial. They have been relatively quiet because they didn't want to give any perception that this had anything to do with the federal government or pushing along the claims of the president was involved. The fact the president noted, this was a state case, not a federal case. And so the campaign has really been leading the charge over the last few hours in sort of attacking what has happened and saying that the former president in his remarks earlier today is, quote, \"unhinged. But that's been the campaign link to the charge. The White House has had it -- has a much more difficult time and has had to walk this fine line. And that's when you saw the president doing today, sort of taking a somber tone, talking about the American justice system, and noting again that it is, quote, \"irresponsible\" to say it's rigged. And that again, has been the challenge for the administration. It could very much still be the challenge moving on in the next few weeks. And that is where we sort of see the campaign take the baton, where they could be more forceful, more aggressive in their language in talking about this trial. We know there has been talk about whether or not they should be calling him, him being the former president, a criminal. We've seen the statements be a little more forceful. But at the end of day, what the campaign message is going to be is that this needs to be decided at the ballot box not in the courtroom. So again, the president, notable moment. He weighed in on this for the first time. It has been a historic moment. But he really took the moment here to be very technical in his description of what occurred yesterday.",

And day in, day out, you were kind of calling balls and strikes, pointing out when the prosecution, in your view, was not doing as well as they showed or when the defense was doing well.But clearly, you feel very passionately about some of the diatribes being leveled at the justice system here. I would like to go through some of the things that we've heard from former President Trump's team, where they're saying things like this case never should have been tried. There are Democrats who thinks this shouldn't have been, certainly, the first case that was tried. But I wonder what you think about that -- that point that is made?",

      "sentences": "The timing of the cases being tried wasn't decided by our political system. It was decided by our legal system.This was the case that was brought forward. I think it was abundant evidence to support the indictment. I've said that from the beginning. But I've also said and I've spoken to you on occasion right out of the courthouse that we have a confrontational system. When -- when the witness was -- when Michael Cohen was caught flat- footed by Todd Blanche on a crucial October 24th phone call, I called that right out and I said that was a powerful moment for the defense. And I'll have to say, Judge Merchan, who continues to be subject to vicious and unfair attacks -- I saw -- you can't call what -- what former president and now-convicted felon Trump did today at the press conference because he took no -- no questions. But the way he savagely attacks the judge, to go back to that cross- examination of Michael Cohen, I mean, Todd Blanche moved right in. He was yelling at him. He was calling him a liar, a perjurer right in front of the jury. And the judge, as he should, let him have the run. And there were a number of other instances where the judge leaned backwards for the defense. I'll give you another example. When Stormy Daniels was -- was testifying, on occasion, the prosecution was getting into areas that, clearly, they should not have been getting into in terms of, let's say, the salaciousness of the incident. But meanwhile, the defense was just sitting there and not objecting. The judge objected and sustained objections on his own to protect the defense. Another instance, when Stormy Daniels was testifying and apparently -- this I didn't hear personally -- but it was subsequently on the record that she was saying things regarding the encounter. All of a sudden, the judge brought the parties to the bench. And then they went back to the bench. It subsequently came out, what the judge did was he warned them because apparently Defendant Trump was using expletives. But instead of calling that out in front of the jury, the judge did it in a controlled way. This was a fair trial. There was a mountain of evidence in this trial. Now, the key was ultimately the jury had to believe a damaged witness, Michael Cohen.",
