In just two days Senate Republicans will pick Mitch McConnell's successor as the party's leader in the upper chamber. Over the weekend, President-elect Donald Trump issued a new demand for whoever will ultimately fill the role. Trump posted that the next leader must support recess appointments for his nominees. What does that mean? It's a way for the president to get around minority opposition to his picks. And while all three of the top contenders quickly signaled support for the idea one figure has emerged as a favorite among key Trump allies. Elon Musk, RFK Jr., and others publicly endorsing Florida Sen. Rick Scott for the role. Trump has not endorsed anyone yet. On Wednesday, the Senate GOP will hold a secret ballot election to decide who will win the power to control legislation and wield the power over those key cabinet confirmations. Here was Sen. Rick Scott making his pitch over the weekend. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. RICK SCOTT (R-FL):  We have to be the change. That's what Donald Trump got elected to do -- to be the change. That's what business guys do. I'm a deal guy. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

John Thune and John Cornyn, longstanding members of the Republican Conference on the Hill and longtime members of leadership sort of, in some ways, represent -- I mean, they're much younger than Mitch McConnell but they represent the old guard a little bit more than Rick Scott does.What did you make of the fact that John Thune came out pretty immediately and said OK, Donald Trump, recess appointments are fine. What does that say to you about the state of this race?",

It may not matter who he wants in that position, but you can show that the president-elect is already wielding his power because just within minutes of him putting out this demand all three of the contenders fell into line. So it shows that whoever it is, it's probably somebody who's going to curry favor with the president-elect, of course, because it's going to be a key dealmaking partner.But this is still a tight race. It's fascinating that a lot of Trump's allies are endorsing Rick Scott. Of course, he was the one who was seen as having the closest relationship with the president-elect. John Thune getting in the president-elect's crosshairs when he endorsed Tim Scott for president in the GOP primary. Objected to the efforts to reject -- did not get on board with the effort to reject the election results in 2020. John Cornyn was one of the bipartisan dealmakers on that gun control bill a few years ago, something that caught the ire of conservatives. So there are certainly some different sides being taken. But the key here, Kasie, is that it's a secret ballot, so Trump and his allies can do as much bidding as they want but at the end of the day this is going to be a decision for each senator to make on their own and nobody's ever going to know. So that sort of also shakes things up with how -- the uncertainty of how this is going to play out.",

Rick Scott mounting a bid against Mitch McConnell for Senate leader at the beginning of 2021, and he only got 10 votes -- which, of course, Mitch McConnell has been the Republican leader since 2007. He's a known figure on Capitol Hill and people respect his leadership. But still, 10 votes isn't really much to show for even if you have some close allies in the Senate.So that's why before -- as Stef said, before President-elect Trump won and was on his way to the White House a lot of people were laughing off Rick Scott's bid and it wasn't seen as a real power player in this three-way race. But now with Trump in the White House and again, Rick Scott seen as the one who has the best relationship with the president-elect and a lot of his allies pushing for it, now folks are saying hmm, maybe this could be a dark horse candidate -- somebody who could sway. But again, it all gets back to this idea of the secret ballot. Trump could get involved if he wants and his allies could keep pushing, but it just depends on how senators take to that recommendation when they get to that ballot secretly.",

And he also went ahead and endorsed Tim Scott in the GOP primary. Cornyn didn't -- maybe took a little bit to endorse Trump but didn't actually endorse one of his opponents. I mean, the relationship with John Thune -- Trump went all the way to threaten a primary challenger against John Thune. He said this guy is going to get primaried and he's going to be out of Congress. Now, that didn't end up coming to fruition. There was not a strong primary challenge. Obviously, he's still serving. But John Thune probably has a little bit more bad blood with Trump world. However, important to note that they have tried to mend fences campaigning and appearing with one another. Taking phone calls and having conversations. So allies of those camps are trying to say this is not a big deal anymore.
