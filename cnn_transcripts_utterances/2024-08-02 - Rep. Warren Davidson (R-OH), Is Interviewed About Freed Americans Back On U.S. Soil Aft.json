They're finally home, Wall Street Journal reporter, Evan Gershkovich, former U.S. Marine Paul Whelan and Russian American journalist, Alsu Kurmasheva, now back on U.S. soil after a historic prisoner swap with Russia. A joyous scene overnight as they embrace their families for the first time since being freed with the President and Vice President looking on.Now the historic swap the largest since the Cold War involves 24 detainees and seven countries. The trio is now in Texas where they'll undergo medical evaluations. The gravity though of their release, continues to set in. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The President trying to bring this deal across the finish line while also having to deliberate and come to a momentous decision in his own election. But the way that it's been described as, as two separate things, the President has often talked about his foreign policy chops. And this was always a priority for the administration securing the release of Americans who the U.S. described as wrongfully detained in Russia.So this is something that will go as part of the President's legacy while he was also having to make the decision about the presidential race. But there is no doubt, Paula, that all of this happens against a political backdrop or President Donald Trump and his vice presidential nominee, weighing in as well, U.S. officials knocking what they've said so far to say there's no evidence to show that former President Donald Trump could have secured their release if he wins a second term, making the point that it was President Biden who did so.",

Thank you so much for being with us. Congressman, I want to get your reaction to President Biden's comments that the White House is not giving up on a deal possibly involving Marc Fogel. REP. WARREN DAVIDSON (R-OH): Well, it's exciting. And look, it is a great day to have our prisoners freed and returned. It's a shame that they were held in Russian captivity for so long. And we should be grateful and thankful. So I'm glad to see this finally happened and -- and I'm greatly appreciative of Germany helping I mean, they released an assassin, he killed a Chechen terrorist. If he did it in another place, it would have been celebrated. He did it in a public park in Germany. And so he's serving a life sentence. So not a small thing for Germany to release this person but it really did result in freedom for Americans, and we should expect the Biden administration to continue to fight to free American prisoners and hostage -- hostages that have been unjust and -- unjustly held captive, including in Gaza.",

And it was really the last thing that we needed because investors were already growing concerned about the health of the economy and the state of the jobs market. And so this report just amplifies those fears. We saw that, yes, the U.S. economy is still growing, still adding jobs, seeing 114,000 jobs added in July. But this was tight. This was the second lowest rate since late 2020.The unemployment rate also ticked higher, noticeably higher up well above 4 percent. Now and so this is raising some concerns about whether or not the Federal Reserve waited too long here, right? They could have cut interest rates earlier this week. They opted not to. And now this is raising some worries that maybe all that tough inflation fighting medicine from the Fed is really starting to damage the economy. Some forecasters are even talking about the risk of a recession. I do think it's important to emphasize -- emphasize though, that it's just too early right now, we don't know if this is just a growth scare, or perhaps something more serious. I talked to Moody's economist, Mark Zandi, earlier and he said he still thinks the economy can avoid a recession. But he noted that the risks are rising, and it could be a closer call than people thought.",

The Iranian government and Hamas say Israel carried out the assassination. Though Israel has not confirmed nor denied its involvement.

We did attend a rally last night and it was notable that many of the people attending so they had hesitated to go that they were somewhat scared about this and highly anticipated response from Iran from Hezbollah or whatever that response might look like. We are starting to see preparations beginning. We spoke to a hospital -- a hospital here in Tel Aviv that says it has cleared out a below ground parking lot of all cars so that it can potentially be used to treat patients that there was some kind of a strike.[11:20:30] We have also heard from Jerusalem's municipality, which has urged people to prepare and clean their shelters to make sure that wherever they go, they are able to get to a shelter within 90 seconds, which is the amount of time they would have from an alert being given. And also telling people to stock up on supplies, to basically be prepared for potentially a power outage of several days. Also, one of the big supermarket chains here are saying that their sales have gone up 30 percent, that people are stocking up on toilet paper, on canned goods. So definitely this is a country that is on higher alert and is preparing but still no real concrete sense yet as to what this attack might look like and when it might come.",

But he didn't yet really give a timeline. Not that he would, but he allowed for some wiggle room, if you will.So while everyone is anticipating this, it's still not clear what exactly it what it might look like. Now, when we were here in April, when Iran launched its attack, 300 projectiles towards Israel, the primary target of that appeared to be the Nevatim Airbase where the F- 35 fighter jets are kept. In this instance, they may go for some kind of a military base. They might try to go for a power plant, for example. It's interesting in all of the preparations we're seeing. We're hearing a lot of emphasis on preparing for the possibility of several days without power. But this is speculative and all we know is that they are having a lot of conversations here at the highest levels with U.S. counterparts. Yoav Gallant, the Secretary of Defense here spoke to Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin for the third time this week today. The British Secretary of Defense also here in Israel today as they tried to prepare to form some kind of a defense for whatever response we might be imminently about to see, Paula.",
