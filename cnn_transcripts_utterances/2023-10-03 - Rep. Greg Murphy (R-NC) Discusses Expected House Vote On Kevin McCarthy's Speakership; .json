There are many unique things that have created Donald Trump the way that he is. But the politics that underlie it, especially the fervor in that base, in the MAGA base -- David, you spend so much time looking at these people and trying to understand what motivates them. We know it's not the whole Republican Party that feels this way or agrees with Matt Gaetz. But it is a segment that's very loud and very insistent and very defensive where they are.

We're told that a handful of numbers aren't able to make this vote.That could change the threshold. Because what they're counting on here is the majority of members voting and present. If there are fewer than 435 members in the chamber, which we expect, that would lower the overall threshold in order for this motion to succeed. We will see if that could actually help Kevin McCarthy if there are enough Democratic absences to offset the Republicans pushing to oust him here. That is one of the key questions at this moment. But right now, as you can see, there are 10 Republicans who are voting to essentially keep this resolution alive. We've been saying all along, if all 435 members are there and all Democrats vote for this effort, he only needs five. Matt Gaetz only needs five Republicans to side with him. Already 10 and counting. That is a very bad sign for Kevin McCarthy. But again, the question will be, how many members ultimately are there and voting? But also, we're seeing one Democrat vote -- a Democratic member voting yes. We'll see if that's a mistake or intentional or not. Sometimes, the members vote and realize they meant to vote no or yes, and they change it before the time is up here. [14:35:03] But at the moment, 10 Republicans voting and counting, a warning sign for Kevin McCarthy that he could very well lose this vote. But again, we will see how many absences are there, whether that changes the thresholds there for the speaker. But for the moment, not looking good for him in the first key vote -- Jake?",

Which we assume is going to happen. Although, there is one Democrat voting yea, which is to table the motion. Again for those keeping track at home, a yea is in favor of tabling the motion to get rid of McCarthy. And a nay is in favor of proceeding with the vote to get rid of McCarthy. It's all very wonky. But basically, yea means for McCarthy, nay means against McCarthy. And right now, as we're looking, and Manu pointed out, the no votes are actually significant as well.

Because what voting present does is bring the overall threshold -- Manu was saying, if everybody is there, it's 218. It brings the overall threshold of what is needed down, which could make it easier, in this case, to sort of cut through all of the procedure here, make it easier for Kevin McCarthy to survive, without actually having to vote to make him survive.

It makes me think back to the summer of 2020 when the polls around the midterms, and people were being asked, how do you feel about the direction of the country? And folks were saying they don't really like the direction it's going in. I think they're talking about votes like this. I think they're talking about moments like this.

We now know of 10.One of the original six was Congressman Tim Burchett of Tennessee, who has now issued a statement -- or not issued a statement. Spoken to reporters. He told reporters that Speaker McCarthy called him and condescended to him about a previous statement he made about how he was praying on his decision. On the way to the floor, Burchett told reporters, quote, \"When I make a statement that I am praying about it and I get a call from the speaker that he belittles that, to me, that shows another reason we need a change in leadership, unquote.\" I was, obviously, not privy to the phone call, but that is the reason that Burchett believes that McCarthy was belittling his comment that he was going to pray on that, which is obviously not what you want to be conveying, even if by accident, to somebody who is voting against you. Right now, we have, roughly, 50 individuals who have yet to vote. And, again, all of the Democrats who have voted, 171, as of this moment -- 172, have voted against McCarthy, against tabling the resolution, in favor of a motion to vacate, in favor of voting to get rid of McCarthy. And 10 Republicans are with them. 203 Republican, the majority of the majority are not with Matt Gaetz. But 10 Republicans is a lot. (CROSSTALK)",

This is a procedural move that members of Congress feel they can spin when they get home. Senate, they did a lot of same things in a lot of places. But this is important because the Democrats are united in, nope, you're not taking our best opportunity to help Kevin McCarthy. They'll see how it plays out. But, two, I think we should step back for a second and think about the big picture of what we're seeing unfold. Because we haven't, as you repeated, Jake, seen anything like this since 1910, when we certainly didn't have access to C-SPAN when we could see this playing out on the House floor.

We're still waiting on Congresswoman Lauren Boebert, who has been coy about where she is on this. But, Jake, those are the 10 that are defying the speaker. And even though they're in the minority of the minority, the fact that they're voting with Democrats shows that this is major danger territory for the speaker of the House to keep his job to potentially push him out, which is expected this afternoon, declaring the office of the speaker vacant. Because of the support of these members, along with Democrats to oust Kevin McCarthy, that's what -- this will be the end result of these votes here, that are happening. So those 10 members, those 10 and counting, are voting to kick Kevin McCarthy out here, Jake. We'll see where this vote ends up.
