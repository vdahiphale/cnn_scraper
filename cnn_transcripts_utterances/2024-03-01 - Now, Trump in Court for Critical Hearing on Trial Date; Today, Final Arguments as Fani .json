      "sentences": "Good morning. You are live in the CNN Newsroom.Right, now Donald Trump is in a Florida courtroom as he pushes to delay his classified documents trial. And defiance in Moscow as thousands of Russians gather to pay their respects to Alexei Navalny. Crowds chanting his name and turning his funeral into a protest against Vladimir Putin. Plus, an extreme winter storm is slamming California bringing 100 mile per hour wind gusts and dumping up to, get this, ten feet of snow. We'll talk about that in a little while from now. In the meantime, I'm Jim Acosta in Washington. This is the news right now. And we begin with former President Donald Trump returning to his playbook of attempting to delay another trial. This morning, Trump is set to appear inside a Florida courtroom. As a matter of fact, we think he just arrived a few moments ago in the federal criminal case over his handling of classified documents. A judge could determine whether the trial will go ahead in May or be delayed. CNN and Chief Legal Affairs Correspondent Paula Reid is live outside the courthouse for us in Fort Pierce, Florida. Paula, what do we think we're going to see today?",

      "sentences": "Well, Jim, we know the former president did just arrive a few minutes ago. And any time now, this hearing, this high-stakes hearing is expected to get underway.And the judge overseeing this case, Trump-appointee Judge Aileen Cannon had scheduled this trial. This is the trial where Trump faces approximately 40 charges related to his alleged mishandling of classified documents. She had put this on the calendar for May 20th, but signaled she will likely push it back and asked both sides of this case, the special counsel and the Trump legal team, to come prepared today to talk about scheduling. Jim, in any other case, scheduling would be a routine matter. But here, timing, scheduling, this is the most consequential issue. We know there's a tension between the special counsel and Trump legal team. The special counsel wants to move as quickly as possible. But Trump's team wants to delay this potentially until after the November election. Now, Trump some lawyers are arguing that their clients should not be in a federal courtroom when he wants to be out campaigning. They insist that's a violation of his First Amendment. Now, I'll also note that, Jim, if Trump is reelected he could, through his attorney general, make this federal case and the other one he faces go away, so another incentive for him to the delay. But the special counsel is urging the judge to put this trial on as quickly as possible, suggesting July 8th as a possible start date. Now, I'll note the Trump team conceded that if this trail has to go they would be okay with it starting on August 12th. Now, I want to note there's a little bit of gamesmanship going on here. If they can take up some time with this try on the calendar in August it could make it more difficult for other trials to be scheduled and they could always come back and try to get it delayed again. So, very high-stakes here, all eyes on Judge Aileen Cannon.",

She said, no, we went Dutch. We were a couple. We went Dutch.The law and the evidence don't support disqualification, but the judge has had to preside over a gigantic disqualification and he is going to be struggling with, can he just say, oh, it's all fine, move along. That's why I've said there needs to be some compromise. Mr. Wade should say, hey, I'm willing to voluntarily step away.

I think the other defenses he's raised are very weak.So, the defense attorneys here are doing a very good job so far of delaying this. And I think Judge Cannon will delay the trial. She'll probably set it prior to the election. But I doubt very much that this case will go to trial before the election.

She's been reversed twice by the extremely conservative 11th Circuit earlier in the investigation for moves she made favoring him. They repudiated her for saying a president has special legal standing. It's an unbelievably bad pattern.That being said, you do see the elements of a compromise possibly emerging. Jack Smith says July. Trump says, I don't want to go to trial, but if I have to, August. [10:10:00] And Trump has some motivations to do this. The Supreme Court, in his D.C. case, is going to reject absolute immunity. That case will go to trial. They won't decide that any later than the end of June. That case will go to trial if this one doesn't. So, maybe Trump will say, well, favorable judge, Florida jury, that's a lot better than D.C., we're going to use this case as a blocking maneuver. And then, of course, you have the 2016 election interference and hush money case that is definitely going to trial. So, I wouldn't be surprised if we got two trials. There's room for two. If I were betting, I would say don't rule out that second trial as a companion to the 2016 election tampering case.",

I agree with Norm that there is an avenue for something to potentially happen.But, first of all, let's go to the classified documents case. Classified documents cases are very difficult procedurally because they involve classified documents and review and specialized procedures. You have a defendant who is in four different cases and has conflict schedules. He just filed motions to dismiss, which, if they're denied, he will appeal. And that's going to take additional time. So, there are many avenues in the classified documents case for this to be delayed. And I don't want to speak about Judge Cannon's motivations or her prejudice. I think she is a fine judge, however, she was appointed by this president. And I think she has shown some inclination to listen to his lawyers, which all judges actually do. And if the defense attorneys can present credible grounds to delay this trial past the election, they absolutely will. I don't think their strategy is to try this case first.

And as soon as Donald Trump told them not to support the bipartisan Senate bill, which, by the way, gave Republicans everything they wanted, offered nothing that Democrats wanted, basically said, we'll do it your way.
