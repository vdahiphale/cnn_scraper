Thomas Dickey, the attorney explaining why he is fighting Mangione's extradition from Pennsylvania to New York. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) THOMAS DICKEY, SUSPECT'S ATTORNEY: Well, what happened today is he could have -- he -- there was a extradition proceeding. We did not, N- O-T, add that on there. OK. Because if you're reporting that earlier that we did, that did not happen. We did not waive extradition. We were contesting extradition. We are going to fight this along the rules and with the constitutional protections that my client has and that's what we're going to do. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

A different scenario when he was leaving that court hearing. He was also quiet during the beginning of this court hearing, only mentioning -- or only answering rather twice to the judge when asked questions. He said I do when he was sworn in and yes, sir, answering the judge when he asked if he understood his right to contest this extradition.I can tell you that he was wearing an orange jumpsuit. Our reporter inside the courtroom said he had a disheveled collar. He was shackled at his hands and at his wrists. And his attorney who you just mentioned, we have since learned, Jake, just in the last few minutes that he has been hired to represent Luigi Mangione that this was not a court appointed defense attorney. And during this hearing, he, as you just heard him say, fought this extradition. He also was trying to fight, basically trying to get Mangione out on some sort of bail, saying he's got no criminal history. He can be, you know, tracked by GPS if necessary, to which the district attorney there in Blair County basically lined some of the evidence that they have against him, including the fact that he was found with $8,000 cash, $2,000 of foreign currency, a passport, said that he was evading police for several days, was transient. So, of course, as we know, he is still behind bars. The judge denying that request for some sort of bail and he is allowed to fight this extradition. That is his right. What we understand now happens is that his attorney, that defense attorney, has 14 days to file a writ of habeas corpus. This basically allows him to say, you know what, this is not the guy that needs to be extradited. Of course it's a stretch, but it does basically extend these proceedings. And it also, if you think about it, gives the NYPD, gives investigators more time to sort of collect evidence, build their case against them, and then they will all be back in court to discuss next steps in this court process.

It also tracks with what we've been learning from his social media footprint is that, you know, he was very active on social media for quite a while, you know, posting pictures of friends, his travels, and then sort of went dark where people were reaching out to him, wondering if he was OK. One person asked, are you going to honor your RSVP to my wedding?So it did seem that he went dark for a while.

That video is all going to be scoured and ultimately stitched together into a timeline to try to show as much of the 225 or so hours that he spent in New York City as possible, to really be able to almost show the jury a movie of his movements, to successfully conclude that this is, in fact, the same person who's responsible for this crime. At the same time, they're continuing to test the forensic evidence. They're going to start to get DNA results back. At some point, they will get a DNA sample from Mangione to do a direct comparison to any DNA that was recovered off that water bottle at the crime scene or the KIND bar wrapper at the crime scene.

But there are larger gaps in the story before, which is when he went off the grid, where did he go off the grid? San Francisco seems to be a pointer there.What, if anything, did that have to do with his, what appears to be, self radicalization? So they're working on that. But they have core responsibilities that hinge on this extradition, which is Pennsylvania has the gun, they have the body has the fingerprints in terms of the prisoner, also the DNA. So they may have to get warrants to travel to Pennsylvania to obtain their own fingerprints, their own DNA, to test fire that gun. Pennsylvania can't simply hand all that over to them because if this process drags out and the judge, you know, says, produce the evidence of your crime, they can't say we lent it out.

For example, were the victim is a judge, a police officer, a first responder, or were the murder involves a murder for hire, or were there's torture involved in the case, or were the murders committed in the course of some other crime, like a robbery or a terroristic act. And as far as we know, none of those features apply to the murder so far. And so that's why it seems that New York prosecutors have charged a second degree murder.What they will have to show is that Mr. Mangione intentionally killed his victim here. And if that's proven, he's looking at a mandatory minimum of 15 years behind bars, no parole. And he could behind bars for as long as life, depending if and when he ever does get parole.",

You know, this is very, very different.And we saw that outpouring of support on social media. We see, you know, comments, really backlash against the McDonald's employee who called in the tip in the first place. So, you know, I think that there is a fear.

We're going to bring you that live as soon as it begins.As we learn more about the suspect in the murder of the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, there is one alarming detail we want to unpack right now, and that's the apparent use by Mr. Mangione of a ghost. That's a weapon that's untraceable, one that can even be made, manufactured at home. We turn to CNN's Josh Campbell now, who's a former FBI agent. Josh, help us understand exactly what a ghost gun is. How are they made?",

      "sentences": "Well, as you mentioned, Jake, they're virtually untraceable. These are essentially self assembled firearms. And you know, the ATF says that they've collected tens of thousands of these so called ghost guns used in crimes in the last several years, including in homicides. The Supreme Court right now is currently weighing how much they can actually be regulated.They come in forms. In one instance, you can go online and buy what's called a gun kit, where someone will actually send you the parts that you then assemble and you can make that into a fully functioning gun. There have also been times, including as is alleged here with this shooter, that there was some type of 3D printing that was involved as well, and that is using a home 3D printer to print specific components of that firearm, essentially making a fully functional weapon. Of course, the big fear that I hear from security professionals is if someone were to make a firearm that had no metal parts at all, it could get that through metal detectors at airports or other public venues. And then there are two big issues here with the ghost guns, Jake. The first is that they don't require background checks. You could buy these kits online. You don't have to go through a background check even if you have a criminal history. And second, perhaps most important, no serial number in any investigation, including this one involving the shooting of the CEO. Serial numbers can help match a particular gun to a location, with these ghost guns, they don't have serial numbers. So that makes it very difficult. Jake, bottom line, these ghost guns are essentially invisible to police.",

The way they do that, and you can see here are some images, I went inside an ATF ballistics lab that they essentially take that firearm that they recovered.They will do a test fire and recover both the bullet that comes out of the front of the gun and the shell casing that gets ejected from the side. And then they take that under a microscope. You know, these bullet shell casings, whenever they make contact with a firearm, it's almost like a fingerprint leaving that unique marking. And what they'll do is do a side by side comparison and look to see where the shell casings recovered from Manhattan at the scene of that shooting. Are they similar in nature to the test rounds that they will eventually fire from that gun that was recovered? If so, that's really damning evidence.",

They were nervous about chaos, about looting, about further violence. But really, we saw people coming out in full force in Umayyad Square celebrating. And I should add, Jake, it was people of all different ages. There were Christians, there were Muslims, there were women who were covered. There were women who were uncovered.

The federal government now plans to test milk across the country to get a better idea of how this virus is spreading. CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta is here for his On Call segment. You can scan the QR code on your screen. You guys got to put it up there. There it is. And submit your question. Sanjay, should I be concerned about getting sick from drinking the milk in my refrigerator?DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: I -- I think the short answer is no. Thankfully 99 percent of the milk supply in the United States is pasteurized. That's sort of the key to -- to this. It's a high temperature, low duration paste. So 160 degrees for at least 15 seconds and that takes care of most of the problems. The concern is, Jake, you know, we have a -- a not insignificant about 1 percent of the population that is drinking raw milk every week. So there's a demand for this. It's, again, a small percentage, but it's -- it's a thing. And I think part of the reason they do it is because of possible health benefits from the bioactive ingredients in raw milk. There's not a lot of evidence behind that, but what we know is that there can be pathogens since over the last 20 years or so, there's been about 200 or so outbreaks related to raw milk, pathogens like salmonella and E. coli and listeria. And now there's a concern about H5N1. There's not been anyone who's gotten sick from drinking raw milk because of H5N1. But that is the concern now, Jake. So that's why this testing that you just mentioned is going to beginning next week. They're going to be checking the milk at lots of dairy farms. But again, pasteurization is a really effective technique for these pathogens. One reason, I'll tell you quickly, Jake, that H5N1 really gets the attention of epidemiologists. And I've covered this -- this virus in places around the world. There was a huge outbreak in southeast Asia in 2006. I want to show you just some global numbers. If you go back about 20, 21 years or so, take a look the number of cases on the left and the number of deaths in each of those bar graphs. Not that many cases, but a really high mortality rate. If you do the math on this, about 50 percent of the people who got infected overall died. But what you see, though, is the number of cases overall going down and the mortality rate going down as well. Some, possibly some good news there, Jake. But still something that they want to keep an eye on in the United States. We've been talking about this since March, when a cow became infected. And now, you know, we're -- we're starting this more robust testing process.",
