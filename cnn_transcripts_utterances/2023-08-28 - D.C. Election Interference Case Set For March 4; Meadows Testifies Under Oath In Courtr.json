Plus, a risky move, by his former Chief of Staff, Mark Meadows, taking the stand, for hours, in his own defense, offering his explanation, of that phone call, now at the center of the Georgia case. And prosecutors, in Spain, tonight, launching a criminal investigation, after that unwanted kiss, at the World Cup, and a strange new development. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Donald Trump's attorneys, in court, today, in both Georgia and Washington. A marathon hearing, in Fulton County, ending without a ruling, from the judge, after hours of surprising testimony, from his former Chief of Staff, Mark Meadows, who of course is fighting, to get his case moved, from federal court, and potentially ultimately dismissed. Meadows was questioned, on the stand, about the former President's infamous phone call, with Georgia's Secretary of State that is at the heart of this investigation. Of course, Meadows himself was also on that call. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And instead, jury selection is going to start, on March 4th. That is the day before Super Tuesday. Trump responded to that date, by criticizing Judge Chutkan, who he previously had been warned against, with his inflammatory rhetoric, with her saying that it could potentially speed up that trial.

But for now, I think it's reasonable.But I'll tell you, Kaitlan, the moment, in that hearing, that struck me, I can only have two words, to describe it, as stunningly stupid. And that was when Trump's attorney compared their desire, to delay the case, to what happened, in the case of Powell versus Alabama, a 1931 case, involving the Scottsboro Boys, who were convicted of raping two White women. And case went to the U.S. Supreme Court, and their convictions were reversed. And what the Trump team did was say that, \"Well, what happened in that trial is what could happen here, in this trial,\" which is absolutely absurd. In the Scottsboro case, the Scottsboro Boys were indicted, and were in trial, six days later, not even given the opportunity, to choose their attorneys. In this case, there was an indictment. But that was -- the trial date is seven months out. He has experienced lawyers, a whole team, investigators. And it was stunningly stupid, because one, the comparison is ridiculous. But second, if you want to alienate a judge, in a case? This was exactly what to do. A female judge, a Black judge, and to talk about that case, and compare it to Trump's case was absurd. And Judge Chutkan really took them up on it and said, this case is entirely different. I think she was absolutely offended. It was really a stunningly stupid thing to do.",

In addition, the prosecution has said, \"Look, we're not even going to use classified documents, when we present our case.\" So, I think, she -- I know she gets it.

But Meadows is hoping to move his case, not only to a more favorable jury pool, potentially, but also maybe a more favorable judge, who potentially could dismiss the charges, against him, completely. The all-day hearing though ended on a cliffhanger. The judge stopped it without a ruling, said he would rule, as soon as possible, given arraignments are barely a week away, expected to start, on September 6th. That is going to be a very busy day. Mark it on your calendars. Trump and a long list of co-defendants will be entering please, on the same day, just 15 minutes apart, starting with the former President himself, at 9:30, that morning. Joining me now, to discuss, Geoff Duncan, George's former Lieutenant Governor, who testified, of course, before the Fulton County grand jury; Jen Jordan, a former Georgia State Senator, an attorney; and Michael Moore, also a former U.S. Attorney, from Georgia. Michael, let me start with you, because what did you make of Meadows taking the stand, under oath? How risky is this, potentially? MICHAEL MOORE, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY: Well, it's a pleasure, to be with all of you, tonight. It's unusual to see a criminal defendant, get on the stand, and give any testimony, under oath. And most lawyers sort of shy away from that. What it tells me is his legal team, in this case, at least is thinking about making a complete record that will likely find its way, before an appellate court, in that they needed to get evidence out, from him that would be unique to him. So, in other words needed, they wanted to hear him talk about his job, how he perceived his duties, how he perceived the functions that he was doing, to find out if he could meet that standard, and even it's a low standard, and a low bar, to have his case removed, to the federal court. [21:20:00] And so, I really think it was a strategic move. We'll see if it hurts him down the road. But, at this point, he's now created a record, where he has without a doubt, stated that he felt like what he was doing, and the job description that he had, falls clearly within his role, as Chief of Staff, under federal employment. And that's going to be critical, whether it's Judge Jones that decides, or whether it's the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals that decides it, or whether ultimately it's the Supreme Court that looks at this, and makes this ultimate decision.",

They also got a sneak peek, at some of the arguments that the government's going to make, both, to the motions that will be forthcoming, on behalf of Trump, and also have them go with trial.Remember that a president and vice president are not subject to the Hatch Act provisions, which is what we've been hearing about, whether or not that this was some kind of illegal campaign activity. And Meadows was acting on behalf of the President. And so, the judge is going to have to look and say, well, 154 of those 157 overt acts that the District Attorney has alleged, were part of the conspiracy, were done while Trump was a sitting President of the United States. And, so how does that play into Meadows' job? And Trump's lawyers had a chance to hear this. They will now know what to expect, from Raffensperger. They'll know he's going to say it's a campaign call. They'll know about the arguments, on whether or not they think this is some kind of campaign violation, on Meadows' part, or otherwise. But it really gives them a very brief, and it's very brief, frankly, preview, into the case to come. And, I think, it also tells us that we will have a number of versions, circling around both, in the interpretation of the telephone call. And even if you listen to that call, where Meadow says, \"This is the Chief of Staff,\" and apparently they're calling from the Oval Office, it's a unique introduction. Clearly, he didn't say, \"This is the Trump campaign.\" Now, whether or not that's dispositive for the federal judge? I doubt it.

One of his weapons, an assault rifle, was decorated with swastikas. Officials say that the gunman's first target was actually Edward Waters University, a historically Black school, in the State. But a security officer there confronted him, and followed him off campus, potentially saving dozens of lives. Here to discuss, what we are learning, tonight, these new details, is retired Missouri Police Captain, Ron Johnson. And thank you so much, for being here. I mean, the Sheriff says that they have this manifesto on their hands that they will eventually be releasing at least parts of it. What would you be looking for in something like that? CAPTAIN RON JOHNSON, MISSOURI STATE HIGHWAY PATROL (RET.): Well, the actual verbiage that was in there, so we start talking about racially- motivated, we want to see what the verbiage is, and where he's getting his verbiage from, looking at data sources, and books that he may have read. So, it'll tell us a lot about his mindset.",

And normally, people, who are detained under that Act, cannot buy firearms. But both of his guns were purchased legally, we now know.
