So, as you know, the places are lousy with them right now, particularly places like Arizona. And then, today, Ted Cruz went on \"The View\" and could not answer the question as to whether or not basically Joe Biden was legitimately elected. And he pivoted, and Karen, this will be to you, because it is the new talking point that I hear all the time now from Republicans. When they get uncomfortable about the election denying, they pivot immediately to the past. So, let's listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Those two pleaded not guilty and their trial will start expected in January. For more, I want to bring in CNN legal analyst Paul Callan. Doug Heye and Karen Finney are also back with us.

So, the judge in the case could give the maximum sentence, consecutive counts, on each count.So, I think what's going on is they want to assert an incendiary defense originally. Defense lawyers came to conclusion that it was an untenable defense. It's very hard to prove insanity in a court of law. Ultimately, they decided the only hope for him was to have him plead guilty to everything and for the court to see that level of cooperation, and they're going to use that to argue that he should get a lighter sentence than life in prison.",

And for reasons that are entirely irrational, she was stopped and then taken away and then be snapped in a van and turned up dead a few days later.

So, the strikers are taken into custody. They have to pay huge bails in order to be released and then a whole bunch of other strikers are taken in.

It never happened.And now, suddenly, this enemy that was burning our flags, that called us the great Satan, that seemed to be the greatest threat against us. The nation is coming up to the street saying that our enemy is right here. They lie when they say it's America, and they have no other ambition other than to overthrow their government. And I think, in some ways, Washington is not ready for good news. I met with the top class of the State Department nearly two weeks ago. And I said to everyone, including the special envoy, Robert Malley, that what the Iranian people want is a revolution. They want to overthrow the regime.
