Look, there has been a strategy since the change in dynamics in Congress after the midterms. The Republicans taking over the House obviously makes it more difficult to pass legislation. We all know that. It is also somewhat provided the White House a little bit of a change in strategy here that they favor.

And right now, you can be a law enforcement officer and fired in Memphis and go join the police force in Nashville, Tennessee, or Columbia, South Carolina, where I'm living now.And so we need to have a database of bad actors. But the fact is I was in a room with Tim Scott and Lindsey Graham and many of these families. And you can see that Tim Scott wanted to get this done. But he did not have the fortitude of other members of his caucus to get it done even on a limited scale back basis. And that for me is the upsetting part. And it is even more tragic because you don't want the next knock at the door or the next hashtag to be sellers. And that is what a lot of black folk feel like.

It was as it she took every Republican talking point and hot topic in word and just put it all together in one speech. And if you close your eyes, this is a speech that Marjorie Taylor Greene could give. This is -- this is a speech which is the one of the reasons that the Republican Party has this fundamental inability to grow beyond that uber conservative base. I don't know necessarily what she was talking about or what American she was talking about. I said it sarcastically, she done a great job of banning the word of Latinx in Arkansas and examining their AP African-American curriculum and tackling the issues that are affecting pocketbooks of people who live in Arkansas.
