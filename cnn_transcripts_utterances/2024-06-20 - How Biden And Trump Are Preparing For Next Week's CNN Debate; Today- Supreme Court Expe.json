Both candidates huddling around advisers and close conference for prep sessions as they work towards the ultimate goal, which, of course, is painting their opponent is presiding over disorder and also being unfit for office. Joining me now is CNN White House correspondent Arlette Saenz and CNN national politics reporter, Steve Contorno. Good morning to you both. Arlette, first to you. What is President Biden's strategy going into the debate?",

And he and his advisors will really drill in on their debate preparations in the coming days, sources tell us it's expected that they will start with some informal discussions talking about possible topics and ways to answer the questions that could come up before a transitioning to more fulsome 90-minute mock debates. That is something that President Biden has done in many of his past debate preparations, and aides have already started compiling binders of topics possible questions and ways that the president could answer them. The president is known to offer detailed feedback in these types of sessions. Now, this debate prep is being led by his former chief of staff, Ron Klain, his deputy chief of staff, Bruce Reed, who focuses a lot on policy, has actually been here in Rehoboth Beach with the president. He has been tasked with going through materials of what Trump has said, watching hours of tape as they're trying to find ways to counter Trump on the debate stage. It is also possible that his -- the president's personal lawyer, Bob Bauer, could potentially pay play Trump in mock debates as he did in 2020. Now there already have been some prep sessions underway and in those meetings, sources say, the president has really been focused on finding ways to hold Trump accountable on the debate stage, one campaign official saying that Biden has been a lot punchier in his attacks against Trump on the campaign trail. And that is something that they are hoping will continue into this debates. But, of course, the stakes for this debate are incredibly high. Was the Biden campaign who had gone to the Trump campaign saying, hey, let's have an earlier debates. They really view this has an opportunity to present the American people, not just with Biden's policies, but really trying to offer that contrast with Trump as there has been this belief among his advisers that once people start to remember what the four years of a Trump presidency was would like, that could potentially turn this race. So that's something that they're really hoping to drive in there contracts heading into November.",

Chris Christie was one of his opponents, who is very vocally against him this cycle. So instead he has been held in sort of informal policy sessions bringing in, some of the people that he is considering for his running mate, including Senator JD Vance of Ohio, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. He's also brought an individuals like Senator Eric Schmitt of Missouri, some former advisors like Kellyanne Conway, Stephen Miller, and they're talking the former president through a whole bunch of issues, economy, border crime, abortion, the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, and trying to get him up to speed on some of the talking points they expect from President Biden. And he's also been focusing on how -- sharpening his responses to how they expect that some of the issues that come up in January 6, as well as these convictions that he is just faced in this trial that has really kept him off the campaign trail and has made it difficult for him prepare for this debate leading into next week.",

I highly doubt that will happen based on how the oral argument met. A full victory to the special prosecutor, I don't think that's going to happen either. My guess based on how oral argument when is that they'll send it back down to the judge, Judge Tanya Chutkan, to decide what -- which actions of the former president might count as official actions, which ones might count as personal, private actions?

In 2020, they had another opportunity to do so, and chose to go a different way, 2021 after January 6, there were many questions, including from Republican senators about Donald Trump's fitness for office.So the idea that merely because the litigation process is playing out on the timeline, that it was naturally supposed to play out on which the things take a long time to get to court, the idea that now voters are at some grade disadvantage based on the legal system.

It is not a democratic platform in that idea of free speech doesn't actually exist. And I think it's -- you know, there's a little bit of irony, perhaps in somebody like Elon Musk championing this idea of it as being a platform for free speech, while also simultaneously saying we shouldn't allow people who are woke, right, or who endorse DEI agendas to actually speak.
