      "sentences": "Well, I'll tell you, they do think that President Biden is a little bit too old. So this is a great question. We got a little timeline for you here. Think Biden is too old to be an effective president. You go back to June of 2020, just 36% of registered voters nationally believed that he was too old to be an effective president. Look at where we are in November of 2023, just a few months ago, this was taken in six key swing states, the six closest states that Biden won in the 2020 election. Look at this number, it is leaped up to 71%, nearly double where we were in June of 2020.And, you know, Laura, I've been looking at a lot of poll data trying to figure out why Joe Biden is trailing Donald Trump even as the economy is improving. And I must say I do believe it is tied to age because this is the one thing that just gets worse for Biden in the voters mind. He just keeps getting older. And we can see here on this individual question about age when we're looking specifically at Joe Biden. But I also want to look here, and I want to compare Trump and Biden, all right? Better at being competent and effective, this I think tells it all. So if you look back in June of 2020, among registered voters, this was nationally. Biden held a lead on this metric, OK? He was at 47% to 38%. Look at where we were just a month ago. This is an NBC News poll that came out over the weekend. Look here, Donald Trump better at being competent, effective. 48% of registered voters say that compared to just 32% of voters who say Joe Biden. So it's not just on the individual age question where voters are increasingly believing that Joe Biden is too old, he is also losing on the matchup against Donald Trump. It has become significantly worse for him. And again, when I look at all of these different poll metrics, this seems to be the one. This seems to be the one that is most closely tied, Laura, to how voters are feeling coming into this election. And this is the number one reason I believe that Joe Biden is losing the Donald Trump in the national polls. And unless he's able to do something over the months to come, twhis will be the reason that Joe Biden is not reelected.",

In the last hour, we were discussing Elise Stefanik interview here on CNN. Marc Short, you remember he's former Vice President Mike Pence's aide, he tweeted a photo that he said was of Elise Stefanik. And it turns out according to her advisors, that was not her in that photo. The photo showed a congresswoman cowered in the Capitol on January 6. So I wanted to make a note of that, that incorrect information by Marc short, Mike Pence's former chief of staff.Now on Joe Biden, which has been a big source of conversation here, what Harry just laid out, Scott, really is, I think, the big picture of all of this. We talked about the age question specifically. But when you look at the trend, in just the poll numbers, this is something that we did not see in 2020. Donald Trump leading Joe Biden in the polls and then specifically faring better than Joe Biden on the question of whether he is fit, age wise, stamina wise, to serve in this office.",

It got then further worse, because of the press conference.And I don't know how he's going to recover it. I mean, the only way to recover it would be to undertake a series of public facing events that gave people something else to think about or something else to chew on. But every time he has a public facing event, it gets worse, just like it did tonight when he had this press conference and he had a mix up while he was out there and fussed at the press. And so, they're in a real bad fix here on this topic. And, of course, Trump's not without his words, his candidacy has limitations as well, not the least of which is he may be convicted of a crime before it's over with. But right now, Trump has a consistent lead. It is mostly due to concerns about Biden's fitness. And it is not going away and it will not go away before November.",

But people who watch this saw President give a statement where he was batting down some of the issues that were in that report. He was speaking very forcefully. So the one mistake he made, which was about confusing the name of a leader in the country, we've seen other people do that recently, including Mike Johnson, the speaker who did it on Sunday on Meet the Press where he confused Israel and Iran.You know, about Harry's point about the polls, you know, Joe Biden should have never been president, according to history, right? I mean, we haven't seen a Democratic vice president get elected to the presidency since 1836, right, on his own, since Martin Van Buren. So this should never have occurred in the first place. He ran, he was nominee, no Democrat who had run before he even won the nomination since Adlai Stevenson in 1956, right? So Democratic voters actually broke history when they made Joe Biden president. So the polls in the history may say one thing, but I think this president has beaten history already. And we may see him do it again in November.",

      "sentences": "Yes. Look, I think all of that is correct. The missing caveat is that, yes, it was a historic presidency because we are actually coming out of a once in a generational pandemic. In fact, we were going through that once in a generational pandemic when the election was held. So certainly, I think that had an impact in many ways.If you go back to Nancy Pelosi ripping up the speech of Donald Trump, coming off of that State of the Union. And at that point, it was quite clear that a Trump presidency, a second term, with the 7 million jobs, pre-COVID that had been created was all but a short. So the world has changed in many, many ways since then. And one of them is the fact that as you see in these numbers, people do not believe that he has the intellectual dexterity at this particular moment to deal with the issues that are confronting this nation. And it's not just about the press conference, because I would agree, I think there are Democrats who would say that they'd like to see that fight, that fire in the belly that's still there. But it's about what happens when the cameras go away. And if you remember going all the way back to Afghanistan, when the President looked the entire nation in the eye, and he said it was unanimous recommendation of my senior military advisors to remove every single last troop. And then we watch (inaudible), chairman of the Joint Chiefs, go before Congress and say it was his recommendation to leave at least 2,500 troops behind. And to this day, nobody has asked who was lying or what was preventing that message from getting through to our commander in chief. So again, yes, you can say there's the fire in the belly. Yes, no one should take any pleasure with a statement coming officially on paper from the DOJ that the President is compromised from a from a capacity standpoint, but it opens the door to questions that many people have been talking about an whispering about for a very long time. ANA NAVARRO, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Can I say something? Listen, I think what you're seeing in those poll numbers is America having a memory lapse. And I think we don't remember just how bad Donald Trump was because he hasn't been under the scrutiny that the sitting president has been under for the last four years. And also, I will tell you, that for the last three years with a very difficult makeup in the Congress, Joe Biden has gotten more done than any other president in my lifetime. I think he is the most consequential effective president of my lifetime, who gets the least amount of credit. So the memory I want to have is about the CHIPS Act, is about the infrastructure act. It's about the $35 cap on insulin, is about all the things he's done that we don't give him credit for. And again, this is a binary choice. I think Biden's campaign slogan should be 81 years old versus 91 counts. Republicans don't care that we are nominating a criminal. Republicans don't care that we are nominating somebody who we heard boast about sexual assault. Republicans don't care that we are nominating somebody that was just held liable of sexual abuse and liable of $83 million dollars. If Joe Biden was found -- was under one count, not 91, Democrats wouldn't be nominating him.",

What do you say? ADRIANNE JAMES, JUROR, LAURA'S COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION: I think it's a slippery slope. I think that on the one hand, you know, he was president prior. And there were things that happened. And that day, he did incite a riot. I feel that he did that. He told the people go on down there and get Mike Pence to do his job. And that's what he said to them that day. And then he even told them that he was coming with them, that he was going to come with them. Don't worry, I'm going to be there with you. He kept saying that to them, I'm going to be there with you. So you're telling the crowd, you know, I'm coming with you, I'm going to be there with you, that's getting them even more hyped up. And so, they went down there and he even tried to get his secret service driver to take him to the Capitol. So we did come find that out down the line during the some of the trials that they've had, where they've had Secret Service kind of take the stand and talk about what happened that day, where he tried to grab the wheel of the car and tried to get them to take him to the Capitol and maybe use it --",

If we remove Trump for from the ballot, what is to say that we can remove another candidate from the ballot, right? The sort of laws become then arbitrary. And we sort of set a new precedent of who we can and can't put on the ballot. And when you look at the heart of the 14th Amendment, removing any biases or prejudices that we may have towards President Trump, former President Trump, certainly it does kind of get to the heart of the fact that no state can impose, certain laws with that -- that don't ensure liberty. So it kind of gets to that issue, hence why it's a slippery slope.

There were millions of us in 1976 who wanted vote for Ronald Reagan for President but we couldn't because of the process. He was not nominated by the Republican Party and Gerald Ford was.

And this country does not have leadership. It has no idea what's happening. It's lost its way it's a failing nation. And we're not going to have a failing nation much longer. I just want to really thank the great people of Nevada because this was a turnout. I don't know if you know you broke the all time record, the old time caucus record was broken. And we kept waiting and waiting be good to everybody's, they're all flowing in from all parts of your state. They all want to be. I said, well wait. But they said they'd certainly be very upset when they come here. And everyone's and everyone's gone -- and, you know, if we win this state, we easily win the election on November.

All right.Look, Trump's up potential legal calendar, where are we right now? We're at least in the east on Friday, February 9th. You have a little bit coming ahead right deadline as SCOTUS to intervene in the immunity cases on Monday. But in reality, the next big date in terms of Trump's potential legal calendar isn't at least in this point until March 25th. Now why is that important? Well, the 5th is Super Tuesday, right? That's when there are a ton of delegates that are at stake on the Republican side. And then the 12th, as I circle right here, that's the first day that anyone could potentially accumulate a majority of delegates to win the nomination. So that happens before the stormy Daniels hush money trial starts. It's before the classified documents start in May of 2024. It's certainly well before Fulton County prosecutors propulse trial starts. So the fact is, the primary may not in fact be all that impacted by it. And I will note though, if Trump wins the nomination is convicted by the GOP what should the GOP do? The majority, the clear majority of likely South Carolina GOP primary voters say he, Trump, 60% of them say keep Trump. Replace Trump is just a 36%. So I'm not sure that a conviction would have any real effect, even if it were to happen before in fact the Republican nomination process wrapped up or even afterward. But here's the one thing, Laura, that I would keep my mind out on. One thing for primary voters, it's another thing in the general election. Biden versus Trump margin. Currently, Trump plus 2 points. But if Trump is convicted, look at this, we see buying up by four points. So just because something holds with the primary electorate, Laura, doesn't mean it will hold in the general electorate. This to me is the number one X factor that I'm looking at as we head towards the general election, whether Trump gets convicted or not. We'll just have to wait and see.",
