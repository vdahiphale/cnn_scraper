But the heaviest rain is really focused across portions of Virginia and North Carolina.Jacksonville, Kingston, even stretching over towards Raleigh. From time to time, they're getting some of those heavier bands. The storm will continue to push inland and then start to veer back towards the north and east as we go through the next 24 hours but taking with it all of that heavy rain into the mid-Atlantic and areas of the northeast over the next 24 to 36 hours. So, you can see by this afternoon, you've got more of that heavy rain spreading in across Washington, D.C., Baltimore, then into Philadelphia, gradually into New York, and yes, even as far north as Boston could end up getting some rain from this particular system. Now, one of the big concerns is flooding, and specifically river flooding. This is the James River already at major flood stage right now. We expect it to dip back to minor flood stage this afternoon before coming back to major flood stage for the next high tide, which will be about 6:00 p.m. tonight, and that's just one of the few places that has a potential for some extreme flooding both today and tomorrow.",

Phillip Paxson's wife says her husband was driving back home from her daughter's birthday party last summer. His family says he was following the apps' GPS directions on a dark and rainy night, which led him to an unmarked collapsed bridge that he assumed was a safe route because of the GPS directions. This is what the bridge looked like in the daytime. Instead, he fell to his death. The lawsuit claims Google had received notifications from area residents about the bridge, but failed to update its maps. Now, Google has issued a statement that reads, \"We have the deepest sympathies for the Paxson family. Our goal is to provide accurate routing information in Maps, and we are reviewing this lawsuit.\" The family is also suing Google's parent company Alphabet and two local companies for failing to maintain the bridge. CNN has asked for comment from those co-defendants as well. So, joining me now is Alicia Paxson. Philip Paxson's widow. Alicia, I just want to start with one, I'm so sorry for your loss.

And when they built that development, they sold the houses, but their responsibility didn't stop there, they had a responsibility to either turn the roads over to the North Carolina Department of Transportation, or set up an adequate maintenance program. And they did neither. And this was a bridge that no one in the community wanted to take responsibility for. With respect to Google, Google was aware, for years, before this incident, that this bridge had collapsed. And there was essentially a cliff and a crater in the middle of a residential neighborhood. For nine years. There is no good reason why this could occur. And we have evidence that multiple complaints were made to Google, through their Google Maps application, telling them that this was an issue. Telling them that there was -- there were articles that showed that this bridge was out and they did nothing. I appreciate they have sympathy at this time.
