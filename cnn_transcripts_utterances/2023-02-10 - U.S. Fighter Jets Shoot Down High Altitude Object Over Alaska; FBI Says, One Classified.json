U.S. fighter jets shoot down an unidentified object flying at high altitude over Alaska, President Biden giving the order just hours ago and just days after the downing of the Chinese spy balloon.Also tonight, another classified document is found in the possession of former Vice President Mike Pence, the FBI removing the material from Pence's Indiana home after searching it for hours. And we'll take you inside the urgent hunt for survivors in the earthquake zone with a rescuer who's on the ground right now. We're getting dripping new accounts of people found alive as many, many more bodies are found and the death toll rises higher and higher. Welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You are in The Situation Room. Let's get right to the breaking news on the U.S. military shooting down a, quote, high altitude object just a little while ago after tracking it over Alaska for 24 hours. We have a team of correspondents and experts standing by as we break down what we know and what we don't know about this object and how it compares to the Chinese spy balloon shot down nearly a week ago. First, let's go to CNN's Chief National Security Correspondent Jim Sciutto. Jim, what are your sources telling you first of all about this object that was shot down over Alaska?",

We went there in 2018 for U.S. submarines operating in the ICEX exercises. You could see one of them there.As we saw with the Chinese surveillance balloon earlier in the week, attention focused on why might an object be in that area. We don't know. But we do know that there are military facilities up there, U.S. assets operating up there as well, similar to what we saw when saw with the Chinese surveillance balloon flying over state such as Montana, I should say, with ICBM sites.

Because as you have been talking about, they really don't know a lot about what this actually was, this mysterious object, and where it came from. And so recovery here is really critical to answering those questions.Now, the recovery of this mysterious object that was down is going to look a lot different than the recovery of the Chinese spy balloon that came down off the coast of South Carolina over the weekend, because that came down on territorial waters of the United States. This is coming down over ice. It is freezing in these Alaskan seas right now. So, it's a very different recovery. But it's just beginning. This was shot down, of course, around 1:45 P.M. today. And so we are expecting to learn more as these recovery efforts get under way. Of course, we really still don't who is in charge of this. Was it a nation state or was it a private entity that sent this object up into the air? And the other thing that is different in terms of the Chinese spy balloon and this object is the fact that the United States knew that it was a Chinese spy balloon before they shot it down. And we are told by sources that there was actually a system, a method that was developed by U.S. officials just in the last year, according to my colleagues Natasha and Katie Bo Lillis, who said that there was a method that enabled them to track the Chinese spy balloon fleet around the world. It appears that this object was not being tracked as part of that effort. Wolf? BLITZER:  All right. Kylie, thank you very much. Kylie Atwood and Phil Mattingly, appreciated very, very much. Let's discuss all of this with the former director of national intelligence, James Clapper. He's a retired U.S. Air Force Lieutenant General. He is a CNN National Security Analyst as well. General thanks so much for joining us. As you know, the Pentagon says they have no details yet on this object's origins. Do you suspect China? And how do you narrow down who was behind this?",

This is kind of a new area for us to manage. But I think at some point, there needs to be a commonly understood protocol on how these things will be handled and responded to. In this particular case, it sounds like this was a potential hazard to navigation, although I am not sure how many airplanes flying in that region, and according -- it was taken right away.

They are being very cagey about it. They are not attributing it to any state, any government, any individual. They are not saying that it is a surveillance thing, like the last one. I think it was unmanned, they say, and it was operating under its own steam. BLITZER:  Yes, very interesting. You had a chance to sit down with the president of Brazil, who is here in Washington right now. As you know, President Biden will be going to Poland later this month on the one- year anniversary of the Russian invasion, now the Russian war against the Ukrainian people right now, and I know you had a chance to discuss this with the president of Brazil.

Now we have to find people to fix the mistake, to fix the error that was made. I know that Brazil doesn't have that international political clout to promote that in this rationale of conflicts in the world, but I can say to you that I will dedicate a lot of my time to find a way, a road for someone to start talking about peace.

We've learned they've also turned over an empty folder that is marked classified evening briefing.Now, these previously undisclosed handovers, it just reminds us of how much time it has taken the Justice Department to try and get back all of the classified documents they're in the possession of the former president. Now, we learned that Trump attorneys first discovered this additional classified material back in December as they were going through some boxes. They discovered these additional documents with classified markings. They also subsequently learned that many of those documents had been copied, scanned onto a laptop and a thumb drive, which is why those electronic devices were also handed over to investigators. Now, of course special counsel Jack Smith has been carrying out an investigation looking into whether the former president may have mishandled classified documents and looking at whether he's trying to obstruct this ongoing federal investigation. And that's just one of his investigations into the former president. The other is, of course, his efforts and the efforts of those around him to try to subvert the 2020 election. And, look, Wolf, the former president's lawyers would like to tell you that these investigations are ramping up, that they're pretty much over. But our reporting has shown in the past few days that these are very active and ongoing. We're seeing in addition to this new evidence they are gathering, they are also sending out fresh subpoenas to top Trump officials, including the former national security adviser Robert O'Brien. He was subpoenaed in both investigations and, of course, as we reported yesterday and today, vice president Mike Pence also subpoenaed in the January 6th probe.",
