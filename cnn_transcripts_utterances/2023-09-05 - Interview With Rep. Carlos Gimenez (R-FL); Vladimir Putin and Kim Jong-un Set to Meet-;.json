He was spotted on a botanical garden security camera just a few miles from the prison that he escaped from last Thursday. And police are now expanding their search area, as they are scouring the woods about 30 miles west now of Philadelphia. Two school districts are closed today while all of this is happening. Police have been using a unique tactic, helicopters and patrol cars blasting an audio message from the escapee's mother urging him to surrender. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. COL. GEORGE BIVENS, PENNSYLVANIA STATE POLICE:  Early this morning, we were notified by security at Longwood Gardens that they had trail camera photos taken on their property which appear to be Cavalcante. This area is just south of the perimeter. Investigators quickly examined those photos, and we can confirm it is Cavalcante. The photos confirm that Cavalcante has not changed his appearance, but also that he has obtained a backpack, a duffel sling-type pack, and a hooded sweatshirt. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

They believe that he is desperate, and they believe that he will be looking for any sort of way to get resources, whether it's resorting to burglarizing a house or trying to get items or resources from a vehicle. But I want to go back to, Brianna, what the big headline of the day is, which is that the Pennsylvania State Police, they say that they are expanding and intensifying their search. And, Brianna, this is six days into this manhunt since Cavalcante escaped from the Chester County prison behind me. And now we have had six confirmed sightings of him, including that one overnight from the botanical gardens. And I want to describe the gardens a little bit. It's Longwood Gardens. It's a very famous tourist destination here in Chester County. And, Brianna, it's massive. It's 200 acres of winding trails, of meadows, and also of lush gardens. That's where police have focused their efforts overnight and into this morning. We have seen a number of helicopters flying overhead and a lot of State Troopers blocking off a lot of roads just south of where we are. And it's really not that far. It's about five miles from where we are here at the prison. So, on the one hand, police say that, yes, he did slip through the perimeter they had earlier. But, on the other hand, he has not gotten that far. But the risk is real. Take a listen to what one resident in the area said about an encounter he believes he had with the suspect.

      "sentences": "That's exactly right, because the indictment that the special counsel filed on January 6, it focused solely on former President Trump.It was narrowly tailored and designed so that they could bring it to trial possibly before the 2024 election. But it specifically mentions co-conspirators. And our colleague Zach Cohen and I have done some reporting to look at whether any of those co-conspirators could be charged. And what we have learned is that, in recent weeks, investigators have been asking a lot of questions about one of those co-conspirators especially, and that is Sidney Powell, the Trump-aligned lawyer who helped push a lot of those bogus claims of voter fraud and who worked to try to overturn the outcome of the election. Now, they have focused their questions on three specific things. First of all, they have asked if these witnesses ever saw any evidence of the false claims that Powell was making, these conspiracy theories she was pushing. They were also really interested in her nonprofit, Defending the Republic. Now, this is a group that was fund-raising off of these lies, and they were particularly interested in what that group did with its money, including the third thing, these efforts to get forensic experts to breach voting systems. And we know that, according to an invoice obtained by CNN, that Defending the Republic did pay for forensic experts who were able to breach voting systems in four states won by now President Biden. Now, it's unclear if Powell or anyone else will be charged, but this really changes our understanding of exactly where this investigation is. We thought maybe they were going to go really narrow on January 6 and let the state down in Georgia do a more broad criminal prosecution, which included Powell and others. But, according to this reporting, that may not be how this turns out.",

Now, if they were to add additional charges, it could potentially impact the timeline of the former president's trial.

According to the National Security Council, Russia's defense minister, Sergei Shoigu, visited North Korea himself in July to try to convince Pyongyang to sell artillery ammunition to Moscow.

He's tested negative for COVID both yesterday and today. He has shown no symptoms.

We're going to keep monitoring the conversation from the White House. But, first, another major development in Russia's war on Ukraine. The Cuban government says it's uncovered a human trafficking network that's tricking Cubans into fighting for Russia in Ukraine. The Cuban Foreign Ministry says it is now working to -- quote -- \"neutralize and dismantle\" the trafficking network, though. No arrests have been reported. We want to discuss this and more with Congressman Carlos Gimenez, a Republican from Florida. He serves on the House Armed Services and Homeland Security committees. Congressman, thanks so much for being with us today. So, this would not be the first time, as you well know, that Cubans have been recruited to fight at the behest of the Kremlin. But did the response from the Cuban government here condemning this surprise you? REP. CARLOS GIMENEZ (R-FL):  Well, yes, a little bit, because it's first time I have ever heard such a thing. But I'm a little bit cynical about it, because there's also reports that the Cuban government actually signed some kind of deal with the Russian government to send Cuban soldiers over to Russia to fight in Ukraine. And just like they did with -- are they doing with their doctors, they're going to pocket about 80 percent to 90 percent of the money, it's like $2,000 a month per soldier, so that it helps the Cuban government. And so, yes, I'm a little bit cynical about the announcement. It is the first of its kind, though, I have ever heard of it, but I sincerely doubt that they're sincere.",
