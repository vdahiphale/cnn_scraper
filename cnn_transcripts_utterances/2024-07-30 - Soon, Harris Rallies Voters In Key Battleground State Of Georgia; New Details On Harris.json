NIKEMA WILLIAMS (D-GA): So, I don't know if you can hear the background or see the vibe in this room, but Georgia Democrats are ready. We are fired up, ready for Vice President Harris to take the stage. She has been to Georgia 15 times since she's been vice president, but this is her first as the presumptive nominee of our party. And Georgia Democrats are ready to do the work. We are a true battleground state. I talked with the vice president about her commitment to investing in Georgia, and this is proof in the pudding. Georgia is on the vice president's mind as we push her to victory and deliver our 16 Electoral College votes. We've got work to do, but we always knew that because Georgia is a battleground state. We've got a choice on the ballot, a clear contrast with Vice President Harris protecting our freedom, and Donald Trump trying to take us back with this dangerous Project 2025. So, we are not discouraged, we're not listening to the noise, except for the good vibes that are in this room today. But we know that we have work to do and we're going to do it again.",

And then Donald Trump decided that he didn't actually want action, he didn't actually want policy results. He wanted to use politics to get in the way of delivering for the American people and protecting and securing our border.So, it was Republicans who put that plan out of place that their colleagues in the Senate had already negotiated, but then Donald Trump, as he has done in so many other things, has injected himself into the policies of his party, and that's who they're following. We know that we have work to do. We're listening to the American people, not to Donald Trump, and what he wants to put in people's minds. Because we understand that Vice President Harris is moving forward on a path towards the future, protecting our freedoms, our freedom to vote, our reproductive freedoms, and our freedoms to thrive economically.

I was in contact with a senior media advisor to the group a few hours ago and he said he was going to get back to us shortly. But that's been a few hours ago now, so we don't know his fate. But certainly, if this man was killed as the Israelis claimed, it's the most significant assassination of a Hezbollah leader either since the 2008 killing of Imad Mughniyeh, a man who has implicated in the attack on the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut in 1983, that left 241 marines dead. And it certainly represents the most significant escalation between them his Hezbollah and Israel since the beginning of hostilities on the 8th of October. Now, in the past, the leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, has said that an attack on Beirut is a red line and they will meet escalation with escalation. So at this point everyone one is waiting to see how Hezbollah will respond. If it's limited, perhaps a, something worse can be avoided.

The first time and reporters have been able to see the door plug since it shot off that Boeing 737 MAX 9 back on January 5.That incident left a gaping hole in the side of Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 which sparked major questions about Boeing's quality control. Now, to see this, I was taken inside the National Transportation Safety Board's material lab. That's where investigators have been analyzing this door plug over the course of months. This is the single biggest piece of evidence in this case, and reporters were kept behind a perimeter, a blue tape on the floor because this investigation is still going on. Now, what was visible where the chafing marks at the very top of the door. That is what investigators call witness marks. Now, the NTSB used marks like this to say that the door was loosely shimmying against the frame of that 737 for months. Also, you could see damaged metal down here at the bottom of the door plug. This is where the door plug cleared the hinges when it shot away from the plane. What was not visible were the four key bolts that would have kept the door solidly on those hinges. There would have been four of them, one at each corner of the door, the NTSB says that those bolts were removed at Boeing's factory in Renton, Washington, and not re-installed.",
