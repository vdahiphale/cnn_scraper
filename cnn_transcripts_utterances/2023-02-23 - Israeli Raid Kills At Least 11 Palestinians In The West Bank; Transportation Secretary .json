Israeli military forces killed at least 11 Palestinians during a daytime raid on Wednesday that also injured almost 500 others.Elliott Gotkine joins me live from Jerusalem. Elliott, Palestinian officials are calling this latest raid a massacre -- their words -- but the Israeli Defense Force says it was targeting three militants. What can you tell us? ELLIOTT GOTKINE, CNN That's right, Christine. Daytime raids are quite rare because of the risk both to Israeli forces and, of course, to civilians, and they're not unprecedented. But this one happened yesterday. It started soon after 10:00 a.m. local time. The Israeli security forces saying that they were targeting three militants who had holed themselves up in a house. When they didn't surrender, they -- one of the militants fled. He was shot dead. And then a rocket was fired into the house and the other two militants were also killed. As you say, 11 dead so far and more than 100 injured due to live ammunition. That's according to the Palestinian Red Crescent. And as you also said, almost 500 injured in total, including wounds from tear gas inhalation and shrapnel. Now, Israel said that it carried out this raid in the daytime because in its words there was a specific intelligence indication of an imminent attack. And it says that the militants that they were seeking to apprehend were responsible for killing an Israeli soldier. And now according to the Palestinian Red Crescent -- according to its head in Nablus -- this is Ahmad Jibril -- he says that there was live ammunition being fired from the rooftops. He said the bullets were flying everywhere. And, of course, at that time of the day many people would have been out shopping in the old city of Nablus and there were many civilians around. And it does seem that of those 11 deaths that we have so far that several of them at least were civilians. Now, we've asked the IDF to get back with us with more detail as to just how so many Palestinians could have been injured in this raid on Nablus yesterday and we are awaiting their reply. We'll get back to you when we get it -- Christine.",

So Miles and another man are facing capital murder charges. Miller, meanwhile -- he has not faced any charges and Alabama announced that he would continue to be on the team. And during the game in South Carolina last night, fans chanted \"lock him up\" and \"guilty\" as he was playing every time he touched the ball, but it did not phase Miller. Miller scored a career-high 41 points, including a basket to send the game into overtime. And then in O.T. he actually hit the game-winner as well. Second-ranked Alabama wins 78-76.

And -- because you have less savings, you're more likely to lose your job, you're more likely to lose your home or be evicted. And people who have more money have much more of a cushion built up. Now, that's still the case this time. It's still better to have more money and more education heading into a downturn than it was before, but it's a really unusual one. You have more economists now predicting a recession in the next 12 months than you did before the big great financial crisis. You have -- you just mentioned Meta laying off another 11,000 people. Tens of thousands of layoffs of these very highly-paid workers. Yet, you have unemployment at a 53-year low when you have help wanted signs going up all over the place for service-sector jobs. So you are, relatively speaking, in a much better position if you are someone who does something that's not as well-rewarded or doesn't have as much education because people want you to do jobs and they're looking for you. And that's not to say you're getting out the world's tiniest violin for people who have a lot of money but it's different.
