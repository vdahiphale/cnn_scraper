And I think, look, this is a moment three days before Election Day when both parties are going all in on their most important races, their most important States, and for Democrats, they are making clear, it is the State of Pennsylvania, and it is the big City of Philadelphia.The reason why is quite simple: They need their voters to vote. That sounds simplistic to some degree. However, Midterm Elections are often the moments where Democrats in particular see major drop offs in their kind of stalwart homes, places like Philadelphia, places like Pittsburgh, that's where President Obama was earlier today. Now, he is here. A presidential bookend of some sorts for Josh Shapiro, who is speaking behind me, running for Governor and John Fetterman who is running for Senate. President Biden going before them, President Obama to close this event in Philadelphia, and the mood to some degree is of a rally-like atmosphere that we haven't necessarily seen as much over the course of the last several months, particularly for President Biden. They have been very focused at the White House of trying to have tailored events to talk about the President's accomplishments in their view, to buck up certain members. This is a very tried and true campaign rally. And this is purely driven to get out the vote in this critical city. Alex, Philadelphia County was a county President Biden won by more than 60 points in 2020 in a race in a State that he only won by 80,000 votes. They need that kind of margin here. The exact reason that President Trump right now is in Western Pennsylvania, and that's why Biden and Obama are here. President Obama will be speaking after John Fetterman. Obviously, that Senate race is what everybody really has their eyes on here, a pickup opportunity for Democrats as they have several other very tight races. This is a race Democrats say they need to win. They think they can win. And now, you've got a former President and the current President trying to deliver that win -- Alex.",

So how did this happen? We're being told by the Elections Office through a letter to its Board members and by the Cobb County spokesperson that this was simply human error by one of the supervisors. Take a look at a statement sent out by the Board of Elections Chair that says: \"While human error was clearly a factor, I believe reduced timeframes of the receipt of requests for and processing of absentee ballots provided under SB 202, as well as the turnover in the Elections Office are also significant factors.\" So you see there, she mentioned turnover. They lost a lot of people in their staffing, so a lot of people had to be retrained for these positions. We're being told that people in the office are working 80- plus hours a week, they are overworked. And you saw she mentioned SB 202, which was the bill that was passed here in Georgia by the Republican-controlled legislature that really changed the timeframes for accepting and processing absentee ballots that changed early voting, it changed a lot of things on how the vote process is worked out here, the election process in the State of Georgia.

The nation's top cybersecurity officials are saying that there are no specific or credible threats to disrupt Election Day, but if you have a sense of unease about what could happen in the next few days, you're not alone.Only 26 percent of Republican voters say that they're very confident that their in-person votes will be counted correctly compared to 55 percent of Democratic voters. Confidence then drops for Republican voters when it comes to absentee or mail-in ballots, just 10 percent saying that they are very confident that those votes will be counted accurately. Hereto, Democratic voters have much more confidence. Overall confidence in the vote count accuracy, that has declined since the events of the 2020 election. Jen Easterly joins us now.

You have these unprecedented physical security concerns, threats of violence, intimidation, and harassment. And then of course, you've got rampant disinformation, which can be used by foreign adversaries to sow discord to undermine confidence in the integrity of our elections or even to incite physical violence. As you said, though, we have no information about specific or credible threats to disrupt or compromise election infrastructure, but we are working very, very closely with State and local election officials to make sure they have everything that they need on Tuesday to run safe and secure elections.",

And so we do a couple things, we put out information about the tactics of disinformation, and then how Americans can build resilience to it, recognize it, question the source, investigate it, not amplify it. We have an election literacy site called Rumor Versus Reality that puts out accurate information. But at the end of the day, elections are surprisingly complicated and technical. And so, what we really do is we focus on those State and local election officials who know the most about their voting infrastructure, and we're really amplifying their voices as trusted voices. I have to emphasize though, Alex, you know, CISA is a nonpartisan agency. We work with election officials, regardless of party, regardless of politics, whether they're elected or appointed to ensure that they all have what they need to run safe and secure elections. I think we need to recognize that ensuring safe and secure elections is a non-partisan issue, and so we all need to work together to make sure that that is the case.",

And look, you know, I've interviewed (Nick) so many times over the years, and back before I worked at CNN, and you know, he had long suffered with drugs and alcohol addiction. Just this fall, he lost custody of his 10-month-old child and he entered rehab again, because he was trying to turn his life around to regain custody of his child. He has been in the headlines for not the things that he loved, which was music and making art and that has been really hard for the people around him over the last several years. You know, he went on \"The Doctors.\" He's been on television shows talking about his issues with addiction. You know, I confirmed this news earlier from a family friend that he was found dead in a bathtub in his home. Again, no further details from authorities as of right now as to what happened. We haven't heard yet from his older brother, Nick Carter, who is one of the members of the Backstreet Boys. But again, you know, Aaron had several hit songs in the early 2000s. He was on Nickelodeon. A few years ago, he was on \"Dancing with the Stars.\" You know, he had highs and lows and ebbs and flows. But, you know, at times he would come out and say \"I need help;\" other times, he would say publicly, \"I don't need help, and I don't have a drug and alcohol problem.\" It's incredibly sad. And I was just talking to my colleague, Lisa France at CNN and we were talking about how you really see this with younger stars who grow up in the spotlight, sometimes in the shadow of their older siblings, and just -- he has talked so publicly about his struggle with fame, and all of the attention and his family has had issues and not just him with drugs and alcohol. One of his sisters, she died of a drug overdose, a prescription pill overdose when she was 25 years old, and that really shook the family deeply. And so, you know, again, the details around his death still unclear, incredibly sad, tragic. He was a talented guy, really a kind soul. And we've seen this with so many stars, whether it's Whitney Houston, but you know, so many celebrities who have struggled with drugs and alcohol. And Aaron, he did enter rehab even just this fall.

Iran now saying it did provide a limited number of drones to Russia, but adding the caveat that those were given in the months prior to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.This admission happening in a press conference Saturday with Iran's Foreign Minister, but there is a big but here. Yes, Iran admitting giving these drones, but not admitting that these drones have been used here in Ukraine. Instead, Iran's Foreign Minister saying he is in touch with his Ukrainian counterpart and that he has requested concrete evidence from Ukraine that this is taking place on the ground and going on to say that if indeed they were provided that evidence, that Iran would not be indifferent to the matter, really vague statement there. But just to give you some context, Iranian drones have been found -- or their remnants here in Ukraine -- according to Ukrainian officials. They've terrorized civilians including here in Kyiv and Western officials, Western sources familiar with Iran's weapons program say more weaponry is on the way, that Iran is preparing to send more drones and more ballistic missiles to Russia. An important note here, this admission could have consequences for Tehran. The United States and other allies have said if Iran continues to provide weapons to Russia in its illegal war here in Ukraine, it could face more sanctions -- Alex.",

And we are seeing that, of course. But inflation remains uncomfortably high.So they have to do what they can, which is raise interest rates in order to get inflation down. What the Fed decided to do, of course, was to raise interest rates by three quarters of a percentage point. There is some indication that going forward they will raise rates by a smaller increment each time. So it's a little bit gentler, a little bit less aggressive. Because, of course, they're worried about what happens to labor markets, what might happen to GDP growth, things like that. But they're going to keep their eye on the ball. They're going to keep raising rates for a good long while until inflation gets under control.",

I think there's sort of a misperception of what's going on here and people think the Federal Reserve is trying to tank the economy or trying to drive unemployment upward. In fact, what they're hoping to do is to cool the economy just enough to get inflation under control, but not so much that they accidentally kill the patient with their medicine.So among the indicators that the Federal Reserve is looking at, for example, is the number of vacancies, the number of job openings. In theory, you could have the number of job openings and there are now about two per unemployed worker come down without displacing a lot of people who already have jobs. Now, that may be an optimistic timeline, but that's the kind of outcome they're looking for. They don't want people to lose their jobs. They don't obviously want people's wages to go down. What they're hoping for is that they can cool the economy just enough without causing a lot of pain. But Powell, among others has indicated, that's a tricky balance to get right and they may get it wrong. In the past, the Fed has gotten it wrong.",

And later, a product director at Twitter said that they're still testing things out in real time.So it does seem like they are in a final sprint here to launch that feature.

Georgia tied and Georgia at this point is the most likely to be the 50th seat and, of course, you need a majority of the vote there to win in November. Otherwise, there's a runoff.My bet at this point is there's probably going to be a runoff, of course, we'll see. And if that's the case, it could be we have to wait until December, Georgia runoff in December to know who controls the United States Senate. But don't lose track in Nevada, where there's a very interesting race. Right now, the Republican there, Adam Laxalt holds a very small edge, but again, well within the margin of error.

It's just 202, just 202, and of course, 218 is needed for a majority. So when we talk about that first slide and Democrats having only about a 10 percent chance of holding on to the house, it's because Joe Biden's approval rating is so low at this point, it looks like Democrats are going to suffer major losses in the House of Representatives.",

The net favorability of the Republican candidates in all of these states is underwater. That is more people have an unfavorable view than favorable view in all these states and it's not particularly really close minus nine points for Blake Masters in Arizona, minus 15 points for Herschel Walker in Georgia, minus five points for Adam Laxalt in Nevada and Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania, minus 11 points.
