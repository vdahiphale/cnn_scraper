Now, Ozempic and Mounjaro are both approve for type 2 diabetes. Wegovy is the only one actually approved for chronic weight management. And you can see in trials they've led to weight loss of between five and 22 percent. That 22 is for Mounjaro's trial in obesity, so they are awaiting an FDA indication there. But now we are starting to see this data emerge actually showing that in addition to weight loss, they actually have protective effects against heart attack and stroke and potentially, heart-related death. Twenty-six percent were seen in a previous trial of Ozempic and people with diabetes.

That's according to a new CNN investigation. CNN was the first to report on the investigation's coverup in June. It revealed a dark history of sexual misconduct at the Academy that leaders covered up in favor of protecting the Coast Guard's reputation.CNN's chief investigative correspondent Pamela Brown is live in Washington this morning. So, Pamela, you spoke exclusively with the commandant's predecessor. What did you learn? PAMELA BROWN, CNN CHIEF INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT:  That's right, we did speak exclusively with Adm. Zukunft, who launched Operation Fouled Anchor, but left before it was completed. He says he briefed his successor, Adm. Karl Schultz, about the importance of this investigation into sexual assault, and he said he expected it to be made public. But when the investigation wrapped up in 2020, the report with the disturbing findings of systemic sex abuse at the Academy was buried.

Schultz would not speak to CNN. The report, dubbed Operation Foul Anchor, found dozens of cases of sexual abuse and rape at the Academy from the late '80s to 2006 that leaders ignored or mishandled. It was kept hidden until CNN reported it in June.

If you look at what Democrats have done -- you know, they and progressives -- they've done a really good job of not only activating their base around this issue but they have now built a coalition that also involves Republican moderates in the suburban areas as well as Independents. So if you look at the backdrop of the politics of this, Republicans have to go out there and pro-life advocates have to go out there and find a way to find a better message for what the post-Roe world looks like and what legislation looks like state-by-state. And they've got to go and build a coalition that sort of addresses the concerns that many Republican moderates who may have voted with Republicans who were pro-life before but are now very worried about this post-Roe world.
