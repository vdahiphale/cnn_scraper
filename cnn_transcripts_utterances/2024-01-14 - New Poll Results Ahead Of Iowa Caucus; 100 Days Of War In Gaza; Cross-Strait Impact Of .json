I'm Paula Newton.Ahead here on CNN NEWSROOM: A new poll shows Donald Trump with a massive lead in the Iowa caucuses as candidates battle not just each other, but dangerous winter weather ahead of Monday's polling. Plus, it's been 100 days of war in Gaza. And Israel's prime minister says there will be no stopping the bombardment until it meets its goals. And, Taiwan has a new president-elect.

And a just released poll shows Donald Trump holds an iron grip on the GOP. The final \"Des Moines Register\" poll, and that is \"The Des Moines Register\"/NBC News/Mediacom poll of likely Republican caucusgoers chose Trump support at 48 percent. Nikki Haley is at 20 percent. And Ron DeSantis at 16 percent.Iowa is coping now with a vicious winter storm that has forced candidates to cancel events during this critical final weekend. Now amid the concerns, the storm will affect the turnout of Monday's caucuses and candidates, of course, are still working to try and build enthusiasm. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIKKI HALEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Now, Monday is going to be cold, really cold. But what I'm asking you is if you will take the time to not just go to the polls, take people with you. Wear layers, because you might be standing in line. Take your ID, but think of the fact that you might be making history in this moment. GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  They can throw a blizzard at us, and we are going to fight.

This Iowa poll which has a storied history of capturing the final movements in this race shows Donald Trump at 48 percent in the poll. The race for second place is fascinating, with Nikki Haley edging out Florida Governor Ron DeSantis just narrowly, 20 percent followed by 16 percent. The rest of the field is far below, Vivek Ramaswamy 8 percent, the rest goes down from there. But it is the top of the field, showing that Donald Trump still has an overwhelming lead of the race, his supporters the most committed. The reason this matters, weather has been a central concern, blizzard warnings and dangerously cold weather, the committed supporters may be the answer to who shows up on the caucuses here on Monday night in Iowa. But Haley is riding a wave of momentum, although the poll finds that her supporters are not as committed or enthusiastic as others. It also shows that some 68 percent of people have made up their minds, a quarter of Iowa voters have not made up their minds. So, there's still room for movement in this race. But bottom line, this is still Donald Trump's race to lose, there is no doubt. Also, this poll raises expectations of it. He's 28 points ahead of his leading rival, so his margin of victory should he have one on Monday night should be judged against that number. Jeff Zeleny, CNN, Des Moines. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

All the major polls have Trump solidly ahead near the 50 percent mark. And Haley in second.But when you go beneath the raw numbers you find that Trump support, very solid, not as solid however, is the support for either Haley or DeSantis.

You can't keep destroying Hamas and expect them to come to the negotiating table to bring about another truce that would see the more than 100 hostages who have presumably been kept deep inside Hamas' tunnel network to get them back.Israel's perspective, the prime minister has said it is the military pressure that will force Hamas to eventually release those hostages. But at the same time, there are concerns, of course, that is just simply not going to happen. So while I do have very broad support for the war aims of destroying Hamas, Israel has been traumatized for those 100 days since what was the worst day in the country's history, and the deadliest attack and murderous day against Jews in the Holocaust. And yet, at the same time, they all agree they want the hostages home. Are they contradicting one another? I'm not sure those two objectives can be achieved simultaneously. Of course, they are all there in Israel, due to last for 24 hours. They are all there not just to keep up the pressure on the government to do all that it can to bring them home. To make bringing the hostages back the number one priority. But it is also to remind the world that 100 days on, these people, more than 100 of them, are still being kept by Hamas and other groups inside the Gaza Strip.

I don't think any thinking person would suggest they shouldn't be allowed. Be free to go home. Israel despite attempt has only managed to free one hostage since this war began. There have been a number of attempts, all of them have failed, to bring other hostages home in terms of, you know, doing it militarily. And so, it does seem the truce (AUDIO GAP) that something like this is going to happen. There is no sign of that coming about, things like the assassination of al-Arouri on January 2 presumably by Israel isn't helping matter, in fact, it's making it even harder to get the hostages home, Paula.",

Several, including the two largest in Gaza, Al-Shifa and Al-Quds, were directly attacked by Israel Defense Forces, this evidence suggests.
