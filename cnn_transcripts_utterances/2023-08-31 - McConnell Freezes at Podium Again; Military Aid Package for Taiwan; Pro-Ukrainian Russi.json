As we mentioned earlier, he froze for about 30 seconds yesterday while speaking with reporters in Kentucky. That's about a month after he did the same exact thing on Capitol Hill during a press conference. I want to bring in our panel. Senior reporter for \"The Root,\" Jessica Washington, former Manhattan prosecutor Jeremy Saland, and political video reporter for \"The Washington Post,\" Joyce Koh. Joyce, I want to start with you because the first response I think for most people, I hope, is, there's a human response of that's scary - it's scary to watch. It's scary to watch. I know his team feels the same exact way. People who don't like him feel the same exact way for political reasons, feel the same exact way from a human reason. But the what's next is, I think, a very real, palpable growing question on Capitol Hill. What's your sense of things? JOYCE KOH, POLITICAL VIDEO REPORTER, \"THE WASHINGTON POST\":  Yes, we saw that human response from members of both sides of the aisle. President Biden, yesterday, even responding saying they have political differences, but that he was concerned watching that and he was going to call his friend, Mitch McConnell, later on and check up on him. And you even hear that from the ground in Kentucky. I was speaking to several sources there, state lawmakers, who watched that and they said their jaws dropped when they saw Mitch McConnell experiencing this freezing episode again. But, you're right, the big question that comes after this is that Democrats specifically in Kentucky are asking is whether or not there are people around McConnell in his circle, his aides, his staffers that are having these conversations with him on whether or not, you know, he served a very long time, he's been in office in that position since 1985, whether or not he should be resigning at this point seeing that there are these health concerns that are very visible in the public eye. You know, it also goes to these questions of, he's made no indication that he's going to resign. You know, he said that he's fine. His office has said that it was him feeling lightheaded. But if he were to resign, you know, what would that look like. The formal process in Kentucky now is that the governor of -",

Because when it comes to the president, you see a lot of people, especially on the right, really going after him, saying that he is too old to do the job that he's doing. But you have Mitch McConnell, which you don't hear that form the right, and you have Dianne Feinstein, who where - who has also been attacked. She has said she's going to - she's not going to run again. But she's still in her position.What's going to happen? Is this going to play into the 2024 presidential race you think? JESSICA WASHINGTON, SENIOR REPORTER, \"THE ROOT\": Yes, I think there's potential for it. The fact that age is becoming salient, certainly people were talking about Mitch McConnell's multiple episodes. I think there's deep concern, you know, are these people cognitively able to do the job, particularly with Mitch McConnell, where we can see it visibly. I think with Biden we haven't seen these same episodes. So, I do think this is going to play into it. And we've already seen it in polling. I mean polling, both among Democrats and, you know, Republicans, they're saying, you know, Biden might be too old for this job. I don't think that means that Democrats are not going to pull the lever for him. We haven't had any indication that they're going to say, I would rather have Trump or another Republican in office over Biden because of his age, but certainly this seems like a salient issue in the election.",

The package totals $80 million and U.S. taxpayers will, of course, be footing the bill for that.CNN's Kylie Atwood joins us live from the State Department. What can you tell us about what this - what this is and the timing of all of this is significant as well? KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, there's a few things about this new type of military assistance that the U.S. is giving to Taiwan that are pretty significant, Sara. First of all, this is typically a program that, as you said, is for sovereign nations. And so this is the U.S. providing military support to Taiwan, as it has in the past, but through this new program. And because the U.S. is going ahead and providing this assistance with this new type of program, it's likely to enrage China, because we have seen China be infuriated in the past when the U.S. has provided military support to Taiwan. But because they're using this different kind of program, typically for sovereign nations, of course China doesn't view Taiwan as a sovereign nation, it's likely to see China pretty enraged by this situation. The other fact that we need to consider is just, you know, what make this is program different than the other types of military sales that the U.S. has given to Taiwan in the past. The difference here is that this financing for this program is actually paid for by U.S. taxpayer dollars. So, Taiwan isn't going to be paying for this military equipment. It's the U.S. government, U.S. taxpayer dollars that are going to be paying for this $80 million in new military equipment going to Taiwan. Now, when the State Department alerted Congress earlier this week that they were moving ahead with this funding, here's what they said. Quote, \"FMF, which is Foreign Military Financing, will be used to strengthen Taiwan's self-defense capabilities through joint and combined defense capability and enhanced maritime domain awareness and maritime security capability. Now this alert didn't say exactly what kind of military support Taiwan is going to get with this new financing, but there are a whole host of options that could be included, like drones, like military training, like missile defense programs, a lot of options that Taiwan is now going to be open to because of this new financing.

All right, this morning, new U.S. intelligence reveals Russia and North Korea are actively advancing negotiations for a potential arms deal. Russian officials have visited Pyongyang twice in the last month. The National Security Council also says North Korean Dictator Kim Jong-un and Russian President Vladimir Putin have been exchanging letters pledging to increase their bilateral cooperation.

Now, this one, as you mentioned, hit a residential building. They went across the border, and with their drones say they also managed to attack an airfield, causing damage there. Now, Russia has denied and said that it managed to push off -- foil those drone attacks, but it is important, not only because of the political aspect that began this Russian group functioning from within Ukraine's borders, but because of the increasingly obvious porous nature of that border. One thousand 200 miles that separate Ukraine from Russia that have increasingly seen not just attacks by these particular paramilitary Russian groups, but, of course, also by Ukrainian forces over the course of the last few months. We saw overnight, on Wednesday, the largest drone attack on Russia since it war began. And that's important because it is about taking out Russian capabilities even as Russia tries to resupply its lines just south of here in Zaporizhzhia where Ukrainian forces have continued to make such progress.
