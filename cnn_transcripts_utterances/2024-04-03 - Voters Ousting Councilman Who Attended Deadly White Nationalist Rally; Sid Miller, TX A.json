The voters of Enid ousting their city commissioner, Judd Blevins, for taking part in the deadly white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, back in 2017.CNN is projecting that Blevins will lose the special recall election to Republican Cheryl Patterson, who is a former teacher. Blevins denies being a white supremacist. But when videos and photos surfaced shortly after he took office last year, activists uncovered his past and worked to recall him from office. CNN's Ed Lavandera reports on their decisive victory.",

He won just by 36 votes, despite a controversial pathway, which includes ties to white nationalist organizations, as well as having participated in the Unite the Right rallies in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017. This group of activists sounded the alarm about Blevins' controversial past. Now, despite all of that, Blevins did manage to get about 40 percent of the vote here in Enid. But those activists say a win is a win and they are relieved the election turned out the way it has. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Health officials say he'd been in direct contact with cows that were infected. We're joined now by Texas agricultural commissioner, Sid Miller, to talk a little bit more about this. Commissioner, thank you for taking the time with us today. You've said that this is devastating, not just for Cal-Maine, but for the entire Texas Panhandle region. First, can you just talk about what this is going to mean for food production and farms there?",

So the likelihood of catching it -- I mean, this person was actually in the dairy that had sick cows. So were recommending to the dairies that their workers take precautions, you know, protective equipment, respiratory equipment, goggles, and gloves, things like that.

But the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, has just put out a new forecast that just really digs into the cloud cover. And it's -- cloud covers everything. it's notoriously difficult to predict, but there it is. And you can just see the clouds really go right along the line of path of totality. Texas, Arkansas looking really bad. The one bright spot is like southern Missouri, central Indiana, and then farther up north in New England and Upstate New York. But that huge patch in the southern portion of the United States, not looking great. And it is just the difference between heavy cloud cover and none is huge.

That is a huge amount of time compared to what it was back during the last eclipse in 2017, almost double the amount of time of when it's going to be so dark that you can even see the stars in the middle of the day. That's what we're talking about here. And also the sun is much more active right now. So all the coronal flares and those little wispy things that you see coming off the surface of the sun during those moments of totality, it's supposed to be much more active and, quite frankly, cool looking.
