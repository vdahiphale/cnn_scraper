The president-elect is standing by his decision to elevate MAGA fire brands to top government positions and tells his team that Matt Gaetz as attorney general is the most important pick he will make.Plus, is Elon Musk flying too close to the sun? The richest man in the world seems to go everywhere Trump goes. And now is using his social media platform to publicly push his favorite cabinet picks and preparing for a purge. We have new reporting on the hunt to find and fire federal employees. Those employees at the Trump team believe are too not enough -- not MAGA enough. I should say for the cause. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. We start with the potential problem for the Trump transition team. The House Ethics Committee is now planning to meet on Wednesday, as pressure builds to release their findings on the president-elect's pick for attorney general, Matt Gaetz. Today, we're learning new details about the potentially damning evidence that even Trump's Senate allies say, they want to see. CNN's Paula Reid broke this story. Paula?",

      "sentences": "Oh, Dana, these new details come from a civil lawsuit filed by a Gaetz associate. The former congressman is not a party to this litigation, but it targeted people involved in the criminal investigation Gaetz faced, including the woman who is allegedly 17 when Gaetz had sex with her, as well as one of Gaetz's former friends.And as a result of this lawsuit being filed, the parties engaged in discovery. They created a whole new record of evidence, some of which is public. They spoke to witnesses, including that underage girl now her deposition and those of some of the other women in the case are under seal. But lawyers in the case, they were pretty clever because they introduced portions of her testimony that's under seal when they questioned other witnesses. So, they referenced the underage girl's testimony, including that she says she had sex with Gaetz on an air hockey table. So, the lawyer asked, quote, and you heard her testimony that she said that you observed her and Matt Gaetz having sex on an air hockey table? Now the person being asked about that denied that is something that he saw. But the lawyer also throws in that quote, the friend of the underage woman who brought her to the party testified that she too had sex with Gaetz at the same gathering. Now this is relevant to the ethics committee report because the ethics committee has talked to many of these same witnesses. They also have much of the evidence that was gathered in this civil litigation. So, it gives you a flavor of what they've gathered in their investigation. Of course, we know the Justice Department investigated the former congressman over these allegations of having sex than underage girl is whether obstruction of justice, and they opted not to charge, and he has consistently denied any wrongdoing.",

A lot of folks have talked about it leaking.Dana, I broken more stories than anyone on this ethics investigation over the last year. And I can tell you this committee, it doesn't leak things, which is why we're so focused in our reporting about what kinds of evidence the committee has collected. Because even if they do release this report or release a redacted version, it likely won't include all the evidence. So, it is a public service, not only to the American people, but also to the lawmakers who have to assess whether former congressman Gaetz should be the nation's next attorney general.",

Thank you so much, Paula, for that terrific reporting.Let's bring in my panel of reporters here, Astead Herndon of The New York Times, Vivian Salama of The Wall Street Journal, and CNN's Manu Raju. Hi everybody. I have a case of Mondays, obviously. Manu, let's just pick up where Paula left off because the ethics committee -- the whole point of the ethics committee is that they investigate sitting lawmakers, which I think it's pretty fair to say, the fact that Matt Gaetz quit as soon as he was nominated. You don't normally quit unless you're trying to avoid something. [12:05:00] So, I think the cause and effect are pretty clear.

In order for them to release this report, it would require a majority vote on this evenly divided committee, which means one Republican needs to break ranks.And you can already hear the pressure coming from people like Mike Johnson, the Speaker of the House, last week, saying that they should not release a report, a pretty unusual statement by the speaker to do just that, to lean on the ethics committee. Typically, speakers stay away from the ethics committee, given the fact that they are investigating such significant issues involving their own members. They don't look like they're tipping the scales one way or the other. Even Kevin McCarthy stayed away from the House Ethics Committee report. Even last week, Mike Johnson indicated, he was not going to get involved, and then ultimately did. Now he denied to Jake Tapper yesterday that he spoken to Trump directly on this. But you can tell -- you can be certain that Trump world does not want this information out there. So how do the Republicans ultimately respond to this. And Dana, Johnson is saying that this should not get out because of precedent, or would establish precedent, but there actually is precedent to release reports in the aftermath of members resigning. So, the question ultimately, though, is going to be on those members -- on the committee, do they change course, and they side with Democrats here?",

The point of it is revenge. And after the last four years of he's kind of been stewing about these government agencies, it is an intentional thumb of a nose at the kind of intelligence community, at the Department of Justice, and that's the reason why these pics are happening. I think it's going to be the first test of how much room we think congressional Republicans are putting -- willing to put between them and Donald Trump. And I also think it's an early test of how much the public is engaged in the second Trump administration in a different way. Are people -- are the folks in the constituents in the districts going to feel like Gaetz is a step too far, or did they sign up for a MAGA ideology second time around. And Donald Trump is going to have a lot of leeway based on the mandate of the results.

And he was saying at that time that he found no difference between Trump and Harris. And we would ask him why, like, what was the origin of his kind of break from Democrats? And it obviously goes back to kind of what he calls the elite capture of big pharma in 2020, and it all roots back this kind of antivaccine crusade. But I have to say, as I have traveled on the trail, I have been kind of surprised of how many make America healthy again, hats. I see about how much of his brand has actually really cut through to some of the Trump voter who, you know was making fun of Michelle Obama for bringing up some of this stuff, you know, back in that area. But that has now embraced this new message of breaking up big pharma or big food and things like that and focusing on chronic illnesses. That message, coupled with Trump's anti-establishment has really cut through to a portion of the electorate.
