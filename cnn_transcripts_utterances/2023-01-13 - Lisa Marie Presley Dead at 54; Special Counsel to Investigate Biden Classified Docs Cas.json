Her mother confirmed the death in a statement to CNN. The statement read in part, quote, \"The Presley family are shocked and devastated by the tragic death of their beloved Lisa Marie. They are profoundly grateful for the support, love and prayers of everyone, and ask for privacy during this very difficult time.\" Lisa Marie Presley had been hospitalized Thursday morning after suffering an apparent cardiac arrest. Presley was born in 1968 at the height of her father's fame. He died in 1977 when she was just 9 years old. She had a troubled childhood that led with her acting out and experimenting with drugs. It resulted in her mother sending her to a series of private schools. She told \"The L.A. Times,\" \"I never really fit into school. I didn't really have any direction.\" The sole heir to her father's fortune, Lisa Marie Presley lived a colorful life in the public eye, often leading to moments in the tabloids.",

Because a lot of people think cardiac arrest is a heart attack. They are two completely different entities.So a cardiac arrest is really a primary electrical problem with the heart, where the heart goes into an arrhythmia where it's not beating effectively or appropriately. And essentially, what happens is you're not able to pump blood -- the heart is kind of the pump for the blood -- out to the rest of the body: to the brain, to the other organs. And pretty quickly, within minutes, you can have death result if you're not treated with things like CPR or, potentially, defibrillation. And we talked about the other day, you know, 350,000 out-of-hospital cardiac deaths a year. That survival goes down by about 7 to 10 percent every minute that heartbeat is not restored. Three-quarters of them occur at home. But this really is, you know, it's another sad, you know, tragic event. And unfortunately, 50 percent of the time, the first manifestation of heart disease is sudden cardiac arrest. So people may not know they had risk factors.",

      "sentences": "And that's, unfortunately, how cardiac arrest and cardiac disease works sometimes. People can look completely fine until they have a heart attack, or a stroke, or a cardiac arrest.And really, you know, what we know about cardiac arrest is that 70 percent of it is really due to some underlying structural heart disease. Most of it's underlying structural heart disease. Most of the time it's coronary heart disease, which is blockages in the coronary arteries. But many times, it can be a problem with the heart muscle, where the heart muscle is scarred, or there's failure of the heart muscle. But sometimes, in about 10 percent of the cases, it can be a primary genetic electrical problem you may have been born with that you weren't even aware of. And then there's things like recreational drug use or certain medications that can trigger it. So there's a whole host of reasons why someone might have a cardiac arrest. But one thing is to look for the risk factors for cardiovascular disease and try to screen and treat those. The same risk factors for cardiac arrest are the same ones that we talk about for things like heart attack, so high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, exercise, smoking, all of that.",

And we are told that that made everything so much more hectic. And there were lower-level assistants, lower-level staff who were mostly involved in packing up his belongings.

But let's go to the Senate for a second. We did hear from the Senate Judiciary, the ranking member and the chair of that committee, Dick Durbin, of course, the chair as the Democrat. He said, \"Rather than acting as the president's personal lawyer like Bill Barr, Attorney General Garland's appointment of a special counsel assures the American people that this investigation will be done fairly and with integrity.\" And Lindsey Graham, the Republican from South Carolina, he said, quote, \"The bottom line is we need to fully understand what happened in both cases with Presidents Trump and Biden to make sure our system works in a way that protects our national security interests.\" But again, Don, the Senate is out and has been out for the last couple of weeks since they were sworn in. They'll be back a week from now. But in the House, they were in yesterday. And Kevin McCarthy, the House speaker, just had his first news conference.

Classified information needs to stay in secure spaces. So we'll wait to see the facts. But, you know, classified information needs to be in secure spaces. REP.
