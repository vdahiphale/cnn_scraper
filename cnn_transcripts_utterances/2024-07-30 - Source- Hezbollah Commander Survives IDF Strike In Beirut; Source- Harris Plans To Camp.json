A high level Hezbollah commander has reportedly survived an Israeli airstrike that was targeting him in Southern Beirut. This is all according to senior Lebanese government officials. Israel has confirmed that it was targeting Fouad Shukur. It says he was behind the deadly attack that killed 12 children in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. According to the state media in Lebanon, at least one woman has died, several more injured in the strike. It also says the attack was carried out by a drone. A drone that fired three missiles. The video shows rubble in the streets and smoke as you can see there, seen from the distance. Two sides of the story. We are reporting both of them from their respective capitals, or at least respective places. Jeremy Diamond is in Haifa in Israel. Ben Wedeman is in Beirut. Start with you Ben, to bring me up to date on exactly what happened and what the current situation is.",

Now, the now Ministry of Health is saying that at least one woman was killed more, than 60 people were injured in that strike. Now the Israelis are saying the target of that strike was Fouad Shukur otherwise known as Hajj Mohsin, a senior military commander in Hezbollah. Now, I spoke to a senior Lebanese official who told me that Shukur could had survived the strike, although we are seeing persistent claims coming from Israeli officials that they successfully assassinated this individual. So we are waiting for some sort of final word on this, we're expecting some kind of statement from Hezbollah shortly, but obviously, this is the -- this is sort of perhaps the opening shot of what was expected to be an Israeli response to the strike on the Israeli-occupied Syrian Golan heights where 12 children were killed on Saturday.",

And that message I'm told was to show that this attack on the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, which killed 12 children would not go unanswered. The Israeli government viewing that attack on Majdal Shams in the Golan Heights as crossing a red line in the words of the Israeli Defense minister. At the same time, I am also being told by a senior Israeli official that even as they take this very kinetic action near the Lebanese capital in the southern part of the Lebanese capital, they are also trying to send a message that they do not seek an all-out war between Israel and Hezbollah. One senior Israeli official telling me that whether or not there will be an all-out war will depend on Hezbollah's next actions. And so the Israeli military at this stage has not issued any new guidance to Israeli civilians. They say the home front command guidance for civilians remains unchanged, but there is no question that there is the possibility of escalation in the air tonight -- Richard.",

Let's just dissect this if we may, because it seems like there isn't the appetite as you were just hearing from both of them for further and increased military activity. So the risk here is something getting out of hand. Some rogues, some whatever, but the things sort of escalates inadvertently. LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING (RET), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, Richard, in your interview, you summed it up very precisely comparing it to the last strike between Iran and Israel and the attacks. There is always a process of action, which in this case was Hezbollah striking the Majdal Sham within the Golan Heights. Israel has now reacted by targeting the individual they believe, Fouad Shukur conducted and led those attacks, and he did it in such a way -- they did it in such a way as to send a message to not only Hezbollah, but also the government of Lebanon by striking very close to the capital city. Now, we are concerned about what happens with the counteraction, what comes next? Will Hezbollah do something more? Or will Iran pull Hezbollah's chain a little bit and pull them back from the brink? Will Israel strike more targets? That's still a possibility, but in this case, I see this particular strike, this very precise and sterile attack against one individual south of Lebanon as to being very proportional in nature. And I know most of your viewers might not agree with that, but it was a proportional strike based on the original strike that occurred in the Majdal Sham area a few days ago.",

She is going to be consulting on and advising these super PACs that are now working to get Kamala Harris elected president. Now, the president did release a statement that just came out from the White House and of course, that speaks volumes. It is not often that the president will actually formally comment on a personnel decision, it really goes to show you what a part and important part of the inner circle of advisers she has been for so many years. The president said, in part, \"I deeply the value her counsel and friendship, and I will continue to rely on our partnership and insights as we finish the job over the next six months.\" Now, the context here for her departure, of course, is that a couple of weeks ago, as we all remember, there was the CNN presidential debate where President Biden really shocked a lot of folks with his incredibly poor debate performance, and she was Anita Dunn, one of the advisers that ended up getting a good amount of blame. Now, a lot of folks on the other hand, would have argued that it is really only the principal that can be blamed, that is the president himself, but this is really significant given that this is the first major departure that we are seeing from the president's inner circle.",

Now, one week later, we see an ad from the Trump Campaign that doesn't feature President Biden at all, not by his likeness and not by his name. It is very interesting. And on top of that, you're seeing a shift in the messaging. We've gone from an economic and inflation message to now we are talking about immigration. I think they are seeing polling numbers that probably say that Independent voters are feeling a little bit better about Biden. His approval rating has probably gone up since he stepped down because of sympathy, and they think that right now isn't the right time to juxtapose the two in an ad, so they're changing course.

Truth be told, Democrats were kind of dealing with a little bit of clinical depression over the past few months. They have woken up, they're out of bed and they are out the door going to vote. So they really achieved that goal in the first ad. This new ad is looking forward, it is looking at drawing a direct contrast with her and former President Trump and looking forward to issues that they know are going to move the needle going forward.

The problem, of course, Richard, is that the war in Gaza continues to rage on, so quiet in the north is not likely to come anytime soon. And then we saw this horrific strike on Saturday that killed a dozen children, young people in Majdal Shams in the occupied Golan Heights, which Israel considers its territory. The international community considers to be Israeli occupied territory. These are Druze citizens who identify mainly as Syrian, but Israel took this as a strike on their territory. So we knew the response was coming. Richard, the question now is, is this the only response that we're going to see from Israel, particularly because their intended target appears to have survived this attempt. He was not only behind these -- that strike on Saturday, Israel says, but the United States has a $5 million bounty on his head for his role in part in the 1983 Marine barracks bombings that saw some 241 U.S. Marines killed.

Reports are proliferating right now that Fu'ad Shukr was indeed killed in this strike. And gathering from reports on the ground, Hezbollah is going to imminently make some form of public announcement about that. So if that is the case, there is absolutely no question Hezbollah will be responding and they will be responding in a far larger way than anything we've seen from them since October when this latest conflict first broke out. At that point, then we're all in that place where we just hope that that response isn't something that then triggers the Israelis to retaliate even greater and then we're in a spiral of uncontrollable escalation. This is the scenario we've all feared for the last nine months but it does appear to be at least beginning to play out in front of our eyes tonight.",
