And Republicans there are actually feeling bullish about it. We'll see.So it's because of what we talked about before, because of the feeling out there. It's also because of what Jeff was just reporting on. It's history. It's just the way things tend to be, which is the party in power, particularly the party in the White House, the president in the White House, tends to lose seats, sometimes a lot of seats in his first midterm. And so this is maybe gravity taking hold. We'll see. A lot of these Democrats could definitely come out on top, and that is why you're seeing President Obama in particular out there really trying to boost the turnout, because that is what matters now.

And one of his first orders of business, fire the CEO and two top executives. Joining us now, Donie O'Sullivan, who is of course a CNN correspondent, and Elizabeth Lopatto, she is a senior writer at \"The Verge\" and author of a newsletter all about Elon Musk called \"This Week in Elon.\" Elizabeth, let me start with you. How surprising is it that this deal was actually completed by Elon, because it was in the air for so long? ELIZABETH LOPATTO, SENIOR WRITER, \"THE VERGE\":  I think that's a really good question. I think one way or the other Elon Musk was going to wind up as the owner of Twitter. You may recall there was this lawsuit where Twitter tried to make sure that he would go through the bid after he tried to withdraw. He canceled the deal a couple of times, which didn't really have a formal legal meaning. And as we were coming close to his depositions, I think that's when negotiations got serious, and that's when it started to look like things were close.

Look, last night around the time that this news broke Musk was also sending a rocket into space from SpaceX. Look, while running Twitter might not be rocket science, he is going to find that it is a very difficult task ahead of him, right? We have seen other platforms -- Elon Musk is not the first person to say we want a pro free speech platform. We've seen that in the likes of Trump's True Social and other social media companies has well. And what all of those platforms have run into is the very real issue of, yes, you can be pro free speech, but there are limits on that when it comes to inciting hate and violence, and also harassment type rhetoric. So we're going to expect to see some of that type of moderation decision still happening on Twitter, perhaps some blowback on Musk, but most importantly, and of course most critically perhaps even to the midterm elections, is we might see Musk reversing the permanent bans of people like former president Donald Trump, even people like Alex Jones and Info Wars.

And then he went on to say that he wanted to make sure that a wide range of beliefs could be debated in a healthy manner.So I think he's acknowledged that there is at least some need for moderation.
