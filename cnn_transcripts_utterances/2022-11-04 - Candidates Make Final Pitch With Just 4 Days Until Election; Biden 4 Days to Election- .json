Control of the Senate and the House up for grabs as Republicans and Democrats are now vying for every vote. The candidates and their surrogates right now as we speak fanned out across the country. Right behind me, pictures of rallies in battleground states, Wisconsin, Georgia, Ohio and Pennsylvania. The Republican Pennsylvania Senate candidate Dr. Mehmet Oz is just wrapping up a rally, as you can see right there in your screen. He's neck and neck with his Democratic opponent John Fetterman. And the winner of that race in Pennsylvania could literally determine control of the entire U.S. Senate. So, as of tonight, let's just show you two maps. First, the Senate races in Georgia, Nevada, and Pennsylvania. All of these considered total toss-ups, anybody's game. Four others, Arizona, New Hampshire, Wisconsin and North Carolina tilt slightly, just ever so slightly in terms of one party or another. There is an incredible amount of uncertainty in these final hours of campaigning and there is no room for error for Democrats. You see this, one. That's how many seats Republicans need to pick up to win the majority, one seat. And President Biden who has been busy campaigning said he is optimistic, though, that Democrats will come out ahead in the House and the Senate. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

That's 34.6 million Americans have already voted. That is more than this time four years ago. I want to start in Wexford, Pennsylvania, where Jessica Dean is out front at the Oz rally.

      "sentences": "That's absolutely right, Erin. And that's why it is the most expensive Senate race in the country. That's why if you turn on the TV now, it's flooded with ads.And we're here at the Oz rally in Wexford that just let out, where he pitched himself to voters once again, really at this point, they're trying to make sure they're motivating their bases, both the Oz and the John Fetterman campaign, and also trying to get those independent voters. Now, look, polling has come out since the debate in the last couple of weeks shows this is an ever-tightening race. Both candidates looking for any edge they can possibly get here. For John Fetterman's campaign, it came in the last 24 hours with an endorsement from Oprah Winfrey. Now, typically, celebrity endorsements don't move the needle in huge ways. But in this case, it is certainly of interest because of Oprah Winfrey's connection to Mehmet Oz. Of course, she is the person who made him a household name. He appeared on her show many, many times. She backed his television show. So for him to endorse Fetterman and say that she would have already voted for him is significant and is something that people have been talking about. Will it actually sway any voters? That remains to be seen. We're going to have to wait until Tuesday to figure that out. Dr. Oz saying he respects Oprah but then pivoting back to this message about being not an extreme candidate, about bringing bipartisan to Washington, about being a moderate. And so I talked to people as they were looking into this rally just a little bit ago. I asked why they were here, why they support Dr. Oz, and it kind of range. But some people did tell us, because they see him as a moderate. One man told me that that was it, that was the reason he was here. Other people said it was because he was a doctor. They felt that he could really get a handle on the economy. Those are some of the things that were on people's minds. Others were here as solid Republican voters who were never going to vote for John Fetterman and are essentially the base. So we're going to see big surrogates coming to the commonwealth over the weekend. We're going to have former President Donald Trump coming tomorrow. We're also going to have former President Barack Obama and President Joe Biden all coming here to the commonwealth of Pennsylvania just days before Election Day.",

And, Jeff, that is the big question tonight, right, which is when will we actually know the results of this election? Because, in so many cases, because of all the ways that people are voting, early voting, day-of voting, absentee voting. The candidate who appears to be the leader on election night may not be the winner. How long could this take?",

      "sentences": "Erin, the honest answer is we don't know. That does not mean anything is wrong with the election. That does not mean anything has going to gone afoul. It is simply how Americans are voting has changed, how we vote in America is drastically different than it was a decade ago, and it changes cycle by cycle.And here's what I mean by that. Of course, almost 30 million people have already cast ballots. But those ballots, by and large, have not been counted. The counting varies state by state by state. If we take a look at some top battlegrounds here, you'll understand what I mean by why we may not know exactly. The mail ballot processing begins meaning they are opened and counted in different way in different states, in Pennsylvania, in Wisconsin, for example, top battlegrounds, those ballots cannot be opened until election day because of a state law. And in Michigan also a top battleground, there's been a new law. So in many counties they can begin processing these ballots two days before the election. But some cannot also be done until Election Day. So there is this huge amount of ballots coming in that election officials have to deal with on election day. So, yes, 35 million ballots, if we look at this state by state, some extraordinary numbers here in terms of how the early vote is coming in. Look at Georgia, for example. A prime battleground, 2.2 million votes. In Georgia actually, they can start counting ballots two weeks before. So that processing is already beginning. That's why we're likely to know the Georgia results, at least in part on election night. But look at Michigan, 1.2 million. Pennsylvania, a million votes already cast but not counted. So, on election night, we are going to see likely in many of these places Republicans, we know, like to vote on election day. That is their habit, that's what we saw in 2020. So, a Republican candidate may appear to be ahead. But the other votes may be coming in, in the overnight hours or the next day. And early votes count the exact same as election day votes. So that is why we don't know. We have to just sort of sit down, have a cup of coffee, have a soda, be patient on election night. You may not know for a couple days.",

Fascinating when you're talking about some states, you could count two days ahead in parts of the state but not in others.I mean, it is incredibly complex. Now, you mentioned Georgia. So the good news would be, hey, look, Georgia's going to give us an early result because they've been able to count the early votes two weeks early and then, boom, we're going to know Georgia. Except for we probably won't know Georgia.",

      "sentences": "Likely not and here's why. Georgia is one of the handful of states in the country largely in the south that does not have a runoff. If the candidate does not get 50 percent of the vote, it goes to a runoff, and a tight race between Raphael Warnock and Republican challenger Herschel Walker.There is also a libertarian candidate who is running. So, he is likely to get at least a sliver of the vote there that is going to complicate the effort of getting more than 50 percent. So, in Georgia, we're likely to know the result early, but it is likely to be a runoff, which means the runoff election is four weeks from election day on the 6th of December. And you'll remember back in 2020, the control of the U.S. Senate hinged upon Georgia. So if that's the case next week, if control of the Senate is hinging upon Georgia, which we don't know if it will be or not, that of course is going to send all this into overtime for four weeks. Certainly we should all take a collective deep breath, it does not mean anything is wrong with the votes if they're not accounted on election night, because how we're voting and how votes are counted have changed in America -- Erin.",

But they're not all right. I look at polls -- I'm a grassroots organizer. That's how I started in politics, and grassroots organizing is about people. Not all people talk to pollsters and not all pollsters talk to every person. And so, when I look at this -- I don't think anyone knows what's going to happen including the president. I think Democrats are going to do better than we expected a year ago. Do I know if we're going to hold both chambers? I'm not sure. But actually, you know who will know is the people, because on election night and on election day and even for weeks now, people have been able to go and cast their ballots. I think polls are about a fourth of the equation if you're looking at this as a whole pie. I think another fourth is the campaign that folks are running. I think another fourth is this unexpected thing. And then I think the final fourth is that grassroots people power that I believe that voter will show up and elect the right people.

I mean, it is -- it is a crucially important election.Now, Doug, in New York, people are -- crime is a driving issue. But our latest CNN poll shows the economy when you look across the country trumps everything else, the top issue by a mile, okay? Biden said in a statement today, one thing is clear, while comments by Republican leadership sure seem to indicate they are rooting for a recession, the U.S. economy continues to grow and add jobs even as gas prices continue to come on. He then -- come down, I'm sorry. And he says that inflation is his top economic challenge but he has a plan to fix it, which, of course, he does in detail and no president truly can have. But is this the biggest issue to most Americans, the biggest one? And yet earlier, this week primetime 20-minute address on democracy in America. That is what he did on the same day the Fed upped interest rates by another three-quarters of a percentage point. Are Democrats missing the mark on their closing message, Doug?

And so what Biden did the other night just a few blocks from here at union station was he told America, let me tell you what I think should be important to you. When voters are saying here is what's important to me, and it's inflation, number one, crime may be number two.
