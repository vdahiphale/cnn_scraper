And that number`s expected to nearly double by the year 2030, the U.N. says this is helping to perpetuate a worldwide plastic pollution crisis. The U.N. says that more than 90% of single use plastic is produced from fossil fuels or unrecycled material. Well, in South Africa, these urban surfers rise before dawn, ravaging through bins and household waste for recyclable materials and are actually helping the African country become one of the best recycling nations on earth. Our David McKenzie reports on how their work has an important environmental impact for our climate. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Tlamoke Mokoka and his cart are on the move. His job goes by many names here. Reclaimer. Hustler. Even Urban Surfer. It`s dangerous work in a dangerous city. There are thousands like Mokoka fanning out well before dawn. After an hour on the road, he`s in a neighborhood south of the city.",

There aren`t any jobs here, he says, so we`ve made our own work, making their own work with a scale and impact that`s hard to overstate. Just look at this sorting zone near Joburg where thousands live. It`s informal but hardly simple. Everything is carefully separated. Everything has value. (On camera): Towards the top of the pecking order are cans. Now, a bag of these will get reclaimers almost 40 U.S. dollars. As they say, one man`s trash is another man`s treasure. (Voice-over): I`m always surprised how rich people throw away so much rubbish, says Tlakatla Khang, but I`m happy they do. This collection took them weeks. I don`t know much about climate change, he says. Of course I`m glad we can help, but what matters is to survive. Today is payday and every bag is carefully weighed. There`s always trust amongst us, says middleman Motsama. Though he seems a little skeptical. I have to double check they didn`t put any water in the bottles to make them heavier, he says. It must just be the plastic bottles. What reclaimers don`t find end up in a nearby landfill. Even here, the desperate salvage what they can.
