It's Wednesday, November 29th, 5It's noon in Gaza, where the extended truce between Israel and Hamas is now in its sixth and possibly final day, as negotiators work toward the release of more hostages. We are learning that the ongoing talks in Doha between officials from Israel, the U.S., Qatar, and Egypt have been positive. A source telling CNN they are in agreement to extend the pause in fighting. More hostages are said to be freed in the hours to come. Sources say a list of names has been given to Israel, and families have been notified. Hamas released 12 hostages at the Rafah crossing on Tuesday. Ten Israelis and two Thai nationals. This comes as more crashes were reported in the West Bank between Palestinians and the IDF, and skirmishes in northern Gaza as well. In Gaza, the health system has all but collapsed. There is limited to no fuel, water, and medical supplies. The World Health Organization warns the death toll from disease will soar if infrastructure is not restored. CNN's Scott McLean joins us from Istanbul now with the latest. Scott, good morning to you, where do the talks in Doha stand, and what are the barriers to getting this truce extended?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, good morning, Kasie.Look, the barriers are probably not that big to get this extended for a short period of time, a longer extension though is much more complicated. According to a source familiar with the talks happening in Doha, the expectation is that if all goes according to plan, today, Hamas will likely agree to extend this truce for at least another day to get ten more women and children hostages out. But there are only enough women and children in captivity in Gaza to last another two days. Beyond that, we are talking about negotiations for civilian men, and Israeli soldiers, some of whom, by the way, are female. Hamas says that there have not been discussions thus far about Israeli troops, releasing Israeli troops held hostage right now. It is proposed the possibility of two deals, one, a partial deal, it is calling to focus just on civilians, or another one it is calling a comprehensive deal to also deal with those Israeli soldiers. But that would take Israel effectively emptying the jails of Palestinian prisoners, something that is not likely to have been at this stage. We are also hearing from a member of the Israeli Knesset, a former Israeli ambassador to the U.N. who says, the Israeli government has signed off until Monday to have these -- this pause extended. But beyond that, the government would have to meet again to agree to a new deal, or a tweet deal, and keep in mind as well, that the Israeli military has made abundantly clear it is gearing up for the second phase of this war. He was asked how long Israel is willing to hold back on its continued -- continuation of its military campaign. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Winter is coming, and it is getting really cold often, it leads to flooding and even more levels of displacement. That is why U.S. officials are talking to Israeli officials to allow-- find a way to allow a consistent flow of aid, but also commercial goods coming back, so that the markets have things for people to buy when they have a chance to do so. Otherwise, this aid coming in, even the 240 trucks that have been coming in over the past five days are simply not enough, Kasie.",

So that was a danger. Hopefully, they get that upright as quickly as possible. The winds have relaxed across the East Coast because the front responsible for the strong winds but also the lake effect snow has moved off shore. So, the winds are going to relax. But the damage has already been done. Not only with it Norway spruce, the Christmas tree falling over the national ellipse, but look at what it did here. This is the winds affect over the lake. Of course, we get this lake effect snow banding that occurs downwind of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. Some of these snowfall totals were very impressive. I want to show you Cleveland, Ohio, yesterday, check out the treacherous roadways heading into the city. No one wants to travel on that, nearly two feet of snow in some places across New York. Michigan also got in on some of that lake effect snow action as well. This high pressure, there is the departing cold, but it is that pressure, grading the squeeze that puts the wind over the Great Lakes and the Eastern Seaboard. Well, this is the remaining lake effect snow bands just south of Buffalo, just north of Syracuse, south of Watertown, and they become thinner and thinner as time goes on. The winds will change direction. The weather actually is going to improve greatly for much of the east coast. We have to get there at least one more day of cold air.
