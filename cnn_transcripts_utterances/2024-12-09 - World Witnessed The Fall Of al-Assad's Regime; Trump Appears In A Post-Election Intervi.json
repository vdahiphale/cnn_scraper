We've seen images of children going into these former residences, the palaces. And we've also seen images of people coming out carrying furniture. So certainly some of the looting has been happening within Assad's residence itself. But the celebration is the most immediate reaction that we are seeing. And it's not just in Syria, given the fact that millions of Syrians had to flee during the brutal crackdown after 2011. And they are in a number of different countries around the world.

There are about 1,000 American troops on the Iraqi-Syrian borders. So we know exactly, President Trump said, there is nothing in Syria, only death and dust.He really doesn't care about Syria, about the Middle East. Well, he doesn't really care about anyone except himself. But President Biden, obviously, he is very much concerned about the transitional period in Syria. He wants a diverse government. He wants an inclusive government. He wants to make sure that Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, led by Abu Mohammad al- Jolani, accepts a kind of an inclusive government, does not really establish an Islamic Emirate, similar to what happened in Afghanistan. And he is very much concerned about the resurgence of ISIS. Just in the past 24 hours, the United States carried out about 75 bombings of targets of ISIS. So there is the likelihood, the risks, that ISIS could use this particular transitional moment to basically go on the offensive. All in all, I think the most important point President Biden really made was that the United States will work with the United Nations in order to really help Syria transition to a new moment, a moment of hope. Remember, Margaret, American sanctions on Syria in the past few years have pauperized the Syrian people, have pauperized even the followers of Assad. 80 percent of the Syrian people require humanitarian aid. So lifting the American sanctions, working with the United Nations, could really help Syria and the Syrian people to overcome the vast and challenging economic conditions facing the Syrian people.",

But that leaves open the question of who's going to rule the country. And the lead rebel group that was behind this was known a number of years ago as al-Qaeda in Syria. They have since said that they've transformed themselves and they're no longer Sunni hardline al-Qaeda adherents, much more of nationalist tendencies.

When you ask me about the needs, yesterday we received here in Damascus many calls from some hospitals, from health facilities asking for urgent delivery of medication and emergency medical items.

And as long as security will not prevail, it will be very difficult for the population to go back to some kind of normalcy, let alone for the humanitarians to try to deliver on their mission. If we look at the north and the northeast of the country, there are still ongoing hostilities between different groups, and it will be difficult in such conditions for the people, for example, to go back home. A lot of people are willing to go back home or to move from one region to another, and it is not safe yet to do so. There is, of course, another problem, which is, as I said, the resumption of the public services. We need to ensure that public services, essential and critical infrastructures are not only spared but can function. So all this will require the different parties to the conflict to find some arrangements, to comply with their obligations under international humanitarian law, and to, of course, let humanitarian organization work, which is very difficult for the moment due to the uncertainties about both safety, but also pipelines, routes and possibilities to move goods and people around the country.",

And we're all, you know, this one giant community and you're able to spot one another across a room.
