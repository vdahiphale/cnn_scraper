I`d like to say that my 14-year-olds are better at information gathering than their parents and their grandparents might be. The media lessons allow them to take that skill and then add to it.

Media literacy has absolutely nothing to do with which side of the debate you`re on. And I often say to my students, I don`t care if you are conservative or you are liberally. It really doesn`t make a difference to me, whatever article you`re choosing, I want you to be able to look at it from a critical lens and really make my decision about whether or not this is a trustworthy article. How else can I say it besides threatened, take it down a notch for me? How do you state it factually? You can have an opinion on either side, but you should be able to validate that opinion with a fact-based article. Information literacy is going to give them those skills. So is the photograph that`s attached to that story? Flattering, neutral or unflattering? What does that say about this? Whether or not we should trust this article. You give them how to decide if something is credible, how to detect bias, how to determine if something is coming from a credible source. If you pair that with what they already do well, I think then you have the potential to really see change.",

We want to give our kids language to be able to speak to that, to say, hey, I was interested in that topic too. And I get some research and here are two other sites. I found that talk about that topic differently. That`s giving the person that you`re talking to the opportunity to reflect on what you said. Maybe read a little bit and not feel like you`re attacking them, which I think is really dangerous in this media environment. These are kids that are going to go out and do brilliant things. We need them to think about how they accept information in a smarter way, because I think that will change the way we all do. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Even the classic holiday song, \"12 Days of Christmas\" is not immune to it. In what has become an annual holiday tradition, PNC bank calculates the prices of all 12 gifts from the carol and releases what they calls the Christmas price index. It`s similar to the U.S. consumer price index, which measures the changing prices of goods and services that the average American consumer spends on, such as housing, food, clothing, and transportation, the 40th Annual Christmas price index showed an increase of 2.7%. But the good news, that`s much less than last year`s heavy, 10.5% increase. If you add up all 12 gifts that may get the latest Christmas price index report, the total cost increased nearly $47,000 this year. Although the partridge cost was unchanged, there was a 15% jump for the pear tree, a symbol for housing costs that continue to move higher even as mortgage rates are at their highest since 2000. The turtle doves are the most volatile gift price in the index this year, growing by 25%. The cost reflects their rarity. There were several gifts with no price increases from last year, including the four calling birds, five gold rings and seven swans a-swimming. If you`re looking to buy all gifts mentioned, a total of 364 items as the gifts are constantly repeated throughout the iconic song. Get ready to dish out nearly $202,000, 2.5% more than last year. It`s the first time that purchasing all the gifts cross the $200,000 threshold. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
