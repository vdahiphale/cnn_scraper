(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RYAN YOUNG, CNN U.S. CORRESPONDENT: Still a lot of strained feelings in this community. Of course, now there's news about the father of the alleged shooter being arrested. We spent the day outside the home talking to neighbors and trying to get some information. That's after investigators indicated to us that they believe the alleged shooter's father bought the weapon that was used here in a shooting as a holiday gift. Now, that's after Jackson County Sheriff's Department talked to the young man and tried to figure out if he was connected to some online threats. After that happened, the father indicated that there was no weapons that he had unsupervised access to. But that gun was purchased, apparently, and then that was the same gun that was brought here and used for such tragedy.",

The presiding judge in the case says he'll announce on Friday if he's willing to delay the former president's sentencing date. Trump was convicted earlier this year on 34 counts of falsifying business records stemming from hush money payments made to adult film star Stormy Daniels. He's set to be sentenced on September the 18th, but has asked the court to delay that decision until after Election Day. And new developments in the election subversion case against Trump could have an impact on the polls this November. The judge has set a schedule for next steps in the case. And that timetable may allow prosecutors to unveil new evidence about what happened on January 6th, just days before the November 5th election. Paula Reed has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: It's a total fraud. It was election interference. PAULA REID, CNN CHIEF LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Donald Trump's January 6th case back in D.C. federal court with a fiery and contentious hearing. Attorneys for the former president seeking an immediate dismissal to the case. We have an illegitimate prosecutor. We have an illegitimate indictment. And we have illegitimate legal issues raised in that indictment. Trump attorney John Lauro said. The judge, Tanya Chutkan, made it clear that was not going to happen. The Trump team sparred with her over a timeline for the case, calling it unfair to introduce evidence this close to the 2024 election. Chutkan responding: I understand there is an election impending. You have said before, and I will say again, that the electoral process and what needs to happen before the election does not matter here. And that she was definitely not getting dragged into the election. But there was one area of agreement. The judge must decide how a Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity affects this case before any trial. Immunity is the linchpin here, she said. A 6-3 decision in July gave former presidents immunity from prosecution for official acts, but not for private conduct. Attorney General Merrick Garland said this week he was confident in special counsel Jack Smith. MERRICK GARLAND, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: I stand by the actions of the special counsel. The superseding indictment is an effort to respond to the direct instructions of the Supreme Court as to how to effectuate a new indictment in an ongoing case. REID (voice-over): While the new reworked indictment removed things like Trump's infamous Rose Garden video.",

It tanks the entire indictment, Laura argued. They also intend to raise other issues like the legitimacy of the special counsel. Questions about obstruction of justice in January 6th and discovery. But one question that won't be answered anytime soon is when this case will go to trial. It is sort of an exercise in futility at this point to talk about setting a trial date.",

Because it did look like they were very close to reaching a deal. Back in July, when you had the U.S. proposal there, Hamas said it had agreed to it.

So the question is right now, where do we go from here? When you have the U.S. coming out with these statements, saying we have a deal pretty much, 90 percent agreement. Well, we've had 90 percent agreement for weeks now, if you really look at it. It's those sticking issues that continue to hold up a deal. And again, as I've been hearing from officials in the region, they believe that to get to a deal, the U.S. must use its leverage and must pressure the Israeli Prime Minister to agree to a deal because you've got Qatar, you've got Egypt, who are and will exert whatever pressure they have on Hamas to agree to a deal. But you've got both sides accusing the other of holding up the deal. And then you've got critics of the Israeli Prime Minister saying he has absolutely no intention of ending this war.

And we have to remember, Max, the longer this goes on, this is not just about politics and diplomacy and the positions of the different parties here. Lives here are at stake, whether it is the Israeli hostages, as we saw on Saturday with the devastating developments there with the six hostages executed by Hamas, and the civilians in Gaza.

We don't know the cause of the fire. It's still under investigation. But we know, according to the police, that 17 boys were killed in this fire, 14 are receiving treatment. Some of those were burned beyond recognition, according to authorities. It's a real tragedy. Parents have now gathered at the school to see if their boys were among those who were killed in this or among the injured. And they're just shocked, shell-shocked, standing there silently waiting for more information. The police have cordoned off this area as they continue this investigation. The disaster management unit from the homicide unit as well as other specialized units of the Kenya police are on the scene there. But this brings back the tragedy of school fires in Kenya, Max. This is not the first one. In fact, after a string of school fires going back a couple of years, the minister of education came up with guidelines, fire safety guidelines for schools about there should be at least two doors on each end of a dormitory and another door in the middle, clearly marked emergency exit. There should be space between the beds, about 1.2 meters. There should not be any grails on the windows, so they can be easily opened. They've covered issues like crowding because of so many other school fires. Unfortunately, in many cases, these are not followed. We're not saying this is what happened in this instance. We still don't know. It's all speculative. The investigation will reveal that. But for so many parents who are going through this tragedy right now, who are learning that their elementary school kids might have been killed in this, it's the worst day of their lives, and they will obviously have questions about, could this have been avoided? And how do you make sure that this does not happen again, Max, for other parents, for other kids in school who go there hoping to get an education and sometimes they don't make it out alive?",
