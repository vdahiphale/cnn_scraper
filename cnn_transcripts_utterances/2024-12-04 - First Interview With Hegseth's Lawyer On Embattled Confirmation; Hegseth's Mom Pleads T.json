      "sentences": "Welcome to The Lead. I'm Jake Tapper. This hour, the plane returning a stowaway to the United States is just minutes away from landing in New York. CNN's on board the plane as French security agents escort this Russian woman who somehow snuck past multiple airport checkpoints last week.Plus, a fast moving winter storm bearing down on parts of the Midwest and tonight moving toward the east coast with intense bursts of snow and strong winds that can create whiteout conditions. The CNN weather team is tracking the forecast. We'll bring that to you. And we are shattered, the heartbreaking statement from the family of the United Healthcare CEO who was shot and killed outside of a New York City hotel this morning. Police say it was a, quote, brazen targeted attack and the suspect remains on the run. But leading this hour, with his nomination in jeopardy, Trump's pick for secretary of Defense is back on Capitol Hill today, meeting with the Republicans who will decide whether or not he gets confirmed. Pete Hegseth telling reporters today he's going to, quote, \"Fight like hell.\" And that the president-elect is still 100 percent behind him. Sources say behind the scenes, however, Trump is actually considering possible plan B. In moments, I'm going to be joined live by Pete Hegseth's attorney. And later this hour, we're going to speak to a Republican senator who met with Hegseth earlier this week. But we're going to start with CNN Anchor Kaitlan Collins down in West Palm Beach, Florida. Kaitlan, what are you hearing from inside the Trump world about the state of the Hegseth nomination? KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN ANCHOR, \"THE SOURSE\": Well, Jake, they're watching very closely to see what's happening on Capitol Hill with those critical Republican senators that are ultimately going to be the ones who decide Pete Hegseth fate here and what happens here from the Mar-a-Lago perspective. And they're watching meetings. One of the biggest ones that they were watching today, based on what I heard, was the one with Senator Joni Ernst because of course, she is a female combat veteran, the first elected ever to Congress who has also been very outspoken about sexual assault. And so they wanted to see what was she saying coming out of that meeting. And you saw she was relatively quiet. She said that they had a thorough and substantive conversation. Trump world down here is kind of reading the tea leaves on what that looks like and what that means because they know just how critical having her be it yes on a Pete Hegseth nomination would be. And so, Jake, one other thing they're also doing is watching the president-elect himself very closely and how he's handling this. And you heard Hegseth saying that he had that conversation with Trump, that Trump had voiced his affirmation behind him, that he was standing with him as his pick to run the Pentagon. And I think that's certainly, you know, something very much that Trump is doing until he isn't. That is what everyone around the former president and the president- elect knows very well. And so they've been watching that very closely to see how all of this is handled today and what all of this looks like. And Pete Hegseth going out and doing media interviews, his mom going out and doing an interview this morning are all part of the effort from people down here to try to maintain this nomination and to convince those skeptical senators either not to oppose Pete Hegseth or to at least keep an open mind behind him. But Jake, one other thing that is happening is they're talking about other names if they do pull Pete Hegseth that could be tapped to run the Pentagon. And so that is something I've heard from a few people who know Trump well say could be potentially a worrying sign for Pete Hegseth. Trump is already discussing who he could potentially replace him with, including a conversation he had with the Florida governor, someone who not that long ago was a pretty fierce critic of Donald Trump's when they were both running for the Republican nomination. That is something that Trump has also had a conversation about this job with. Now, whether that means Ron DeSantis would ultimately be the backup, I think still would be an open question as what that process looks like. But it is certainly something that they are watching closely here. And a lot of people I've spoken with don't have a ton of confidence in Pete Hegseth's nomination and are just watching it, kind of seeing how the developments happen, Jake, by the hour, really.",

He's arguing that his client still has Trump's attention, still has the commitment to have him committed. What's the word? To have him confirmed, rather as secretary of Defense. MARC CAPUTO, AUTHOR, THE BULWARK'S \"MAGAVILLE\" NEWSLETTER: Well, I guess D.C. is sometimes a lunatic asylum. So it can be the same word that can be used in both contexts. But the reality is that it really only matters what the 53 Republican senators think at this point. Trump is going to stand by his nominee as long as his nominee can stand up and get the votes. That was the lesson of Matt Gaetz. That's going to be the lesson of Pete Hegseth. And that's going to be the lesson the others. Now, at a certain point, Donald Trump is going to decide to really start to fight and really start to bend arms, twist arms and perhaps break them. The question we have here is not only can Hegseth the votes, but if he falls short, to what degree is Donald Trump going to spend political capital? And we don't think, at least right now, that he's willing to spend a lot. That's why he's on the phone talking to Ron DeSantis about whether he wants the job. It is pretty surprising. It kind of shocked me yesterday morning when I heard it. But that doesn't mean DeSantis is going to get the job. What it means is that Donald Trump has doubts about whether Hegseth can actually get the votes.",

So if they really want to get to the truth, they should let her out of her NDA.That's point number one. Now onto the mom interview. Look, it was a softball interview that was strictly appealing to the female GOP senators, as she said. And it was a mom encounter, too, because it was mom to mom. And if mom says that her child is OK, then maybe other moms will feel the same way. I don't know. I'm seeing that there's a lot of hesitation from these female GOP senators. It'll be really enlightening to see what Joni Ernst actually says. I actually think she would make a better defense secretary than Pete. But you also have Shelley Moore Capito. And you have Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski. You have now Cynthia Lummis changing her mind on this. And yesterday you had Senator Lindsey Graham, who had concerns about this as well.

Of course the investigation is still underway.Now back to that picture, if we can bring that up to show our viewers. This is another picture that police put out on their X account, again hoping the public can bring in some tips. We're told that from sources that this picture was taken prior to the shooting at a Starbucks, really just a few blocks from where we are. And then of course, we have seen from sources that we obtained that chilling video of this shooting taking place here at the Hilton in Midtown Manhattan this morning, where police believe this gunman waited for about five minutes prior to Brian Thompson leaving a hotel he was staying in across the street, heading to this hotel, the Hilton in Midtown, for an investors conference. And we see in that chilling video how the gunman walks up behind him and fires his gun, hitting him. And then we're told by sources that the gun jammed and he fires again once he loosens that jam. And then that video also shows us, Jake, that he just calmly walks away from the scene. Really doesn't even run very fast at all. We're told from sources he got away by escaping through a back alley onto an electric bike. And then where police at least to our knowledge, lost him was in Central Park. And that is where they last saw him on that bike. So, a lot of investigations still going on right now. We're told that they recovered a cell phone. They're trying to use forensics to see if it tracks back to a person that helps them. Also, they uncovered shell casings here at the scene. And of course, those images are being circulated.

That's not because police were on his trail, it's because, you know, you do that video canvas where you check all of the cameras, police cameras, city cameras, traffic cameras, private cameras, and, you know, the last place they see him is going into Central park riding that bicycle he used in his getaway. So, now they're working on the east side and west side of Manhattan doing canvases for video outside the park to see where do they have him exiting the park. And then they literally continue that canvas.So they try to get an end to end trip and figure out where does that resolve. Does he take down the hood? Does he take off that backpack and get into the change of clothes? So that's in the hunt for him, based on the video. Then there's what was left behind, of course, which is you've got three shell casings from the shots he fired. But the gun jams three times. And on the video you see him calmly clear the jam, which ejects a live bullet onto the street. So they have three live bullets as well where they can check for fingerprints and DNA. But more critically, as Brynn showed us, there's that picture in the Starbucks. He's there buying a bottle of water and two power bars. A bottle of water and a phone is found in that alleyway between the street where the shooting was and the next block where he hops on the bike. That bottle of water could offer DNA, could offer fingerprints. And as Brynn suggested, if they crack into that phone with NYPD's technicians, it may offer an awful lot more, including communications with people before the incident or even the identity of the owner of that phone if it's not a burner.",

Joining us now is Republican Senator Rick Scott. He's a Navy veteran who serves on the Senate Armed Services Committee as well as representing great state of Florida.

Number two, this is his nominee. All right, we know we have to make changes. Number three, Pete is a great candidate. Here's some -- I respect people that put on the uniform and led troops at war. He went to Iraq. He went to Afghanistan. He knows people that died. He knows people that were injured. He got out. He's fought for veterans since he got out. These are anonymous accusations.

Even as CNN's Clarissa Ward reports, many blame the United States for the destruction.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CLARISSA WARD, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): From the balcony of his apartment, a man gazes out at his city, Tyre, once renowned for its glittering waters and ancient ruins, now in ruins itself. Mousassad (ph) has lived through many wars in Lebanon, but none like this. Twenty years we have been here in Tyre, he tells us. An Israeli strike pulverized the next door building where his neighbors once lived. Their clothes still hang ghost like in the closet. Imagine a person was sleeping here, the building collapsed on them. Everyone died. A woman and her children, all of them dead. Why? For what? He says. America did this to us, not Israel. It's America that goes like this, like she didn't see anything and she didn't want to know anything. Lebanon is a country where loyalties are divided, but bitterness towards the west for its support of Israel is everywhere. In villages around Tyre, Hezbollah flags fly proudly. No community has been spared. The Melkite Greek Catholic Church had been a refuge for displaced people when it was hit by an Israeli missile on October 9th. Eight people were killed. Eighty-one-year-old church caretaker, Milad Ilya (ph), has prayed here as long as he can remember. This is my house, he says. Next to the church, a mosque connected by a shared hall for events. If our homes were hit and the church stayed, it would better, he tells us, if the church is gone. There is no coexistence between people here. Tyre is one of the world's oldest inhabited cities, mentioned several times in the Bible. As the light falls, Kemal Istanbully (ph) does what fishermen have been doing here for thousands of years. For 60 days during the war, Israel's military barred boats from going out on the water. Of course, it was tough, he says. We fishermen must work every day to feed our families. What's your dream for the future? We don't have a future here, he tells me. With Israel as your neighbor occupying your land, there's no future for you. There's just war after war, destruction after destruction, and the country collapses and collapses, a bleak outlook shared by many in this historic city even as a shaky ceasefire continues to hold. Clarissa Ward, CNN, Tyre. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
