      "sentences": "A very warm welcome to the show, everyone, I'm Lynda Kinkade in for Isa Soares. Tonight, Kamala Harrispresents a first economic proposal as the presumptive Democratic nominee. We'll have a preview of the plan she hopes will make life more affordable for Americans and help secure the White House. Thus, is the ceasefire talks finished for now in Doha? We're going to have a look at what was accomplished amid a threat of a wider regional war. And adding fuel to the fire, Israeli settlers go on a rampage at a West Bank village, drawing harsh rebukes from top officials in both Israel and Washington. Well, Vice President Harris is scheduled to roll out her economic plan in North Carolina this hour. Is another big step for a presidential campaign that's still just a few weeks old. Harris' plan is expected to target high grocery prices with a proposal to ban price gouging. Campaign officials say it also includes her ideas for lowering housing costs, tax cuts for more than 100 million Americans, and a new child tax credit for middle-class and lower income families. Well, let's go straight to Kayla Tausche, who joins us from outside the White House, good to have you with us, Kayla. So, polls indicate that economic issues are going to be dominating this election in November, what are we expecting when Kamala Harris speaks this hour, particularly with regards to tax breaks for middle-income and low- income families.",

      "sentences": "Well, economic issues have been top of mind for voters, but it's not just that, it's also thecost of living. That's why it's no coincidence, Lynda, that Vice President Harris, when she delivers today's speech, that this first platform on economic issues, specifically attempts to target the cost of living, the cost of housing, and the cost of childcare, which have risen dramatically in the last several years. Among the policies that she is announcing today are plans like you mentioned, to have a federal ban on price gouging. A $25,000 credit for first-time homebuyers as well as plans to build up to 3 million new housing units by spurring new construction. And the reason why she's delivering this announcement in Raleigh, North Carolina, is because in that city, there are plans funded by the American rescue plan from earlier in the Biden-Harris administration that have already been underway to do just that. She is also calling for an expansion of the child tax credit to up to $3,600 per child, and up to $6,000 for a baby's first year of life. Now, this is an area where her policy has converged with that of the Republican ticket, where the Vice Presidential nominee for Republicans has argued that, that needs to be up to $5,000. And they have also argued for more affordable housing and some federal lands freed up to build more housing. Just showing how both sides of the aisle are trying to target the same set of issues because they're so acutely aware of how important they are to Americans and to voters. We expect Vice President Harris to take the stage momentarily, and to talk about her plans to try to lower those costs and try to draw contrast with Republicans who she says are just trying to help corporations and themselves.

But now, I want to turn to the Middle East, and new details areemerging from the second day of high stakes negotiations in Qatar over a Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal. Senior officials from the U.S. Qatar and Egypt presented a bridging proposal today. Israel says it welcomes the efforts, but so far has not explicitly endorsed the latest offer. The mediators are expected to meet again in Cairo next week, and over the phone, Qatar's Prime Minister spoke with Iran's acting Foreign Minister about the latest ceasefire efforts that comes as Iran mows its next move. Tehran and its proxies have vowed to retaliate against Israel for the high profile killings of senior Hamas and Hezbollah officials. And Israel says it expects the U.K. and France to join the U.S. in striking Iran if Israel is attached. Well, meanwhile, in the West Bank, Palestinian villages come under assault by heavily-armed Israeli settlers. These images coming in from the town of Jit. Palestinian officials there saying a 23-year-old man was killed. Top Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are condemning that violence. Our team is tracking these high-stakes talks from all angles. Jeremy Diamond is standing by for us in Haifa, Israel. But first, I want to go to our Jomana Karadsheh who joins us in Doha. So, talks have wrapped. Just take us through what we know about the progress and what sort of sticking points are at this point in time?",

      "sentences": "Well, we don't have a sense yet of whether Israel is in agreement with the bridging proposal that was put onthe table today. What we do know though, is that the Israeli Prime Minister's office put out a statement saying that they quote, \"appreciate the mediators' efforts in this matter.\" They are framing it as the mediators efforts to convince Hamas to accept a ceasefire deal, effectively saying that they believe Hamas needs to be dissuaded from its refusal to agree to a ceasefire deal. We should note that Hamas hasn't actually refused to this proposal that is on the table. And Israel hasn't either at this stage, both parties seem to be interested in trying to reach a deal. But the question is, which deal is it that they are talking about? Hamas has said that they don't want to engage in further rounds of negotiations. They want to see a deal based on the framework that was agreed to on July 2nd, that was before the Israeli Prime Minister made a series of demands, including related to Israeli control of the Gaza-Egypt border, as well as preventing armed men from going from southern Gaza to northern Gaza. And so, for now, it seems like both Israel and Hamas, which also hasn't released a statement, saying that they support or are against this current bridging proposal, both of them are at least listening to the mediators, are engaged in these negotiations and will let this process play out over the coming days in terms of the technical teams that will work to try and kind of cement this bridging proposal that is on the table with negotiations set to resume once again sometime later next week. But I think one critical angle as we have been watching what the impact of these ceasefire negotiations will be on those regional tensions, the Qatari Prime Minister who has been intimately involved in these negotiations, he has now spoken with the Iranian Foreign Minister twice over the course of the last two days to update him on those negotiations, and to make clear to him that it would be in the interest of finalizing a deal that Iran not launch any kind of major escalation in the region. And so far, Lynda, it appears that Iran is heeding that message.",

CNN was accompanied by the Ukrainian military who reviewed the video without sound prior to the release for operational security reasons. Yet, they have no editorial control. Take a look.

This Ukrainian assault so persistent, and Russia, despite its sense of history, it's sort of passed has being some impregnable, completely unable to push the Ukrainians out here.

Let's welcome anchor of CNN's \"FIRST MOVE\" Julia Chatterley to join us right now. Good to see you, Julia. So, we know that Kamala Harris is going to promise tax relief for over 100 million Americans. Talk to us about her proposal to lift the middle-class and low-income families up.",

      "sentences": "So, there's going to be a few things, and I'll just give you the top level and then I'll break them down veryquickly. To your point, that tax relief I think is incredibly important. And if you're a parent in the United States, now is the time to listen up. The hope is that they can boost or raise the level of child tax credits from the current 2,000 level to 3,600. There's also the hope that they can add an additional tax credit for the first year of a child's life for low and middle-income families, that's the $6,000 that you can see in front of you. Expand the earned income tax credit, another angle here, and we've also heard a talk about removing tax on tips that obviously got blowback from the Trump administration, no detail on how she pays for all of this. If you're a high income earner or a corporate in the United States, perhaps you need to be a little nervous at this point. The other thing that she's talked about tackling also a huge issue, changing the narrative on food price inflation, and how she's going to tackle corporate gouging, price gouging, which is basically when companies collude to keep prices high or they try and take advantage of rising prices. Right now, what we have is the FTC, the Federal Trade Commission that can investigate whether that's going on. It can prevent mergers of big companies like in the meat industry or grocers if it thinks that, that will end up in consumers paying higher prices. You can walk into a grocer and say, hey, egg prices or something like that are too high and you need to lower them. So, we have to see what the details of this is, how she envisages it working. There's a lot of debate over ultimately whether or not this will create more distortions rather than actually bringing food prices down, which of course, is what everybody wants, likely to fly well with voters though, because it is a plan of action even if the outcome is debatable. And then the other thing is housing. Of course, how to make housing more affordable. We know we have a shortage of houses. She's going to talk about building 3 million more houses, providing incentives for home-builders to do more. And then perhaps, incentives like a $25,000 sum for first-time homebuyers to get them on the property ladder. Again, how do you pay for all of this? One of the big challenges, of course, is that mortgage rates are so high at this stage that people are struggling if they're already in a mortgage and the padlocked in at lower rate, they don't want to move until rates come down. Home-builders of course, would have to probably borrow money in order to build more homes. They will also want to wait for interest rates to come down. So, there's a lot of stickiness, but it does cut to one of the central problems of the affordability crisis and the housing crisis in the United States, which is we simply don't have enough homes. And this is one way to tackle it. Again, the execution and how you pay for this plan will be critical in how it improves the situation or doesn't.",

So, I think she can keep the good bits and she tries to distance herself from the worse parts. We know that Biden has been blamed for high inflation. We can have a debate over what contributed to that over the past three years. And in some part, it was the Act that was signed, the $1.9 trillion at the beginning of their administration that I think everybody agrees field inflation to some degree. But I think changing the narrative and trying to talk about corporate greed and that being part of what's lifted food prices in particular is perhaps smart if inaccurate, overall way of trying to address the challenges.",

And then also, as somebody who's wrote many of these speeches, it was really ironic to hear her keep talking about the Trump tax. Trump wants to put these tariffs on things that would directly make people's milk and breads higher. What you saw today is saying, I understand your pain, I grew up in a middle-class household. We couldn't afford to buy a house till I was a teenager. I know what it's like to feel the pain that you're feeling. Trust me and we can do this together. It was a really good speech.

He had an event yesterday at his golf course in Bedminster. He had a lot of items from a supermarket that he had out and he talked about how prices have gone up. But most of what he did in that speech or it was a press conference technically or the speech that he gave the day before in North Carolina himself was talking about how essentially if he is elected, he thinks things will get better. He's also warned that there will be a depression if he doesn't get elected. There is no evidence for that. In fact, there is a lot of evidence against it.
