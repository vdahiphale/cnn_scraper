And that's big for terrorists and active shooters, but it also brings in diverse groups who may not like each other. And so, you also have the possibility that this was potentially gang-related, something in that kind of vein. And we won't know until we know more about the suspects that they have.",

This is supposed to be a celebratory event.So whether it is churches or schools, today is the anniversary of the Parkland shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. This seems like just to add it to the list of these soft targets and these places where these things are really not supposed to be mixing.

You could go right to the gate, you could walk on airplanes, sometimes without being challenged.Everything in society moves and changes. Now you can't get past the lobby of an airport without an extensive search. You find now like in this shooting at the Church of Joel Osteen, you saw that the shooter was engaged by two congregants. That is because every organization you see like this, you see the massive amount of security in this situation. But even churches, large churches are starting to have armed security people. It is a different day. And we need to start realizing that until we solve this societal issue, that we need to protect large groups of people, because those are targets for people with horrible minds.",

This is at Union Station. This was near the end of the rally itself. Law enforcement officers reportedly taking two people into their custody. We don't know the details yet of exactly what transpired. But as we learn the new information, we will, of course, bring it to you. KEILAR: Yes. And so this had been, of course, the parade that had ended near Union Station in this rally that had gone on for some time and this was wrapping up when this all had happened. Of course, there was a huge police presence there. But what was really a celebratory mood, people just very excited for this big win for the Kansas City Chiefs. And instead, they find themselves in many cases here running for their lives. We just heard people are trying to reconvene with their family members who they may have lost track of in the chaos at this point in time.",

They're saying that at the conclusion of the rally, there were shots fired west of Union Station.As we indicated earlier, police had said that multiple people were struck. Now we're hearing from the fire department that upwards of 10 people have been injured. Unclear right now what -- we're talking about gunshot wounds, obviously, in a large crowd with people fleeing. There can also be injury sustained in the process of trying to get away from the sound of gunfire. But at least according to the fire department right now, 10 people have been injured. Police say that they have taken two people into custody. Two armed individuals. No information that they're releasing right now and who those individuals are, whether this was a targeted type of attack, or whether this was gunfire that was exchanged perhaps between two parties. We know this was taking place at least according to authorities near a garage next to this large celebration. Authorities are now asking for anyone who was in that area and witness events to contact law enforcement that tells us that they're still trying to piece all of this together. Again, that notice just going out a short time ago from Kansas City Police asking anyone who was in around that area to please contact law enforcement, help describe what it is that you saw, what it is that you heard, as they try to, again, figure out what they're grappling with here. And if -- we don't know the state of these two individuals, if they are indeed being interviewed, if they're providing information, how they were actually apprehended. Frankly, whether there was any type of force, you know, used by law enforcement and taking them into custody. So a lot of unanswered questions right now. We do know that this large event came with a large security package to begin with. We've seen on our images here from our affiliate KNBC that law enforcement was on hand with departments from across the region. It was a state highway patrol, obviously, local police, different police agencies from around that area who were already on side providing security for that event. And so, again, if there's any good news in a bad situation is that you had this large law enforcement posture that could quickly sprang into action to try to apprehend the people who perhaps were responsible for this and then try to help victims as well. But, again, finally, you know, we're learning 10 people injured now, two people in custody, trying to determine the motive. Authorities are providing information in real time. We hope to get more soon.",

It's worth pointing that out anytime that we see some type of potential mass shooting, as a potential, you know, at least a targeted mass shooting, because the motive is always the question. And as you mentioned, right now, we have no indication that this celebratory event itself was a target by two individuals, or whether this was a shooting that happened, you know, adjacent to this event, and you had a crowd that was struck that was, you know, they're nearby.So that's important to point out. We're not -- you're calling this a targeted mass shooting. Authority certainly are not calling that right now. But they do have a lot of work to do. Much of that comes down to what the current state is of these two individuals who have been taken into custody. We've seen in various incidents where oftentimes suspects will gladly, you know, describe what it is that they were doing, why they were there, provide that information to police. Sometimes, you know, they will lawyer up making it much more difficult, but a lot of work going on behind the scenes right now to try to get to that motive, Bri.",

But, you know what, I'm Joaquin's dad. I'm a father. So when you're a father, frustration is not -- it's not an option. I got to keep on doing things that a dad will do and that's exactly what I'm doing.

And we play the audios, different audios because we have six audios. And the reaction from the staffers were like -- they were trying to control their expression. And that's what I wanted to see. And that's my hope because, you know, those staffers are the ones who get the phone calls. So when you're receiving this kind of voice message, you're expecting to get that message.
