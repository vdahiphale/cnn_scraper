Russia, according to U.S. officials andaccording to what the U.S. sees, it is simply looking for more ammunition, artillery ammunition as well as other types of ammunition, such as anti tank ammo. That will be especially crucial for Russian forces, given that Western tanks have started to arrive in the battlefield and U.S. tanks are expected to arrive within the next couple of months. So Russia is just looking for ammunition. We have seen North Korea do something very similar before. Several months ago it was North Korea that gave Wagner artillery ammunition. That after the now deceased former leader of Wagner Yevgeny Prigozhin said his forces did not have enough. So they came in agreement with Pyongyang, to supply their forces. Now instead it's Russian president Vladimir Putin looking for artillery ammo for his own forces. As this has become a battle of attrition there on front lines that move only a little bit, that artillery ammo is crucial for the fight. Russia needs more and it's looking to North Korea to provide it.",

So they are looking for help in that department, according to U.S. officials, and they are also looking for help trying to advance their nuclear submarine program. North Korea currently does not have nuclear submarines. But it's certainly on their wish list of technology they are looking for. So they are looking for Russia to try to advance their understanding and their work in that field. We have seen this relationship slowly -- or perhaps rather quickly -- move forward, from Russian defense minister Sergei Shoigu's visit to Pyongyang in July. Then according to U.S. officials, there was another visit by a Russian delegation and now it's gotten to the level where the leaders could meet in Russia though the U.S. is not clear on what exactly or where even that meeting could happen. But it's a sign of how these two are moving their relationship forward in ways that will certainly would or could affect their battlefield in Ukraine and improve or advance North Korea's military and its capabilities, Becky.",

There have been reports in the last several days of Cuban citizens who were essentially tricked, told they were going to be some sort of other kind of work involved in the war but not on the front lines. When they got to Russia, they were given a rifle and told to report to the front. So this is an interesting development because Russia has been promising lots of economic aid to Cuba since the war began. It seemed to be bringing these countries closer together.

But now that there are allegations that people have been tricked, we are talking about very young men who do not appear to have very much military training and yet they find themselves on the front line of a very real war. The question becomes, what happens to those Cuban recruits? Are they allowed to come back to Cuba? Are there any arrests that have taken place? Not surprisingly it's not clear at all but it will be interesting to see how this impacts what appeared to be an improving Cuban-Russian relationship. And even though the Cuban statement is not mentioning the Russian government by name, certainly this cannot be going over well in Moscow, where they have been pouring millions of dollars in economic aid to Cuba.

As far as surveillance, we are not seeing surveillance at the level that we did in the early days of COVID-19. But there are still some programs, like there is wastewater surveillance that is happening to really track what kind of variants are circulating and which one is the dominant variant at this time. There are some programs that are taking wastewater from airplanes and testing those as a part of surveillance efforts. What we do know, there have been some small rises in reported cases. But we are nowhere near a major surge right now. As you mentioned, we are hearing of some prominent figures like here in the United States, first lady Jill Biden tested positive for COVID-19. And when you do test positive, the rules are still the same, to isolate for at least five days. And by day six, you can end isolation and symptoms improve between day 6 and 10, wear a mask unless you have two negative tests 48 hours apart. Thankfully, with preliminary lab tests here in the United States, some of the variants that we are tracking -- this is not a dominant variant but BA.2.86 was one that scientists were concerned about because it is highly mutated. But thankfully lab tests here that are preliminary have found that this one may be less contagious than scientists fear. And we do suspect that the updated COVID-19 vaccines releasing this fall will still offer some protection against that variant and others that are circulating. So that is good news for now, Becky.",
