But the chief of military intelligence in Ukraine is predicting an end to the war by next summer saying, quote, \"Russia's loss is inevitable.\" His comments coming as Ukrainian intelligence believes Russia's supply of many missile types are now critically low. Still, Russia reports more high precision strikes as the country's top commander says Russia's goal is a friendly Ukraine independent of the west. Whatever Russia's aim, its ruthless airstrikes are having a devastating impact on Ukraine's energy infrastructure. The Ukrainian president says 30 percent of the country's power stations have been destroyed in the past nine days, and that's causing massive blackouts across the country. Two central Ukrainian cities say they just lost power due to overnight shelling.

It perhaps signals something else other than a defense of the city. It perhaps does signal that they're pulling out. He said that they're pulling out the civilians from that city. Now, there is no other place here that it seems where Russia in -- where the offensive and the war has been going on has cared too much about what is happening to the civilians around them. Ukrainian civilians. And there is a potential here while the civilians are pulled out, a potential for the military to retrench its position around Kherson.

Many thanks.Well, in the coming hours, Britain's Liz Truss will face tough questions during the weekly prime minister's questions. That's -- if she shows up to Parliament, of course. She was notably late on Monday and deputized the House of Commons leader to speak on her behalf. The prime minister is also under fire from fellow conservatives. Her credibility took a big hit after the finance minister tossed out her mini budget, and now we've just received a report that inflation in the U.K. soared more than 10 percent last month. CNN's Scott McLean is tracking this for us. He joins us live from London. Good morning to you, Scott. So, all eyes, of course, on Liz Truss scrutinizing her every word.

She will not be deputizing her answering today as she takes questions from the opposition and from her own party as well.She has to face the music and really answer for the chaos of the past few weeks. Yesterday, she put out a statement saying that, look, she wanted to be honest with the public about the tough times ahead. And you mentioned we're already starting to see that things are not exactly improving. Inflation to the end of last month ticked up slightly year over year compared to the numbers from August now more than 10 percent. A junior cabinet minister was asked yesterday how many chances Liz Truss has left, and his answer was pretty blunt. Not that many. She has already fired and hired a new chancellor and rolled back almost her entire economic plan in order to restore trust. The question now though, is, has she dug herself such a deep hole that she cannot get out of it? A no -- a new poll shows that only one in five people think that the conservative party should keep her on as prime minister. Two or three quarters think that she cannot regain the trust of the British public, and two thirds think she cannot win back the trust of the markets. There are sort of, a general perception, certainly if you read the British press that Liz Truss is not in control of her own government. And this new poll shows that the public, by and large agrees with that. Most people say that it is the new chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, that is calling the shots on the economy more than the prime minister. That's on top of a poll that shows that the conservatives would be absolutely trounced by the opposition labor, where an election to be held today, and if you're a vetting person, well, the bookies odds on favorite are on the year 2022 as the year that Liz Truss will be replaced as prime minister. Of course, a handful of conservative M.P.s, backbench M.P.s have already called on her to resign. So, what is stopping the party from actually pushing her out? Well, first of all, the rules say that she can't face a leadership challenge for at least a year. Of course, those rules can be changed, but perhaps more practically is the fact that there isn't an obvious successor that could easily unify her party. And that is what the foreign secretary James Cleverly pointed out this morning in an interview saying that, look, the people who plotted to oust Boris Johnson didn't have an obvious plan B. There is no obvious plan B in this case. And look, if we go through another leadership race or just select a new leader, that doesn't exactly say to the British public that we're focused on them rather than ourselves. Rosemary?",

Demonstrations erupted last month after Mahsa Armini died in the custody of the morality police for allegedly not wearing her hijab properly.CNN obtained this video from the pro-reform activist outlet IranWire. It shows protestors gathering around a fire in Amini's birthplace Tuesday. She's become a symbol in the fight for women's rights and freedoms in Iran. These are university students in northern Iran chanting for freedom and equality during their protest March on Tuesday. Meantime, an Iranian rock climber is now back in Tehran after competing without her hijab in South Korea on Sunday. Elnaz Rekabi told Iranian state media on arrival that she accidentally competed without her head scarf, but there's growing concern she could face repercussions given Iran's current climate. And CNN's Anna Coren joins us now from Hong Kong with more on this. Good to see you, Anna. So, a lot of concern for the welfare of Elnaz Rekabi. What is the latest on this?",

She had disappeared after competing in the Asian championships rock climbing event in Seoul on Sunday. She was seen not wearing a hijab.In all her previous events, she wears a hijab, but not on Sunday. And many people believe that she was acting in solidarity with the women of Iran, that she was staging a protest. And of course, these images of her rock climbing in Seoul went viral on social media. Obviously, she flew into Tehran very early this morning where she appeared to receive a hero's welcome. She came forth in these, Asian championships. She spoke to the media and apologized for what had taken place. She said it was unintentional. It was an accident that she was busy preparing her equipment and her hijab had slipped off. And she didn't realize. But why don't we take a listen to what she said to reporters when they were asking if she was facing any problems. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ELNAZ REKABI, IRANIAN ROCK CLIMBER (through translator):  No, I am back to Iran in perfect health and peace of mind, despite the overwhelming stress that I had. Thank God nothing happened. UNKNOWN (through translator):  There were some youths that for 24 to 46 hours, nobody knew what happened to you. REKABI (through translator):  No, nothing like that happened. Everything happened according to plan. We are back to Iran and even now everything is according to plan. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Anna Coren, many thanks.Well, CNN has learned some of the protestors injured in Tehran's brutal crackdown over the past month are avoiding medical treatment for fear of being arrested. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh has the story and a warning some of the video in her report is graphic. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The repressive Republic is crushing dissent with brutality that knows no bounds. Kurdish cities like this one bearing the brunt of an unforgiving crackdown that's left no place safe, with security forces now hunting down the injured. UNKNOWN (through translator):  The injured don't go to hospitals because if they go there, plain clothes police will arrest them. Even in most pharmacies, they cannot go and get treated because they will be immediately identified and eventually lead to their arrest. For this reason, people are not being treated for their wounds. KARADSHEH:  This is the leg of a 14-year-old boy peppered with what appears to be birdshot wounds, protesters in his town know better than to go to the hospital. A story replicated over and over across the country. Doctors, protestors and a human rights group tell CNN hospitals have turned into a trap, too dangerous for protesters. A doctor inside Iran who doesn't want to be identified for his safety spoke to us through the voice of a translator. UNKNOWN (through translator):  They mostly come undercover, but most of times they are recognizable by some signs. They come and ask about new patients if they want to use force, we have to answer them. Most of the times we use fake names or fake calls for protestors to help them so that they would not be recognized by intelligence forces.",

Meantime, the United Nations is split over how to respond. Some member countries have proposed sending in defense forces while others say they need to honor the wishes of the Haitian people.
