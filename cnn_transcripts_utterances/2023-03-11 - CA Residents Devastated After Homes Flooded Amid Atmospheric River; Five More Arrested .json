      "sentences": "All right. We begin this hour with the sudden implosion of a major tech lender and it's already sent shockwaves from Wall Street to Main Street. Silicon Valley Bank collapsed Friday making it the second largest failure of a financial institution in American history. SVB was a top source of funding for tech startups and held more than $200 billion in assets.The collapse happened after the bank sold a bunch of securities at a loss and said it would sell billions in new shares to shore up its balance sheet. The bank is now under the control of the FDIC, which is an independent government agency that insures bank deposits and oversees financial institutions. The agency says all insured depositors will have access to their insured deposits no later than Monday morning. The FDIC insures deposits of up to $250,000. With us right now is the host of CNN Business Nightcap, Jon Sarlin. He's also the producer for CNN Digital. John, so good to see you. So, put it into context for us. Why did this bank fail so quickly?",

      "sentences": "Well, Fredricka, it is a old school bank run in a modern economy. You can point to two reasons. The first is that the Fed has been increasing interest rates since 2022. That has had an effect on the bank's assets, which means that its unrealized bonds were worth less money. On the flip side, those increased interest rates has had a devastating effect on the tech sector at large, right?And this is a tech sector that has seen layoffs, that have seen V.C. funds dry up. Those two factors combined to -- on Wednesday, the bank announcing that it is hard to sell off some of its assets to be solvent that led to panic. WhatsApp groups, group chats of founders of V.C.'s, all were abuzz with what to do about SVB, that led to panic. The key ingredient in a bank run and what we've seen is that nobody wants to be the last customer held at a bank.",

So, $250,000 is the floor and the FDIC has come out and said that that is what guaranteed will be available on Monday.But right now, they're looking at the books of SVB and determining how much and how quickly they can make the rest of those funds available to the customers.",

WILLIAM \"BILL\" PATZERT, RETIRED CLIMATOLOGIST: Well, you know, after many years of punishing drought here in California, Fred, we're having these atmospheric rivers which are like, literally rivers in the sky. They're extremely wet. And the result has been almost continuous storms since December. In some parts of the Sierras, there's almost 600 inches of snow, here locally in Southern California.

Well, it's been more than two months now of these regular protests that on a regular basis bring out more than 100,000 people at a time in a population of just around nine million. Just to get to show you how many people are coming out. We are in Jerusalem. This is -- we're right outside of the Israeli president's residence.And as you can see, there are hundreds if not thousands of protesters here. Many of them chanting Israel will not become a dictatorship. They are chanting this is not Poland. And we're even seeing some protesters dressed as handmaids from The Handmaid's Tale. That's been something that we've been seeing as a regular part of these protests. But it's the Israeli president here who actually just a few days ago, made an impassioned plea in a televised speech. You know, this is the first time we heard him speaking out directly against these reforms, saying that they are potentially a threat to the Democratic foundations of Israel and warning that the country is at a point of no return. For many of these protesters, this is what they feel like. They feel like they are fighting for the soul of Israel. But the reason that so many people are also coming out tonight is this week is a very important week in terms of the legislation moving forward. It's going to go through quite a few important steps. It still has some time before it will become law if it becomes law. But this week will be a key week to push it forward even further with the police from the Israeli President, the pleas from these protesters to stop the central station, to come together to have some sort of negotiations over what these reforms will look like. Well, they appear to be falling on deaf ears. We're getting no indication from the Israeli government, from the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who's actually in Italy right now on a state visit, that they plan to slow this thing down at all. And because in their minds, they say these are necessary reforms. They say they're a long time coming. They believe these will bring back balance between the branches of government. And also, they don't need to listen to the protesters because they have a clear majority in the Israeli parliament. They have 60 (INAUDIBLE) they can pass these reforms if they need to and if they want to. But the question will be how much more of this pressure of these regular protests, hundreds of thousands of people coming out to the streets will it take for them to actually potentially slow down these reforms before they take place.

But I remain deeply worried that the White House just doesn'tappreciate how dire our situation has become. It's also very hurtful and upsetting that after 25 months in office you haven't found the time to meet with our families, to just give them some words of assurance. Sir -- Morad, Emad and I have now collectively languished here for 18 years. Our lives and families have been utterly devastated. We desperately, desperately need you to finally conclude that we suffered long enough as Iran's hostages. President Biden, you and you alone have the power to deliver an Obama administration's broken promise to my family. I implore you, sir, to put the lives and liberty of innocent Americans above all the politics involved and to just do what is necessary to end this nightmare and bring us home. Thank you.

Of course, it happens at a time when the United States has very big arguments and conflicts with Iran over, certainly, the Iran nuclear deal. That still hasn't been signed. Over Iran, allegations of sending weaponry to Russia to use in its war against Ukraine. And of course, over Iran's crackdown on human rights over the women's movement.

Norfolk Southern says it found loose wheels on a series of cars involved in the incident. Officials believe there are nearly 700 rail cars nationwide that could have an issue with loose or defective wheels similar to the Springfield, Ohio, derailment. Let's bring in CNN's Polo Sandoval.

The good news in this latest incident, Norfolk Southern confirming the train was not carrying any hazardous material when it derailed this week in Calhoun County, Alabama. But look at the mess it's left to clean up. This is going to be ongoing for 24 hours a day, according to authorities. They're basically going to be cleaning out what's left behind. No injuries to report. No hazmat. There were reports, according to the company, that a couple of the cars did carry hazardous material initially at one point. However, they were empty at the time of the incident. But look at it from a wider perspective, you have the toxic incident last month in East Palestine, you have the other incident you just talked about in Springfield, Ohio, a month later, which the company discovered that it had some loose wheels that they're looking at. And then, of course, a recent one in West Virginia as well that a CSX train was involved in. So you bundle it altogether and it certainly is going to lead to concerns and very serious questions for the people who live in these communities that have these trains going through their neighborhoods. These are questions that are being echoed by legislators as well. They're calling on a closer look at these lines - Fred?",
