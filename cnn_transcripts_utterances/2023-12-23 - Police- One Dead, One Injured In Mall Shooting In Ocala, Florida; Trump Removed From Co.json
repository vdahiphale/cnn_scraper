Law enforcement officials say multiple people were injured at a mall in Ocala, North Orlando. Officials report the mall is being evacuated, but add there is no longer a threat in the area and that the suspect has fled the scene. Moments ago, police holding a news conference said one person was killed in this shooting, one person was seriously injured in the shooting, and they say, at this point the shooting appears to be a targeted act of violence. We are closely following this story. We will bring you any new developments that come in throughout the evening, so stay with us. But in the meantime, I just want to reiterate, police just held a news conference in Ocala, Florida, they are saying one dead, one injured as a result of a shooting at this mall, of course, this very busy holiday shopping season taking place across the country right now, a lot of people go into the malls and shopping centers, of course, hoping everybody stays safe. But down in Ocala, Florida, they did have this violent incident. We're going to stay on top of it as things develop. We'll bring you those details to you as they come in. Meanwhile, we are getting President Biden's first reaction to the Supreme Court's decision that it will not fast track a ruling on whether Donald Trump is immune from federal prosecution for alleged crimes he committed while in office. In a short interaction with reporters this evening, President Biden was asked if any president is immune from criminal prosecution, Biden said: \"I can't think of one.\" Meantime, Donald Trump is applauding the court's order on Truth Social writing: \"Of course, I'm entitled to presidential immunity.\" Of course, we should doubt the Supreme Court did not say he is immune. They just haven't ruled on it just yet. Following the playbook of his previous legal cases, the former president wasted no time looking to profit off of this short-term delay, for him, asking supporters for money in a fundraising e-mail yesterday. Trump is also railing against the Colorado Supreme Court taking his name off the state's primary ballot for Trump's role in the January 6th insurrection. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)",

He has been accused of very, very serious crimes, both on the January 6th case, and frankly, in the documents case, and I don't know how many of these cases could be resolved by the election in November. But I think he deserves his day in court, because if he were acquitted of these charges, obviously, that would matter to the voters as well. So, I think it's in a number of people's best interest for this to get adjudicated. It may not be in his legal best interest, and obviously, they've been operating on a strategy of delay, but it strikes me that if he could get acquitted, it would help him and it would also let the American people know what's what when it comes to the very serious charges leveled against him.",

Children who are malnourished or even more vulnerable to waterborne diseases, something like cholera could take hold and could potentially take as many lives as the fighting, you know.And so, it is -- when we talk about the amount of aid going in, and we talk about the Security Council resolution yesterday. You know, it is welcome that we all finally are in agreement that more aid needs to get in, but the reality is, is for that aid to be able to reach children and families who need it, there has to be a pause in the fighting. We've lost more than 130 UN colleagues in this war and you can just imagine trying to provide this kind of support. You know, for many of us this is -- it's a job which we live day in day out when we are trying to do our best, to reach children and families who need us, but when bombs are falling, it is impossible.",
