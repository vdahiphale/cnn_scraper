This is new CNN video from just outside the Gaza border. Dozens of Israeli tanks, armored personnel carriers and bulldozers are gathered in this area, and several other groupings are nearby. Israeli troops are waiting the order to storm into Gaza. After days of agonizing delays, humanitarian aid has rolled into Gaza for the first time since the war began two weeks ago. The Rafah Border Crossing between Egypt and Gaza is closed again, we should note, after the 20-truck convoy made its way through. Police agencies say many more massive shipments of water, fuel, and food are urgently needed, and that Gaza's hospital system is teetering on collapse. Also to tell you about this afternoon, an American mother and daughter are one step closer to the U.S. soil one day after being freed by Hamas. Judith Tai Raanan and her 17-year-old daughter, Natalie, are reuniting with family today at an Israeli military base. Her father says he's expecting her home by Tuesday for her 18th birthday.

And the laws -- and the regulations of war, Israel and any combatant needs to abide by. Of course when you're combatting a terrorist organization like Hamas, they don't pay attention to anything like that. They came in and they massacred 1300 Israelis, just because they were Jewish, and the captured 200 and still holds all of them except for two.What my colleague is doing is fanning flames that I'm sure is resulting in more people dying. Endangering people's lives, fanning those flames. That is outrageous and to suggest that Americans don't want to make sure that we eradicate a terrorist organization that is ISIS-like, I don't think she's reading the American people's sentiment right now. And I really would ask my colleague to stand down, turn down the volume. And let's make sure that we keep the focus on assuring that our national security interests are protected and that we can prevent a terrorist organization like Hamas from ever doing what they are doing again. And ensure that Hamas can't put their own people, innocent Palestinians in harm's way, and caused the death of their own children, women, and elderly, by putting them in harm's way, because Hamas uses their own civilians as human shields. And that's been proved over and over.",

It's advice on how to brutalize hostages, how to get them to comply, how to use electric shocks.And it says right at the beginning, if any of them is going to cause you any trouble then you kill the ones who are going to be problematic.

But the handbook, it is entirely envisioning situations where there's a prolonged standoff on Israeli soil.So what actually happened was, of course, almost all the hostages got taken back to Gaza very quickly, whereas it seems like what they were planning for, at least the people who had that handbook, were maybe a bunch of standoffs in the kibbutz scene, in the territory of Israel, and, you know, bargaining for the lives of hostages there, rather than consolidating them all on the Gaza territory.",

A lot of the things that they were envisioning they didn't have to do it, they didn't have to consolidate food, they didn't have to consolidate batteries and flashlights. That's the kind of thing that's in the manual. If you just take them home, then you can use the food supplies you have.",

There are (INAUDIBLE) citizens, there are American citizens and so forth, and the reason they're doing that is because it's one thing to take an Israeli hostage but if Hamas is also taking another country's citizen hostage, there are other implications to that.So it's probably not a coincidence that these two who have been released are American citizens.
