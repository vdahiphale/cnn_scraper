The focus here for all the witnesses will be about what they can say about damages.And that is the question of what testimony could Trump give that relates to damages that E. Jean Carroll has suffered as a result of the defamatory statements. That is something that the lawyers and the judge have been gone back and forth on. And it's not clear exactly how that will play out if Trump does decide to take the stand. He is likely the only witness his defense will call. They have mentioned calling a woman who E. Jean Carroll confided in after the assault. But the judge has not ruled on whether that testimony will come in. So, for now, Trump might be the only witness testifying his defense.

And that is what he is trying to do. They have made these court appearances part of their campaign trail strategy. One of the things that we noted was last week he attended two different court appearances. Both of them were voluntary, as was this one. And one of them, he used every single opportunity to be in front of the camera. Now, I am told that right now, they aren't expecting him to do any sort of media availability. So, unclear what he is getting out of this in terms of media narrative. But they do believe, and he particularly believes, that this keeps the focus on Donald Trump. Now, I also am told that, with this case in particular, he has been fixated on it. And you can tell from his social media as well, consistently posting about this case and the judge. He has continually said that all of these cases are election interference and he is being politically prosecuted -- or persecuted. Excuse me. So, what do we expect to hear from him today? Well, that is the big question. What messaging is he going to give here in New Hampshire? Because we are just days out from that primary. And one thing we know is that his team has been watching Nikki Haley's poll numbers rise very closely. In fact, they are spending millions of dollars already in the state. They put out ads attacking her on immigration. They put out ads attacking her on Medicare and Social Security. They are concerned about what they have seen in her growing popularity. But I will also tell you, they are much more relieved going into this primary after what happened last night. They believe that they have some momentum now going into the second primary, whereas there was a little concern of what those margins could have been in Iowa. But, of course, as we know, he did have a historic win there.",

Jean Carroll has said that she lost her job as an \"Elle\" advice columnist because of the defamation, because of defamatory statements that Donald Trump has said consistently throughout this entire process. So I suspect we will see someone from \"Elle\" magazine or someone that can testify to the fact that, yes, she did lose her job and, yes, her reputation is damaged, that perhaps she can't get other jobs in the media or entertainment field. And we may hear someone testify about the emotional damages, how this has caused her shame and humiliation.

He asked the judge to allow him to make closing arguments and to participate in the closing argument that his attorney was given -- was giving. That's very different than taking a witness stand, putting your hand on a Bible, holding it up, saying that you swear to tell the truth, and then to be cross-examined by the other side. So I do not expect Donald Trump to take the witness stand. I do not expect him to be in any way a participant in this trial. What I expect is what we have always seen. He will make remarks about it. He will make promises, and then he won't do it. But, more importantly, he is there for media attention. As the other correspondent said, this is his way of sucking the air out of the -- out of all of the other candidates' efforts to gain any media attention.

And she said she will only debate if it's Joe Biden on that stage, and inferring that she would be the one to go on and win the Republican nomination. So that's really the tone shift we have seen from Iowa here into New Hampshire, where, again, it does appear that she has among the best chances she can to cut into what has been a Trump- dominating lead since really the beginning of this primary process.

Also here is Democratic strategist Maria Cardona, who also has a podcast called \"Hot Mics From Left to Right.\" Thank you both for joining us. Joe, if you look at the entrance polls from Iowa last night, Donald Trump's cementing his hold on the Republican Party. We have a large majority of Iowa Republican caucus-goers thinking that the 2020 election was stolen from him. Of course, as we know, well, it was not. But just as many, just a small bit less, they think that Trump is still fit to run the country even if he is convicted, remember, 91 counts for indictments against him. Sitting here today, just a few hours after those results in Iowa, how are you feeling about Trump's hold on the party and where he goes from here? FMR. REP. JOE WALSH (R-IL):  I think I'm a lousy guest to have on TV shows like this to talk about this race, because I just don't think there's a race. (LAUGHTER)",

And so I think that tells you exactly what Joe was saying and the frustration that is felt, because what if she had been going against Trump, had the backbone to go up against Trump from the very beginning. She talked about how Donald Trump, for better or worse, for right or wrong, chaos follows him. No, Nikki, chaos doesn't follow him. He is the chaos. He causes the chaos. He injects the chaos.
