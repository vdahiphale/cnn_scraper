After four hours of testimony, the former president thought that everything was just perfect. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: I think it went very well. I think we were there and we listened. (INAUDIBLE) scammed this. This is a case that should have never been brought. It's a case that should be dismissed immediately.

So, if he tells them, I did great, I did great, all of a sudden they start to parrot, Donald, you did great, you are brilliant today. This is all about basically patting him on the back and making him and stroking his ego. That's all this is about. He knows that he lost this matter already. It's just a matter of how much. It's a matter of the disgorgement that they're going to be able to show. What he's looking to do is to figure out how to play this, since he lost already in the court of law, how to play this to a court of public opinion. And he thinks that he's doing well and he's going to try to ride the same street. Look, with all due respect to media, think about it. 24/7 since he took the stand has been nothing but Donald Trump.

He's the owner of Echo Fine Properties in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. He's also the author of How Making a Sandwich Can Change Your World. So, Jeff, Trump, when he was asked if he believed that Mar-a-Lago was worth a billion dollars, he said I think between a billion and 1.5 billion.

And then also the surfside place was just sold for $120 million, and that was two acres. So, that's $60 million an acre. So, if you look at Mar-a- Lago, that 17.5 acres. So, 17.5 acres at $60 million, you're above a billion dollars.The problem is that it's the land in both Rush Limbaugh's case and in the surfside case, they're buying the land. And that is the best use of the property. So, you have to bulldoze Mar-a-Lago. And you can't do that because it's a national historic register.

The Washington Post is revealing how Trump and his allies have already begun strategizing for how to use the White House and the Justice Department to exact revenge on his enemies if he's elected to a second term.Now, according to The Post, Trump isn't just talking about weaponizing the DOJ on the campaign trail, his allies are putting together a game plan. And after musing about using the Insurrection Act against racial justice protesters back when he was in office, The Post says that Trump is, once again, plotting to invoke that 152 year old law in his first days in office. Now, here with me now to discuss this is James Schultz, a former Trump White House lawyer, and Miles Taylor, former chief of staff to Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. Miles, let's start with you. This report says that Trump might use the DOJ to go after former officials, people like John Kelly, who you know well, Bill Barr along with other officials inside the DOJ and the FBI. How far do you think that would go and do you think that you yourself, a former Trump official who notably came out as anonymous, could be a target?",

One of the plans is, quote, that they would deploy the military domestically under the Insurrection Act. This was a law that was last updated in 1871 and authorizes the president to deploy the military for domestic law enforcement.The idea is to use it to squash potential protests that could actually accompany him returning to office.

Every one of the appointees has to be confirmed by the Senate can be removed and impeached and removed from office as well.And the folks that go into these jobs, especially the lawyers, right, the lawyers that are in those positions have a law license that they have to protect. If they're asked to do something that is outside the bounds of the law, then there's going to be a check on that as well. So, that is the good news in all of this, is that we have career officials, we have folks in the military, we have people that are lawyers that will exercise good judgment to beat that back, just like we saw through the allegations where you have Jeffrey Clark's issue and the January 6th issue, and it was beaten back by the White House counsel, Pat Cipollone and folks like that.

He said that you don't need a statutory changed at all, you just need a change of mind set. You just need an attorney general and a White House Counsel's Office that doesn't use itself as trying to protect the department from the president.Jim, I mean this is a real -- in some ways, it is actually a legal question.

And all of these places who have been there a long time, and the folks that are leading those departments, again, are going to have to be confirmed by the Senate.I don't think you have the risk that the same type of risk that you have that folks are really worrying about here. Yes, we have got to hope that people go to the ballot box and vote against these types of things, but at the same time, if they don't, there is also a lot of other things going on in government that need to run. We have a conflict around the world, those things are going to be on the front page. They're going to have to deal with the economy. So, this idea that all they're going to do is be laser-like, that there's going to be a group of individuals who are going to be able to push the entire federal government in that direction is ludicrous, in my view, but the risk isn't worth it in the end of the day, right?
