The moments after the missile strike were chaotic and gruesome. Victims were trapped beneath rubble and debris. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the attack was carried out by Russian terrorists, a term he often uses to describe the military leaders within the Kremlin and he said it was utter inhumanity. The missile strike coincided with a visit to key by the U.S. Secretary of State who was in the capital to show support for the Ukrainian counter-offensive now its fourth month.

The corner in Washington and the Ukrainian capital is the longer this offensive drags on without significant progress the more likely NATO allies are to waver in their support. [01CNN's Sam Kiley breaks down now where Ukraine has had some success and where the Russians are pushing back. (BEGIN VIDETAPE) SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Antony Blinken has just been in a cave with another check for a billion dollars worth of American military aid for the Ukrainian war effort, very significant increase upon the already massive levels of donations coming from the United States and others but the Americans are way ahead in terms of their support for Ukrainian war effort. But the critics in the United States are pointing to these very small yellow and white dots here on the map. These are the very small incremental gains that the Ukrainians have been making. Now their critics are saying they're not getting through those America -- the Russian frontlines hard enough, or fast enough. The Ukrainians response to that and indeed, more sensible voices, frankly, within NATO, as saying, Well, this whole front line here has been a long anticipated and indeed all of this stuff, down in the south to the Russians have had plenty of time many months to reinforce. They've got at least three lines of defense in some areas, possibly five that includes minefields, tank traps, it's now up to infantry to infiltrate these areas, clear the mines by hand, and then get that armor that the United States and others have been donating into the battlespace. This is going to be where the concentration at the moment of the future operations of the Ukrainians are likely to be. And that is because they want to expand this area so they can use that as a bridgehead to go forward into Crimea, and indeed cut the Russian supply lines to the east and west. But the Russians get a vote in this. If we take a look at what's going on, on the Eastern Front, we'll be able to see much more closely. First of all, where these Russian gains have been made, but also where the Ukrainians have been pushing them back, particularly here, south of Bakhmut. But of course, just in the last 24 hours, the Russians have struck back killing a large number of civilians and others here in Konstantinovka, in a missile attack with at least 16 killed more than 20 injured. Now that is part of the steady state of this war, the constant attacks on civilians behind the front lines as part of the Russian effort to try to drain the energy out of the Ukrainian war effort. Now, of course, the new Ukrainian commander is saying that every single inch of Ukrainian territory as far as they're concerned will be liberated as part of that campaign. But again, the Russians are counter attacking, particularly here, up near Kupiansk and all along this northern front here. They actually made some minor gains that the Russians have, but they've been assaulting with very severe and heavy numbers of armor tanks in particular being put to use there they are being held by the Ukrainians. But all of this is adding up to a degree of frustration among the Ukrainians, allies in the West very often derived from a lack of understanding of what this battle space really is like. And speaking as somebody who's been on the ground here, the NATO doctrine is you need three to one advantage in terms of troops from the Ukrainian perspective. Indeed, the troop numbers are actually the other way around. So any kind of Ukrainian advance under those circumstances, particularly without air cover, and they have none so far, is nothing short of something close to a miracle. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Now, testing is an excellent way to be more certain that you don't have COVID but most people are using antigen tests. Now those antigen tests are not as good ads as catching early stages of COVID.
