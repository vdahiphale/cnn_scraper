Officials tell CNN that Israel is now planning to shift resources from southern Gaza to northern Israel in preparation for a possible offensive. Israel and Hezbollah have been trading increasingly intense threats, raising concerns of wider war.The latest coming from Hezbollah's leader who says that if a war breaks out, the group will target the nearby European Union nation of Cyprus. Earlier, Israel warned of a possible, quote, all-out war after Hezbollah released drone video purporting to show sensitive Israeli military and civilian sites. With us now is retired Army Lieutenant General Ben Hodges. He was commanding general of the United States Army in Europe. Sir, thank you so much for being with us. How close do you think we are to a war between Israel and Hezbollah? LT. GENERAL BEN HODGES, FORMER COMMANDER OF U.S. ARMY FORCES IN EUROPE: Well, of course, it's not inevitable, but it seems more dangerous now than I've seen in a while. And in fact, recently, former Prime Minister Ehud Barak says he thought that Israel faces the biggest crisis in its history. And I think Israel is possibly going to find themselves in a three-front war with Lebanon, Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas, and even the West Bank. So this is a very dangerous situation.",

That was not so intensive, but yet you had Israeli defense forces plus the U.S. Air Force and Royal Air Force and Jordanians helping. I think Hezbollah will have learned from that.And they have a lot more capabilities that have grown over the last few years. So I'm reluctant to say that, yes, they will overwhelm it, but they will do -- they have the potential to do a lot of damage in terms of precision and range. They can hit infrastructure. And I would imagine that Hezbollah also is going to be looking at the power grid, the electricity generation infrastructure, just the way that Russia has been doing against Ukraine. This would cause a real problem for Israel.",

And so if Hezbollah were to attack Cyprus, this has much broader implications because of security obligations other members of the EU would have to support Cyprus. Now, Cyprus, why would they be targeted?Cyprus provides training areas, some bases that Israeli defense forces have used in the past, because the terrain in Cyprus is very similar to what Israeli forces might encounter in Lebanon. So I think I can't tell yet. Is this a threat or is this a warning? I mean, are they serious about following through on that? That would be a significant escalation.",

It's the codifying of Christianity in the state of Louisiana, and it clearly violates the First Amendment, both in its free exercise clause and also in its establishment clause. In the United States of America, based on our founding principles, we have the right to choose any faith that we want or no faith at all, and that's free exercise.And the establishment clause also tells us that the government cannot favor one religion over another and certainly cannot favor religion over non-religion.

The Supreme Court, if we look at what the Supreme Court has said over time, it has said the Bible is permitted to be taught in school as long as it's, quote, presented objectively as part of a secular program of education.

Graham, and that was a Kentucky case where they did precisely what the government is trying to do here in the state of Louisiana, which is to mandate that the Ten Commandments be posted in every single classroom. And the reason that that is particularly harmful and the Supreme Court struck that down is because public school students and schools are given heightened protection under the Establishment Clause.There's a specific reason for that. Schools are mandated, between K- 12, are mandated for students, and that makes students a captive audience. We also know that students are incredibly impressionable. So we know that if we're requiring the Ten Commandments be posted in the classroom, we know that it is very likely for students to get the impression that the government is, in fact, endorsing a certain religion. In that case, it would be Christianity or Judaism. And so we know that that is something that the Supreme Court has upheld in its jurisprudence for almost 40 years. The Establishment Clause is still good law. The Free Exercise Clause is still good law. And so we are very optimistic that that 40-year precedent will remain in effect.",

That's actually just a tradition or a practice that happens in this country.What we really need to focus on and what the Supreme Court looks at is this idea of making sure that people still have the free exercise of religion in this country, that they are able to choose a faith of their own or no faith at all, and these really important fundamental Establishment Clause principles. Which are that the government does not have the right to coerce students or parents or families to choose a specific religion. They cannot proselytize. They can't choose one religion over another. These are the most foundational principles of the United States of America. And certainly we respect and think that this will be something that the court will uphold.",

      "sentences": "Yes, absolutely. They're taking their playbook from Stone v. Graham. I mean, in that case in the 1980s, the school district argued exactly the same thing. And as a matter of fact, they put a little clause underneath the Ten Commandments saying that it was of historical significance and that it was very similar to documents like the Declaration of Independence or the Mayflower Compact.And the court still, under the Lemon Test, which is no longer the precise test in these cases, but the court could clearly see that there was a non-secular purpose for this law. Right? And so, when you're looking at this particular piece of legislation, it does not matter that the legislators have argued that this is non-secular or that it's actually historic. What we know is that the Ten Commandments are a sacred religious text. They're a sacred religious text that are used in various religious backgrounds and faiths, in particular the Judeo-Christian ideology. And so when you take a document as specific and as religious as the Ten Commandments, it's very difficult to argue that this is just merely historical. It is much more clearly a religious doctrine, something that is followed by many, many, many believers and has a very significant religious significance. And that's why it's a very different situation.",
