Vice President Harris is the one that polling shows that voters want to know more about.So, in some ways, she would have more to gain at the sort of 11th hour presidential debate at the end of October. But many voters already know what Former President Trump stands for. Of course, a third -- a second presidential debate this cycle could, you know, help him appeal to some of these voters who are on the margins in these key swing states, but at the end of the day, I think his strategy, it's appearing to be, is that he's going to continue to do these rallies to try to rally voters in these key swing states that will determine the election.",

And we've seen from polling that the honeymoon has not ended.It, of course, is an incredibly close race, but in some of these battleground states that, I've said, will determine the election, she has maintained sort of this, you know, polling edge or at least maintained the sort of margins with Former President Trump, which is, of course, a dramatic difference than when President Biden was at the top of the ticket, when Former President Trump was winning in most of these swing states. And so, I think sort of broadening out Harris' pathway to victory in November if -- you know, if she's able to pull it off, it's important to see that she has a broader path on the electoral map than President Biden did, and whether that's going to be enough to make her win the White House in November still remains to be seen.

And zooming out a little bit, North Carolina is a critically important state for Former President Trump. He won it in 2020 by the smallest margins of all the battlegrounds that he won. And so, I think he knows basically to win in November, he needs to win November -- win North Carolina. And the big question is, will this scandal at the bottom of the ticket -- or lower down on the ticket sort of pull-down Trump at the top of the ticket? Trump is pulling higher than Robinson is in his respective race. So, Former President Trump is -- it's not surprising that he is trying to distance himself from sort of this lower down candidate that, you know, could be -- could potentially pull him down in November.",

So, if you've been on the sidelines, you're thinking, oh, you know, am I going to be able to afford a house, this is good news, but I don't think that people should be like, yes, let me just go out tomorrow.You know, there's still some fundamentals that need to be in place. You need to make sure that you've got a good down payment, that you're, you know, you've reduced as much debt as you possibly can before you buy a house. So, don't just look at the rates and say, it's time to buy. You need to look at your entire financial picture to make sure it's right for you. And this is particularly so for people who were, you know, just really waiting to refinance their mortgage. I would say for those folks in particular, you need to probably put a pause on it, because the Fed has said, you know, we're probably going to do some more rate cuts. And so, you need to be patient so that when you refinance, you get the best rate possible.",

What does this rate cut mean for which, you know, way and how fast inflation could go down?SINGLETARY Well, you know, the Fed has been fighting inflation. And so, this is a good sign. They're saying, listen, we're seeing the numbers come down. That's a good thing. Now, for different types of goods, it's not come down enough, right? You know, people still have to pay more for groceries. You know, if you're in the market for a car, even though the rates have come down, cars are still very expensive. And so, you know, here's what I tell people, you know, you can't just look at the rate cut and go, yay, and go out there. Look at your financial fundamentals. You know, if you're looking for a car and the rates are still a little high, then maybe you buy a used car or you buy a car less expensive. Or maybe you put on to your hoopty for a little bit longer, you know, and save up, and you can actually pay cash for a car, you all. And so, you know, just look at the whole thing. You know, people, just the one thing we ask, should I go buy a house? Should I do this? Listen, if you're carrying a lot of credit card debt, no. You know, if you still have a whole bunch of student loans, no. You know, just make sure when you walk into that house and you buy that car that you are in the best possible situation. And if you've got credit card debt, you know, this cut is really not going to impact it. You're still paying on average a credit card that's around 21 or 21 percent. And that's too that's really hot. So, concentrate on getting that debt down. And that's really the best thing for you than just watching what the Fed does with the Fed rate.",

Sources tell CNN that foreign governments could be interested in sensitive data that may be stowed in watertight safes that were on the ship. CNN's Barbie Latza Nadeau is live for us in Rome. Now, Barbie, quite a twist in this story. Tell me, what else do we know? BARBIE LATZA NADEAU, CNN REPORTER (on-camera): Yes, you know, I mean, I think first and foremost, we have to remember this is a tragedy. Seven people lost their lives when this luxury yacht went down in a storm on August 19th. But it's who those people were and what they may have had on board that is making this a matter of international intrigue. Now, Mike Lynch, the British tech titan, as he's been called the British Bill Gates was among those who perished. It was his companies that were tied to Western intelligence agencies. That was a very, very well-established fact. And, you know, through investigations and through interrogations with the crew members and the friends that survived, we've learned that that he always traveled with his highly encrypted data with him. He didn't trust cloud services. Let's say he kept it with him in these watertight safes on the vessel. So, as they're trying to figure out how to raise this very large luxury yacht from the from the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea, the very concerned that people might try to access it. Now, this is 50 meter or 114 feet below the surface. So, you're not going to have novice divers here, and that's what they're worried about. So, they're putting in place some extra security to try to make sure nobody reaches that vessel that shouldn't have access to it.",
