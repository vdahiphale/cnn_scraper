I think Israel made a strategic misjudgment. They thought they could live alongside a Hamas- controlled Gaza. 7 October demonstrated they could not. Well, they're living alongside a Hezbollah-controlled Lebanon. They-re living alongside Iranian controlled Syria, but a Syria in which Iran has a substantial foothold. Now, I don't think the Israeli security chiefs, the people I used to work with, in the Mossad and the Shin Bet and so on will be ready to tolerate this indefinitely and they'll say, if not now, then when.

I'm very skeptical. I think Hamas will be able to reconstitute its military forces. There'll be plenty of volunteers for Hamas battalions emerging out of this conflict.

But since Donald Trump abandoned the deal back in 2018, at Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's urging, Iran has been enriching near weapons-grade uranium and surging ahead with its ballistic missile program. From my archive this week, we revisit my conversations with all the key stakeholders at the center of what had been a landmark deal, a vital reminder of how negotiated agreements actually made that region more stable, even if only for a few years.
