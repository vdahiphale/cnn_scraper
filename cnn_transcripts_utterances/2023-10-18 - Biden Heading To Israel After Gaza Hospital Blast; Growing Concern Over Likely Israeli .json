U.S. President Joe Biden is on his way to Israel this hour as a scene of chaos and devastation is unfolding in Gaza. The videos we're about to show you may be upsetting. Palestinian officials report hundreds of people have been killed in an Israeli airstrike on a hospital in Gaza. Israel insists the hospital was hit by an errant rocket fired by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Sources tell CNN, the U.S. is analyzing intelligence provided by Israel. The World Health Organization, says, in addition to caring for patients, the hospital has been sheltering thousands of people displaced from their homes. The hospital blast has broad condemnation from around the globe. The U.N. human rights chief calls it horrific and unacceptable. President Biden says he's outraged and deeply saddened. And here is the Palestinian ambassador to the U.N. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The first lie was that there were Hamas people hiding in the place, and that's why they hit it.

      "sentences": "Good morning, Rosemary. Indeed, a very important question you are asking. And I would actually ask what evidence do you have to corroborate what Hamas has been telling and lying since the very beginning of this incident, which took place at around 7Unfortunately, the dramatic heartbreaking images of death at the hospital are a result of a Palestinian Islamic Jihad rocket. We initiated immediately an investigation and inquiry into the circumstances that caused these tragic images. And I can, without a doubt, say that the IDF was not responsible for the attack on the hospital. We know that because once we investigated, we found, at the high-level investigation, we utilizing intelligence, operational data and aerial footage, we concluded that there was no active operations by the IDF against the hospital. Our radars tracked and found the contour of the rockets towards Israel at that time. And indeed, we intercepted intelligence communications of Palestinian Islamic Jihad terrorists confirming that they had actually hit the al-Ahli hospital by name. So, I would say, first of all, we need to be very, very cautious in trusting anything Hamas is saying. Hamas is a brutal terrorist organization that butchers babies in their bedrooms, that utilizes the Palestinian people as a human shield that jeopardizes their own people. Why would it be beyond them to lie to the international media? So, I would say, we have to be very, very cautious, very, very careful in jumping to conclusions, based unfounded -- and while these incidents -- an incidents like these will develop, I think there is a huge responsibility that news outlets around the world corroborate information that Hamas is feeding you. Because what happened in the aftermath of this attack, and you briefly went over the International and the diplomatic ramifications. And it's all because you did not confirm what actually happened and you base it on what a terrorist organization that is holding 199 people -- hostage until today. (CROSSTALK)",

I'm sure you understand that when we are sharing aerial footage or footage from our radar systems, we are jeopardizing our own security. When we are exposing quick capabilities to intercept a certain call between A and B, we are jeopardizing our intelligence capability. So, we are very cautious. I hope that some of the information indeed will be released throughout the day. And but, indeed, instead of in believing automatically what Hamas is telling you, from the Hamas, you know, doctors that are in the Ministry of Health of Hamas in Gaza, they have no free will, they are being told what they can say and cannot say. You have not seen them report one incident of a terrorist being killed in their attacks. Why is that? Because they can't report the truth. They can't tell you what is actually happening. They are being held hostage like everybody else in this conflict. I can tell you for this, Israel is a truthful country. We are a professional military that fights on behalf of innocent people to restore safety and security to our country. And when we say something, we mean it, and is the -- it is the truth. And when you are taking an organization, a terrorist organization, for its face value, a terrorist organization, as I said, that has no problem in butchering babies in their bedrooms, and abducting and taking hostage, holocaust survivors, and holding them against their will, you take what they say when they're telling you a rocket attack was conducted by Israel? Come on, we have a joint responsibility. And I would say the media here has a key part in making sure that the facts are facts and not based on what a terrorist organization would say. You need to put a question mark on every announcement they are making to you, Rosemary. We are, yes -- we are now looking at -- looking forward to the potential of a grand operation. We are looking forward to an expanding operation, and we are going to destroy Hamas. That is the government's directive. And that is what we intend to do.

We have to report to the world and to the viewers that you are -- you are serving. But we need to be factual. We can't base our reportage on anything that Hamas is saying.

And certainly, this open chaos for weeks at a critical moment in the world and the prospect, as I said, of the member of Congress who may have been most directly involved in Trump's effort to overturn the 2020 election, becoming the speaker, will certainly give Democrats plenty of ammunition to make that case in 2024, particularly against those 18 House Republicans representing the districts that Biden won.

They are certainly playing with fire with the way, not only with the way they have allowed the House to descend into chaos, but with the possibility of elevating as polarizing a figure as Jordan to be their face and leader into 2024.",

Well, Chinese President Xi Jinping has met with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of a global infrastructures summit in Beijing, that is according to China's CCTV.Both leaders addressed the crowd earlier in an opening banquet, but all eyes are on the two presidents and their reactions to the conflicts in both the Middle East and in Ukraine. CNN's Beijing bureau chief Steven Jiang joins me now live. Good to see you, Steven. So what more do we know about the meeting between Putin and Xi, and what have we heard from the two leaders so far?",

But in Xi Jinping's opening remarks, as seen on state television, he made a point of saying this was their 42nd meeting since 2013.And how bilateral ties have grown so much in the past decade, especially when it comes to bilateral trade, soaring to new highs in the past few years, on track to hit their mutually agreed goal of two hundred billion US dollars annually. That's perhaps not surprising, given Beijing is increasingly providing Moscow with an economic lifeline since Russia is very much under severe Western sanctions after Putin invaded Ukraine. But despite that war, and despite Beijing's claim of neutrality, the two sides have become a lot more in sync on multiple policy fronts, not just economically, but also politically and militarily, and in terms of their global messaging. That includes their responses to the latest crisis in the Middle East in Gaza, both sides very much focused on the Palestinian cause, while barely mentioning the Israeli casualties and not naming Hamas in their statements and condemnations. Now, strategically speaking, analysts have pointed out, this conflict, this crisis, may be beneficial to both Russia and China, as it could potentially divert US attention and resources away from both Ukraine and the Indo-Pacific region. So the two strongman leaders, even though they are not really saying they're known in this partnership that much publicly anymore, their relationship remains strong, their countries' relationship grows more robust and substantive. Because at the end of the day, they are very much bonded by their shared grievances against the US and their desire to reshape the US- led world order. That is also the underlying theme in this forum, which is why Putin is here at the 10th anniversary of the Belt and Road Forum, Xi Jinping's signature foreign policy. In his keynote speech at the opening ceremony, even without naming the US, the Chinese leader very much taking a swipe at Washington, saying his program is not about ideological confrontation or geopolitical rivalry. That's an argument Putin seems to be very much on board, as the two good old friends meeting once again here in the Chinese capital, Rosemary.",

And Hamas has seen its following surge ever since the gruesome October seventh attacks on Israel. CNN's Donie O'Sullivan reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Hamas, a designated foreign terrorist organization in the United States, is banned by major tech companies like Meta and Google. But on Telegram, the group is thriving, especially since the October seventh attack on Israel. One Hamas account jumping from two hundred thousand followers to almost seven hundred thousand followers. Another from 160 thousand to more than four hundred thousand. CAITLIN CHIN-ROTHMANN, CENTER FOR STRATEGIC AND INTERNATIONAL STUDIES: Telegram has actually marketed itself as a platform for free speech, where they don't take down content, which means that extremist organizations like Hamas are able to post messages on Telegram with very little fear of retribution. O'SULLIVAN (voice-over): Hamas has been using it for terror propaganda.",

O'SULLIVAN: In every step of this conflict since October seventh, Hamas has used Telegram to tell their story. CHIN-ROTHMANN: Yes, exactly. Telegram has allowed them to shape a narrative. It's allowed them to spread messaging to very large audiences, not just Gaza, the audience is the entire world. O'SULLIVAN: And this all just further muddying a very complicated information ecosystem around this conflict. Really, all the experts and observers we've been speaking to have really just remarked on how big a role information warfare is playing in this conflict. Donie O'Sullivan, CNN, Washington.
