I'm Jake Tapper.We start today with our world lead and top Biden administration officials publicly suggesting Israel needs to change its approach to fighting Hamas in Gaza, more than 10 weeks into this war. U.S. Secretary of Defense, Lloyd Austin, visited Tel Aviv earlier today where he met with both his counterparts and Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. During a press conference after this meeting, Secretary Austin said, they discussed ways to transition away from Israel's bombardment of Hamas in Gaza to more surgical operations, to more specifically target members of Hamas without civilian casualties. We heard of similar messages from the national security spokesman, John Kirby early today, suggesting Israel needs to change its rules of engagement after its soldier shot and killed three hostages in Gaza on Friday. Israeli officials are releasing more details about the incident that killed Yotam Haim, Samer Talalka and Alon Shimriz. The IDF says these photos show how those three hostages were using leftover food to write messages on sheets. The words red help, three hostages in Hebrew. Israeli officials admit the three hostages were killed while waving a clap back a sign of surrender. The IDF says it's investigating what happened with the chief of staff of the Israeli army admonished IDF soldiers over the weekend. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HERZI HALEVI, CHIEF OF STAFF OF THE ISRAELI ARMY (through translator): Three people came out, they took into account that they were taking a risk in approaching IDF soldiers. To reduce the risk, they really thought they took their shirts off, so that no one would think they have explosives. They held a white cloth on a stick to identify themselves. They approach talking in Hebrew, they shouted, help. What if it is two guys with a white flag who come out to surrender, do we shoot at them? Absolutely not, absolutely not. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Defendant Giuliani continues to spread the very same lies for which he has already been held liable. Defendant Giuliani statements coupled with his refusal to agree to refrain from continuing to make statements made clear that he intends to persist and his campaign of targeted defamation and harassment.

It follows another financial setback after Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban vetoed a European Union aid package worth more than $50 billion that was set to go to Ukraine, that was Friday.CNN's Nick Paton Walsh has this report now on how the lack of aid is already being felt on the front lines as Ukrainians trying to beat back the Russian invasion. A warning: some of the footage we're about to show you is graphic. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This was where the billions were meant to spell a breakthrough. But with the counteroffensives which supposed to have kicked Russia to the sea this summer, now, now it is mud, death, deadlock, and the remnants of American help vanishing. It's notably different mood here, dark frankly. In the summer, they were buoyed, feeling they had the world at their back moving forward. Now it is slow, dangerous, and there is a sense of despair to be honest. Forty Russian drones sought one trench here in a day. Down here, this tiny basement, the rule is do not get seen. The other side are not so lucky, to Russians were spotted moving a load. They guide in a mortar strike, there are just so many Russians now. Usually more meat means more mints, the commander says, but sometimes their machine struggles to handle it. And sometimes they have success. Batteries die faster in the cold, and Russian jamming seems to damage them, too. This is Orikhiv, whose streets reeked of crushed lives, and how much horror Moscow is willing to bring to be seen to win. It's a matter of months since we were here in the summer, how much more damage has been done? If you stop thinking about Ukraine, be sure Putin hasn't. That command, they watch a wasteland, tree lines now bare, the dead, the injured, it's unclear if Russia treats them differently. Another Ukrainian drone aims for a foxhole. What they've struggled with are the waves of Russian assault. Dozens of prisoners, well-trained, and equipped, backed by armor, they say are given a mix of drugs. They show us this graphic video of a wounded Russian, his leg severed, seeming high enough to smile through his fatal injuries. Still, they claim they've held hard won ground, but at a huge cost. As we say in the Army, he says, the counteroffensive was smooth on paper but we forgot about the ditches. Colossal changes are taking place. They started making their own attack drones and outnumber ours. But they use them badly like a kid's toy. IHOR, 15TH NATIONAL GUARD (translated): Excuse me, what's happening?",

They are arguing in this lawsuit that Navy Federal Credit Union uses discriminatory practices against Black and Latino borrowers.And this again, a direct result of CNN's investigation that found that this credit union had the widest disparity of many of the major lending institutions when it came to who they approved and denied for these conventional mortgage loans. Now, within this lawsuit, they say that Navy Federal's claims of community support are meaningless, in the face of its actions, systemic discrimination, in housing in violation of federal laws. Those are the words within his lawsuit. Navy Federal Credit Union, we reached out to them today in light of this, have not heard back from them yet, but when they reported the story last week, they did say that they are committed to fair lending practices. And just another footnote, coming out of D.C., Representative Waters now calling for any investigation by federal regulators, Jake.",
