It still takes four justices, though, to hear a case -- to hear the appeal, and I think they won't.And I'd be shocked if they took the case and then they overturned the lower court. Because the lower court is the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals where a unanimous 3-judge panel used very sound legal reasoning to rule for the D.A. in Georgia. And two of the three judges on that panel were Trump appointees. So, ultimately, I do believe that Lindsey Graham is going to have to testify.

Ethan Crumbley admitted to one count of terrorism causing death and four counts of first-degree murder for the mass shooting at Oxford High School. And prosecutors are also targeting his parents. CNN's Jean Casarez has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEAN CASAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera):  The criminal case against the parents is precedent-setting and the prosecution wants to include even more evidence through experts, saying that the parents of Ethan Crumbley created that pathway of violence. They want expert testimony. The defense is saying it is unconstitutional, the science is not valid, and it's prejudicial. The issue will be looked at this Friday. As far as Ethan, in February, he will be back in this court and the issue there will be sentencing -- what amount of time is proper. Both sides will argue the Supreme Court, in 2012, for the United States, said that to have mandatory life in prison without the possibility of parole for a minor is unconstitutional. There have to be other options. We'll see what will happen. And his sentencing will be farther along in 2023 -- Christine. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
