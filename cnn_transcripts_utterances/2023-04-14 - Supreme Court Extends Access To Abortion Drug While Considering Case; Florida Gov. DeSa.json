      "sentences": "This means girls, women and doctors will continue to have full access to mifepristone without any restrictions for now. But what is still uncertain, how long will full access remain? One year after sending the issue back to the states, will the Court eventually do a 180 and allow a national ban on this long FDA approved medicine?Our coverage starts with CNN's Jessica Schneider who's been diving into what this new court order means and what could happen next. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) JESSICA SCHNEIDER, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The Supreme Court now weighing into the fight over the abortion pill mifepristone. Justice Samuel Alito putting a temporary pause on any changes to the way the drug is currently administered, but only until Wednesday. The Court giving itself more time to decide if restrictions on the drug will go into effect. If the full court doesn't choose to act after Wednesday, doctors will be instructed to only prescribe mifepristone up to seven weeks of a pregnancy instead of the 10s weeks now. However, doctors typically have discretion to ignore those instructions, and it will get harder to access the pill. Women will have to see a doctor in person and pick it up instead of talking to a doctor online and receiving it by mail. According to a newly published study, nearly one in 10 abortions obtained last year after the Supreme Court reversed Roe v. Wade used mifepristone subscribed during a telehealth visit with a doctor. And overall, the drug is used in more than half of all abortions. The Justice Department urged the Supreme Court to put all the changes on hold, writing, the FDA is trying to discern their legal duties and urgently demanding guidance. DR. JENNIFER CONTI, PROFESSOR OB/GYN. STANFORD UNIVERSITY: Patients and providers shouldn't be panicking day to day trying to figure out what the law is today and how it's going to change tomorrow. And that's exactly what it's doing, it's causing a lot of confusion and chaos. SCHNEIDER (voice-over): The Justice Department points out that mifepristone has been approved for more than 20 years, a scientific judgment that has spanned five presidential administrations, and mifepristone, DOJ argues, is a drug the World Health Organization has included on a list of essential medicines. The Justice Department also pointing out that mifepristone isn't only used in abortions, but also for women who have suffered miscarriages, writing that if any changes are made to the way the drug is dispensed, harms would be felt throughout the nation because mifepristone has lawful uses in every state, even those with restrictive abortion laws. The case was filed by antiabortion doctors who contend they are trying to protect the health and safety of women and girls. It's a case the mainstream medical community argues should be thrown out, in part, because the doctors who sued aren't directly involved with mifepristone and didn't have the legal right to sue. SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN), JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: There is a way for them, at least for now, to get out of this, and that is by simply saying the truth, which is the people that brought this case, a very small number of doctors, do not have what we call standing. (END VIDEO TAPE) SCHNEIDER (voice-over): So, at this point, the Supreme Court is only stepping in right now to keep the status quo for mifepristone until Wednesday night. That's when the Court would decide whether to step in again and keep those changes once again on hold. In the meantime, Jake, the underlying appeal on the merits of this case, including whether those antiabortion doctors even had standing to sue, that is moving rapidly in the Fifth Circuit. The first briefs are due at the end of the month. And right now, oral arguments in the case are scheduled for May 17. So we'll see what the Supreme Court does midweek next week. Jake.",

But I wonder what you think is the likelihood that the U.S. Supreme Court might actually permit a national ban on mifepristone, even though it's been legal and approved by the FDA for decades and the American people, according to polling, do not want it banned, do you think it's possible that they will allow this ban to go through?",

But I think there are a lot of problems with this case as a vehicle standing, the fact that it took almost 25 years to bring this suit, the fact that it's based on science that the FDA largely considered and rejected, and I say science, loosely speaking.So, I think the question really is whether the court will turn away any case that scales back access to abortion or if there are still bridges too far for this court. And I think that remains to be seen. I'm not sure what the answer will be.",

But I know this strategy makes sense for people who are opposed to abortion, in part, because when they take their actual beliefs to voters, essentially the idea that a fetus is a rights holding person, that abortion is immoral, we've seen in 2022, we've seen in this recent Wisconsin Supreme Court election, we've seen in ballot initiative after ballot initiative that voters aren't buying it. And so, instead, making these quasi scientific arguments is a way of routing things away from voters back to conservative federal courts and in some ways asking questions that some voters may not feel competent to answer. You know, the average American doesn't have an opinion on how mifepristone works or if it's safe or not. And so I think it's an effort to kind of move to an area where people opposed to abortion think they can win when they know that voters are an area where they've been losing a lot lately.",

But ultimately he was in a minority of one on that. Nobody else was with him.And what we're seeing now is Governor DeSantis in Florida just signed a six week ban with exceptions for rape and incest and human trafficking, I think, this mifepristone is basically used up until 10 weeks. The pendulum is really swinging very, very far in one way. And I'm wondering what's the scientific argument that is being made here about fetal viability at five weeks?",

      "sentences": "Yes, I mean, there really isn't a scientific argument about viability. Essentially, what you're seeing is, again, a kind of moral or constitutional argument that abortion is wrong, whether pregnancy is viable or not, that these constitutional rights that antiabortion people believe in exist from the moment an egg is fertilized. And even in sometimes some of them would argue, even if that's not inside of anybody's body. Even if that that's as part of an in vitro fertilization process.So part of what you're seeing is that the Overton window is shifting and what is passing for sort of a normal claim within the Republican Party is changing pretty rapidly too. And that means, I think, that even if the Supreme Court wants to sort of move in the direction of cooling things down, they may do something that still is pretty sweeping and extreme, in part, because the GOP and the antiabortion movement are demanding so much so fast.",

But I think in this case, they really had no choice.First of all, what is at risk here isn't just access to this abortion drug, which accounts for more than half of the abortions in this country. The other part that's at risk is the drug approval process in and of itself, which is now a target for potential political, you know, political purposes. Really, anyone could decide that they could challenge the FDA approval for any drug, any therapy, any vaccine. And I think that the administration really views this in both veins, both on the abortion issue and in terms of the kind of administrative law part of this.

You know, when I, in the last cycle, 2022, out talking to voters, center right voters who basically said, I don't agree with abortion. I would never have an abortion myself. I think it's immoral, but I'm not comfortable with the idea of the government deciding when exactly women ought to be able to make that decision. I don't necessarily think it's the government's role to do that. And Republicans are grappling with that reality right now.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [17:47:55] TAPPER: In our Earth Matters series, there is a clear picture emerging to see how the climate crisis is not a matter of getting warmer or colder, but the reality is that we now live with a series of extremes. CNN's Bill Weir shows us how one critical spot in California went from nearly bone-dry to awash in water. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): In California's central valley, farmers have spent much of the last 20 years praying for rain. But then came this winter of relentless rivers in the sky, enough to bring a long dead lake back to life and drown over 150 square miles of farmland and counting. So now, they pray for the water to stop. (on camera): It is mind blowing to realize that if you'd stood here for the last couple of generations, you'd be watching the sunset over dusty fields of cotton or alfalfa or pistachio trees. And now it is waterfront property. I had no idea Tulare Lake was once the biggest freshwater body west of the Mississippi, but it was damned and diked and drained to build a $2 billion agriculture industry. And now it's back. It's proof that water never forgets. And this may just be the beginning because behind those clouds over there, the Sierra Nevada's are so packed with snow. 260 percent above normal, and sooner or later that's going to melt, which is only going to make this flooding worse and last longer.
