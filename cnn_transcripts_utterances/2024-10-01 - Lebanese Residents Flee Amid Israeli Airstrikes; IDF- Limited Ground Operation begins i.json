U.S. President Joe Biden is set to visit the hard-hit state of North Carolina on Wednesday, where hundreds of thousands of residents are still without power. Longshore workers at ports from Maine to Texas walked off the job early on Tuesday. Dock workers are striking at 14 major ports in the U.S., east and gulf coasts. The strike could seriously impact the economy by stopping the flow of goods from everything from bananas and clothing to European wine and liquor. Mexico will inaugurate its first female president today. Claudia Sheinbaum will officially take office in the coming hours in Mexico City.

Israeli officials say the goal is to take out Hezbollah assets that threaten residents of northern Israel and there will be, they say, no long-term occupation.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I'm currently in the mountains actually, southeast of Beirut, but obviously in the past two weeks there have been, you know, increasing Israeli airstrikes on the southern suburbs of Beirut. I think we should stress that the Israelis are basically focusing all their energies, if I could say, on the southern suburbs of Beirut, which they are systematically now beginning to destroy.Other parts of Beirut have been spared this, although they have targeted attack. They did have a targeted attack in a more central part of Beirut yesterday. And so, I mean, of course, in response to your question, of course, it's very difficult for someone who people in Beirut are hearing the explosions and the Israelis are not really saying where they're going, so there is, of course, this fear that they can hit.",

But at the same time, you had this very noticeable statement this morning on Twitter by the Israeli Arabic language spokesman, a military spokesman, who told people not to go south of the Litani River. A few days ago, in fact, an Israeli spokesman declared that the Litani River was Israel's northern border.So I'm not at all convinced that this is a limited operation, as the Israelis say. It could be that, on the other hand, it could be that they have negotiated something with the United States that is more limited. But, you know, I remember 1982. I was here at the time. The Israelis entered in what was also supposed to be a limited operation. And, of course, they, you know, eventually ended up in Beirut. I don't think they're going to end up in Beirut this time, that's it.",

      "sentences": "Well, I mean you know, it's certain that Hezbollah has not been good for the authority of the Lebanese state, but let's be serious. If there is today an assumption that you're going to get rid of Hezbollah so easily because of a few assassinations or a few bomb attacks, this is an illusion. I mean, Hezbollah is anchored in one of Lebanon's largest communities. It's backed by, of course, a major regional power called Iran.Definitely, I can understand that in the Arab world there is a great deal of hostility towards Hezbollah, but you know, this is not going to be resolved militarily by Israeli military action in Lebanon, I'm afraid. This is a much bigger issue of Iran emerging as a regional power with its networks of alliances. You know, it's at this level that you need to address the problem. All that's happening today is that effectively you have over a million Lebanese, according to the Lebanese government, most of them from the Shia community, who have become essentially refugees in their own country. It's a major humanitarian problem. It will have a definite impact on Hezbollah afterwards because they will have to resolve this problem. So, at best, what you can do in Lebanon today is to sort of erode, to a certain extent, Hezbollah's aura in the country. But you're certainly not going to get rid of Hezbollah. I think that's an illusion. And in the meantime, there is major destruction taking place and enormous loss of life.",

He says that he thinks that a lot of time has been lost since he's been in prison. He sees more impunities, there's more secrecy, more retaliation. He's called this a dark crossroads for freedom of expression.So it was, in a sense, a rallying cry, but he also did detail at length the various sort of abuses and mistreatment that he himself faced. And interestingly, given the timing of this in the context of the U.S. political calendar, he was very critical in particular of the Trump administration. Interestingly, since, of course, we had Trump in the 2016 election claiming that he loves WikiLeaks, he claims the Trump administration ran a campaign of retribution against him, that the CIA was pursuing him. Obviously, this, you know, could perhaps serve as a warning, given that we might see Trump re-elected in November. But as I said, this clearly is a man who feels his own recovery from those 14 years is incomplete. He at one point in the hearing said he was tired and the head of WikiLeaks at the moment had to take over. So it'll be interesting to watch his next steps. We didn't get a clear answer on what his plan is moving forward, but clearly it is not to stay silent.",
