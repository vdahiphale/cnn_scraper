But Hezbollah has just followed up with a second statement in which they are blaming Israel for the pager blasts across the country and said that Israel will, quote, get its fair punishment. And again, as we heard from Nick, an extensive history of what's happened in the past year. Hezbollah began launching rockets into Israel on October 8th. And since then, we've seen an escalation in the back and forth between these two warring sides.

In any case, there is a widespread belief beyond Hezbollah that Israel is - - within Lebanon at least -- that Israel is responsible for this. We're looking at more than 2,700 people injured and eight dead, nine dead, including a 10-year-old girl. What will happen next is not clear. Hezbollah is stuck between a rock and a hard place. They've been taking literally a beating over the past year. They've lost more than 450 members of the organization, significant damage to their infrastructure, and now this. So they've been -- they've lost the deterrence. They haven't lost it completely, but they've been hemorrhaging, if you like, a lot of their deterrence. How will they respond is another question. However, also one of the questions today on all of our minds is, is this also a first step in a broader escalation that Israel is planning? Because we've also been hearing from the Israeli government that they would like to plan -- sorry, expand the conflict into Lebanon in a more significant way than what we've seen so far.",

There are other theories that are talking about an interruption to the supply chain. These pagers, from what we know so far, were imported recently by Hezbollah. They're manufactured in Taiwan. And, you know, they've just deployed them. So it's still really not clear to us how they were hacked, whether it was, you know, a virus, which is the most likely scenario that we're hearing. A virus that caused the lithium batteries to overheat and then explode. Or if there were some small charges placed on them while they were being shipped from Taiwan to Lebanon. We don't know. The injuries that we're hearing about are not obviously all Hezbollah because these things exploded while people were going about their daily lives. So you saw -- we've seen images of people in hospitals, driving cars, in supermarkets, on the street. So there are, again, as the time passes, we're going to get a better sense also of the civilian casualty. I can tell you, I live near the American Hospital, American University Hospital in Beirut.

You'venow had three attacks, back to back, which shows the sophistication in terms of how Israeli intelligence is aware of the inner workings of Hezbollah. And that is the targeted assassination of Fuad Shukr a few months ago. Just last month, you had the Israelis in what they call a preemptive strike, take out missile launchers in Lebanon that they said were already timed to launch missiles into the country. And then, obviously, you have today's attack. We don't know much of the details. But as you note, Reuters also reporting that these pagers were recently purchased by Hezbollah. Do you think that does serve as a deterrent for Hezbollah, which you describe as being put between a rock and a hard place in terms of how much further they can escalate any attack?

We're joined live by attorney and legal affairs commentator, Areva Martin. Areva, thank you so much for being with us. I mean, how could your heart not break, right, for what these alleged victims apparently experience? And I say alleged because we all saw the video. We all saw that horrific video out of that hotel room. In terms of what we learned today, that in order to get women to perform sexual acts with male sex workers, he would distribute drugs, he would control their careers, he would leverage his money, he would threaten to cut them off, he would use violence and intimidation. And a lot of the victims didn't feel they could refuse him because he threatened more abuse. And he also brandished firearms as well. I think my question to you is, when you look at the extent of the accusations against this man, obviously, the world became very familiar with it after the Cassie Ventura lawsuit. But some of these allegations against Diddy he go back to 1991, right? So that -- we're talking about 30 years of abuse against women in this country. Just talk to us a bit more about why it has taken so long to bring us to this point.",

      "sentences": "Yes. Great question. And we know why. We know why, because in telling Me Too movement, women were not believedwhen they came forward and made accusations against powerful men. There was an unspoken rule in this country, and I've been a civil rights attorney for over two decades. I've represented women who have been sexually assaulted, sexually abused. And I know firsthand how difficult it was prior to the Me Too movement in order to make those kinds of claims against a man. Oftentimes the woman would suffer repercussions. Her career would be maligned. Her reputation would be maligned. And so many women suffered in silence. We saw women who were afraid, afraid not just for their careers, their family lives, but also for their physical safety because of men like Diddy, Sean Combs, who used their power, who used their influence to perpetrate the kind of crimes that he's been accused of. And it wasn't until women came forward, and there was a seismic shift in this country around these types of allegations. And men like Harvey Weinstein, R. Kelly, and others, Bill Cosby, were actually prosecuted that we started to see a shift in terms of how people view these cases. We've seen legislation around making the statutes of limitations longer, so that women can file these claims, both civilly and criminal prosecutions. And there is this sense now that it doesn't matter how much money or power you have. If you engage in this kind of heinous, reprehensible conduct, you should be held accountable both criminally and civilly. So I'm not surprised that these allegations go back to the 90s and that many of the victims were afraid to come forward. And it took the courage of Cassie Ventura. And you will remember the bravado, the arrogance after that initial lawsuit was filed until we saw with our very eyes the kind of assault that she was referencing in that lawsuit.",

A lot of black women, especially in the hip-hop world, have been very hesitant and very reticent to come forward. I mean, obviously, in this particular case with Combs, there were firearms present. So that of course makes sense. But just explain to us, in the wake of R. Kelly and now with Diddy, is that beginning to change?

We certainly know they have a significant arsenal of missiles, whether or not they would want to try and overwhelm the missile defense systems of Israel with shorter range and drones, or whether they would prefer to use some of the longer range missiles that they have largely kept in reserve during the tit-for-tat we have seen on almost a daily basis over recent months. It's uncertain how they would retaliate at this point. But another question is how they would be able to retaliate.

The way that assassination attempt was supposed to occur is with an explosive device that was supposed to be detonated remotely from Lebanon. This could be a demonstration by the Israelis that if you were going to attempt something like this, Hezbollah, from Lebanon, our reach is far more expansive and we can -- we can harm you a lot more. There is also a shift to the North in terms of the war effort. This has been kind of the ignored war that has been going on amidst the focus on Gaza. The fighting in the North has been much more intense. And the return of the Israelis to the North is something that the Israeli cabinet, as you noted, has placed as a priority for the current war effort. There is really no way to ensure that that will occur, at least as I can see without some kind of military campaign that would distance Hezbollah from the north. The diplomatic efforts that are on the table are simply insufficient to guarantee that Hezbollah will not return to the border. And once that happens, imagine a situation where Hezbollah operatives return to the border, Israeli civilians return to northern Israel. And then something as simple as Hezbollah operatives shining laser pointers into the homes of Israelis in a town like Metula, is going to take on a much more ominous tone than it did prior to October 7th, in light of October 7th, and in light of the threats that Hezbollah itself has made against Israeli civilians to conduct its own October 7th-style attack. So I think the Israeli cabinet is taking into consideration that increasingly fewer peaceful options to achieve a satisfactory resolution are available.",

Itcould also be an attempt to get Hezbollah to overreact. Right now there is -- it's not just the kinetic impact on the organization. There is a humiliation that is -- that is attached to this. The fact that Hezbollah's operatives, Hezbollah presents itself as this invulnerable, strong, mighty resistance organization that is capable of either deterring or defeating Israel at any point in time. And the fact that the Israelis cannot just kill their top military commander, but a short time afterwards targets so many, it seems hundreds of their operatives all at once, demonstrates the vulnerability of this organization. And so they're going to have to do something to demonstrate to their base that they are not vulnerable. Otherwise, they're going to risk the utility which they present themselves at their base being harmed. This may force them to overreact and give Israel a justification for launching a broader campaign, a ground campaign, perhaps, that does considerable damage to Hezbollah's capabilities, at least in South Lebanon.",

They got wind of and were able to attack those Hezbollah firing positions prior to that attack, perhaps just a half hour before the attack was planned. So, you know, that is not a -- an imagined threat. We know they have these weapons systems. And it was just a short time ago they seemed willing to use them. So they have capabilities.
