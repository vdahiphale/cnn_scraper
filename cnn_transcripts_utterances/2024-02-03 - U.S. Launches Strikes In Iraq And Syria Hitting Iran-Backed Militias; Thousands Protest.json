The U.S. now says it hit 85 targets linked to Iranian backed proxy groups in both Iraq and Syria overnight. Iraqi officials claim the blast killed 16 people including civilians.The U.S. hopes to destroy the militant's capabilities or at least degrade them where they can, while avoiding a broader conflict. But Iran now saying the U.S. has made a strategic mistake, warning that the strikes could fuel more conflict in the Middle East. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said that this is just the beginning. Meanwhile, the U.S. Central Command says it struck six Houthi cruise missiles, that's in Yemen. It happened earlier today as the Iran backed rebel group continues to launch attacks against shipping in the Red Sea. CNN's Oren Liebermann is live at the Pentagon with the latest. So, Oren, what are you learning about this response last night in Iraq and Syria?",

That's a B-1 bomber taking off from the U.S. on its way all the way across the Atlantic to carry out those strikes in the Middle East and take part in this operation. That in and of itself a message. These strikes, 85 targets or more than 85 targets across seven different sites in Iraq and Syria. The first time we have seen the U.S. strike both in the same evening over the course of the past few months here as the U.S. goes after command-and-control centers, intelligence centers, the weapons that are used to attack U.S. forces. So the U.S. very much trying to not only disrupt the ability of these groups to attack U.S. forces but also to try to send the message to Iran's leadership that to whatever extent it can it has to at least try and pull back these forces and these militias from attacking especially after one week ago that drone stroke that killed three U.S. service members and wounded scores more in Jordan here. The question, of course, how does this play out from here, and that's something the U.S. is watching very closely after these much broader strikes than what we've seen in the past. But Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and President Joe Biden promising there is more to come and this is just the start of the response. And it's not just in Iraq and Syria. We are of course seeing continued U.S. strikes on Houthi capabilities in Yemen. So different challenges in different spheres for the U.S. This all links back to Iran.",

I think this growing number of people to really get enough momentum it's going to have to build from 10,000, perhaps as it is now, well over 100. Perhaps 200,000 as the country witnessed during the height of the constitutional change protests that were happening late last year, so -- or earlier on last year.

According to one of those officials, the targets include an underground weapons storage facility, command-and-control centers, as well as other sorts and types of weapons that the Houthis have used to target international shipping lanes.That official also tells CNN that the U.K. also took part in these strikes. That's significant. It would be the third time that the U.S. and the U.K. have carried out joint strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen. Now of course this comes one day after broad U.S. strikes against Iranian backed militias and Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in Iraq and Syria. But we should make a distinction here. These strikes in Yemen are because of Houthi attacks on international shipping lanes while the strikes in Iraq and Syria, of which we expect more at some point based on promises and statements made by President Joe Biden and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, those are a result of ongoing Iranian backed militia s attacking U.S. forces in the region, including of course last weekend's attack on Sunday that killed three U.S. service members and wounded scores more. You see the link to Iran in both of these cases but the rationale behind them still lightly different. Still, these U.S. and U.K. strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen again a broad reminder of not only of the threat in the region, the ongoing attacks on international shipping, and U.S. naval forces in the region, but also trying to send that message to Iran and its proxies that if the attacks continue, so too will the U.S. strikes. Now, we'll learn more about a battle damage assessment. Effectively how effective were these strikes against Houthi targets sometime I suspect in the next few hours here. Generally when there is a U.S. and U.K. strike we do get a statement. So we do expect that at some point. But it is noteworthy how close these are together. On consecutive days here, we have seen the U.S. go after in a very powerful and broad way, Iranian backed militias in Iraq and Syria and now seeing the U.S. once again in a broad and powerful way go after Houthi forces in Yemen. So we will wait to learn more, Alex, and we will certainly keep you posted as we get more information here.",

That's why it was so important. The U.S. felt, to gather this coalition of nations to both undertake a mission to escort these ships through the Red Sea, but also to join up with allies, in this case the U.K., as you say, to carry out these strikes, that this is an international response as opposed to what you and I were just talking about, which is in Iraq and Syria.I want to ask you about the twin goal that the U.S. has here in terms of deterring the Houthis and degrading their capabilities. Give us some context about what has been happening over the past few weeks because when these strikes started it was a very big deal. It was the same question of whether they would be deterred and it seems like they are not being deterred. They continue to carry out attacks against these ships.

So these are experienced fighters.You know, when it comes to the way in which the U.S. and U.K. have struck these targets, they've been able to take out targets, they've been able to take out missiles as they're about ready to be launched at shipping. So that's a very good indication that there's real-time intelligence that is being used to go after these targets. But the Houthis still have more. And that's part of the problem here. This is going to be a long-term project for the U.S. and the U.K. and its allies, because the weapons supply that the Houthis apparently enjoy is perhaps greater than has been previously estimated. And certainly the Iranians have done a pretty good job of stocking them up for these kinds of occurrences, for this kind of activity against shipping around the world.",

We haven't seen Iran take their spy ship away. We haven't seen Iran remove the advisers on the ground, have we? I don't think so. So they're not trying.

So I think that the Houthi calculus about whether to stop or not depends on how it ends in Gaza.

But if the Palestinian cause in Hamas looks like the big loser, they have the capability -- I think it's really, really important that, yes, we're fighting this fight now against them around this Gaza war.

Iran doesn't want a direct confrontation with the United States but the proxies are affecting on the United States, killing its troops and trying to undermine U.S. interests in the region.Hezbollah, a couple of days ago, was correct. Oren was correct saying, when it was clear the United States was about to launch missiles, bombs that might hit them, they said they were standing down at the moment. This is an engagement of war, if you will, that they've been in for some long time to take on U.S. targets, to say they're stepping out of the ring for a couple of rounds and potentially step back in later, which is what they signaled last night about 50 minutes before the airstrikes went in. Hezbollah, on their Telegram channel, said they were waiting for orders about what to do next. Those orders, presumably because they're an Iran-backed proxy, were from Iran. They were waiting for instructions. So I think actions speak louder than words. And it is clear that Iran has the ability, not -- not the absolute 100 percent control, but the ability to influence and turn on and turn off proxies at will. Look, if you look at Hezbollah and Lebanon to the north of here that is engaged in an uptick in exchange of fire with Israeli forces in the north of Israel, they very much listen and -- to what the leadership in Iran is saying. They have their own set of political parameters that they're working to. In Lebanon, they have their own concerns about their own stability there. But when Tehran doesn't want to escalate the war with Israel on that northern border, Hezbollah won't do it. If Iran did, I think most bets are they would do it. When a group says something, it doesn't -- may not hold fact to be factually correct a few days later. And I think the Houthis are a point in case here. Look at how they affect the region. Just a couple of years ago, they were fighting a long war with Saudi Arabia. After October 7th, they actually did a mini incursion in Saudi Arabia, killed troops on the border. They say they're fighting for the people of Gaza, the Palestinians, but the talk these days is of a normalization between Saudi Arabia and Israel. What are Houthis going to do in regard to that? Will they try to undermine Saudi Arabia, perhaps at the behest of Iran? It's so complicated. But it does come back that the fact that all of these little groups, large, little groups, if you will, can have their own effect undermining U.S. interests, be it Saudi, be it Israel.",

Beth Sanna, I want to go back to you. We have some reporting from our colleagues that have reported that Iran has actually been rather uncomfortable with some of the activities of their proxy groups. What do you make of that? Do you think that is possible that Iran is not liking what it's seeing?",

They're more monolithic in some ways but there are differences. If you're talking to people in Iran, like the president, who today in a speech didn't even mention the attacks in Iraq and Syria, well, you know, maybe they have different goals and they prioritize the goals differently than the IRGC. So maybe it's worthwhile to take a step back and say like, Iran actually has a very complicated situation that they're trying to work through to their advantage as well. They want to get U.S. forces out of the region. They want Hamas to retain in -- as a Palestinian leadership in Gaza. They want to destroy Israel. They want to be hegemons in the regions. All these things, some of these conflicts. So I think that, you know, we should recognize that they have to work through kind of a complicated calculus as well. And we should make that as hard as possible.",

What you're talking about is the national security establishment coming together.We talk about those 160 strikes that have occurred since October 7th. But when you're talking about Iranian fomenting discourse in the area, the entire Middle East, from Iran to Lebanon, you're talking about the PMFs have been doing these things not since October 7th but probably within the last 20 years. They've just not been as noticeable. They were very active during the time when U.S. forces were in Iraq. They've been very active since we left Iraq. It is, at best, a form of Iran's national security strategy to put these free-floating electrons, if you will, these PMS forces all over the area to do their external strategy. Meanwhile, inside of Iran, you've got a whole lot of dysfunction, from a national perspective. So this is their way of trying to keep their regional identity and keep control of the area and be seen as being powerful. It's not working. Going back to your question though, what caused this sudden burst of energy, this campaign plan by the United States? I believe it's because we were playing Whack a Mole with all the small forces, attempting to keep them under control and strike them and not sustain any damages . And it just gets to a boiling point where the national security establishment of the United States says, OK, enough is enough, now we have got to do something. I think this massive reaction, again, threading the needle between hurting these forces and ensuring there isn't a regional war, is very difficult to do. But it just comes to the point where you have to do something like that to put the enemy in line. I think that's what's happened right now.",

They don't seem to be moving.The second day, they said they don't seem to be moving to a position that Israel, Qatar have agreed upon. So I think they feel enabled by this. It draws out their conflict in Gaza as well. Getting to an end stop there appears much harder. Therefore, that keeps attention on the northern border here. All of these, as we keep saying, are interconnected. And Iran is behind all of them. But how did you get to an end stop? I think the Gaza issue is going to be a big part of it. But you will be left with is this residual knowledge and Iran has that knowledge of its proxies reach and prowess from the region now.",
