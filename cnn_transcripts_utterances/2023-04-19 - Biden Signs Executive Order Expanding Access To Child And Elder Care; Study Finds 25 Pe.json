Doctors are calling it a major wake-up call.Our chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta is here. We're talking about things like Ritalin, et cetera? DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, that's what we're talking about and there is a significant amount of these drugs being abused. I mean, this was a survey so this is what people actually conceded -- they admitted to in these surveys. The numbers are probably even higher. The challenge is this. These prescription drugs -- these stimulant drugs for ADHD can have very legitimate purposes. About 10 percent of kids at some point have had a diagnosis of ADHD and about 75 percent have been prescribed a medication. But what they found -- what really struck me about this study was that in those places where these medications are prescribed the most that's where you're seeing the highest rates of abuse as well. Maybe that's no surprise. And if you look at where the medications are coming from they are typically leftover medications. People getting them from the medicine cabinet, asking their peers. And just as you said, the most common ones are Ritalin, Adderall, Concerta, and Vyvanse. Those are the ones that were the most likely to be abused. What is also interesting is that this is a relatively new phenomenon. People may not realize this but Ritalin was approved in 1955, but Adderall was approved in 1996. And by the way, just to give you some context in your own life, Don Lemon graduated from high school about 12 years before Adderall was even approved; and Poppy, five years after it was approved. So this is -- this is a relatively new phenomenon that we're seeing out there.",

But also, tangible effects on the heart. Irregular heartbeat, for example. Keep in mind -- I mean, these are stimulants. So in people who have ADHD it can have a calming effect. It raises norepinephrine and dopamine levels. In people who don't have ADHD it can have a much more negative effect. Long-term, to be fair, we still don't know.
