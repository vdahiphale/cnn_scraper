      "sentences": "And tonight, straight from THE SOURCE.A searing snub, for Nikki Haley. Tim Scott, the senator that she once appointed, now expected to endorse Donald Trump, giving him the backing of the nation's highest ranking elected Black Republican, just four days out from the make-or-break New Hampshire primary. Plus, the District Attorney, who indicted Donald Trump, in Georgia now facing allegations of her own misconduct, involving the man that she hired as her lead prosecutor. What new credit card records reveal? And what it could all mean for the future of this case? Also, Alec Baldwin indicted, for a second time, in that deadly movie shooting, charged again with involuntary manslaughter, prompting major questions, about what changed. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Any minute now, we are expecting another endorsement, for Donald Trump, someone who has been racking them up constantly, since his dominant win, in Iowa, on Monday, as the Republican Party falls in line. But this one, in particular, is notable. Not because it's necessarily surprising, but because it's a stinging blow, to his rival, Nikki Haley, who is fighting to keep this race competitive, with a strong performance, Tuesday, in New Hampshire. Senator Tim Scott is expected to appear, on that stage, in Concord, New Hampshire, potentially, at any moment. We know he traveled there, with the former President, tonight, as the former GOP presidential contender, who I should note is, of course, from Haley's home state of South Carolina, could potentially help push her out of contention. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. TIM SCOTT (R-SC): Oh, man. I'm so excited for the announcement, tonight. Just tune in. Pay attention. Listen closely. And let's talk about four more years. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIKKI HALEY, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It is with great pleasure that I am announcing that I am appointing our next U.S. senator to be Congressman Tim Scott.

We are four days out, from the first-in-the-nation primary, in New Hampshire, where Haley has been campaigning aggressively, and building momentum. A source close to Haley tells CNN that she did not know Scott was planning to go ahead, with endorsing Trump, tonight. I was told by a source that Haley called Senator Scott actually, in recent days, to ask for his endorsement. We've also learned that Trump's inner circle originally hoped this moment, where Tim Scott is endorsing Trump on stage, would actually come, not now before New Hampshire, but instead before South Carolina's primary, on February 24. But the timeline moved up, as Haley was seeing a spike in the polls, in New Hampshire. All of this is course part of a goal, by the Trump campaign, to paint Haley as someone who is disliked by those who know her best, in her home state. In a statement after all of this, I should note that Haley responded, saying and I'm quoting her now, interesting that Trump's lining up with all the Washington insiders, when he claimed that he wanted to drain the swamp. She's also likely referring to what we're seeing, from other senators, on Capitol Hill. Senator Marco Rubio, who also just endorsed Trump again, another blow to Haley, especially in light of this.

And some people are not going to be willing to believe that about Tim Scott, because he's so aw-shucks nice.But I would say this. He's already shown us, number one, by making this endorsement that he's not willing to put country over party, number one. He's willing to go along with how Washington works. Washington takes care of their own. And that's how this is going to go. This is Tim Scott auditioning to be in the Trump administration, this time. He wants to situate himself while also sticking it to Nikki Haley. They got in a lot of jabs, during those debates. And I think the situation here is that there is love lost. But also, this endorsement kind of means nothing, because who is it moving the needle with, electorally? Evangelicals? Well, they've already still got a choice, in Ron DeSantis. And Trump doesn't have to worry about evangelicals. He needs to worry about moving that moderate independently-minded voter. That's who he's having trouble with. And this is a distraction, right now, because that voter, the independently-minded voter is sitting in New Hampshire, right now, not caring about a Tim Scott endorsement.

And when the nominee of your party or the President-elect of the United States asks you to serve, you consider. So while he may not, a few weeks ago, have told you that he was seeking out the vice presidency, or a spot in a potential administration, that could change, if the question comes as a serious one. But at the end of the day, it's important to remember this. Both Nikki Haley and Tim Scott have, over the course of time, been allies, and they have been friends. They've also underscored the fact that they don't take things, like these presidential races, all that personally. And so, this is a small state, where you have common friends, where you have common allies, where you have common donors, where you have members of, candidates that serve, a governor, right now, who supports President Trump, and who served the previous governor who's now running for president.

The way this nomination is going to be won is by feeling the pulse of the Republican electorate. And I don't think that can be felt until Super Tuesday. Now, I get that we're going to be where we're at, very tense in March. And the math has to be there. Again, we're looking at something like 1,200 delegates, for somebody to win over, in order to outright get the nomination. But I want you all to think a step further. I was a delegate, to the 2016 nomination, the first one to speak out against Trump, when I was elected, when he was a presumptive nominee. That summer, we tried to deny him the nomination, on the floor of the convention. And it didn't work. This time, I think if he's -- if there is a rebellion, it can possibly happen. And there's a greater chance, for him, to be denied the nomination, on the floor of the Republican convention, this summer than there was in 2016, because of the sentiment that's in the electorate.",

This came out as evidence, in Wade's divorce proceedings. But what it is being used here is now in this case, with Trump, because Trump's co-defendant there, in Georgia, and also his former campaign staffer, is trying to use this, and this allegation, to disqualify Fani Willis, from prosecuting this case. It could have very important implications for this. I want to break it all down, here tonight, what we know so far, with Clark Cunningham, who's a law professor, at Georgia State University. Also, Geoff Duncan, our former Lieutenant Governor of Georgia, regular here on CNN. Clark, let me start with you, because you know Georgia law inside and out. And as I noted here, this is coming from a Trump campaign staffer turned co-defendant, here in Georgia. It's a little bit hard to follow. But this is Michael Roman, who his attorneys have been saying, without evidence that Fani Willis had this affair with Nathan Wade that she's financially benefiting from the salary that he has, as special prosecutor.

CLARK CUNNINGHAM, GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY LAW SCHOOL: Well, up until today, I've generally had almost nothing but good things to say about how D.A. Willis has been handling this case. But with the corroboration that came out this afternoon, of the allegations that are being made, by Michael Roman against her? I've said that I think she should seriously consider taking a personal leave, and stepping away from the office.

But I don't think they're trivial arguments.And it's very dangerous, I think, from the District Attorney's perspective, to go forward, and fight this to the very end. Because if she loses, as I say, then she gets thrown off the case, her whole office gets thrown off the case. The case gets put in limbo, until a special prosecutor is appointed, by a state agency. And then, that special prosecutor could decide to reduce or dismiss charges. So, the stakes are really, really high, in trying to fight this one out. Whereas I think, also in the public interest, she and probably Mr. Wade need to get out of the spotlight, and let the merits of this case go forward. So, here's the problem. So, there are two arguments that could be made, why she should be disqualified, both having to do with Georgia law that says a prosecutor--",

But I don't believe that anybody's heard it yet.I was in trial today, with the grand jury judge. And we know that it came down just before lunch. So, those haven't been released yet, the actual details. But the way that this is working, is that they are charging it in the alternative. So, it looks like there's two counts, but it's not. It's one count of manslaughter. The first way that they're trying to indict, is that somebody committed a misdemeanor, or petty misdemeanor, in this case, negligent use of a deadly weapon, and that resulted in the death of somebody else. That's how they're getting to the involuntary manslaughter. The second way that they're trying to get around it is that no crime was committed, but they were so reckless, acted it with a willful, reckless disregard, for the safety of others, that that would amount to manslaughter. And I think that's going to be a really uphill battle. Because people act that way all the time, on movie sets, right? That they trust the process and what's going on. So, I think they're probably more likely to have the first option. But both of these option will carry, or could carry, if the D.A. decides to move that way, the special prosecutor, to add the firearm enhancement. And in 2020, they raised that from one year to three years. So, even though this is a fourth-degree felony, in New Mexico, which is the very lowest felony that we have, and it would carry 18 months, they could add an additional three years.",

She was born in South Carolina, I should note here. And also mocking her birth name, Nimarata. My next guest knows all too well, what it's like to be personally attacked, by Donald Trump. He was among the exonerated \"Central Park Five,\" five Black and Latino teenagers, wrongly convicted of the rape and assault, of a White female jogger, in the 1980s. In response to that, Trump took out what was a full-page ad, at the time, calling for New York, to bring back the death penalty. Those teenagers spent nearly seven years, in prison, before DNA evidence proved that someone else had committed that crime. Joining me now is one of the Exonerated Five, Yusef Salaam, who is now a New York City Council member. So Councilman, it's great to have you here.

Israel needs security control over all territory west of Jordan. This clashes with the idea of (Palestinian) sovereignty.\" That, of course is directly at odds, with the stance that we have heard, from President Biden, and his top aides, including the Secretary of State. In fact, a person familiar with the conversation today, tells CNN that the statement was meant to not shut the door forever, on the possibility of a Palestinian state, though it certainly raises the questions about what Netanyahu would do for one. President Biden told reporters, after they spoke, that he does believe that Prime Minister Netanyahu would agree to a two-state solution, quote, \"Given the right one.\" Did not elaborate. But also during that call today, we have learned that Biden and Netanyahu discussed the ongoing efforts, to bring hostages home. Right now, the Israeli government believes that 132 hostages, taken on October 7th, are still being held, in Gaza, tonight. Several women and children had been released, as we saw, during that brief period, where there was a temporary pause, in the fighting. That included a 13-year-old Hila Rotem Shoshani (ph).
