You can't turn around and charge him for this crime that he already started proceeding on with that plea deal in place. That's one of their initial arguments.A lesser argument, although it's certainly a practical one is we're finding Hunter Biden charged with a crime that if anyone else had done it, and you know, they might have been able to work this out civilly or without prosecution, it sounds like a lot of money. And to the average person it is, but we often routinely will see these tax types of crimes charged for far greater amounts, and that this is more from a political perspective and pressure coming from the Republican House and the investigation into the president.

And they aren't bringing a foreign lobbying case or anything that would amount to what the House wants there to be, what House Republicans want, some sort of indication of bribery or political malfeasance.

But he's trying to solely indict or has indicted solely proceed on a case against Hunter.If ultimately, when there's a trial, and if there's a trial, it turns out that his father, meaning President Biden was involved. They're going to get that evidence the House could use later on, but the four corners of this he is trying to be clean and easy. Why create more of a mess? Why create more issues?

This time it will be his lawyers who will be setting this up directing the questions to him, allowing him to answer the questions in a way that they want.So he'll have more control over these questions and his answers that his lawyer did say she advised him not to testify because of this gag order. But the gag order is limited to stopping Trump from making any comments about the judge's staff that has nothing to do with the underlying accusations in this case. But as we saw the last time that Trump testified, he was turning his opportunity on the witness stand into a bit of a campaign event using a lot of the same statements. He is used time and again criticizing the New York Attorney General who was in the courtroom also criticizing the judge who has already ruled in this case that Trump's financial statements are fraudulent. So he's sitting just a few feet from him making criticisms to the judge's face and the judge at one point trying to or telling Trump's attorney that he needs to control his client. And if you didn't the judge would. So it was a bit of a bombastic testimony at times combative. But Trump also did answer specific questions acknowledging had a role in the financial statements, that he knew that the banks had relied on them, and that he had relied on his accountants, his lawyer saying that he's not afraid to testify and saying that he wants to clarify some manners.

His blatant lack of human decency and disturbing thoughts on life in general do not in any way warrant a second chance. My son doesn't get a second chance, and neither should he.

It's such a young age. I want you to think about everything that came after 14. Everything Hana doesn't ever get to experience. She was not supposed to be shot and killed not even three months after starting her first year of high school. She was supposed to grow old just as we all are right now. Experience the beauty of life, not feel its cruelty. The least that can be done for Hana is for it to be rolled life without parole. There is no justice that will ever be enough. STEVE ST. JULIANA, FATHER OF HANA ST. JULIANA: Every day is a battle to attempt to move forward or struggle to get out of bed to go through the motions of everyday life while pretending that things are getting better. Simple everyday sights and actions bring pain as I think of what it should have been like with Hana there with us. I think of all the good times that we've shared together as a family and mourn all the memories that will never be. I will never think back fondly of her high school and college graduations.

But victim impact statements are important always. And yes, I do think that they influence a judge. Why? Because you have today, there's three real imperatives for today.The first and the victims impact statement is you're going to want to talk about the victim and who they were, what their life meant, what was the value, and all they meant to so many. The second thing is how you as a family have been impacted by the emptiness and the absence of the person whose life was taken far too soon. And then the third thing, Fredricka, goes to the issue of accountability. And clearly these, you know, victims are -- they're just they're going through so much emotionally. And I think they want accountability. And I don't believe, Fredricka, that that's lost on the judge at all. So I do think it'll move the needle with respect to what the judge ultimately does.",

Whenever you look at sentencing, you're looking at punishment, you're looking at deterrence, and you're looking at rehabilitation.And so the judge has to fashion what is the appropriate punishment in this particular case. When you look at deterrence, not only to deter the individual, but others who might even consider and think about the acceptability of doing this, what message do I want to send. On the issue of rehabilitation, the judge largely considered that issue at that pre hearing and just very briefly, Fredricka, there was a pre hearing because he was 15 at the time he engaged in this horrific act. And so the Supreme Court outlawed mandatory life sentences without parole for minors, there had to be a hearing at which the judge determined, you are irreconcilably corrupt, and you are not a person who can be rehabilitated.
