      "sentences": "And good afternoon. Good to have all of you with us. I'm Erica Hill with Jim Sciutto today.For the first time, the U.S. is offering an assessment of what may have caused that deadly plane crash in Kazakstan, killing dozens on board. A U.S. official says early indications suggest a Russian anti- aircraft system was responsible, adding that, if true, it may also be a case of mistaken identity. The crash came shortly after Ukrainian drones struck Southern Russia. Meantime, video and images of the downed plane show various holes in the fuselage. CNN cannot confirm what may have caused them. The Kremlin has reportedly said it would be wrong to speculate before an investigation is carried out. NATO is now calling for a full investigation. Joining me to discuss is Matt Borie. He's the chief intelligence officer for the aviation security firm Osprey Flight Solutions. It's good to have you with us. So this latest assessment that we have now from a U.S. official, this is similar to an alert that your firm sent out right after that crash, knowing that the circumstances, in your estimation, suggest that it was likely shot down by Russian military air defenses. Can you give us a better sense of the evidence that you have seen pointing to that?",

      "sentences": "Yes, so, thank you for having me on today.And, first off, I just want to give my condolences to the families and the staff that were on board that perished and those that are recovering from any injuries and the survivors. The information that Osprey's evaluated looks not just at the damage from the videos of the crash site or the fuselage externally and internally, but also the security environment in the airspace over Southwest Russia during the time after this aircraft took off from Baku in Azerbaijan. While it was over Southwest Russia in the North Caucasus Federal District, Russian military air defenses were reportedly engaging Ukrainian military-grade weaponized drones that had been launched, presumably at Chechnya. During this time period, the aircraft was bound for Grozny Airport in the capital of Chechnya and effectively was in the air at the same time as this Russian military air defense activity was occurring to defend against a Ukrainian drone attack. Now, the reports are from the -- some of the passengers that were on board the aircraft is that an explosion was heard outside of the aircraft and shrapnel penetrated through the fuselage into the cabin of the aircraft. There is video from while the aircraft was still in flight showing shrapnel damages inside the aircraft, and then the video of the wreckage shows shrapnel damage to the tail vertical stabilizer and horizontal stabilizer sections of the aircraft as well. So, combining the fact that there was a drone attack being repelled by air defenses in the vicinity of where this aircraft was attempting to land and the damage that was sustained in flight and visible after the crash points to a Russian surface-to-air missile being launched at this aircraft while it was attempting to land at Grozny. This has been not only highlighted by Osprey, our company, but Azeri media outlets are quoting unnamed Azeri government officials. Reuters has also reported that it is confirmed from sources that a Russian air defense system shot the aircraft down. Euronews has reported the same, that it has spoken to sources indicating a Russian air defense system downed this aircraft. And Ukraine, who supposedly launched the drones at Russia, has said that Russia shot down the aircraft. So while there are denials or calls for an investigation to be completed before assigning the cause of the crash, all evidence that's being made public at present points to this being a misidentification and shoot-down of a civilian airliner.",

      "sentences": "So the reporting that is -- has came out from Euronews, citing Azeri officials involved in the investigation, has said that Russia denied landing to the aircraft at, I believe, four airports in Southwest Russia.And then the aircraft pilot in command decided to attempt a diversion to Aktau Airport in Kazakstan across the Caspian Sea. Now, this aircraft being exposed to GPS jamming during its flight is something that happens to a large number of aircraft every day that are operating in this part of the world, the Black Sea area, the Caspian Sea area, and up into Russia. Effectively, what's taking place is, Russia is jamming GPS as a way to try to defend against drone attacks, so drones guided by GPS to their targets being jammed by Russian electronic warfare units with GPS jammers, trying to do -- stop them from being able to reach their destination. Now, when you jam GPS in a defensive manner, it's going to affect any other aircraft flying over that area that are within the cone of the propagated signal. So civilian airliners flying over the same area would be having GPS interference take place. And so that isn't something that Osprey views as being outside the norm, as in, this aircraft's GPS was being jammed. That would happen to any aircraft flying over that area on effectively a daily basis at present due to the frequency of Ukrainian drone attacks deep inside areas of Russia.",

And, again, we should state at the beginning it's early, though we do have a U.S. official saying initial indications are this was a Russian air defense system that took down this passenger jet, as well as Reuters reporting citing officials in Azerbaijan that this was a Russian air defense system. The parallels to MH17, when a Russian missile shot down a Malaysia Airlines flight over Ukraine, are notable here. And despite the fact that that was established by the evidence, right, it was a Russian missile that took down that passenger jet and killed all those people on board, Russia still denies it to its -- to this day and is floating this idea that this was a bird strike that took place with this Azerbaijani jet. I mean, I ask that because I think it's important to highlight that Russia does not have good credibility on incidents like this well.",

And, immediately, when I heard about this crash, it reminded me of that, because immediately you had theories, it's birds, it's fog, it is whatever. And, again, we have to find out ultimately what happened. But the similarities really are striking, because, in that case, back in 2014 and now, it would be embarrassing, at the least, to Russia to have some -- to take a step which maybe was not aimed at bringing that down, bringing the plane down, but the effect was the same. And I think if you look at now, the situation with drones, which didn't exist back in 2014, this is a major factor. And it is having a major effect on Russia. And Russia is trying to get back at Ukraine, stop these, and is quite furious about them. So I don't think that it's surprising that this is a possible scenario.",

They flood the zone, create uncertainty, which, well, our own country can relate to, based on experience in recent years. Let me ask you about where you are today, in Tbilisi, because there are ongoing protests there of recent presidential elections, which several senior Georgian opposition officials, as well as international agencies have, called a -- not a fair -- a free and fair election. What happens now in Georgia? The protests haven't stopped. Will the people get a new election?",

Her name is Salome Zourabichvili. And what you could have on Sunday the 29th is, you could have a new president that has been named by this Parliament that the existing president says is illegal. They could be trying to inaugurate a president, when there already is a president. So this is really a constitutional crisis. And it's more than that. I mean, if you look at the streets, there is worry that there could be martial law. Nobody quite knows what's going on, but it is a very big show, I think, by the opposition and by civil society here in Georgia that they want to be part of the E.U. They want to be part of Europe.

And, listen, Russia through the last several years has shown, when countries within its perceived orbit move further -- closer to the West, they don't like that and often use violence in response.I want to focus, if we can, on Ukraine now, because President Biden is condemning the -- quote -- \"waves\" of missiles and drones that hit Ukraine's power grid, deliberately, we should note, on Christmas Day, Ukraine says that Russia fired some 70 missiles, more than 100 drones. Officials report one person killed, six wounded, half-a-million Ukrainian households now without heat in the bitter cold. And that would seem to be the function of these attacks. Russia hit in Eastern Ukraine in the Dnipro region, as well as closer to the border in the Kharkiv area in the northeast. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy decried the attacks as inhumane. President Biden said he directed the Pentagon to keep up its surge of weapons deliveries to Ukraine in response. His statement said -- quote -- \"The United States will continue to work tirelessly to strengthen Ukraine's position in its defenses against Russian forces.\" So, Jill, President Biden's call to -- quote -- \"work tirelessly to strengthen Ukraine's position,\" listen, he only has 25 more days left in office. President-elect Trump may take a very different view, although I should note that Keith Kellogg, who is acting something as Trump's emissary to Russia and Ukraine, did condemn these attacks on Christmas Day. What is your read of what happens when Trump takes the presidency? Does he try to force Ukraine to the negotiating table?",

It still wants to push Ukraine into submission. I mean, and that's -- let's be frank. That's what these attacks are meant to do by targeting the civilian population, making it freeze in the middle of winter by taking out its heat. That hasn't changed because there's a new incoming president here. Can we read that as a sign of the limitations of Trump's power to fundamentally change the balance, the dynamics of this conflict?",

And all of these countries that are on the border, small countries, I mean, Georgia, four million people. Ukraine is bigger, of course, but Moldova, all of these small nations are really fair game for Vladimir Putin if he wants to kind of neuter them or make them at least kind of a protection for Russia, which would violate their sovereignty.

Now, that statement from him is kind of referencing what Donald Trump has said, which is that he believes that Chinese soldiers are playing a role and taking control over the Panama Canal, that they are influencing how that is run, something that the president of Panama is clearly very much pushing back on. That is something we heard from Donald Trump yesterday, but all to say, again, it's very unclear how serious Donald Trump is with these threats and what he would actually task his new pick for the ambassador to Canada to do in some of these conversations.
