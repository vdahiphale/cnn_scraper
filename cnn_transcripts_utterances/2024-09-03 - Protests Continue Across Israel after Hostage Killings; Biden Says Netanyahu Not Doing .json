Geopolitically, this world is much different than it was four years ago under Donald Trump's leadership. And so, drawing that contrast -- contrast is critical, especially in a state like Michigan, when you're looking at the Blue Wall states here and you look at a large Arab-American population who is already very upset with Joe Biden and the direction he was heading with his geopolitical strategy. When you look at that, and you saw them vote non-committed during the primary, because they were upset about this Israel-Hamas war. This is an opportunity for Republicans to depress Democrat turnout and a fracture their base a bit going into the general election. And to say Kamala is running as a change agent. That is why you're seeing momentum for her in the polls, whether it's about labor; it's about the economy; it's about geopolitical people right now, believe she will be different than Joe Biden. Her not only campaigning with Joe Biden, but think she would pursue the same geopolitical strategy, is one that Republicans can use as a wedge issue for Democrats.",
