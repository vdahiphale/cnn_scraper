Some inside the Kyiv subway, these people singing, who else will stand up for our freedom today, if not you, if not me. Kyiv says Russia launched more than 120 missiles and more than a hundred drones. While many were intercepted, others struck areas across Ukraine. Putin sticks to his style, Ukraine's president says, he's a sick creature, that's been obvious for a long time, but it's also clear that he can only do what the world allows him to do, weakness, lack of decisions, fuel terror. The strikes possible retaliation for Ukraine's incursion into the Kursk Region in Russia. And Vladimir Putin's army still appears unable to stop Ukrainian troops advancing there. Kyiv saying their forces are making gains even three weeks into the operation. And another possible blow for the Russian leader after Putin visited Azerbaijan last week, the founder of the Telegram messaging app, Pavel Durov, was arrested in France, revealing Durov was in Azerbaijan at the same time as Putin. The Kremlin quick to claim Putin didn't meet with Durov in Baku. DMITRY PESKOV, KREMLINS SPOKESMAN (through translator): We don't know yet what exactly Durov is accused of. We haven't heard any official statements on this matter yet, and before we say anything, we need to wait for the situation to become clearer, what exactly are they trying to incriminate Durov with. PLEITGEN (voice over): French media reports Durov's arrest warrant is related to Telegram's alleged failure to moderate content, reportedly facilitating money laundering, drug trafficking and the spread of pedophilic material on the platform. [02:05:08] Telegrams says Durov has nothing to hide. There have been questions about Pavel Durov's possible relations with the Kremlin on Moscow's streets, support for the Russian social media mogul. It's connected to the fact that the man sticks to his principles, this man says and his main principle is freedom of speech. Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Berlin. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Hamas has once again stressed that any agreement must include guarantees for an eventual transition from an initial six week pause in fighting during the first phase of the proposed deal to a permanent ceasefire in the second phase. Israeli officials have yet to provide such guarantees with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in June indicating that Israel would seek a continuation of the war following an initial pause. Now, according to officials, there also continues to be disagreement on the terms surrounding the longer term presence of Israeli forces within the Gaza Strip, while Israel has proposed to station a reduced number of troops along the Philadelphi Corridor, a buffer zone between Egypt and southern Gaza, Hamas has reiterated that it wants to see a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. However, one senior U.S. official has told CNN that negotiators believe Hamas may be more flexible on an Israeli troop presence in Gaza during that first phase of the deal, with ongoing debate as to whether parts of the Philadelphi Corridor should be considered densely populated areas, and therefore areas where troops should not be present under the terms of the proposed deal. Now, officials say mediators expect that Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar will receive a copy of the latest proposal in the coming days, though, the timing of any expected response remains unclear. For now, discussions continue to try to hammer out those finer details of the proposal and to bring Hamas and Israel to some sort of agreement, but there is no indication that that agreement is in any way imminent.

The Philadelphi Corridor, the borderline between Gaza and Egypt is still one of them, but they are talking about reduced numbers of Israeli troops along that border, perhaps bringing it down to zero. There's a lot of Egyptian pressure on the Israelis to trust the Egyptians that they will be able to secure that border. The Egyptians maintain that there were no smuggling tunnels underneath that border, which Israel claims is not correct. We don't know what the truth is.There's also a significant sticking point on the release of Palestinian prisoners, their numbers, the number of vetoes that Israel would have on those released, and also the question of whether or not those serving life sentences would be forced to leave the area, as Israel was demanding. Hamas, of course, disagrees to that. But the main thing that I would say about the whole negotiation is that they're negotiating a bad deal. In the first six weeks, there will be a release of 32 of the Israeli 109 hostages, what they're calling the civilian hostages, leaving another 77 of them -- 77 of them in captivity for an unlimited number of amount of time, and this is a bad deal. It's bad deal for Israel. It's bad deal for Hamas, because the war will continue. There are no guarantees that after six weeks, there will be a permanent ceasefire. I think that the media have seemed to scrap the whole thing and put a new deal on the table, which talks about ending it all in three weeks, ending the war, Israeli withdrawal, return of all the Israeli hostages.

And I think that it would be best if the United States would have put on the table this new deal.That would say, let's send it all in three weeks. It can be done. There can be an Israeli withdrawal to secure positions. Israel can secure the border. The Americans can promise the Israelis that they will help to secure the Egyptian-Gaza border. All 109 hostages would be released, and a great number of Palestinians, it would be released from prison. My suggestion is to the Israelis that they allow these people to be released to their homes, because Israel has a better chance of observing them, of monitoring them if they are released to their homes. The ideal can be made. It's all a question of political will, of whether or not we want to get this war done, whether or not the United States is willing to lose its leverage on Israel and the Egyptians and the Qataris on Hamas, and I think it's all doable.",
