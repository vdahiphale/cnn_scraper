And he just wants to get it right. He wants to be an advocate for his daughter and learn and listen and do what his daughter needs. But Gabrielle Union took a different tone. Hers was a call to action. And it needs to be a call to action. And I believe she was speaking directly to the NAACP, which stands for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. And that's all colored people. And LGBTQ Plus, especially transgender youth that are of color, face an uphill battle, they face death, they face persecution at a rate higher than their white counterparts. And when she says, are we going to stand for some or are we going to stand for all, it is the difference that -- it's the difference between saying, hey, we're going to push this agenda, you all stay over there in the corner. And for me, as a dad, like, my job as a parent is to create a world where my daughter can sit at all tables, any table she wants to with her head held high. And I loved what Gabrielle Union said because that militant tone is what parents feel, especially parents of color, because there is a war going on outside and we have to fight it every day for our children so our daughters can parade these streets and I will be darned if anybody else is going to rain on them. My daughter is my sunshine, but I promise you, I will be that sunshine to shine away the clouds of anyone who says anything about my daughter whom environment she chooses to be.

Eleven of these drones were fired at Kyiv. At least nine of them shot down by air defenses. But the sirens wailed for some five and a half hours because this was a multi wave attack. That is not normal. Normally these sirens go for a couple minutes, then are turned off.

The U.S. standing firmly behind that line of President Biden, that right now, in this fight, Ukraine does not need fighter jets. That right now the priority should be on artillery, on longer range rockets, on tanks. That fighter jets are not necessary for this fight. They're not ideologically opposed to sending fighter jets. In fact, I've been told that they wouldn't - it wouldn't bother them if other countries sent their fighter jets.But, right now, the U.S. priority is on the ground fighting. That is a priority. Getting them stuff very quickly. And we are starting to see those shipments coming in. A major sticking point right now is over the ATACMS. Kaitlan, as you know, those are the longer range rockets that fly some 200 miles or 300 kilometers. Ukrainians saying they need those right now to hit Russian targets, to hit command posts, to hit ammunitions depots, supply lines, targets in Crimea. The U.S. has only sent rockets that go as far as 100 miles or 150 kilometers because there is a real American fear about provocation, about the fact that Russia would see those longer range rockets as an escalation.
