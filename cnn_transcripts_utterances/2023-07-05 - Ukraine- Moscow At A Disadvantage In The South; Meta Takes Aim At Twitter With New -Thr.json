A different story though around Zaporizhzhia and Kherson where Ukraine not reporting advances but insisting they still have the upper hand. CNN's Scott McLean joins us live from London. So, Scott, Ukraine's president now making a bold claim about the safety of that Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. What's he saying?",

And obviously, given that we're dealing with a nuclear power plant there is not a whole lot of margin for error here.So, President Zelenskyy, last night in his nightly address, made a very bold and very specific claim, saying that Ukrainian intelligence has evidence that there are objects on the roofs of several of the -- several of the power units at the power plant that have objects resembling explosive devices on them, essentially suggesting that this could simulate a Ukrainian attack. In other words, a false flag operation. This is something similar to what the Ukrainian military had said previously that any explosion would do enough damage to look like Ukrainian shelling but wouldn't do enough damage to actually damage the power units themselves. This is something that Ukraine has been sort of floating for a few days now. In fact, they've recently started doing drills in the event of a terror attack, they say, on these plants -- something -- a possibility that Russia says is frankly a lie, pointing out that their International Atomic Energy Agency employees on site who have the run of the place. Now, the reactors themselves are housing containment units that are in theory supposed to be able to withstand the force of an accidental plane crash. How they would stand up to the weapons of war is another question that the answer is not so clear, frankly. The good news is that officials on both sides are giving some reassuring signals. On the Ukrainian side, they say that the situation is stable. The Russian nuclear officials there say that the radiation levels are normal. They called the Ukrainian claims garbage and is calling on people not to fall for what they described as information psychological operations of President Zelenskyy -- Rahel.",

Dozens of community groups are expected to join him for the presenting the crown jewels at Edinburgh Castle. And the battle for digital dominance -- well, that's heating. Meta is set to launch a new app tomorrow called Threads. So it's being described as a tech space conversation app. Hmm, does that sound familiar? Well, this comes as Twitter is facing more criticism for now limiting how many tweets users can read, although they note it's only affecting a small percentage. Let's bring in Sara Fischer. She is CNN's senior media analyst and senior media reporter at Axios. Sara, good morning. Always good to see you. So details still vague on what Threads will actually look like and how it will function. What are you learning?",

Even getting rate limited is something that a lot of users expressed frustration about over the weekend.But the thing to note here, Rahel, is that when it comes to Twitter competitors there have been many that have launched, whether it's been Bluesky, or Post.news, or Macedon. But what those apps have not had is an inherent user base that they could use to get market share. What Instagram has is the ability to let users get in on this new product, Threads, by logging in through their existing Instagram accounts. That means that it's going to be able to import a rather large user base -- something that all of these rivals have not yet been able to do. And if you're Twitter, that presents a huge threat.",

But what about its broader user base? I mean, has engagement suffered? I mean, we know its revenue challenges but what about engagement? FISCHER:  That's a good question. When it was a publicly traded company, Rahel, I had all this information at my fingertips every quarter. Now that it's private I have to rely on third-party analysts. But what we understand is that some of the user base has really changed dramatically. They had about 229 million daily active users before Elon Musk took over. I don't think that's fluctuated all that much, although he's tried to purge a bunch of accounts claiming that he wants to get rid of bots, et cetera. But in terms of engagement, what's funny is that in the beginning the engagement had almost increased because people were, like, tuning in to watch the train crash. Now I think it's starting to level off as users get a little bit more frustrated with all of these changes and features. This needs to be paid for in order to get access to this. You have to be verified. Now, amongst the hyper-users, which are people like myself -- journalists, politicians -- I don't think engagement has changed all that much. But amongst more casual users there's just now much more options -- many more apps -- that it wouldn't shock me if engagement has fallen off a little bit.",

The Japanese sensation leading the major leagues in home runs as a hitter and has the third most strikeouts as a pitcher, but a blister might bring the curtain down for the \"Showtime\" for a little bit of time. Ohtani had a rough night on the mound against the Padres, giving up three straight hits in the sixth inning, including back-to-back home runs. It was the first time that's ever happened to the 29-year-old in his MLB career. San Diego went on to win 8-5. And after the game he told reporters it's likely that he won't pitch in the Midsummer Classic next Tuesday. He was selected to the All-Star Game as both a pitcher and hitter for the third consecutive year. And the right-hander says he's hoping to get better in time to make his next Angels start, which would come in about nine or 10 days.

It's the Fourth of July and I got to eat some hot dogs and get a win. I feel great. I got -- I got -- I got leftover room so I'll be having some beers later. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Welcome to the program. So, according to a senior Treasury official, no significant breakthroughs are expected but the conversations will be constructive and frank. It seems like they're trying to lower expectations before Yellen even gets on the plane. What are you expecting? GORDON CHANG, AUTHOR, \"THE GREAT U.S.-CHINA TECH WAR\", \"THE COMING COLLAPSE OF CHINA\" (via Webex by Cisco):  I'm expecting very little. You know, we are Americans so we like to say talking is important, so this is talking about talking. But unfortunately, I think this is encouraging China to be even more arrogant because we're feeding their already inflated sense of self-importance. We view our actions as responsible.
