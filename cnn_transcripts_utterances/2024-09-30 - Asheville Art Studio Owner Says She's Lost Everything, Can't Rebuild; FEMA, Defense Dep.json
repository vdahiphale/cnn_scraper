We were just talking about this. At any moment, President Biden will speak on the federal relief efforts for Hurricane Helene, and we will, of course, bring that to you live.One of the hardest hit areas is western North Carolina, that entire region now struggling with Helene's catastrophic aftermath. Much of the area's famed scenic landscape completely unrecognizable. Look at these visuals. It just tells you everything you need to know about the devastation and the damage from Helene. In Buncombe County, where Asheville is, at least 35 storm related deaths are reported, with more than 600 people unaccounted for. Officials warn the death toll could go much higher. And these exclusive pictures just in to CNN, showed the extent of the destruction in Asheville. What you are looking at is the main road there in Biltmore Village. It's near the famous Biltmore Estate. It's a five lane road, usually full of cars. Now, as you see, it is covered in mud and debris. People walking down the middle of the road looking for supplies. Helene tore through the historic village. The floodwaters rising to roof level and pushing trailers into buildings. Power and water are out in much of the city just basic necessities people need to survive. They don't -- they're not getting right now. This is a transformer in the road leaking fluid. It's been there for days. The power company says it hopes to restore electricity to most cus -- customers by Friday. And this morning, the mayor of Asheville seemed at a loss for words for what has happened to her city. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR ESTHER MANHEIMER (D), ASHEVILLE, NORTH CAROLINA: I've never seen anything like this. It's hard to describe the chaos that it looks like. It -- it really feels like, you know, a post-apocalyptic scene in some T.V. show you watched. And -- and I've never thought I would see it myself. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

As you see, Pattiy Torno was set to celebrate her studio's 35th anniversary next month, but now she says she's lost everything and she won't be able to rebuild. Pattiy joins us now. Pattiy, thanks for joining us. I see you're in your car. You lost your studio, your home, everything in the storm. I want to give viewers an idea of just how bad the flooding at your studio has been. We're going to show a picture on the screen of what it looked like before the storm right here, and this is what it looked like when the flood set in.You know, Pattiy. And I know you knew the storm was coming. You saw the forecasts. You were bracing for it. But this was so much worse than you could have ever imagined, right? PATTIY TORNO, OWNER, CURVE STUDIOS &amp; GARDEN: Yes, yes. I mean, I had lived through the 2004 flood with Hurricane Francis, and we got to about, our river level got to about 15.5 feet. In 1916 the flood level got to 23 feet. So when they were predicting 16.5, 18.5 on Thursday, we were like, OK, this is going to be bad, but it's hard to imagine, I mean, the 1916 flood has always been the big flood. Well, we got to 25 feet this time. So it was two feet higher than anybody had ever experienced here. And so it's just, nobody could have prepared for this. We just couldn't have. Yes.",

A couple of my tenants who were seriously impacted back then, eventually, small business administration came through with loans for them that were -- that were helpful, but these guys, their lives, never recovered.So I think that will be the case for some of the folks here. But as a creative, we are resilient. It is part of our DNA. We figure this -- we figure shit out. Oops, sorry. We figure it out. And so I have -- I have total faith that anybody that wants to stay in the district will figure out how to stay in the district. I'm just -- I'm done. Curve Studios as an entity will not exist anymore. And that is an incredibly sad thing, you know. But we had a good run.

I hope that we can find somebody to buy the property that will do something good with it, or that the federal government decides that this is an area where buildings should not exist, and perhaps, you know, FEMA will buy my property.But regardless, I have my health, I have my life, my kitties and I got out safe, I'll figure it out. I mean, that's the thing is those of us, and it's the piece that I have learned is, that the world that I live in now is different than when I started Curve Studios 35 years ago. It was possible for a single artist to buy a piece of property in the River Arts District at that time. But that is no longer possible. A lot of our founders, when they either passed away or they decided to retire, the people buying their properties are not independent artists. And so that breed of Intef people we don't get to play in this particular pool anymore. But we will figure out which pool we do want to play in.

And so what they're doing is a very organized process between the state and the federal government to be able to identify where those locations are, assess transportation routes, clear roads if they need to be cleared or by helicopter, get to certain areas by helicopter.We've seen rescues and people being brought out of areas that way, and they're going to continue to do that until every area is -- is accessed. Some of these damages are going to be significant. They're not going to be easy fixes, but right now our focus on is on getting those commodities in supporting the folks that are on the ground, getting access to those areas that have not yet been accessed, and also supporting communications, working very hard with the providers of cellular service to be able to help get them additional resources in.
