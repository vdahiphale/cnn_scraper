But I'm going to take you to the other side over here on this marvelous ocean.This is where a lot of Brazilians are coming at this hour to start doing a very important tradition of New Year's Eve, that is, to jump the seven waves. If you've ever been to Brazil on New Year's Eve, this is what you do. And it's not that easy at this hour, but I'm going to try. The trick is you got to make a wish and jump a little wave. Make a wish and jump a little wave. Okay, there's a good one coming. There's a good one coming. We're going to try for this. I'm going to cap that at two. But there's a bunch of other traditions that I want to share with you guys. One of them, its similar to what people do in Spain, which is you eat seven grapes -- seven green grapes and making a wish every time. I mean, if I keep on making wishes that I keep doing all of these, I think I'm going to be really lucky in 2025. This, of course, has to do with Brazil's multicultural background, cultural background, right? A lot of these earlier today, I threw flowers into the ocean for the goddess of the sea. That's something that comes from Brazil's African religions, that has kind of seeped into the general culture. And now everybody does it. The colors are really important. I'm wearing white. That's for peace. I'm wishing peace for the world in 2025. And then this one, I believe my producer is telling me this is for good luck, right. So I'm going to take a little bit. And money, money. So take a little bit of powder cinnamon. You make your wish and blow it into the air. The last wish that I'm going to make with you guys hear on this lovely glass. Not going to drink it. Don't worry.
