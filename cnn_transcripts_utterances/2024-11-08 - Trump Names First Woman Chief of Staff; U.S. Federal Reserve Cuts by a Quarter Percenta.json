Sources and aids tell CNN Trump feels he now has a mandate and that most Americans want his policies.One of those policies is the mass deportation of undocumented immigrants. When asked about the cost, the president-elect said the country has no choice. There is no price tag. Trump says he and President Joe Biden agreed to have lunch very shortly at the White House. So with the presidency and senate now in Republican hands, all eyes are on the house races that have yet to be called. As of the latest count, Republicans will have 212 seats in the new congress. Democrats will have 200, 218 seats are needed for a majority. Meanwhile, Trump has named his campaign co-chair Susie Wiles as White House chief of staff. CNN's Kristen Holmes has that story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: President-elect Donald Trump on Thursday named his first White House position and potentially the most important one naming Susie Wiles, the chief of staff to the White House. She's actually going to be the 1st female chief of staff in the history of the country. She is somebody who has been loyal to him for years. Somebody who served as his co-chair of his campaign, and somebody who was really there next to the former president. And when he was saw Republicans across the party, try to distance themselves from the former president. Now, I do want to read you the statement that Donald Trump put out on his naming of Susie Wiles. He said, Susie Wiles just helped me achieve one of the greatest political victories in American history, and it was an integral part of both my 2016 and 2020 successful campaigns. President Trump said, Susie is tough, smart, innovative, and is universally admired and respected. Susie will continue to work tirelessly to Make America Great Again. It is a well-deserved honor to have Susie as the first ever female chief of staff in United States history. I have no doubt that she will make our country proud. The one thing to keep in mind about Susie Wells is we have learned from sources that she did have some stipulations and taking this job. Essentially saying that she wanted to make sure she had control of the clown car, that they wouldn't have access to the White House at all times. And that is something that we saw in the first administration that these controversial outside figures who caused problems for Donald Trump had free reign at the White House. And something Susie did during the campaign was essentially try and stop that kind of chaos around former President Donald Trump. She always said to sources that she knew she couldn't control candidate Trump. However, she felt she could control some of the people and circumstances around him. This really sets the tone for what the administration is going to look like. Susie is well respected across the political spectrum. We'll obviously see how the rest of these namings, appointments of putting forward candidates goes in the next several days. Kristen Holmes, CNN, West Palm Beach, Florida. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

This is the one key thing that distinguishes democracies from autocracies, that we have to ensure that there isn't any kind of doubt in the legitimacy of our elections. And he emphasized unity and moving ahead and some form of optimism, though, of course, the Democrats, I'm sure, are fearing are feeling like things are really, really weak. And I think that's one of the key concerns that Democrats have. That ended up being one of their issues that they voted on, was the state of democracy, and that the next 4 years could be the end of American democracy. But I think it's important that the democrats emphasize that, we love the peaceful transfer of power.

Are they going to go into places where they think immigrants might be working, whether they might be restaurants or other places, other businesses? Are they -- how are they going to distinguish between who is an immigrant and who is not? And is this -- is this going to lead to vigilante forms of justice where this sort of motivates his supporters to try to root out migrants or immigrants just based on what they look like? It's causing a lot of fear in the immigrant community. And, of course, there are many immigrants who have family members that are citizens, and those citizens are worried about what's going to happen if these people are going to be deported.

Many questions as to what strategy, Trump will, in his presidency pursue with regards to the ongoing war in the Middle East, whether we will see a significant departure from the strategy pursued by the Biden administration. Of course, Trump's win has already been welcomed by many in the Israeli political sphere.In fact, we heard from the Israeli prime minister upon the announcement of Trump's victory issuing a statement saying that Trump's return, marks a powerful recommitment to the great alliance between Israel and America. We know, of course, that on the diplomatic front had certainly been some tension, some daylight between the Biden administration and Prime Minister Netanyahu's government despite the continued military aid that we've seen from the U.S., from the Biden administration to Israel. Many within the Israeli political sphere have seen prime president Biden and vice president Kamala Harris' seeking to restrain Israel's actions in both Gaza and beyond, in the Middle East, including in Lebanon. Whereas Trump's presidency is perhaps remembered as being, perhaps more pro-Israel in some of Trump's actions, including, for example, moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem. But again, while Trump has previously expressed that he wants to see this war wrapped up fast, there's no clear suggestion as to how he wants to see this war come to an end, what sort of conclusion he wants to see, or how the U.S. under his administration will pursue an end to this war.",

And now we are learning that quietly behind the scenes, Trump allies and some in the private sector have been preparing for exactly that, essentially detaining and deporting migrants on a large scale.Now, a key component of that is detention space. Of course, if their federal authorities arrest someone, they would also have to detain them before repatriating them to their home country. And the private sector is involved because the federal government often relies on contractors to manage these detention spaces. And that is part of the quiet preparations that are happening behind the scenes, and they are expected to ramp up in the days and weeks to come. But, current and former officials I've spoken with say that their -- the challenge here is also the money and the resources. That is why the federal government has not been able to do mass deportations in recent memory in addition to other concerns. For example, the impact it would have on the economy. But practically speaking, the amount that it costs to apprehend, detain, process, and remove an undocumented immigrant, according to some analysis, is nearly $11,000. That's for one individual. Now, former official I spoke with said that to do something at a big scale, the way that Donald Trump has said he wants to do, would cost millions if not billions of dollars and therefore would be difficult to execute on an addition to the need, for example, for more personnel. Now, the Department of Homeland Security has reprogrammed funds before, essentially moving funds around to try to bolster their immigration enforcement. But again, doing something as big as mass deportation is costly. All the same though, preparations, sources say are underway to try to execute on this part of discussion being to focus on those undocumented immigrants who have committed crimes in the U.S. Another part of the discussion is whether to also include those undocumented immigrants who are brought to the United States as children known as dreamers. Now that segment of the undocumented population has typically had bipartisan support and some are protected, temporarily protected under an Obama era program. But certainly, a lot of discussion underway as to how this first order of business would look like one that Donald Trump has repeatedly talked about and has indicated that he intends on doing.

Vance has described it where Russia gets to hold on to territory it's already seized, the demilitarized zone and Ukraine not going into NATO, that will never float here anywhere in Ukraine. I think a couple of things happening on the sidelines.As you know, Saudi Arabia is taking a much bigger role in the region, in the war in Ukraine. They're expected, actually, to hold a peace summit, the next peace summit in Saudi Arabia, for the first time with Russia and China and Ukraine there. So that could yield results, in whatever happens in Washington. The other, Kim, the other thing that gives me a bit of hope is, believe it or not, there are still a few grownups left in the room that, Mr. Trump could tap and I'm thinking of people like Mike Pompeo, the former CIA director, former secretary of state, former U.S. ambassador to NATO under George W -- Mike -- sorry -- Kurt Volker, and Richard Grenell, former U.S. ambassador to Germany and a former Fox news contributor. So if you have people like that advising him, maybe it'll bring a sense of sobriety and that, you know, they will hopefully, hopefully convince him that if Mr. Putin is not pushed back, he will go further into Europe. It will become more expensive, and, eventually, that will trickle down to the pocketbooks of average Americans.",

But, turning to Russia, Putin has said that Trump's wind could hail, in his words, a new world order and could mean the end of unipolarity. Presumably, he's celebrating the wind. So, specifically, what could it mean, do you think, for his war on Ukraine?",

Autocrats, meaning in Russia, Iran, North Korea and China.I think, however, is, China is the senior partner in the room. We saw that for example the BRICS summit calling the shots this year and last year. And I do think that if Chinese pragmatism is allowed to enter into this story, they're very, very keen to tap Ukrainian natural resources, to resume trade with Ukraine and they do have a lot of sway over Mr. Putin. I have always said if Mr. Xi Jinping called Mr. Putin today or tomorrow and said end the war in Ukraine, it will happen. So hopefully with the, geopolitical, kind of landscape shifting right now, it's not only going to be to a Mr. Trump to decide what goes on, but Trump, again, has to show that America is strong because blurred lines are the worst thing that you could present to a dictator, when it comes to Putin in Ukraine or Xi Jinping in in Taiwan.",
