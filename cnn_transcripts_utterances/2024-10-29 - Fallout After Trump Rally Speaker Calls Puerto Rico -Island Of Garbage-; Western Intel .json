      "sentences": "Yes, Boris. We are told from two Western Intelligence officials that there's evidence at this point that a small number of North Korean troops is now inside Ukraine.And that is a step beyond what the Pentagon and the U.S. broadly had confirmed yesterday, which is that roughly 10,000 North Korean troops are currently inside Russia receiving training with some in route to the Kursk region of Russia where we know that Russians that have been fighting the Ukrainians that have held some territory there since August. So at this point, the number, again, is still believed to be very small. And a U.S. official actually said that they cannot yet corroborate the reports that there are this small number of North Korean troops inside Ukraine. But it does suggest to these Western Intelligence officials that we spoke to that the number could grow and that the North Koreans are actually there to gain combat experience. This is why, according to intelligence assessments, the North Koreans were eager to deploy some of their forces to Ukraine, to Russia, because the North Koreans have not fought a war in over 70 years and they want that combat on-the-ground experience for their troops. Now, we're also told that many of the troops that the North Koreans have sent to Russia to participate in this war alongside Russian forces are Special Operations Forces, North Korea's equivalent of Special Operations troops. And North Korea is pretty bullish about their ability to perform well on the battlefield. But of course, officials tell us that they still don't know just how helpful they're going to be on the battlefield because they haven't been tested, right? And so it remains unclear, just how much of a boon this is going to be to the Russians in the war against Ukraine. But still, it is deeply concerning. And U.S. and South Korean officials are meeting this week in Washington, D.C., to discuss ways to move forward. And one other thing I should note is that there is a really all-hands- on-deck effort at this point to try to pressure China to get the North Koreans to pull back. Because, of course China, still has a relationship with the North Koreans and could have some leverage there.",

And they still haven't recovered all of the bodies from the rubble.About 200 people we're believed to be living in this residential building in the northern most part of the Gaza Strip when it was struck by an Israeli airstrike early this morning. In addition to the devastating numbers of casualties, it's also about how people are picking through the rubble. This part of northern Gaza has been besieged by the Israeli military. Which means there is no heavy machinery to pull those bodies from under the rubble to lift them from under these enormous slabs of concrete. There are no ambulances in northern Gaza. Instead, people using donkey or horse drawn carts to haul bodies away to the morgue and to bring those who are injured to the hospital. And then you have the Kamala Adwan Hospital, one of the few remaining hospitals those in northern Gaza, where those who survived this strike were taken with their injuries. That hospital has very little in terms of medical resources to provide with only two working doctors still at that hospital. Meanwhile, we also saw that, in Lebanon, the Israeli military we conducted one of its deadliest strikes since this conflict escalated last month, 60 people killed 58 people wounded in Lebanon's eastern Baalbek region.",

The national average is down to $3.13 a gallon.That is the lowest level in nearly nine months. It's nine cents cheaper than a month ago and 37 cents cheaper than this point last year. And this trend, it really may just be getting started. GasBuddy's Patrick De Haan, he told me that he thinks that next seven to 12 days, we could see the national average plunged below $3 a gallon. That's something that we have not seen in three and a half years. And look, this is a big deal because a lot of people view gas prices as a real-time barometer for the cost of living. A lot of people remember, all too well, when two years ago, as that chart shows, gas prices spiked above $5 a gallon for the first time ever. That was really painful for a lot of people. It was a political disaster for the Biden-Harris administration. And now we're sort of seeing the reversal, right? Gas prices are well away from that $5 level. It could be flirting with that psychologically important $3 level just in time for the election. And voters in battleground states, they're paying a lot less for fuel than they we're at this point last year. Gas prices are down by seven 78 cents in Nevada, 78 cents in Arizona, sharply lower in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. And this is a big deal because it is a tangible way to show that there has been progress when it comes to the cost of living.",

That is very significant.There was an increase in confidence really across the board. All age groups, most of the income groups. Americans are feeling better about the stock market. They increase their indication that they plan to buy homes, buy cars. What's important is that people are also feeling better about the jobs market. This survey found that 35 percent of consumers say that jobs are plentiful right now. That is up from September. And just 17 percent say that jobs are hard to get. That number is down. So both of those are moving in the right direction. Recession fears have also fallen. The conference board found that the smallest share of consumers are worried about a recession over the next 12 months since they started asking this question, 12 -- two years ago. So that's significant. But one other point here is that even though consumer confidence ticked up, and even though it's trending in the right direction, it does remain significantly lower than it was before the inflation crisis. And it's lower than it was during most of the Trump administration prior to Covid. And I do think that is lingering frustration with the cost of living. Yes, gas prices are down and the rate of inflation is down, but people are still paying more than they were, especially at the grocery store and on things like rent and car insurance -- Boris and Brianna?",
