Here, take a look at the aftermath of airstrikes on Gaza, entire city blocks wiped out. The Israeli Defense Forces say that they have hit hundreds of Hamas targets. On the Israeli side, the scale of Hamas atrocities is now just really fully coming into view. New video shows the scene left behind after more than 250 civilians were massacred by Hamas at that music festival on Saturday. The IDF says the terrorists brutally butchered women, toddlers, and the elderly in a southern Israeli town this weekend. Hamas has also taken dozens of hostages, as you know, the exact number unknown. The son of a missing American citizen was, understandably, emotional speaking to reporters today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I want also to speak about the responsibility that the U.S. administration, President Biden, and the secretary of state, Blinken, has for the lives of every U.S. citizen that is out there, and they are responsible to bring the U.S. citizens back home safe and sound.

These aren't necessarily the settlements that we have seen in East Jerusalem and elsewhere. A lot of these are older, established communities. But they were on literally the front lines when the walls were breached, when the border was breached. It was often these kibbutz communities that were first assaulted. And some of the brutality, some of the worst brutality we were seeing, it occurred very early on. And, as you said, this battle in Kfar Aza seems to have been going on until just the last 24 hours or so. Did you actually witness with your own eyes what the commander was saying?

So the stage that we were at was -- that we were there was -- the dead people were being taken away. There were, I will say, a lot of Hamas fighters lying where they had been shot and killed in the firefight there. And the proximity you're talking about of all these little small communities, as you say, I -- you and I have probably both been to some of the same ones over the years. I have been in some of them 20 years ago. It is. It's a group of very peaceful people living, as you say, an agrarian life. The gates to that community were broken in that -- where Hamas forced their way in. Right now, there's a big tank blocking that hole. But we also shown one of those paragliders, the small portable paraglider with a small engine on it and a motor and a fuel pack on it that Hamas had used actually to fly into the kibbutz as well. So, again, as we have seen so many times, this was so well-planned. The fighters that came through one hole in the fence knew exactly where they were going and what they were doing and what they were targeting, 70 armed gunmen against 700 civilians.

And then at exactly 5:00 p.m., we heard the first, I won't even say volley, barrage of rockets come slamming in. We have subsequently been watching every 20 minutes or so of the air raid sirens go off. You see the sky light up. The Iron Dome starts intercepting those various rockets. Some of them have made impact. There have been reports of at least one home that we know of that took a direct hit. We actually spoke briefly earlier to the woman who was living there. And she is miraculously, perhaps, alive. She was in her shelter. But, certainly, I would say, a definite uptick in the town here in Ashkelon. Again, this is a city that is not a stranger to rocket attacks. There are shelters all over. There's shelters on every floor of this hotel, but people here say that they haven't seen anything approaching this level in terms of the ferocity, the volume, and the continuous nature.

He's an international spokesperson for the Israeli Defense Forces. Colonel, so we just got this report from the IDF from Kfar Aza that women, children, elderly were -- quote -- \"butchered\" over the weekend in this kibbutz in the south. We have certainly seen plenty of butchery in other locations as well. Can you just talk about what you think the significance of what you understand IDF forces have seen in Kfar Aza? LT. COL. JONATHAN CONRICUS, INTERNATIONAL SPOKESPERSON, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES:  The scenes in Kfar Aza, what up until a few days ago was a peaceful society, many of the residents who live there believed in peace, coexistence, and mutual respect and had friends in Gaza. I know that, personally, I know many people in Kfar Aza who had friends in Gaza. And the butchering and the executions -- and I don't want to confirm yet. There are many reports out there about beheadings. At this stage, I cannot confirm that, but I know of atrocities in Kfar Aza, in Be'eri, and in many, many other communities, things that are -- that are hard to imagine. What -- we have seen that. And the reports that are coming up from Israeli soldiers that are clearing communities are unimaginable. It's like things that you would see in a zombie movie or that you would see on online snuff terror movies distributed by ISIS. There's no comparison. It is unimaginable, the cruelty of just families being executed, children mutilated. It is horrendous.",

And the Israeli troops were able to kill them swiftly. I'm not aware of any civilian or Israeli casualties in that event. This tells us that it is still a combat zone, as unimaginable as this is to say, but Southern Israel is still unfortunately a live combat zone. Today, when international correspondents, CNN included, were granted access to those areas, it was like a combat embed. It wasn't taking the international media to a community in Israel. It was like taking the international media to see a combat zone. And we had to have security and armored vehicles, and the journalists had to wear their protective gear because it is an active combat zone, even in an area where there are so many troops. So, it is a situation that we definitely did not imagine before. We are coming to terms with the situation. And as I think your reporters have also said, the resolve is high and the level of commitment of the public in general, general sentiment, but, most importantly, of soldiers, of reserve soldiers and the regular soldiers, is very high. As we see the atrocities, it saddens and tears our hearts, but it also serves to galvanize our spirit and our focus on what needs to be done against this monstrous terror that we have on our doorstep.",

So, M.J., talk to us about what you have learned regarding the call and what we're anticipating will be Biden's message during these remarks. M.J. LEE, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Boris, we are told by officials that we should expect President Biden to address a couple of things here. First and foremost -- and this is no surprise -- we should expect President Biden to reiterate the U.S.' support for Israel, both the government of Israel and the people of Israel, and that the U.S. is willing and ready to provide whatever resources and tools the country needs to get through the next couple of weeks. We also expect that the president will address the hostage situation unfolding over there. Of course, this comes as officials have made very clear that they are sort of accepting the very real possibility that Americans could be among the hostages that have been taken into Gaza. But this is a very, very precarious and complicated situation, where they really, really can't at this moment in time give us even a number, an estimate as to how many hostages might have been taken and certainly the conditions of those people that are inside Gaza right now. We also are told by officials that there should be a message from the president broadly to the Jewish community. Obviously goes without saying that the events over the weekend and the scenes that are coming out of Israel, they have been deeply upsetting and traumatizing for everyone, but particularly this community. Now, Boris, as for the situation the ground and just the questions of what actions Israel might take next, we are told this by one official: \"We are not urging restraint right now.\" I think that really just goes to capture just how unique and shocking and just the complexity of this, the attack that we saw over the weekend that the president right now at this moment in time feels like it is wholly inappropriate for him when he is talking about the situation to urge kind of -- any kind of restraint to Israel. Now, as you mentioned., we did just get word from the White House that President Biden wrapped up his phone call with Prime Minister Netanyahu. This is the third time that we know of that the two men have spoken since the attacks began on Saturday. And, of course, while we don't have a full readout, we fully expect that the president reiterated the U.S.' support for Israel. And I can tell you, just based on information that we have about their prior phone call on Saturday, we are told, when -- that Prime Minister Netanyahu brought up the possibility of a ground incursion into Gaza, again, the president privately in this phone call did not urge restraint. So, again, all of this just goes to capture what U.S. officials here are navigating and the shocking sort of wide breadth of the attack that we are told both Israeli officials and U.S. officials were really caught off guard by.",
