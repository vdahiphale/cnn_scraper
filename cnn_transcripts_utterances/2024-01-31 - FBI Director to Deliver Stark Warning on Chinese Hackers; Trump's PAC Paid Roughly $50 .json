That message coming from the FBI Director Christopher Wray, who will testify on Capitol Hill very shortly. He plans to tell lawmakers that Chinese government hackers are positioning themselves to target water treatment plants, the electrical grid and transportation systems. CNN's Cybersecurity Reporter Sean Lyngaas is with us now with the very latest on this. What do we expect today, Sean?",

It's been going on for several months, over a year now, where in my over a decade covering cybersecurity, this is the most frank and public warnings from the National Security Agency, the FBI, and others about how Chinese hackers are pre-positioning, what they call pre- positioning in critical infrastructure, gaining a foothold, not using that access to these sensitive networks now, but lurking in the time of a crisis, like in the event of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. The thinking among U.S. national security officials that the hackers could use this access to potentially disrupt the U.S. military's response.And so the U.S. government sees this as an escalation, frankly, and it comes at a time in a very tense relation between U.S. and China. They've tried to ease those tensions. My colleagues and I reported yesterday that Xi -- President Xi Jinping told Joe Biden last year that he had no intention of interfering in the U.S. election this year, which is the fact that needed to be said is startling, frankly, and U.S. officials are looking to hold them to that. But today on Capitol Hill, we're going to see more detail than we've previously seen on why senior U.S. security officials are concerned about the Chinese access to these critical systems in places like Guam, the U.S.-specific territory that the U.S. uses to project power in the Pacific.

If the Chinese or any adversary can establish themselves in our critical infrastructure, they could do things like turn off our ability to communicate, turn off our access to the internet, which provides us control over numerous military and defensive resources. They can hamper societal and economic interaction with, in terms of financial trading, in terms of the delivery of goods and services. We all remember how negatively we're impacted by supply chain disruptions after the -- after the pandemic. This would be that on 100-fold level.

They were interested in targeting our -- our private sector to steal research and, you know, technology and things that information and data that could help them bolster their economy.This is fundamentally different. This is hacking for military and intelligence advantage in a conflict. So in terms of what we can do, there's really two main target audiences here. The first is the private sector, the private sector in this country, unlike China, the private sector is in control of our national cyber infrastructure. These are, you know, assets of companies and things like that. And the director and Government writ large is trying to get the attention of private sector, particularly critical infrastructure entities to get on board with updating and securing their systems that is really the on the ground way to defend from this sort of -- this sort of attack. And the second audience is, as you mentioned, Congress. Congress' role is to address these issues in a real and factual way, and to start providing the resources to places like the FBI and NSA. But even more importantly, the cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency, otherwise known as CISA. They are really on the front line of working with our critical infrastructure partners to try to strengthen the systems that are critical to U.S. society in general.",

This morning, how expensive is it to be Donald Trump, $50 million. Sources say that's roughly how much his PAC paid in 2023 for legal bills. Today, we're going to find out the exact some where the new filing from the to the Federal Election Commission. CNN's Alayna Treene is in Washington with the latest on this. That's a lot of money?",

First of all, big picture, this ruling could determine the future of Donald Trump's business in New York and elsewhere, although to an extent that future has already been determined, because it's really important to keep in mind, Judge Engoron actually ruled on one of the causes of action before this trial even started. He found the Trump Organization liable for repeated fraud. And he said I intend to suspend their business certificate, which would end their business -- ability to do business in New York state.So I'm looking for a couple things. First of all, there are six additional causes of action relating to insurance fraud, falsifying business records. Will the judge find the Trump Organization liable or not liable for those? Second of all, what will the number be? As you just said, the A.G. is now asking for a mammoth amount $370 million, the judge can give anywhere from zero to $370 million. And then finally, will the judge reaffirm that, yes, I intend to suspend their business certificates. Important to note, whatever the judge does today will be subject to appeal.",

President Biden told me yesterday he has made up his mind and we know he and his team have been meeting behind closed doors crafting this response with National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby yesterday said that it could include multi-layers to it and also potentially could be carried out over a period of time and come in multiple formats. But one thing that the President has also been trying to make clear as he is crafting this U.S. response to this attack is that he's also keeping in mind the families of those three American service members. The President spoke by phone with each of the families yesterday, that includes Sergeant William Rivers, Specialist Kennedy Sanders and Specialist Breonna Moffett, all of Georgia. It's worth noting the U.S. Army Reserve actually posthumously promoted Moffett and Sanders to the rank of sergeant after their death. And that is something President Biden shared himself in a phone call with a family of Kennedy Sanders yesterday. Take a listen.

OK, lay out your weapons, have a full inspection, put everybody online, open up your headquarters, fly some drones over and then see what's going on there.
