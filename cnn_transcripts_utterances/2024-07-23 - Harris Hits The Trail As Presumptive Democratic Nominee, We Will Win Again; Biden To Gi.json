And Donald Trump is testing lines of attack against Harris and sending mixed messages about debating her saying he wants to, but he hasn't agreed to anything specific yet.

I also think, though, it can draw a contrast between people who have been involved in the criminal justice system. One out of three people know someone in America that has been a part of the criminal justice system. One out of five people in America have actually interacted with the criminal justice system. Those individuals don't get immunity like Donald Trump is getting from the Supreme Court. Those individuals don't get to skip their sentencing day, which happened on July 11th. Those individuals don't have the system actually work the same way as Donald Trump.And so there are multiple contrasts that Kamala Harris can draw between her and Donald Trump and the American people and how they don't have the same lived experience as Donald Trump.",

Let's get reaction from former Biden adviser and United Nations Ambassador Susan Rice. Ambassador, thanks so much for joining us. The numbers are impressive. As I've been mentioning, the Harris campaign has raised now more than $100 million in campaign contributions, signed up almost 60,000 campaign volunteers just in the past few days. Van Jones, our analyst, says he's seeing 2008 vibes. And you know what I mean by that. Do you agree? What do you make of this enthusiasm we're seeing for her now? SUSAN RICE, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE U.N.: I think there's an enormous amount of energy and excitement out there. Kamala Harris is really about the future and people feel that they're grateful to Joe Biden for having been an incredibly successful and effective president and a selfless patriot in his decision to pass the torch. And in Kamala Harris, they see somebody who will prosecute the case against Donald Trump, provide a really compelling vision for the future of this country, where our democracy is revitalized and everybody has a fair shot.

You didn't get there on merit. You got there because you got some unfair advantage. That is incredibly insulting to the vast majority of Americans who fall into all of those categories.And it's worse than that, Wolf. What this is, is emblematic of what this race is really all about. It's a race about whether we are going to move into the future as a democracy, where every American has the opportunity to vote, to have their voice heard, to have a chance to make themselves a success, or whether we're going backward, to Donald Trump and J.D. Vance and their Project 2025 vision of an America where women don't control their own bodies, they can't get contraception or in vitro fertilization, to an America where we don't educate our children in public schools that are sufficiently funded because we don't want them to have opportunity. That's 19th century, where the only people who mattered were, frankly, white Christian men. And that's what they're saying with this DEI thing, that if you're somebody who is not a white Christian man, then you didn't get where you got because you deserved it.

The four presidents before him didn't have anything in terms of national security or governing experience on the level of Kamala Harris. So, you speak to that, you ignore the haters who want to divide us and use fear and hate as their tool.

But if you talk to people on his, they believe that she is lacking in what they call name education, meaning that people don't know much about Kamala Harris other than that she is the vice president.So, what they plan to do is fill this void as quickly as they can, because, obviously, Harris is going to want to define herself as well in the same timeframe, with negative information. That includes not just linking her to Joe Biden and his current policies, particularly around inflation, crime and immigration, but also shedding light on what they believe to be poor policies that were enacted while she was in San Francisco as a district attorney, as a prosecutor. And Donald Trump himself, on a call with reporters earlier today, outlined some of that strategy. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But, really, the thing to break down here is the fact that, yes, the campaign says that they had been preparing for this, that they knew that this was a possibility, that Joe Biden would not be at the top of the ticket, and that they had always been focused on it being Harris.The one thing to point out when I talk to some of these Trump allies is that they don't really know and they acknowledge that this could put us in uncharted territory. There could be an enthusiasm behind Harris that just wasn't there for President Joe Biden. They are still waiting to see how this is going to play out, but interestingly, Wolf, Tony Fabrizio, the lead pollster for the campaign, put out a memo today, sent it out to all reporters. It was a public memo that said that Harris was going to have a Harris honeymoon, essentially setting expectations for polling saying that she was likely to have a bump that could make her be on par with Donald Trump or even ahead of him in certain polls. So, clearly, they're, again, trying to temper some of those expectations, Wolf.",
