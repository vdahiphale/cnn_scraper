David Chalian is at the Magic Wall to take us behind the numbers.Plus, Kamala Harris is zeroing in on Donald Trump's role in overturning Roe v. Wade. It is a central part of her closing message. I will talk to a couple forced to leave their home state of Texas to end what doctors told them was a non-viable pregnancy. And $120 million and counting. Elon Musk is pouring an eyepopping amount of money into his push to elect Donald Trump. We have new details on what he's doing and what he likely wants out of it. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. We start deep in the heart of Texas, where both Kamala Harris and Donald Trump will be today. They're campaigning in that reliably red state. It may sound bit odd because there are, again, only 11 days left in one of the tightest races in history. But to be clear, Texas is not up for grabs on the presidential level. It is the epicenter of two issues, each campaign wants to highlight in his and her closing messages that is abortion and immigration. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE U.S., (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The idea that someone who survives a crime of a violation to their body would be told they don't have the authority to make a decision about what happens to their body next. That is immoral. DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We're a dumping ground. We're like a -- we're like a garbage can for the world. That's what's happened. That's what's happened to -- we're like a garbage can. (END VIDEO CLIP) BASH: First up, CNN's David Chalian is right there at the wall, which only means one thing. There is a new exclusive poll.

      "sentences": "Our final national poll of this 2024 race. And what does it show in this stable race, a tied race. Dead heat among likely voters, 47 percent Harris, 47 percent Trump. It obviously doesn't get closer to that. And I want to show you what this race has looked like over time. It has been remarkably stable. This goes all the way back to when Joe Biden was still running in August of last year.You saw it was a 47, 46 race there. You see here the red line, the Donald Trump line. He's never been behind, outside the margin of error statistically trailing in this race. The entire time that we have pulled this race. Let's look at it by party ID here, Dana. You see, overwhelmingly Democrats are with Harris. As you would expect, overwhelmingly down here, 92 percent of Republicans are with Trump. Harris is getting about 7 percent of Republicans. I know she's making a big play for some of those Trump resistant Republicans of late we've seen. And look at the independents. It's actually within the margin of error of that sub-group. So, there's no real clear leader with independents, but numerically, Harris has this slight higher number there. And we've been talking a lot about the gender gap in this race. It's a little smaller in our poll overall than we've seen in some other polling. But among likely voters, Harris is plus six, 50 percent to 44 percent with women, and Donald Trump is plus six, equally 51 percent to 45 percent with men. That is a 12-point gender gap.",

And as of this morning, nearly 33 million Americans have already voted, including nearly 10 million in those seven states.Joining me now at the table is Jackie Kucinich of The Boston Globe, Cleve Wootson of The Washington Post, and poof, here he is, David Chalian, and made his way from the magic.

Now, they're both in Texas. Harris is going to be talking about abortion. She's talking a lot about democracy. Trump is talking about immigration. He talks a lot about the economy. And when we've been in the states, talking to voters, talking to who haven't cast their votes yet, not one of those 33 million people.

Like that, that makes you a less attractive candidate.We see it about his demeanor and temperament. We see it about his age. These are negatives on Trump, and it answers the question, well, you know, why isn't given everything we just said about the environment that Harris is running? Why isn't Trump running away with it? Abortion is one answer. But Donald Trump's behavior is clearly another part of this equation, as are his criminal convictions. These things got so discounted a lot in the Republican primary, and they get discounted sometimes in our mind, because it's like -- but the whole Republican Party is still unified around him. But the total -- and he's more popular than ever. All those things are true, but they are still weights around him because I think without them, Donald Trump may be running away with everything --",

It's about the data analytics, meaning they really, sort of, you know, know down to a granular level, who it is that they are still trying to persuade.Not just get out and vote who are already convinced but persuade to vote for her. And this is one -- well, these are the two issues, but just staying on the Trump is unhinged is one of the big issues.

Maybe not worry so much about the persuadable voters, because if they're going to vote for him, they are, and if they're not, they're not.
