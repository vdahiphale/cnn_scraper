I'm Jake Tapper in Washington, D.C. And this is THE LEAD. This hour I'm joined by my colleague, Kaitlan Collins, who's down there outside the Fulton County jail.We expect Mr. Trump to surrender at 07:30 p.m. Eastern. That's what he announced he would do anyway. His motorcade arrived at the Newark, New Jersey airport in the last hour for his private flight down to Atlanta. A number of Trump co-defendants also surrendered today, including former White House Chief of Staff and former North Carolina Congressman Mark Meadows. And the first trial date in the court has been set. Pro-Trump lawyer Ken Chesebro, who is the alleged architect of the fake elector's plot we're told, Chesebro is set to go on trial October 23. His team asked for a speedy trial, which is his right in Georgia, although Donald Trump's lawyers opposed the speedy trial. Kaitlan, you're down there in Georgia outside the jail, Fulton County. What is the environment like there? Are there a lot of supporters of the former president?",

They are now here. Of course, we're outside the Fulton County Jail.Jake, for those who don't know, this is a notorious jail. I mean, there have been so many issues with this, whether it comes to actually crumbling walls, faulty air conditioning, bad plumbing. I mean, there have been sheriffs who have said it's a humanitarian crisis, basically, what's happening inside that. The Justice Department has opened investigations into it. That is going to be the environment that Donald Trump is walking into. And the reason I say that is because after he turned himself in at the courthouse in Washington, D.C. just a few weeks ago, Jake, I had heard from sources that he was in this irritated mood leaving because it was kind of this process of being taken into a parking garage, being processed, having this lengthy process where then he was complaining about the conditions of Washington, D.C. Now he is going to be entering a much different environment from accounts of those who have been inside when he goes inside the Fulton County jail. And, of course, one question still remains is whether or not we are going to see his mug shot. We saw Mark Meadows' mug shot earlier. We've seen Rudy Giuliani's, Sidney Powell's. As of this morning, Trump's team said it was still unclear that it was definitely happening, though that does seem to be the case that there is going to be one, Jake.",

He's innocent until proven guilty, right? There's all these presumptions out there.

He tried to get other people in politics to, you know, go back, recount the votes. What was it? What did you learn in that investigation about Georgia that you think is app -- is fits the bill as we watch what happens today? TEMIDAYO AGANGA-WILLIAMS, FORMER JAN 6. COMMITTEE LAWYER: So former President Trump tried to overturn the results, you know, in a lot of swing states. But he did have a particular, as I've said, an obsession with Georgia. He talked about the dead voters. He couldn't stop talking about claiming there were 5,000 dead voters when there, I think investigators found four. He was obsessed with the suitcase full of ballots in Fulton County. And he took a particular focus on two women, Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, two black women in Fulton County who were poll workers, something that's honorable or truly a noble task. And they were both witnesses before the Select Committee. And I think seeing him today, having to answer for what he did in Fulton County, I think they were victim -- how they were victimized is an especially good example of the impact of what he did. He focused on them. He claimed that they were part of this ballot scheme when the entire time he was the one who was running the scheme. And I think what's especially, I think poetic as someone who actually grew up in Fulton County is to see now a black DA, Fani Willis, now holding former President Trump accountable for what he did, not only to the residents of Georgia, but specifically to those two black women in Fulton County.

If he is convicted of any of these felonies, to me, it is a metaphysical certainty that he cannot and will not be elected President of the United States. He's highly unlikely to be elected anyway. This would seal it, in my opinion.

And, you know, he had a very, very sharp tweet or post about Fani Willis today. I did this podcast with Sally Yates this week. And she said, listen, we have never had a case like this where a candidate for President of the United States was under indictment, and judges are going to give him more runway than they would normally give. It's also harder to enforce. They're not going to put Donald Trump in jail. So, you know, he's going to take full advantage of this.
