So I don't know what the situation is there, but I am in Englewood, and some of the homes that were flooded, you can see in the live shot I have up, a lot of debris spread around.

As the sun is coming up now, first responders are able to get a clear look at the scope of the damage.Crews on the west coast of Florida are conducting water rescues to get people to safety. On the east coast of the states, search and rescue teams are sifting through tornado debris. And this just in from the east coast of Florida, officials in St. Lucie County say at least four people have been killed, four people dead at least, after several tornadoes were confirmed to have touched down. I spoke last hour with the sheriff there who said an entire mobile home park, an entire mobile home community was just flattened. Let's go to Victor Blackwell. He's standing by in Orlando this morning. And Victor, there's a lot of moving parts here as we're starting to get an assessment from various parts of the state of what people are dealing with today.",

Of course, we've also had that headline of the power outages, more than 3 million customers out. I just went not too far from here in the last hour I've had, and I walked out on 435 and 535, and I saw that there was a 7-Eleven with metal. I tweeted out the photograph and sent it in. There's some wind damage there with metal panels kind of strewn around. There are sheriff's officers, deputies, who are blocking down branches and large branches, not the whole tree here in the Lake Buena Vista area.We also just saw some video from the Orange County fire department, fire rescue, showing the video of that attempted water rescue about 4:40 a.m. here in Orange County where the water was up to their chest. They were going into this mobile home community trying to rescue people, but those people decided that they wanted to stay. so they stayed in their homes. We're going to see more of the reports of localized flooding around Orange County because that really is the story for the center part of the state. As it relates to the power outages, we're closing in on 100,000 here in Orange County, which is really not a majority of the county serviced. Next door in Lake County and in Polk County, in each of those counties, more than half of the customers are without power. You go west to Brevard County, there's - east of Brevard County, I should say, there's a report of a tornado, one of three dozen tornadoes along the eastern coast of Florida. Thats in Cocoa Beach. Still waiting for todays from the police there on the damage caused by that. But yes, as the sun is now up and people are seeing what's around them, and the first responders able to get out with the winds down and the sunup to give them a look, we're going to start to get the full scope of the damage of hurricane Milton overnight.",

Tampa got roughly four to six months worth of rain in about a day, and you can imagine that for officials trying to get to folks that might be calling for help, that in itself is a challenge. On top of that, you have a storm surge that was coming in, and further, the wind that knocked over a ton of debris, and there was debris leftover from hurricane Helene that also created obstacles for officials. As we were getting to this area now from Tampa, we saw widespread flooding.Fortunately, most of it did not seem to be going into homes that we saw. But of course, these are the areas that we can access right now. It's not what officials have shut off so they can get to people that need help.",

You can see it on this radar estimate, that's where over ten inches of rain has fallen. And we heard from Isabel's great reporting about the water rescues that are taking place in Hillsborough County, and then into the Clearwater area right now. Clearwater Beach saw 14 inches. St. Petersburg, 18 inches. There was nine inches of that rain in St. Petersburg that fell in a three-hour period. So you can imagine just how much ponding and flooding that caused. So here it is, the eye of the storm still pulling away from the space coast. But it's wrapping in that rainfall. So there are still active flashflood warnings in place in and around Daytona Beach. And with that onshore push, three to five feet of storm surge still an issue for our coastal communities before this system is said and done and pulls completely away. These are the record -- or rather the storm surge totals, the highest totals that we saw. Venice Beach, just a little over five feet, Fort Myers, 5.27 feet and into Naples, roughly just over five feet. And of course, that's not as high as what Ian brought in 2022, but still a significant amount of surge that will obviously leave some homes and businesses with water damage this morning. Wind gusts over 100 miles per hour right where the storm made landfall. Again, just near Siesta Key. And this has knocked down over 3 million customers across the state of Florida without power right now. And we know that these approaching hurricanes are prolific tornado makers. While this was just one example of one of the tornadoes that dropped from the sky, and this is on the east coast of Florida. So this is coming out of the Palm Beach County region. And that is a significant destructive tornado. You can see it lighting up the sky, breaking down transformers. This is incredible. John, there were the record number of tornado warnings that were issued in one day's time across the state of Florida yesterday. That was just one of them.
