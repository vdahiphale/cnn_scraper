      "sentences": "Good evening. Today in his New York civil fraud trial, knowingly or not, the former president swung a wrecking ball at a pillar of his defense, namely that he left the question of how much pieces of his business empire worth to the accountants or in the words of his codefendant son, Eric, \"I pour concrete. I don't focus on appraisals.\"Well, today from the witness stand in between attacks on the judge in New -- and the New York Attorney General Letitia James, his own words suggested the opposite, that he was involved. These are appraisals, you'll remember, contained in financial statements that the judge has already ruled were fraudulent. \"I would look at them,\" the former president said on the stand, \"I would see them, and I would maybe, on, occasion have some suggestions,\" which is what the state of New York is claiming that the appraisals were inflated on his behalf and at his behest. In testifying about loan agreements with Deutsche Bank, he went beyond even those already court determined inflated appraisals saying, quote, \"The net worth of me was far greater than the financial statements.\" The former president also admitted involvement in lowering valuations in the case of his Trump Tower apartment around the same time that Forbes Magazine outed him for claiming it was nearly three times larger than it actually is. The question, \"This change in valuation came at your direction?\" His answer, \"Probably, I said I thought it was too high.\"   He also seemed to have trouble with timelines, at one point testifying that a loan for a Chicago property was, quote, \"long since gone,\" only be reminded it was paid off last week or suggesting he was still president through 2021, even though he left office in January of that year. Beyond all of that though, his demeanor at one point prompting this from Judge Engoron to Defense Attorney Christopher Kise. \"I beseech you to control him, if you can,\" the judge said. \"If you can't, I will. I will excuse him and draw every negative inference that I can. Do you understand that?\" It was that kind of a day. CNN Kara Scannell watched it all happen. She joins us now from outside the courthouse in Lower Manhattan. So tell more about what you saw.",

He did answer some of these questions substantively, including acknowledging that he did look at these financial statements, that he did, on occasion, make suggestions for values and correcting, as you said, the value for Trump Tower, calling it a mistake.Now, the judge had -- and I should also mention that he -- you know, in addition to placing blame on the accountants, they're saying it was their responsibility, he also acknowledged that these statements went to the bank and he certified that these statements were accurate, but he tried to downplay that, too, saying that the banks did their own digging into the numbers and that it didn't matter. They didn't really rely on them. This will all be up for the judge to ultimately decide. But many of Trump's answers today were long-winded. He was going off on tangents. And the judge from the start, trying to set the tone here, telling Trump right out of the gate that he wanted answers, not speeches. And then he said to Trump's attorney, \"If you can't rein him in, I will,\" and threatened to move him and remove him from the stand. Now the one point where Trump got the most heated, and he showed some anger, he was losing patience, he raised his voice, was when the attorney general's office had asked him about their main claim in this case that his financial statements were fraudulent and they were misleading, that is where we saw Trump the most expressive. And he got upset at that point saying that, as he put it to the judge, \"He called me a fraud and he didn't know anything about me,\" and calling the New York attorney general a political hack -- Anderson.",

They wanted the judge to give them some direction in how to do it without tripping the gag order.

The judge then relented and said that they could make it. They could make it in writing so as not to violate the gag order, in a sense. And he said he will make a decision on that quickly.

And, of course, if you're that involved in the preparation to review statements, then, of course, you could also be giving direction that the values should be increased, which is really the primary allegation here. So I think that that was an important concession that he may not have realized he was making. He also acknowledged sort of being aware that some of the loan documents that required his personal guarantee were likely -- that that was significant which, of course, goes to the question of materiality, which the judge has to find here.

Let's just start with tomorrow, because that new poll showed Biden is weak, and it showed he's bleeding his coalition.So tomorrow in Virginia, in Ohio, and elsewhere, we're going to look at the results and see if there are more clues about 2024. In Virginia, we'll look here in the Northern Virginia suburbs, down here in the Richmond suburbs. Can Governor Youngkin bring swing voters back to Republicans? That poll suggests, now let me pop out. This is the 2020 map, right? What does that poll show? That poll showed, watch. These were blue in 2020. Michigan and Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona, and Nevada. That poll showed, right now, all six states won by Joe Biden in 2020. He is either trailing or in a dead heat with Donald Trump. Why, Anderson? That's why it's so interesting. Let me go deep into the poll. The horse race numbers are one thing, but it's underneath the poll that shows the president. The incumbent president is in deep trouble. Donald Trump beats him in those states by 20-plus points on the economy. Donald Trump beats him by more than 10 points on immigration. The president says Donald Trump is a threat to democracy. They run almost even on that issue. The president with just a narrow edge. So on the issues, Trump. And then, look, the president simply, Anderson, right now, is bleeding from the Democratic coalition. He won young voters by a lopsided margin. They're tied. Voters 18 to 29. He won more than nine in 10 black votes in 2020. Only 71 percent in those states in this poll. The Latino vote Trump did make some progress in 2020, but he's making even more now. So if you look at this, if the president can't fix this, he has a year, but if he cannot fix the bleeding of his coalition, this is the 2020 map. What happens if he doesn't fix it, Anderson? Is that. And the Republicans win.",
