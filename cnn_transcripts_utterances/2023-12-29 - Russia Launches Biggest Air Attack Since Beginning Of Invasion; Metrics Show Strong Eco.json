And we do know that the National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan is here on Saint Croix with the president.Jake Sullivan spoke to the Polish secretary of state today to discuss this incident, a report involving a missile that entered Polish airspace. So certainly the president has sort of the apparatus around him. But when it comes to passing more money, I think this is really a matter that he's leaving to members of Congress. Because it is so tied up in those immigration talks, White House officials have been involved in those talks. The president says he's willing to make significant concessions. That is concerning certainly some progressives when it comes to new rules for the border. But certainly his big objective is getting this new aid passed and I think this will help him in some ways to underscore the stakes of that assistance going forward.",

And yet, voters still say the economy is in bad shape. In a recent poll, 78 percent say it's poor or just fair.So we want to get a reality check now from CNN Business Reporter Matt Egan.

Despite all the gloom and doom, despite all the political turmoil, despite all the war, this economy just keeps chugging along.And that is a big reason why the stock market has been on fire. S&amp;P 500 up about 25 percent so far this year. The NASDAQ is on pace for its best year since 2003. Jobs are plentiful. Unemployment rate below 4 percent for 22 months in a row and the rate of inflation has cooled dramatically and gas prices are down to below $3 a gallon in 28 states. A year ago, few people would have predicted. Any of those developments, let alone all of them. But here we are. Now one way to look at how the economy impacts people is something called the misery index. This is calculated by adding the unemployment rate and the inflation rate. The higher the number, the more miserable the voter. And what's interesting is that under President Biden, the misery index is actually quite low compared with other presidents at this point in their first term. Look at that.",

Of course, then COVID happened a few months later, turned the whole world upside down.So, Dana, this is a metric that if the trend continues, it bodes pretty well for President Biden.",

The Jordan Commission in the 80s basically was oriented toward trying to damp down the level of immigration, of having an E-Verify system so employers couldn't employ illegal immigrants.And there was a sense that, you know, high levels of immigration basically constrict and constrain the low wage labor market and undercut unionization. But that really disappeared in the late 90s and now in the 21st century. We see Democrats identified with not exactly open borders, but pretty porous borders and a sort of lack of concern as it were with border security. And we see this during Biden's -- Biden administration campaign. And we also see it.
