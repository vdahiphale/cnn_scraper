JOHN BERMAN, CNN NEWS CENTRAL CO-ANCHOR:  Major development in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease in the United States. In the next few months, the FDA could approve a second drug to slow the progression of the disease. The pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly says it has completed submission to the FDA and expects action by the end of the year. As everyone knows, Alzheimer's erodes memory and thinking and eventually leaves a person unable to perform basic taxes. It affects an estimated 6.7 million Americans over the age of 75. CNN's Meg Tirrell joins us now. So, this would be the second drug to hit the market, Meg. Talk to us about it.",

And we remember the first drug called Leqembi just got approved at the beginning of this month, full approval from the FDA. So, really, we're starting to see this momentum build. This would be the first drugs and -- the first one is the first drug to actually slow the course of Alzheimer's disease.And we're seeing that the second medicine, which is called donanemab, it does not have yet a brand name, it's made by Eli Lilly, it also slows the course of the disease. In the trial, it slowed the progression, you know, loss of memory, the ability to think clearly slowed and do daily tasks, it slowed that down by 35 percent. And if you put that a different way, it was really gaining, you know, four to seven months over a placebo across an 18-month trial. Now, this does not stop the disease. It does not reverse the losses in memory but at least is slows it down, and that is a start. It does come with some risks though. The main things that doctors look out for are things like brain bleeds and brain swelling. They did see that in a percentage of the patients in the trial. And most concerningly, they did see three deaths in the trial among patients on the medicine. And so, this is something that patients will have to weigh with their doctors the risks here, but this is showing some progress finally in this disease, John.",

And researchers say this is really important information to have, both for planning and, sort of, allocation of resources. They say the reasons those counties maybe hit harder than others is a higher percentage of older people living there, and also black and Hispanic folks living those counties where we do see a higher prevalence of Alzheimer's, John.",

Police say, the kids, their mother, and grandmother were all swept away as raging floodwaters began to take over that car there. The grandmother, however, survived. The mother, sadly, did not.In the south, intense life-threatening heat is lingering. Right now, 80 million people across 12 states are on alert for dangerous heat. From Florida to Texas to Mercury could climb to 115 degrees. And these extremes are happening globally as well. CNN's Bill Weir joining me now. You have warned us about this for years.

There's only been 11 days, like, over 110 in Beijing over the past since the '50s and half of those were in the last couple of weeks.So, this is happening everywhere. And the reason we haven't noticed it as, sort of, starkly as now is thanks to the oceans. The oceans have been covering up as it would absorb 90 percent of manmade climate change heat.

We're talking about Monica De Leon Barba. She is a profoundly talented photographer from the San Francisco Bay area. She's born in Jalisco, the state in Mexico but she is an American citizen. And she goes to the idyllic beautiful small City of Tepatitlan last summer. Filled with gothic neoclassical cathedrals to share her photographic talent, to take on a summer job, take on some new projects. But we fast forward to Thanksgiving of last year, a couple of days after Thanksgiving, security footage shows her walking her dog in the middle of the street. And then eventually, what you'll see in one of the corners of the security camera image, she's walking her dog and she's abducted by not one, three cars. No fewer than five people. You see, those are some of the last frames of her seen before her abduction. And she isn't seen for close to eight months. What adds in element of apprehension and, sort of, certainly a more unsettling and sinister characteristic to this case is that her captors reached out to her family, tried to negotiate a ransom, and the FBI says, this is not random, this was targeted and intentional. Monica was the target here. Then we move to this weekend, Kate, the FBI comes out with a statement, saying that she has been released. The leader of the FBI in San Francisco writing in part, \"Our relief and joy at the safe return of Monica is profound. The FBI investigation is far from over, but we can now work this case knowing that an innocent victim is returned, reunited with her family.\" So, that statement leads to a couple of things. First of all, there have been no arrests yet, as you mentioned at the top. The FBI, as we speak, is now working on trying to identify just who abducted her and why. That still is unclear at the moment. But I think, the most important thread line of this case here wrapping up is that she's been reunited with her family in the peninsula area of the San Francisco Bay this weekend. And reunited with her beautiful husky, the same dog she was walking when she was abducted in November. For all of us dog lovers there, that, you know, sense of palpable joy certainly felt across California and across the country. For all of us who are wondering where she was, what happened to her, the best possible outcome reporting here from California this morning, Kate.",
