One is that this field is getting increasingly crowded. That could help Trump. At least that's the conventional wisdom and it makes sense.But I think what you're seeing, Christie has a much harder path because the party has changed so much just since the 2016 campaign. The core of the Republican Party, the base, moving much farther to the right, being much more targeted towards the working class, the anti- elite, the anti-college, the anti-business to some extent, the anti- Chamber of Commerce, the anti-globalist. Chris Christie, a coastal governor. He's an institutionalist. Remember, he was once a U.S. attorney and he believes in American business. So, it's a harder path. But I think if you look at both what Christie and Governor DeSantis are doing, they are both pledging to punch and counterpunch Donald Trump. They're doing it in really different ways. Christie wants to be talking to what he calls an exhausted majority. He's talking about not just Republicans, but independents and maybe some conservative Democrats. Ron DeSantis is aiming to right of Donald Trump, trying to push the party further to the right, trying to say Trump is too woke, look at some of his policies on, you know, criminal prison reform and criminal justice policies. So, they're really, really different approaches to punching Trump, but at least now we're seeing a couple of brand name contenders in the GOP primary saying they're not going to shy away from attacking the former president.",

You know, you're seeing Tim Scott, also new to the race, talk about he wants to have an optimistic campaign. Chris Christie wants it to be a joyful campaign. But who are the voters you're trying to bring in? Are you trying to tell people who actually are now independents, hey, switch back to the Republican Party to vote in your state's primary? Are you trying to reactivate a nascent part of people who are still registered as Republicans but are like I don't - I don't really know what's going on here, and say there's still a home for you? Those seem to be the two lanes. If you're going to tie Trump to Vladimir Putin, if you're going to say that - if you're going to focus on January 6th and trying to overturn, you know, a democratically elected election, that is not a brand that's synonymous with an appeal to the base.But Christie's bet, I think, is that there are actually still a lot of Republicans or voters who lean Republican who are more attracted to his message but they need an alternative to rally around.

And in many cases it's frozen on the surface of moons, but then it's liquefied inside because the moons are stressed by the tidal forces of the main planet and other moons. And it's like when you hit a racquetball. They say, let's warm up the ball. You're literally warming up the ball by stressing it and popping it back into shape. That's what's happening with the moons in the outer solar system, which renders what would otherwise be frozen water liquid.
