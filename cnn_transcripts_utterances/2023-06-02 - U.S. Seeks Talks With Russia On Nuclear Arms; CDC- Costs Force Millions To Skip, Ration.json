They're also saying they think that multilateral engagement with all of those side countries that have nuclear weapons could be productive. But, Jim, you'll recall the Trump administration really did try to get China to the table when they were having nuclear arms talks with Russia. So that has been something that has been tried in the past. It may be the future of where this has to go.",

The CDC says that millions of adults in the U.S. are either skipping or rationing out their prescribed meds because they cost too much or people are trying to save money.CNN senior medical correspondent, Elizabeth Cohen, is here. Elizabeth, this is a problem, right? Folks need to take all of their medicine when it says take all of the medicine. What do these latest numbers show? DR. ELIZABETH COHEN, CNN SENIOR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Jim, these latest numbers show that more than nine million Americans rationed their prescription drugs over the past year. Just as you said, it's because they didn't have enough money. Obviously if you don't take all the medicine, you can become sicker. That affects those patients and really it affects all of us, because it affects medical costs. The difficulties are mostly felt by the uninsured. If you look at people who don't have insurance, 23 percent say they have rationed their prescription medicines over the previous year. Again, hurts them, hurts all of us -- Jim?",

We can definitely say they've acted then in game one and in some style, too. The Nuggets showing no rust from nine days off. Nicola Jokic, he's the teams superstar, just dominant throughout. He had 27 points, 14 assists and 10 rebounds. That means a triple double for him while taking only 12 shots. Well, Jamal Murray also had 26 points as the Nuggets had a 21-point lead to start. The Heat trying their best to get back into it, but nothing doing. It wasn't happening for them in the end. Such would be master class really they served up their opponents. I will say that Jimmy Butler had low points, 13 points, by the way. Nuggets taking game one, 104-93. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
