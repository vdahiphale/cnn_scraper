      "sentences": "Yes, a pretty terrifying night for many in Ukraine. In Zaporizhzhia, in particular, we were kept awake a lot of the night by constant air sirens and blasts in the distance and one landed here.We believe two missiles struck this area. Miraculously, nobody hurt or injured by these blasts possibly because the first rocket landed here in front of this house where two women, Tamara and Lyudmila, were sleeping in that back building. And then a second one landed in the garden, throwing dirt up all over these two buildings. In the neighboring house, you can't see behind the wreckage here, a family with 7-year-old and a 9-year-old boys were sheltering. The first sounds of the blasts enabled them to seek cover. And here, too, Tamara and Lyudmila dived into the bath. And they, frankly, can't get their head around what's happened. They're still trying to absorb it. Emergency services working exceptionally fast to fill in the hole. But this is part of a pattern of what we've been seeing. It's pretty hard to see if there was any kind of military target and the two rockets appeared to be thinking they were aiming roughly at the same place. They landed about 10-20 meters apart from each other. But this, just as I say, forms a pattern that what we're seeing Russia doing. Many cities around Ukraine being struck with this extraordinary force. And you may, for the benefit of the doubt, think the Russians thinking they're trying to target something but the inaccuracy is now so common that this is just essential mechanized -- a mechanization of terrorizing Ukrainian civilians. But these strikes last night across the country also matched or responded to war -- at the same time, felt in part of Russia as well where Krasnodar saw an oil depot on fire possibly from the attack. Other parts of sabotage in Russia as well. A sense of these kind of explosions less targeted from what we can see publicly here in Ukraine, but quite precise from what we can see publicly from Russian officials' statements inside of Russia suggesting both sides are escalating this nightly back-and-forth of targeting infrastructure, trying to weaken the other ahead of a counteroffensive, which may already be underway or may be looming in this hot weather we're finally seeing after days of rain here. But startling damage to civilian areas and a miracle, frankly, here -- startling. The families shaken here, unable to get their head around the fact that they survived these two enormous blasts.",

That was two nights ago. Last night -- correct me if I'm wrong but I think it was less of a series of barrages. But last night across the country the alarms on -- deep concerns. And then it was Zaporizhzhia where we were shaken by we think the two or three blasts that had occurred throughout the day. A fear, I think, that as Russia feels the increasing pressure from Ukraine on the battlefield it does what it's always done, which is lash out when it can, and that's really civilian areas as it doesn't appear it has the accuracy to hit differently.",

They both have four NBA championships to their name. But this may be the last time we ever see them go head-to-head in playoff series so we should really cherish this one. And with all eyes on LeBron and Steph, Anthony Davis coming through with an incredible performance. He had 30 points and 23 rebounds in this one. In the second quarter, watch LeBron follow Steph all the way to the bench here in this moment. Steph said after the game LeBron was just joking. He had to guard him until he sat down. In the fourth, LeBron's jumper right here actually gave the Lakers a 14-point lead. LeBron had 22 in the game. But the Warriors then went on a frantic 14-0 run capped off by Steph hitting that three from way downtown to tie the game. Then in the closing seconds, the Lakers were up three. The Warriors had a last chance but Jordan Poole's three was no good. The Lakers hold on to win 117-112 to take game one. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Seattle's Yanni Gourde scored the game-winning goal in overtime to give the Kraken the hard-fought 5-4 victory. They'll play game two of that series tomorrow night on TNT.
