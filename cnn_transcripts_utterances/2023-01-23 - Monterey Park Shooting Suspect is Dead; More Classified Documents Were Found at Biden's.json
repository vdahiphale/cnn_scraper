And it's clear that Biden's attorneys have been communicating with the team for the U.S. attorney who has been handling this investigation out of Chicago, John Lausch, all before that is eventually handed over to the special counsel that the attorney general appoint, Robert Hur. Crucially here, Friday's search was not conducted with a search warrant or a subpoena. And, of course, that marks a stark contrast to the search that was conducted in August at Mar-a-Lago. That was undertaken after months of back and forth with DOJ officials and Trump's team. And it was after a subpoena and ultimately a search warrant was issued all because Trump and his team were not handing over what turned out to be national defense information, also classified material. So that's why possible obstruction has been raised as a possible offense in that case. You contrast that with Biden's team. They've made very clear that they've been working with federal authorities on this since November when some of this classified material turned up from the Penn Biden Center in Washington where President Biden had that office after his term ended as vice president. And then notably, in a statement from January 14th, the president's personal attorney said that once attorneys found classified material at Biden's Wilmington home on January 11th, they immediately contacted DOJ officials and they stopped any of their own subsequent searches and that was all until the FBI moved in on Friday. But the be sure here, the fact that classified material keeps turning up, it has really complicated things for the White House and it really does make clear that this special counsel investigation has only gotten more involved. And because of that, the big question remains, is this the only search that will happen, the one that happened on Friday, or will other locations frequented by President Biden be searched in the future?

It seems that we classify far too much material and that far too many people have security clearances. That is something that has bothered me for some time. And sometimes, I've also questioned the value of some of the classified briefings I have received over the years. Frankly, many times, I'd go into a classified briefing only to learn things that I'd already found out about in an open source or in a newspaper somewhere. So, I'm a bit concerned about how we overclassify in the United States. That said, it's inexcusable that the highest officials in our government from Hillary Clinton with her server where material ended up there and now, of course, Donald Trump, and now Joe Biden, these folks have really mishandled classified material and there are many people who are much in the lower level in government who have lost their careers and their livelihoods for much lesser infractions, it would seem.

Of course, Germany has faced criticism for not offering to transfer those Leopard 2 tanks. But Germany also crucially holds the export license for these tanks. You've heard from Polish officials saying that even if Germany refused to offer permission for Poland to transfer those tanks, they may go ahead or welcome a smaller coalition of nations to support Ukraine on that front. But now, we are hearing from German's foreign minister that they will not stand in the way of another nation, including Poland, from transferring those tanks to Ukraine. Of course, this is a significant shift. They say they haven't received a formal request just yet but, of course, the focus of today's foreign affairs council will be very much focused on the transfer of tanks and other modern armament and artillery of support that the European nations can offer to Ukraine.
