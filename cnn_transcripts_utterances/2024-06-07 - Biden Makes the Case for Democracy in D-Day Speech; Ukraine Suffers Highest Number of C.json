We're following these major developing stories and many more all coming in right here to CNN NEWS CENTRAL. It's the top of the hour and we begin with a historic and high stakes speech from President Biden as he makes the case for freedom and the future of democracy. Today, Biden stood atop the cliffs of Pointe du Hoc in Normandy, France, where 225 Rangers scaled cliffs to capture key Nazi-held positions and help turn the tide of World War II. In his remarks, Biden drew parallels comparing tyrannical threats to democracy to threats looming today. And he spoke about how those Rangers in 1944 never quit and about how they put their mission and country over self. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, look, I mean, first of all, let's be real. Joe Biden is almost certainly the last American president who will have been alive on June 6, 1944. He was just a, you know, young child at that time, born in the midst of the war. And this is a commemoration that's made, I think, extra poignant by the fact that there were something like 180 veterans in the Normandy operation who were still able to come.Five years from now, there will be very few, if any, who are able to make it. This is one of those historic things that is about to pass from living memory. There's always the risk of, you know, being - having Biden up there at a time when his age is under scrutiny in the American presidential campaign. Does it just reinforce that he's, in a way, a relic of a different era, that he is very much, and his foreign policy views are very founded by that post-war international era that, in some ways, has come to an end. But I think he's made some very strong speeches there connecting that history to how he sees the present challenges of today.",

You don't need some secret Republican sources, which is largely what that Wall Street Journal piece quoted, to tell you that Biden has visibly aged to a certain extent over the last four years. That's a very different question than the question of whether he is mentally up to the job.I've done a lot of reporting on this, of course. We're constantly checking this, talking to our sources, people who are in the room with him. There's no evidence to suggest that he has mentally, in any way, diminished. I think that his public performances have underscored that. But he is running to be reelected to another four-year term, the end of which he would be 86 years old, so it's also very much a legitimate issue. But again, it's the substance, I think, where Biden, you know, was on very strong territory in these speeches, drawing this contrast with Donald Trump as someone who is not only an isolationist, to a certain extent, in his views, but actually has - is an admirer of Vladimir Putin.",

Reagan's, of course, was the 40th D-Day anniversary.And it came during a moment where his approach to the Cold War was in doubt, not just in the United States, but internationally. It's obviously early. But do you think that comparison, that again, the White House is clearly aware of, fits the current moment?",

And, you know, for Reagan, that was a question of his approach to what he portrayed as a very good versus evil struggle with the Soviet Union, echoing World War II.Biden sees echoes of World War II in our present-day conflict with one of our allies in World War II, Russia. And I think that he pretty skillfully draw upon that. I'll tell you, White House speechwriters, Democrat and Republican, they really look up to that Reagan speech, the Pointe du Hoc speech, and it's kind of legendary in a way. And I think that, you know, for the Biden White House, this was a little bit of an homage to that fact, that it's a very powerful backdrop and setting for an American president.",

And I think also, quite frankly, the fact that the President went and apologized to the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in that meeting that took place was also very important for the Ukrainians as well.Because, of course, one of the things that they had been saying is those delays in military aid that went on for months were costing a lot of Ukrainian lives and, of course, making it more difficult for the Ukrainians on the front lines as well. And then you have the President coming out also with a new military assistance package for the Ukrainians that includes a lot of ammunition. What happened in the time that the U.S. was not providing military aid is that the Ukrainians were running very low on artillery ammo, for instance. So there's been a backlog, so some of that is being alleviated by some of these weapons packages that are coming through now. But one of the most important thing, and this is something that Zelenskyy also talked about in his meeting with the President for the Ukrainians, is air defense missiles. That's important for the Ukrainians to try and keep their cities safe. You were just mentioning the city of Kharkiv, which, of course, has been pummeled over the past month and a half since the Russians launched a big offensive in that area coming from Russian territory, which then again sparked the U.S. to allow the Ukrainians to use American-supplied weapons to hit the Russians on the Russian side of the border. So air defense is very important for them. One of the big things that we have to keep an eye on, Brianna, is that the Russians have become a lot better at using their air force near the front lines and bombing Ukrainian positions. And that's also one of the reasons why the Ukrainian president keeps saying they need more air defense capabilities. That's also part of that military assistance package as well, Brianna.",

But now they have a long weekend to strategize and figure out if they're going to put the defendant, Hunter Biden, on the stand. But this decision came after an appearance by his daughter, Naomi Biden. She took the stand to testify for the defense. And during her testimony, she talked about two instances where she saw her father in 2018.Now, the first was late summer, 2018. She said he reached out to her while he was in rehab, saying that he would arrange a trip for her to visit. And she took him up on it and brought her then-boyfriend, now- husband. And she said that when she met him in late summer 2018, he was as clean and as clear as she had seen him since his brother, Beau Biden, had died. And she testified that she was proud of him, and she was proud to introduce him to her boyfriend. She also testified that she saw him again in October, specifically on October 19. And that's key, because, of course, the allegations here focus on the time period between October 12 to October 23. That is the time between when he purchased the gun at the center of this case to when it was discarded. And she said on the 19th, she saw him. She was returning a car that she had borrowed to help move and she said that she was hopeful that he was as clear and as clean as he was when she had seen him in California. But on cross-examination, prosecutors did present some text messages that she exchanged with her father when he was visiting New York that showed they did have some difficulty meeting up. He would go dark for periods of time, was texting her at 2 AM. But she repeatedly testified she never saw any evidence of drugs, drug paraphernalia, or any evidence that he was using during this critical time. So there was a lunch break after she stepped down from the stand, and then they made this shift. But I also want to give Naomi Biden some credit here. I mean, everyone who is the child of an addict or knows the child of an addict can empathize with how difficult this would have been for her. I mean, this is an incredibly difficult thing. And she walked into the courtroom with her husband, and immediately the first lady turned around in motion to her husband to come sit right next to her in the front row, because the first two rows of the courtroom are filled with Biden family members and friends.",

I think the commotion was they feel like they've done that with Naomi Biden. They presumably think that she was credible or sympathetic. They feel like they have a juror or two who's on their side or at least that's what their belief is. And that they got this story out there, which was that even though he had been an addict many other times during this very brief period, when he came out of rehab, he was clean and therefore he had a reason for him - you know, not to check or to check the form to indicate that he was not addicted to a controlled substance at that time.",

Obviously, the prosecution is going to make the point that, of course, she's saying what she needs to say to help her father.She's a daughter. She's a good daughter. They're not going to attack her. They're just going to say, of course, she's saying what she needs to say here to help her father. But we know the truth that they're going to point to those text messages you mentioned, Boris, and they're going to make that argument. The defense is going to say, don't you have some doubt here, you've heard this testimony that he was very clear, and lucid and clean during this period of time. That's enough to have reasonable doubt to know that in his mind, when he was filling out the form or checking the box, that he may - was not knowingly or willfully making a false statement. That's essentially the fault line of this entire trial. It's a very straightforward matter. I think the defense is just pleased that they accomplished this without having to put Hunter Biden on the stand because he, of course, would be subject to very withering cross- examination. So I think they're going to take the weekend to pretend to consider to do that, make the prosecution have to potentially work on their cross-examination, and then they're going to say on Monday that they're not going to call him.",
