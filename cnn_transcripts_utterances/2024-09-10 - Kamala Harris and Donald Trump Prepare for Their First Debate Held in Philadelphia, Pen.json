But nevertheless, sort of late last night, there were strikes on that sort of tent city, makeshift shelters destroyed, lots of people killed and injured.

People are buried in the sand. There's lots of injured people as well. But yet again, it underlines just how unsafe it is for ordinary Palestinian civilians even getting struck or caught up in combat operations when they're in supposedly safe areas. The Israelis, for their part, say that this was a very focused operation. It was very highly targeted, they say. In order to attack Hamas militants, who they say were operating inside the safe area, a command and control center, and they condemned Hamas and other militant groups for effectively using these locations and using Palestinians as human shields.

It will be an ongoing effort to reach Italian American voters, particularly in the blue wall states in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, big Italian communities.But what it's about, I think that enthusiasm is actually being built, Sara, by people representing who we are, all the different things that people care about. We care about are Italian heritage, for example, so many people have something that really is core to who they are. And then using that as a way to reach other people for Kamala Harris. I think the excitement is building. I don't think it was a sugar high actually, I think it actually was about authentic, people being relieved that our candidate was ready to go and be very hopeful because her performance, her ideas, her vision is really resonating. Yes, it's a very tight race. But I think you're going to see a lot of these amazing organizing efforts to move people. We have Robert De Niro, Nancy Pelosi, Leon Panetta, Steve Buscemi, Mark Ruffalo. We had incredible group of people that's still up there on YouTube. I urge people to watch it and get involved. But Sara, you're going to see a lot more of that, a lot more of this kind of people doing their own thing to build support for Kamala.",
