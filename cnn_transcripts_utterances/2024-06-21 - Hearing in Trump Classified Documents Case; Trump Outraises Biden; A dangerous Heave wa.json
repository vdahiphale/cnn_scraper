And they believe that these criminal convictions, which have led to a rush of cash into their campaign coffers, have allowed them to catch up to that disadvantage.And it's not just the $141 million coming into the campaign. A pro- Trump super PAC also reported their monthly figures yesterday. They said that they receive $68 million in May and that was largely made up of three contributions from billionaires. One of which was $50 million from a banking heir named Timothy Mellon. Now, interestingly, that individual previously gave $25 million to RFJ Jr.'s campaign. However, ever since the conviction, he decided to give $50 million to President Trump's super PAC. And this super PAC is planning a advertising blitz in several key swing states, helping to carry the -- Trump's message from this debate into those swing states throughout the summer. And interestingly, heading into this debate, we've seen some expectations resetting from Donald Trump.  Him and his campaign, his allies, they have repeatedly been trying to cast Biden as too old and feeble for the job. Well, listen to what he had to say yesterday about what he expects to hear from President Biden on the debate stage. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, I was never a fan of his. But I will say, he beat -- he beat Paul Ryan -- it was still years ago, but he beat Paul Ryan pretty badly. And I assume he's going to be somebody that will be a worthy debater. Yes, I would say.

So, we have numbers for May. It was down 9 percent in May. But perhaps most significantly is the amount it has decreased since President Biden announced some new rules on asylum about two weeks ago. CBP says the numbers are down about 25 percent since the president announced that action.What he did was essentially allow himself to close the border down to asylum seekers when the numbers reach a certain level, 2,500 per day. The level was well -- well above that when the president announced it. So, this did go into effect almost immediately. I think these numbers will be welcome at the White House, which has so long been trying to neutralize this issue of immigration, trying to show that the president has a handle on what's going on, on the southern border. This is an issue for sure -- certain he's very vulnerable on politically. Now, there are a number of reasons why these numbers would fluctuate. Principally, some of the conditions in the home countries of these people who are trying to reach the United States. But certainly I think this is an indication that some of the steps that the president has taken are starting to take effect.",

But that is going to changed quite a bit. We see some people behind us beginning to enjoy what we expect to be a pretty heavily trafficked area as it gets hotter here. As you mentioned, the 8 million people in New York are among the more than 100 million people facing a heat alert. Fifty record highs could be set across the country between now and the end of the weekend. Temperatures in the Ohio Valley and Mid- Atlantic region are ten to 15 degrees above normal. And weekend temperatures in the Midwest and Northeast could exceed 100 degrees. As you mentioned, D.C. could see its first 100-degree day since August of 2016 on Saturday. Officials there have extended the heat -- heat emergency plan, telling people to take precautions, make sure you're checking on seniors and those who are vulnerable. Make sure you stay inside at the hottest hours of the day. Here in New York, the heat index is expected to be up to and even exceeding 100 degrees today. Much of this area is going to be under a heat advisory through the weekend. And New York could see a June record for a heat wave. Seven consecutive days with temperatures at 90 degrees or above. If that happens, it will tie the longest stretch in a decade. And it would be the longest heatwave in June ever. If you're counting, we're on day two right now. The bottom line here, though, is that this is dangerous. This is why D.C. and New York opening cooling centers. Hundreds of cooling centers will be open here in New York so that people, especially the most at risk, older people, people without -- without air conditioning and people with health conditions will be able to take refuge in cooling centers and shelters in order to try to beat this heat.
