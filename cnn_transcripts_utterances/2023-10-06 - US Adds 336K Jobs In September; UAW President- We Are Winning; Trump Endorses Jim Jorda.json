Now, you're seeing this huge fiscal stimulus that is pushing jobs.

Now, this is all coming from \"The Wall Street Journal.\" We reached out to Exxon. Exxon is not commenting. They said they don't comment on market rumors. Clearly, the market seems to believe that there's something here with Pioneer, up 10 percent. One of the big questions here though, Richard, is, would this draw a regulatory and political scrutiny?

But half away from the closing bell -- Dow has been higher all afternoon. It opened in the red. Now, the jobs numbers themselves very likely complicate the Fed's decision- making process. And perhaps, can show exactly what the Feds -- the crystal ball is here. Maybe it will show me what the Feds and the bank's policymakers to do. They've got a few key factors. Bearing in my number one, first and foremost, they save inflation. The headline number is 3.7 percent, well above the 2.7 -- the two percent target. The job market is more than resilient. It is buoyant. And then, you've got labor strikes, government shutdowns, dysfunction in Washington. And then, of course, you've got the mere fact that the Fed has always said they are data dependent. Loretta Mester is the president of the Cleveland fed. Next year, she'll be a voting member of the Fed's Open Market Committee. If you are -- Madam Loretta, thank you. Good to see you.
