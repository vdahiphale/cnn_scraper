The bureau is now offering up to $50,000 for any information that would lead to an arrest and conviction.The announcement comes as police appear to be getting close to identifying the suspect. On Friday, a law enforcement official said police found the backpack they think the gunman wore during the shooting. It's now at a forensic lab where it's being analyzed for more evidence. Investigators have also said they're looking at the possibility the gunman used a so-called veterinary gun to kill Thompson. The weapon is used to put down animals and it creates less noise than many other firearms. Well, the suspect apparently went a long way to cover his tracks. But investigators still have a huge amount of evidence to work with. Well, that's from New York's police commissioner, who spoke with CNN on Friday. As Omar Jimenez reports, the manhunt is now expanding outside of the city. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

But the fact that both men will be in town clearly a great deal of interest in that. After that, the ceremony itself. We understand it's going to be pretty spectacular. There will be a grand concert, of course, and tomorrow the first mass. Now what the archbishop of Paris says is that, in fact, there will be six months of opening celebrations, with three masses a day for any of the faithful who wish to come and worship inside Notre-Dame for the first time in five years. But clearly a very emotional moment for Paris, for the world, as we discover the inside of Notre-Dame, restored really after five years of a great deal of work; $700 million, more than $700 million have gone into its restoration.

So they had to go through and completely clean it out before they could start rebuilding. Another surprising thing was to see the trees. So there were oak trees that had been planted since the time of the French monarchy, before the French Revolution, that were still growing. And they'd actually been planted originally as ship masts. Well, they're mature. They were ready for harvest. And so they were able to cut those down, hundreds and hundreds of trees, to rebuild the framework, the rafters of the roof. And then there's the magnificent spire itself. That was actually a spire that had been installed in the 19th century. And they used a lot of old techniques throughout the reconstruction. In fact, I remember the day seeing wooden beams being taken by barge down the Seine River through the center of Paris and then craned up into the worksite. It was just amazing to see so many, you know, journeymen carpenters, wood carvers, stonemasons, people that have somehow kept this artisanal knowledge over the generations and they're able to apply it to sort of the work site of the century and inspire new people to take on these jobs.",

Again, you know, the right formula for having him stripped of his presidential powers, because there is clear agreement between both ruling and opposition parties that President Yoon should no longer be president.

INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  After the opposition took Aleppo, took Hama, they do appear to be on the outskirts of Homs as well, the last city before the capital, Damascus, on the M5 highway that links Aleppo with the Syrian capital. Now what we're seeing now is that there are signs of unrest in Daraa province, which is in the south, where we see that the rebels in that area seem to have taken over the Nassib crossing to Jordan, border crossing to Jordan, where there's now a new group that's announced its existence, the Southern Operations Room. And they say that their goal is to reach Damascus, keeping in mind, of course, it was in that southern province where the Syrian uprising began back in 2011. Now we're also hearing from what's known as the Military Operations Command, which is the coalition of rebel groups that started in Idlib and is the one that has taken Aleppo, Hama; is now on the outskirts of Homs. They have called on the Syrian army to pull out of Homs, out of Damascus and out of Syria altogether, according to the spokesman for the group. Now we are seeing that the Syrian air force continues to launch air strikes on not only rebel positions but civilian facilities as well in those areas where the government has lost control. But in terms of actual fighting on the ground, they're pulling up relatively little resistance. And of course, yesterday, we heard the Russians via spokesman for the Kremlin, Dmitry Peskov, saying, basically, we're going to be watching the situation in Syria to decide how we're going to assist Syria. But certainly, at this point, after the dramatic events of the last week, it's questionable if there is even time left, the ability left, to save this collapsing regime. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

In their first year in the conference, second ranked Texas is in the game, taking on fifth ranked Georgia. Now the Bulldogs handed Texas their only loss of the season. Now both of these teams, they're in the playoffs, no matter what. The winner gets a bye. Loser will get a home playoff game, which isn't a bad consolation, especially for their students and fans.
