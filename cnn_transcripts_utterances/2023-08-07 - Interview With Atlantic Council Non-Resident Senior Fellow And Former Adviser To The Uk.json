Split screens dominate the news about Ukraine. From Kyiv, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accuses President Vladimir Putin of yet more war crime after a drone attack on a blood transfusion center in the east and Ukraine's security forces detaining a woman suspecting of being part of a Russian plot to assassinate Zelenskyy. While across continents, dozens of nations have just wrapped up a weekend peace conference for Ukraine. Russia was not invited to the event in Saudi Arabia, but China was. That's an important diplomatic coup for Ukraine, which wants to push the Global South into recognizing Russia as the aggressor. Let us get the latest on all of this now with Yevgeniya Gaber. She is a former top foreign policy advisor, and now, she is with the Atlantic Council in Turkey, joining me now from the southern port city of Odessa. Yevgeniya Gaber, welcome to the program. You used to advise former prime minister under the Zelenskyy administration. And I just wonder whether you also have a bit of a disconnect between the, you know, bombardments in Ukraine over the weekend at the same time as this peace conference was going on.",

I'm based in Odessa. So, I can tell you that just two nights ago we had a major attack, with Russia using every kind of ammunition, starting from different types of missiles to drones to attack civilian infrastructure, to attack every cultural seaport infrastructure. The other day, we had Russia attacking Odessa City Center with the UNESCO protected world heritage.

But another thread is obviously a need for Ukraine to step up its air defense capacities and capabilities, and that's where Ukrainian needs support from the western countries. We need to protect seaport infrastructure, Black Sea, but also that of the Danube River, which is an alternative option to that. And we need to talk about the de-occupation of the Black Sea as such, because obviously these blackmailing by the Russian side, it will not end even if we have the grain initiative back on track for some time. But again, in one month, in two months from now, we will probably see the same raising stakes from the Russian side.",

So, in an ideal world, I would argue that we do need this NATO convoys, or at least Romanian and Turkish convoys in the Black Sea, not to violate the Montreux Convention. But I don't think this is really possible now just because many countries are still very much cautious about the possible escalation from the Russian side. So, what we need now is, again, equipping Ukraine with everything it needs for a successful counteroffensive and for restoring control of the Black Sea countries. So, the Black Sea basin. If that happens, I believe that it will be much easier for such countries as Turkey, for example, or Romania to take decisions to come to the Russian aggression on the Black Sea with some kind of maritime patrols or convoys in a more decisive way, just because this aggression now, it's affecting directly also the freedom of navigation, which is international principle, security of Turkey and Romania, et cetera, et cetera. So ideally, I would call for convoys. But from what we can do now, from what is doable and feasible, I would argue that Ukraine needs much more support for its air defense and anti-missile, anti-ship defense systems.",

Since the moment when Russia withdrew from the grain initiative, it destroyed 180,000 tons of Ukrainian grain, which was to be shipped to these countries within the grain initiative. It destroyed more than 25, 26 different objects of infrastructure, import infrastructure, every cultural infrastructure. The lands in Ukraine, the fields in Ukraine are heavily mined. And of course, such countries, as those that you mentioned and those who took part in this meeting in Jeddah, they are affected by that. So, both the level and the scope of these atrocities by Russia and assaults on agricultural and seaport infrastructure, it shows that there is no way Russia can be a negotiable partner, that it can be trusted, and that it can be credible. So, I think more and more we see this understanding in many countries, including in the Global South, that we need to put more pressure on Russia and not just negotiate and hope for Putin and for the Kremlin to be constructive in negotiations.",

As you know, IgorZhovkva, top diplomatic adviser to President Zelenskyy, told -- was quoted to saying about this weekend's summit, China did not object, as it never objected, that Ukraine's territorial integratory should be respected. So, that's about the bottom-line demand by Ukraine that any peace accord needs to be based on the principle of Russia withdrawing from all occupied territories and other such things. Now, China says that it agrees with that. But Russia has said, and was quick to respond, it's deputy foreign minister, the meeting in Jeddah is a reflection of the West's attempt to continue futile doomed to failure efforts to mobilize the International Community, or more precisely, the Global South, even if not entirely, to support the so-called Zelenskyy formula, which is doomed and unworkable from the outset.

But on the other hand, this shows that the summit in Jeddah was a success, because this reaction from the Russian side, itactually shows that it pays attention to what's going on there and that the decisions that were discussed and taken there, they are ringing warning bells for the Russian side. Look at the African summit, which recently took place in Russia and the very low level and very few leaders coming to participate in that summit, actually. This shows that Russia is gradually losing its influence and its political clock (ph) in Africa and in the Global South. And that means that any further attacks on Ukraine will only show the real nature of the Putin regime to those countries, and those populations who have been brainwashed by Russian propaganda for many years. But, of course, it's not easy to make Russia withdraw its troops from Ukraine, but we have to do that, because this is the only way to, you know, durable peace and to a just peace.

Of course, we cannot copy paste any experience in Ukraine in reality just because this is the largest conflict, the largest war in Europe since the Second World War. So, when we're talking about thousands of kilometers of front line, when we are talking about hundreds of square kilometers of heavily mined fields in Ukraine, that's not what probably Ukrainian soldiers are being taught. But on the other hand, of course, this knowledge and this training is important. Then again, what's the situation now in Ukraine, obviously, we're not talking about any breakthrough like it happened in Kherson, in Kharkiv, for a variety of reasons. But there are mainly two reasons why we can't do that at the moment. The Russian defense lines are really very well equipped because it had a lot of time to prepare itself for this defense. On the other hand, we lack air support, again, both for the counteroffensive and generally for Ukraine as a country. So, obviously, it's not easy, but we do have incremental advances, and I believe that now Ukrainians are just setting the stage for decisive counteroffensive operations in the future.",

But there's still some problems with it from a scientific perspective, it doesn't generate factual coherent text all the time. And when I say I'm scared to death, what I really meant is, is the natural proclivity to believe things that speak authoritatively. And these things speak authoritatively, so we just believe them. And that makes me afraid. Because from the science perspective, I'd love where we are. From a product perspective, I don't believe we're ready. I don't believe it's the case that we have shippable or deployable large language models because they hallucinate. And if you talk to most folks in industry, they'll say, well, the hallucination is something we'll tackle. We're going to get to that. That is the problem. Imagine your asking a highly technical question that you need to know the answer to and you are not sure if 30 percent of the time or 40 percent of the time the machine is telling you something that's factually incorrect. So, my being scared to death is more about the natural proclivity to believe authoritative speech, less about the artificial intelligence.

So, for example, if a particular use case is to generates novel ideas, well, we're pretty close to being there now, because once you generate that novel idea, you can check it for -- whether it's factual or not.

And we train really hard with them and we get a great sense of whether we have justified confidence in that technology or not. It's the same thing when you use the self-driving car, if you use the adaptive cruise. For mine, I really trust the adaptive cruise. So, I have justified confidence in my adaptive cruise. So, I feel confident in using that, even though I know I'm responsible if it crashes, right? So, I am taking that risk. I am making that choice to use the adaptive cruise. I don't make the choice to use the lane keep assist in my car. Why? Because it bounces back and forth among the lines and it almost always tries to hit a truck. So, in my training with these technologies, and this is what we do in the Department of Defense, we learn to have justified confidence in whether I'm willing to take the risk to deploy the technology or not. And I think that's the case for all technologies, not just for these newer ones.

It's not like we've got to the point where we have a brain in the sky, where there's something -- there's some monolithic intelligence, which is the way it's being pitched, and it's -- I think it's a little bit of fearmongering, as well as hype mongering going on.

And give us an idea of the sense -- a sense of the scale of how significant this was in the United States. DONOVAN RAMSEY, AUTHOR, \"WHEN CRACK WAS KING\": You know, Hari, the crack epidemic really changed the way that our society operated on a number of levels. I think most significantly, it completely altered our criminal justice system. We have things like the 100 to 1 crack disparity, the (INAUDIBLE) disparity between crack and powdered cocaine thanks to that period. Lots of walls around mandatory minimum sentencing came into place around that period. Lots of policing tactics like stop-and-frisk that we know of today as helping to explode our criminal justice system came into form during that period. But it also changed a lot of ideas about addiction, about cities, about marginalized communities.",

You know, I was born to a single mother, I have two sisters in a really impoverished neighborhood that was hard hit by crack. So, my earliest memories are really of the era. And I wrote in the book that it was like living in a coal town where nobody talked about coal, because, you know, my mom shielded me in so many ways from what was happening, you know, as close as down the street. So, as I got older, you know, I have lots of questions about people in our community that disappeared or, you know, events that I just never got an explanation for. So, I wanted to write this book to be able to answer those questions for myself, but also for people who grew up like me.",

So, I interviewed hundreds of people across 2018, and I travel to the hardest hit cities, and I sat down with a woman named Lennie Woodle from South Central Los Angeles, Kurt Schmoke who is the former mayor of Baltimore, Elgin Swift whose father was an addict in Yonkers, New York and a man named Shawn McCray who was a major drug dealer out of Newark, New Jersey. And together, I hope that their stories give people a sense of how the epidemic played out differently in different cities, but also how people could experience the epidemic differently just based on how they were positioned in society.",

That the framing was that they would be not only, you know, violent and unpredictable, but that they would be costly. And the origin of that idea was just a small bit of research done by a scientist in Chicago, Ira Chasnoff, just on, you know, a few dozen expected mothers who had used cocaine. And they gave birth to these small babies that had, you know, tremors and that developed slowly, and his conclusion was that -- you know, that these babies would have issues. A few years later, he retracted that because he realized that those babies were mostly premature, that the cocaine exposure had caused them to be born premature and that the things he associated with the cocaine exposure were actually related to their being premature. But by then, it was too late, that the news media, politicians had really run with that and it became, you know, another weapon to really use against people who were dealing the drug addiction. And the consequences of it worldwide that I think that there was a cloud that really hung over a generation of young and black Latino people, this idea that you were potentially a crack baby. And what we saw from that was a level of criminalization in our school. And I think that to find out years later after a woman and named Hallam Hurt out of Philadelphia had done research on hundreds of kids that were cocaine exposed and that there was no significant difference, to find out that it was all a myth really opened my eyes to how impactful the misinformation was of the crack era, that it completely shaped my childhood, that it -- again, that it shaped my idea of even kids that I grew up with, you know, to think that, oh, this guy next to me is having issues in class, maybe he's a crack baby, you know that that was not uncommon, you know, to -- sort of an uncommon way to think during the crack era, and think that we still have to expose people to the truth of what was happening.",
