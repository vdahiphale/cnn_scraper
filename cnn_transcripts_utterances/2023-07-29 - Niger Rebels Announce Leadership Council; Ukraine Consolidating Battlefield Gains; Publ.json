The French president called the coup, quote, \"deeply dangerous for Niger and the whole region,\" and backed the possible use of sanctions. U.S. top diplomat Antony Blinken expressed unflagging support for the ousted president Mohamed Bazoum. The coup plotters announced the so- called National Council for the Preservation of the Homeland, with the president to serve as new head of state. Larry Madowo is following the developments for you from Nairobi. Good morning. What's the situation in Niger after the military takeover? LARRY MADOWO, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  This new self-declared leader of Niger is playing president now. Shortly after explaining why he decided to rescue the country, in his view, he met with senior officials from all the ministries. These are career public officials. Not political appointees which is why I imagine he didn't meet with the ministers. They're loyal to who appointed them, Mohamed Bazoum. He met with all of them. A lot of them were members of this 17-member council to protect the homeland. That is now the military group running the country. And he said the work continues. He has tried to kind of show a sense of normalcy in Niger though the international community are all telling him they did not recognize him, that president Bazoum is still the democratically elected president of the country. And Bazoum says he has no intention to resign. And this man cannot be leader of the country because he cannot suspend the constitution. And him declaring himself the leader of the country has no basis in law. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FALMATA TAYA, NIAMEY RESIDENT (through translator):  The international community that says they are here for us, we don't want it. We don't want their moral lesson  because they are no longer credible in the eyes of Africans. We can't understand why they support a coup in Chad and oppose it in Mali and Burkina Faso. This is an internal problem. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And I think they are paying the price of an African policy based on reacting to the event rather than transforming the nature, anticipating and transforming the nature of their relationship with African nations. Africa has deeply changed. A new generation, a politically conscious middle class has demands. They don't accept double or cheap standards when it comes to the continent. As long as they would refuse, the partnership, resting on all networks and all paradigms, the Westerns would continue to be surprised and overwhelmed by the events. I'm not saying that these butchers will create the new Africa. Not at all. I'm saying the support they may find in a part of the population is motivated by the fact that they ousted weak regimes people did not trust anymore.",

In order to keep them in check, the former colonizers are filling these countries with terrorists and various bandit formations. Thus creating a colossal security crisis.\" Does this type of argument resonate with the people in Niger and especially what you have just been referring to also, maybe across the Sahel as well?",

After 20 years, if you assess the level of commitment of Russians in Africa, it is very weak. It has nothing to do with China. Nothing to do with the U.S. Nothing to do with the European Union. So it is very difficult for them to see how they can expand, knowing that they don't have the means of their policy.",

I want to draw your attention to the Melitopol access toward the south. There some Russian military -- we can't independently confirm this -- say that Ukrainian forces have been able to either breach or reach Russian defensive lines. And what they are using is small groups of military engineers to essentially try to cut through those very complicated obstacle courses essentially that have been set in place by Moscow's forces.
