And the reality is, they have candidates who do not have anything to say to the American people, which is why we have seen so much energy for the next president of the United States.",

Just stop and appreciate that.

Bipartisan lawmakers trying to find a path forward.And we should note that this bill has large bipartisan support. It has more than 70 co-sponsors. That's almost unheard of when you are talking about a bill coming to the Senate floor. And it really does combine some odd bedfellows. You have Marsha Blackburn, a really conservative Republican, working very closely with Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut. They really helped spearhead this bill, get it the attention and support that it needed to get to the floor. And it really does two separate things. It puts the onus on companies online to try and protect children, to do everything in their power to make that the case, that children are not victimized online, that they are not seeing the kind of content that could hurt them or, you know, create issues with body image. That's something that we've talked so much about on CNN. The other question that it deals with is targeting advertisements directed at children. It really tries to stem the tide of that. And so you have here a bill and a package of bills that really does lot of things to try to protect kids online. And we should just note, Kate, that this is the kind of legislation that in an election year you may not really see that often because it's bipartisan, it's something that everyone can go home and campaign on. Now, this bill's future is still a little bit uncertain in the United States House of Representatives. But Speaker Mike Johnson said that he looks forward to reviewing this legislation. And of course, we expect that it could come to the floor in the House after the August recess. Kate.",

But, I mean, today was just a nightmare for her.So, she had set point in the opening set, up 5-2, but Croatia's Donna Vekic not only saved set point, she came all the way back and won it in a tie break. And then in the second set, the umpire overruled an out call that just infuriated Coco. She argued with the umpire that the ball should have been replayed do to her claim that the earlier out call had interfered with her shot. Coco got so upset she was in tears, saying she's always being cheated. She ended up getting no relief and would then lose that set as well, 6-2. So, Coco's now out of singles. Her Olympics, though, not over. She's still going to be competing in both the women's and mixed doubles. Now, elsewhere there in Paris, a big day for the women's gymnastics team as they look to reclaim the team gold. Three years ago at the Tokyo games the team got silver. That was after gold in 2012 and 2016. Now, Simone Biles says she's good to go despite tweaking that calf on Sunday. The U.S. should be pretty confident today. They had three of the top for all around performers on Sunday during qualifications. You've got Biles and Jordan Chiles slated to compete in all four events today. Suni Lee on the bars, beam and floor. And then you've got Jade Carey going to be on the vault. Women's team final starts at 12:15 Eastern. The men's team, meanwhile, they got a new hero. His name is Stephen Nedoroscik. And if the pommel horse specialist could deliver a flawless routine yesterday, the U.S. would win a medal in the all- around. And he came through big time. Nedoroscik, he knew it after that dismount. The whole team mobbed him, and a big celebration right there on the floor. Now, the Nedoroscik known as Clark Kent for those thick-rimmed glasses. And he certainly had a Superman performance. It got the U.S. the bronze. It was the men's first team medal since 2008, and just their fourth since 1932. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STEPHEN NEDOROSCIK, 2024 OLYMPICS BRONZE MEDALIST: Went up there, did my routine. And during that dismount, I was just like already smiling, I think. I saluted the judges and looked at these guys and they were jumping up and down. I mean it was just the greatest moment of my life, I think. And I'm so happy to have them there. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Officials, you know, they kept insisting that it would be. The Paris mayor even swimming in it to try to alleviate concerns. Well, this morning, they postponed the men's triathlon because they tested the water and it was found to have too much pollution in order to swim in it. They're blaming the heavy rain on Friday and Saturday for the levels there, Kate. There's hope that the triathlon will be able to take place tomorrow after the women's race.
