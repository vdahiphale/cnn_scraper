And what wehave seen over the last couple of weeks is not only hospitals coming under pressure, not only more than a million people now being displaced, but there is real concern over how sustainable this situation is for those inside Gaza. Now, as we saw today, according to the U.N.'s humanitarian office, some 5000 people inside Gaza attempted to make that crossing from northern Gaza to the south, attempting to evacuate as per the orders of the IDF. They were given that window of between 10 A.M. and 2 P.M. said to be a safe window to evacuate. But the U.N.'s humanitarian office has highlighted that many of these roads have faced severe damage as a result of Israel's airstrikes, and that means that many have had to walk on foot, including children and the elderly. Now, the U.N.'s humanitarian office says that some 1.5 million people inside Gaza are now displaced. More than 700,000 of them are taking shelter in U.N.-run schools. And while these evacuations are said to be heading towards safe zones, as highlighted by the Israel Defense Forces, what we have seen continuously now is parts of central and southern Gaza continuing to come under attack by Israeli airstrikes. We saw just in the last two days a number of refugee camps coming under attack as well. And there is a real sense of concern as to where these safe zones really are. No fuel is getting in. That is -- that means that hospitals are being pushed to the brink of collapse. We're seeing power cuts. We're seeing, of course, shortages of medication and medical care. We have heard from doctors from Doctors Without Borders and they are treating children without the necessary medication and painkillers. So, the situation is dire. There is building pressure from the international community and from human rights organizations, both U.N. and non-U.N. organizations calling for a humanitarian ceasefire.

Hamas effectively perpetrated two huge massacres, the first of Israelis on the day itself and the second of the Palestinians being played out on a much grander scale by Israel. Hamas' cynicism is so profound that it's no exaggeration to call it an intentional human sacrifice of thousands of Palestinians in a desperate bid to increase the organization's decades-long quest for dominance of the national movement.\" And that brings us to The Exchange. Joining us now is the man who wrote this piece, Hussein Ibish. Hussein, thank you so much for joining us. Now, we should point out that you make a statement and an argument here that we don't hear much from the Arab world as a whole, at least not publicly. And you go on to note, and I'm going to quote you, that it is essential to register the depth of Hamas' guilt. Can you explain why you believe that is so essential?",

In among Arab Americans people are reticent, say, you certainly get it in arabica in the Arab world, that's for sure. But yeah, what I mean is that Hamas knew that Israel was going to overreact. Israel has a doctrine of disproportionality. It's never satisfied with even a two to one ratio of civilians killed. It wants a ten to one ratio which we're getting close to at this point. It always wants to inflict more pain on the other side as a matter of strategy, as a -- as a way of restoring deterrence. Hamas knew this. They knew that when they broke through the gates and went into Israel trying to kill not just soldiers which they certainly did kill and capture but also civilians or basically anyone they found, that they are going definitely to prompt an Israeli -- major Israeli counterattack. And even if you could argue, as some people do, that they were shocked by the weakness of the Israeli defenses and how, in quotes, successful they were. Nonetheless, they certainly were changing the stakes, and they knew Israel was going to counterattack. What they want is for Israel to reoccupy the Gaza Strip in its interior, not from the outside, as they have since 2007. But inside, as Netanyahu -- Prime Minister Netanyahu, now -- yesterday said they're going to do. And what they want is eventually to launch an insurgency against the Israeli occupiers and to say to the Palestinians, look, we are fighting the occupiers for control of Palestinian landing Gaza. The PA sits there, views security cooperation in the West Bank with Israel, and the PLO sits at the negotiating table listening to crickets when the Israelis won't talk to them. So, we are the national movement. That's their long-term strategy. It's very cynical.",

So, what is the most effective process where Israel can remain protected and the Palestinians in Gaza can have democracy and freedom to establish a land of their own and one day bring to a two-state solution that the West and many in Israel, as you know, are calling for, as well?",

But it certainly is the presidential race on the Republican side that is going to determine who President Joe Biden is running against. And without a doubt, I mean, this is still Donald Trump's race to lose. He is so far ahead, but no one has cast votes yet. So, it's important to just wait for the process to play out. But at the debate tomorrow night, which is going to be taking place just right behind me here in downtown Miami, it is going to be really a clash between Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and former South Carolina governor and U.N.
