The former president spoke to a group of South Carolina Republicans Saturday night and used his speech, much of his speech, to criticize the recent charges that he's facing, as well specifically go after Special Counsel Jack Smith. He called him, quote, \"deranged as well as mentally ill\".He also made an appeal to Congress, specifically Republicans on Capitol Hill to, quote, \"step up and do something in light of the recent indictment\". Now, one key difference about his Saturday remark is that he continued to talk about the case less than 24 hours after Jack Smith, in a court filing Friday night, had asked the judge to set limits on what Donald Trump's team can do with the evidence shared in the election subversion case. The filing had pointed to one of Donald Trump's two social posts where he, quote, \"If you go after me, I'm coming after you\". Now, Victor and Amara, the judge ultimately ruled that Donald Trump's team has to respond to that proposal by Monday afternoon, despite the former president's team wanting to extend that to Thursday. And one other thing I just think is important to note in this is Donald Trump's team wants him to keep talking about the charges. They do think that he benefits politically from this, at least among his Republican primary voters. But it was very unclear going into tonight whether the former president would be swayed by this recent court filing from the special counsel's team and would kind of shift his rhetoric, but clearly he did not.

This, of course, is a very important issue for members of the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, young voters, voters who haven't always given Biden credit for his record here, dissatisfaction with his record on mining for fossil fuels and cutting carbon emissions.

Inflation is slowing down, consumer sentiment is ticking up. But as you mentioned, voters still feel sour about the economy. 75 percent in that poll say that economic conditions are poor.
