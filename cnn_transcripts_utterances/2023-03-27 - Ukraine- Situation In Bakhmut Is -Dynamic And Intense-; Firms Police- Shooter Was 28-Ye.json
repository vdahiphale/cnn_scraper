Nashville police confirming they have identified the shooter, a 28-year-old white woman who forced her way into The Covenant School, a small private school inside a church that the chief of police in Nashville, Chief John Drake, says appears at one point was apparently a student at that school.",

And police say within 15 minutes of the call, the attacker was dead. CNN's Dianne Gallagher is tracking all the latest developments for us. And Dianne, police just gave an update, all of the families of those killed have been notified. They've identified all of the victims and for now they are not releasing the names.",

      "sentences": "That's right. And also, Bianna, it was noticeable that they said they did not want to release the ages either. We are likely dealing with very young children here as The Covenant School at Covenant Presbyterian Church serves pre K to sixth graders.And so three of those six who were killed by that 28-year-old shooter, of course, are children. We are talking about young children here that were murdered inside their school which is inside of a church. Now, some of the new information that we learned from the police chief there was again, as you said, this is a 28-year-old white female who they say does live in the Nashville area. The Chief said that there was a car that helped lead them to identifying that suspect, and noting that at one point, although they are so looking into this and investigating this, perhaps she had attended the school, again, a 28-year-old woman. They're still trying to investigate earlier today. We were told that there is video from the school that they are going through trying to learn more about what happened. It said that she did try to force her way into a side door. Now, according to the initial description of what happened, we're told that it happened on an upper level inside The Covenant School, not in a classroom per se. It was described by the Metro Nashville Police Media representative, Don Aaron, as being a lobby of sorts inside that school. This is a small school. We're talking just over 200 students, again, from preschool to sixth grade. About 40 to 50 staff members in total, according to Metro Nashville Police there. Look, they have said that they are still trying again to piece together what happened in this, but they had a five-person team. And, look, there was a lot of talk about how quickly they were able to respond, that 10:13 am call that the shooter was killed after engaging with two police officers by 10:26 am. So we're talking about less than 15 minutes from that initial call. They say the shooter was dead. They say five-person team responded to this shooting, to engaged on that upper level two officers engaging with the shooter on that upper level. And again, this is a community they mentioned, they've had these shootings, unfortunately, mass shootings in the area before. I've covered mass shootings in Nashville before. This is something that the Metro Nashville Police Department said that sadly they are very prepared for. And that some of the students were able to quickly respond to this and get out because it is so sad and unfortunate that preschoolers through sixth graders know what to do in this situation, because unfortunately, so many of their parents, their friends, their communities, their schools had to be familiar with it. It's something that we do know is that because this was a small private school inside a church, there was no school resource officer associated with the police department there. Again, right now they are still investigating and trying to, again, comfort a community that once again has just been destroyed by an absolute tragedy, but something that unfortunately is still very common.",

And it was ultimately those two who engaged with and took out the shooter. They had a integrated fire department response with them so they've clearly been doing a lot of training with the tactical folks with fire department representatives who are able to go in with the tactical team and administer first aid to those folks who need it more quickly than they otherwise would be able to do. So you have really - it looks like - a pretty remarkable response highly trained, very quick and yet we still have this number of casualties. I think it draws a lot of attention to the core of this problem that no matter how good law enforcement gets, they are always behind the shooter. They are there to try to limit damages. They can't possibly prevent these things from happening. So for me, that's a really strong take away from this particular tragedy.",

In our previous conversation with the state representative, I noted he signed an executive order last year after Uvalde that attempted to harden schools as targets - they're soft targets, right? But that executive order included no new gun restrictions. And his reasoning for not pursuing say a ban on assault style weapons was that quote, criminals don't follow laws. What do you make of that argument we hear so often from lawmakers that criminals aren't going to follow the law? MCCABESo this idea that all mass shooters are - have committed some sort of crime and coming across their AR-15s or their assault weapons or their handguns, whatever that might be, is just simply not true. The facts, however, are pretty clear that we have twice almost three times as many guns in this country as the next highest heavily armed gun country on the planet. We have - you're 18 times more likely to die of a firearm-inflicted homicide in this country than in any other similar well-developed nation on Earth. You're almost 44 times more likely to die of a gun- inflicted suicide in the United States of America than anyplace else. So all of these societal problems are connected in some way, not entirely, but in some way to the easy, easy access of unbelievably lethal weapons in this country.",

Because she was a student at the school, she would know entry points and so forth. Whether or not that door was locked or it was a forced entry remains to be seen. That's all part of the investigation.But she was heavily armed, I mean to assault weapons, a hand gun, I mean you just don't wake up and just suddenly decide to grab your AR- 15 or whatever and a handgun and go shoot some kids at a school. I would think that once they get into this investigation, start going through social media, other evidence they find as they start executing search warrants, they'll find that, there was some thought put into this. Obviously, this is all speculation because we just don't know. But I just would find it hard to believe that this was a spur of the moment event that took place.",
