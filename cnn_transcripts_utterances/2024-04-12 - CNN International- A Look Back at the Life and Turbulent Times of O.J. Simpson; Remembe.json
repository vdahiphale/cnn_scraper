It's time to walk the walk when it comes to military aid. Vladimir Zelenskyy says his -- Volodymyr Zelenskyy, rather, says his armed forces need more air defenses and other military supplies. Israel is preparing for a possible attack from Iran, and the U.S. is working diplomatic channels to try to prevent that. Iran has threatened retaliation after an Israeli strike on the Iranian consulate in Syria last week that killed a dozen military officials. And China appeared to be top of mind during historic talks at the White House on Thursday. U.S. President Biden hosted the first ever trilateral meeting with the Filipino president and Japanese prime minister. We'll have more on those stories in the coming hours, of course. Meanwhile, though, reactions are coming in over the death of O.J. Simpson, the former U.S. football star who was acquitted in the deaths of his ex-wife and friend. Simpson's family says he died on Wednesday at the age of 76 after a battle with prostate cancer. His career achievements were overshadowed by his 1995 double murder trial for the killings of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman. Simpson was acquitted in the high-profile trial that divided the U.S. along racial lines. But he was later found liable in a wrongful death civil lawsuit and ordered to pay millions in damages. CNN's Tom Foreman has his story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
