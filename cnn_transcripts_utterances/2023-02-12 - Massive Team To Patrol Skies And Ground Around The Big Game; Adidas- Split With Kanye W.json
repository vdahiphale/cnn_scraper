Part of the reason why as to that Friday object, because, obviously, at this point we have to differentiate them by days, as to that Friday object we have so little details. The Pentagon has been really cautious about putting it out because those pilots on those two different trips that they took to kind of survey have come back with varying different things.One pilot really said that -- or not one pilot, some pilots claim that the object interfered with their sensors. Others didn't. Of course, some pilots claimed that they couldn't see how really -- didn't see any propulsions, really questioning how it was able to stay 40,000 feet in the sky. And obviously some pilots said that they didn't see any surveillance equipment. So, with all of these different varying accounts really, it has been hard for the Pentagon to pinpoint what this is and what's going on really to be able to tell the American people. But of course, those are the questions that we continue asking. As of now they have been doing the recovery effort for Friday's object for almost two days and of course the recovery in Canada is ongoing.",

Joining us now is CNN military analyst, retired Air Force Colonel Cedric Leighton. Colonel, good morning to you. I mean, look, once again we have a mysterious object shot down over North American airspace. I mean, this is kind of happening now back to back, Friday and then Saturday. What are your thoughts on what in the world is going on here? Are you concerned at all? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, good morning. Yes, you have to be a bit concerned because we are seeing this stuff occur all the time now it seems like. And the key thing here is I think we are seeing a lot of different calibrations going on within the military. What I mean by that is the military is now much more sensitive, specifically NORAD, much more sensitized to these kinds of objects and to detecting them. And right now we are in kind of a shoot first, ask questions later mentality, and we are taking care of objects that we haven't readily identified, which is unlike what happened with the first object, the Chinese balloon that we shot down a week ago yesterday. WALKER; Yes, and from our exclusive CNN reporting this monitoring system is quite new in the last year or so.

And so, Amara, what you are looking at is, you know, a better system, more calibrated radar, better trained operators, people who are attuned to these kinds of anomalies, looking and judging what they are seeing. And then, of the course, we are willing to scramble jets to go after these objects and identify them or try to, at least. And that's, you know, what we're seeing.We are seeing a renewed emphasis on this because the United States is, and Canada, are beginning to recognize that this is the new path, perhaps, of surveillance activity. In other words, that, you know, perhaps China and Russia are getting together to do something. Perhaps it's just China. We don't know yet. But the basic idea is the surveillance picture has changed and they are using different altitudes potentially to go after American and Canadian targets in terms of an intelligence collection picture.",

I think the basic idea, if we can, you know, believe what the Pentagon has told us, they were able to shut down or at least modify a lot of the communications that would normally be going along the flight path of the Chinese balloon. So, if that's the case, I think, that we can be pretty safe in saying that once the analysis is completed, assuming that the pieces can be put back together again in a meaningful way, I think the U.S. intelligence community gained a lot more than the Chinese gained from that particular over flight simply from the very standpoint that now we know what the system is, or at least hope to know what the system is, how it's connected and what it's collecting. So, that becomes a critical element.The other thing, of course, is, you know, when you look at the other two objects, I think, a lot more forensic investigation will have to take place before we can safely say what those are. I should also caution that we won't know immediately what these kinds of things can do. It will take a while before we get to that point.",

Nada Bashir reporting, thank you so much.While earthquake relief from around the world increasingly is flowing into Turkey getting help into Syria is far more complicated. The nation's now 12-year civil war means that rebel-controlled areas in the hard-hit northern part of Syria have seen little to no aid. Joining us now to discuss that aspect of this disaster is Charles Lister. He is a senior fellow and director of the Countering Terrorism and Extremism program at the Middle East Institute. Charles, thanks so much for sharing part of your Sunday morning with us. Let's start with Syrian President Bashar al Assad saying that sanctions are preventing western resources from entering Syria. Critics in the West say that this isn't about sanctions. So, what's really preventing aid from getting in? CHARLES LISTER, SENIOR FELLOW, MIDDLE EAST INSTITUTE: Yes. So, first off, thank you for having me. You are absolutely right. There is no correlation between sanctions from the United States and our other like-minded partners around the world and the delivery of humanitarian aid. Sanctions are explicitly designed not to have an effect. And, you know, even more important than that fact, the United Nations maintains a multibillion-dollar a year aid program coordinated through the Syrian capital Damascus controlled and influenced by the regime. Ninety-one percent of that is funded by the sanctioning entities, including the United States. So, there would be no aid if it wasn't for the very same countries who were sanctioning the regime for its war crimes. The real obstacles are political. The regime, of course, as distasteful and as evil as it has been maintains the status as a sovereign government. So, within the United Nations it has a great deal of leverage and it puts the U.N. under a good deal of pressure and restrains or constrains its ability to deliver aid across the border, in other words, from foreign neighboring countries like Turkey. And on day one after the earthquake, the regime said all earthquake relief has to come through Damascus. It cannot enter the country from elsewhere and that put the U.N. under a great deal of pressure. The U.N. should have done what it was right, but it has more or less succumbed to the pressure imposed by the regime.",

    },
    {
      "timeStamp": "06:20:00",
      "speaker": "LISTER",
      "sentences": "Well, you'd like to think so. But over the past 12 years, the regime has maintained a consistent siege and starve strategy against all of its opponents across the country. So, no. If that aid goes into Damascus, there is an extraordinarily slim chance of any of it ever going to opposition held areas of the country.You know, to give you an example of this, in 2022, there was a big push by the United Nations to see if it could get more aid from Damascus to the opposition-held northwest, the hardest hit region by this earthquake. And that kind of aid is called cross line. In other words, it remains inside Syria but it goes to other areas of the country. Now, of all of the aid that made its way to northwestern Syria in 2022, 99.6 percent of it came cross border from Turkey and only 0.4 percent made its way from Damascus. So, the regime has an atrocious track record of providing humanitarian assistance or allowing humanitarian assistance into its opponent areas. And so, no, there is no reason to put any faith into what the regime said. This is just the regime's opportunity to turn the conversation into one that essentially paves a path towards its normalization within the international community and hoping the world just forgets or ignores 12 years of horrendous war crimes. SANCHEZ: So in a very cynical way, is it fair to say that this devastating earthquake with 28,000 people killed is a golden opportunity for Bashar al Assad, he intends to use it that way?",

CNN's Vanessa Yurkevich has the numbers.VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS AND POLITICS CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Yes, Amara and Boris, this is a very costly breakup for Adidas. The company ended their partnership with Kanye West or Ye back in October after a series of antisemitic comments the rapper made. Now, this is projected to cost Adidas $1.3 billion in revenue this year because it can't sell Yeezy clothing or shoes. The company said they could rebrand some of the merchandise, which may help save them a couple hundred million dollars. Otherwise, they will have to destroy the merchandise or they could end up donating it. Now, this partnership with Adidas and Yeezy was once extremely lucrative. Now, Adidas possibly $1.3 billion in the hole. And new reporting from The Wall Street Journal says that another partnership is on the rocks. They report sales of Beyonce's Ivy Park line were down 50 percent last year compared to 2021 generating about $40 million in revenue when the projection was closer to $250 million. Adidas responded to the Wall Street Journal's reporting by saying that the partnership is, \"strong and successful.\" And Beyonce hasn't commented beyond posting a new Ivy Park merchandise drop this week on Instagram. But according to the Wall Street Journal, Ivy Park is projected to do $65 million in sales this year. That's a big difference from the $335 million the company was previously targeting. So, this really begs the question, are these celebrity deals profitable for brands? At least for Adidas, Ye, and Beyonce, the numbers, Amara and Boris, paint a very different picture.",

But these AEDs cost around 1,000 to $2,000 depending on the model, but that's not a yearly cost. They can last several years as long as you keep them charged. But a couple rules a thumb. You want to have at least one AED per 500 students. That seems to be the right number.
