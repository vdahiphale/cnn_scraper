Elon Musk is publicizing the names of government employees whose jobs he wants to cut, and some federal workers say that it's terrifying.As the co-leader of the newly announced Department of Government Efficiency, Musk re-posted the identities and positions of four women.

Hadas, do we know exactly why Elon Musk highlighted these people in particular?",

      "sentences": "Well, it's sort of a surveillance camera in the sky for super-polluters, as you mentioned there. It was built with the largesse of Jeff Bezos, The Earth Fund, about $100 million went towards this. The New Zealand Space Agency helped launch this thing.And now that it's been up for a while, we're getting a sense of really the undercount of methane that we've long believed was leaking. Now, as you saw in that -- in those clips you just showed there, you can't see it, you can't smell it. You need special cameras to see methane, which is basically natural gas. It's marketed as natural gas. But it is 80 times more powerful than carbon dioxide when it comes to heating up planet earth. And so the estimates from industry and the EPA, they had them -- they were big. We knew this needed to be contained. It's low-hanging fruit to cap these leaks and try to capture this stuff. But when the Environmental Defense Fund launched the MethaneSAT and it made a few laps now, we're getting our first readings from some of the big oil and gas basins around the country. And the results are staggering. Let's start in Appalachia. We spent a lot of time talking about Pennsylvania fracking wells, 226 tons an hour is leaking there in that corner of the country, West Virginia, Pennsylvania there, as well. If you go to the Utah basin in Utah, older, leakier, doesn't produce as much gas, but still 60 tons an hour is coming out of some of these orphaned wells as well. And then the Permian, the granddaddy of all the big oil patch in Texas and New Mexico, almost 300 tons per hour. That's nine to 15 times higher than the limits that the industry agreed to. So the big question is now -- the theory was what the Environmental Defense Fund was, if we could see the stuff, countries, governments would do something about it. But the Trump administration has been sort of openly scornful to all environmental regulations. It remains to be seen what kind of leverage this will -- these new pictures and this new data will -- will do towards pressuring any kind of regulation around these leaks.",

So using points is incredible for consumers because you can cancel and get your points back for free in most major programs.Unlike airlines, which will give you a voucher, maybe, and have change fees, using points is like buying a fully refundable ticket. So that's what I can't stress to people enough. Even if you're at the airport and your flight's getting delayed and you might be canceled and you've got to get home, pull out your points, book yourself on another carrier. Even if you don't end up needing to use that flight, you can cancel and get all of your points back for free. And but, to your point, never spend on a credit card if you can't pay it off in full every month because the interest you pay will negate the value of any of the points that you earn.",

They charge a premium. But most airlines will release frequent flier mile awards for most of their flights at 11 months or so in advance. So if you can plan a year in advance and have miles, book as soon as the calendar opens up for that airline. That's how a lot of people in the points and miles world will snag those really hard-to-get tickets, like to the Maldives or Hawaii.",

I'm actually a big, bigger fan of the number-three option, which is a piece of fried turkey. I actually did that last year for CNN. I think you keep it far more juicy that way. So if you're going to eat me, you should get me as hot as possible, fry me. And I think that would be the best.
