More now from CNN's Matthew Chance. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): It's the first glimpse of Evan Gershkovich for weeks. The U.S. reporter accused in Russia of espionage standing arms folded behind the glass courtroom cage even manages a smile for the cameras. A few journalists call out their support holds strong, one shouts. Everyone sends you a big hello, the voice says. Before being hustled away. But the court rejected an appeal for bail or for Gershkovich to be kept under house arrest instead of in prison. Outside his lawyers spoke of how he was holding up behind bars. Reading classic Russian novels, one said, and watching cooking shows on TV. But the U.S. ambassador was far more critical, expressing her concerns at his confinement. LYNNE TRACY, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO RUSSIA: I can only say how troubling it was to see Evan, an innocent journalist held in these circumstances. The charges against Evan are baseless, and we call on the Russian Federation to immediately release him. CHANCE (voice-over): Amid its brutal invasion of Ukraine, Russia has been stepping up its crackdown on free speech and dissent, using the war as cover to silence independent journalism. Or to jail long standing critics like Vladimir Kara-Murza, sentenced to 25 years for treason just this week, after speaking out on the conflict. VLADIMIR KARA-MURZA, RUSSIAN CRITIC: They're war crimes, these are war crimes. CHANCE (voice-over): And the pressure is maintained behind bars. Last month, supporters of Alexey Navalny, the jailed Russian anti- corruption campaigner, accused the authorities of poisoning the Kremlin critic again, this time at the penal colony. Now his lawyers say he's been beaten up in his cell and faces new criminal charges. That is against this backdrop Evan Gershkovich remains detained in a Moscow prison. Determined says lawyers to defend himself but utterly at the mercy of an increasingly authoritarian Russian state. Matthew Chance, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

It is still operated by Ukrainian staff, but crucially, it falls under the control of the Russian armed forces and Russia's state-owned energy firm Rosneft. So really, this isn't going to have a significant impact on the ground because it is under the control and under the territory that is now occupied by the Russian armed forces.Now we've heard in that letter, which has been reviewed by CNN, the U.S. Department of Energy, saying that this Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant contains, quote, U.S. origin nuclear technical data that is export controlled by the U.S. government. So that essentially means it would be unlawful for any Russian citizens or Russian entities to handle this technology. And this is, of course, a huge concern for the U.S. government. We've seen since Russia's invasion of Ukrainian and Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant coming under attack. We've seen the power plant disconnected from the Ukrainian national grid on multiple occasions as a result of Russian shelling. And that has really raised concerns over the potential for a nuclear accident in Europe.",
