If the bill does pass the House we could still be in for a partial shutdown if the Senate doesn't time -- have time to read it and cast votes before the midnight deadline -- entirely possible. Here's what Sen. Mike Rounds told me yesterday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. MIKE ROUNDS (R-SD):  The Senate may not even get the bill until tomorrow or Saturday, and so there may be a shutdown over the weekend. I don't like that idea. I think -- and I think this is a terrible way to run a government and this is a terrible thing to do to the country. This was supposed to be done last October. And so, here we are. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Three crew members are safe after their launch to the International Space Station from Kazakhstan was aborted. NASA officials say the Soyuz rocket automatically aborted just 20 seconds before liftoff Thursday after one of the service towers next to the rocket failed to initiate an engine start. Engineers are still trying to determine what caused the failure. The next launch opportunity comes tomorrow. All right. How is your bracket doing this morning?

But the biggest upset of the day -- it belonged to 14-seed Oakland who took down 3-seed Kentucky. And what a night it was for Jack Gohlke. The senior for the Golden Grizzlies made 10 threes. Gohlke scoring 32 points, which is the most points ever in the tournament for a player who did not make a 2-point shot. Oakland would pull off the upset over the Wildcats 80-76. Kentucky is now 1-4 in their last five tournament games. And here was Gohlke after the big upset. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
