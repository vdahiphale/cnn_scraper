Former Treasury secretary Larry Summers says the answer is easy. Listen to him explain his plan. Then, why Putin's war on Ukraine may not be proceeding as he hoped. The Russian president may be getting exactly what he always wanted back home in Russia. \"The New York Times\" Valerie Hopkins will explain. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

So I've taken that overnight train to Kyiv and you're going through Poland. And you're in a war zone for a large part of it. So I'm guessing U.S. planes could not enter that war zone.What was it like for you there? What were you guys thinking? There's a period there where the president was not protected the way the president normally is, right?",

The Ukrainians ask for something, the administration is ambivalent, time passes, there is a clamor around it that builds and then it starts leaning toward it and then finally delivers it. That's what happened with HIMARS. That's what happened with Patriots. That's what happened with the Abrams tank.Fighter jets is now the issue. It feels like if you're going to do it three or four months later, why not do it now given the speed is of the essence? What is going on that always leads to this pattern where you do eventually say yes, but it's now four or six months later?",

      "sentences": "So first, Fareed, the way that our military and our intelligence community make recommendations to the president is they look at the needs of the Ukrainian military during the phase of the war that they are confronting at that time.In the early weeks of the war, what the Ukrainian military needed to defend Kyiv was anti-armor systems, basically missiles that could stop tanks in their tracks so they couldn't roll over Kyiv, and anti-air systems like Stinger missiles to shoot down the helicopters that were bringing in paratroopers to try to take over the city from the air. In the second phase of the war, Ukraine really needed artillery, in the east, to stop the more traditional advances of the Russian military. As we head into the spring, what Ukraine really needs is armor, infantry fighting vehicles, and yes, tanks. And we're providing those. When it comes to F-16s, this is important for the current phase of the war, this point is important for the current phase of the war which is they're about to mount a significant counteroffensive. From our perspective, F-16s are not the key capability for that offensive. It is the stuff that we are moving rapidly to the frontlines now. F-16s are not a question for the short-term fight. F-16s are a question for the long-term defense of Ukraine and that's a conversation that President Biden and President Zelenskyy had. ZAKARIA: Samantha Power, let me ask you a question that really is fully in your bailiwick. And it's something a lot of Americans think about, a lot of Republicans have been clamoring about, which is, before the war Ukraine was regarded as, you know, if you look at various indices, a very corrupt country. There was a lot of corruption in Ukraine. Transparency international, all those kinds of measures. How can you be sure that these massive amounts of aid that the United States and Europe is sending into Ukraine are getting to the people they need to get to, that there isn't corruption, graft, siphoning off? What kind of assurances can you give?",

And so I want to say thank you for your bravery, your courage and for the men and women who are fighting with you. We are grateful for all that you do, the sacrifices that you are making, and we can't even begin to imagine the difficulties and the trials that you've gone through.What we can do is everything in our power to get you the equipment and the ammunition that you need. And you mentioned 155 millimeter artillery shells, 120 millimeter tank shells, and other systems like the HIMARS missiles that you also just discussed. One of things that we are working hard at, at President Biden's direction, is to increase the production of all of these types of ammunition here in the United States but also in NATO countries so that the total supply of each of these different forms of ammunition grows month by month and we can continue to move to the frontlines this ammunition and the quantities that is necessary for you to be able to mount a successful defense and for you to be able to take back territory that has been occupied by Russia. This is not something we can do with the snap of a finger. But it's something that we are putting immense effort and resources into.",

I want you to meet Walter Landgraf. He served in the U.S. Army for 19 years. He has a question for Administrator Power. Walter? WALTER LANDGRAF, U.S. ARMY: Thank you for the opportunity. What vital interest does the United States have in Ukraine? From a national security perspective, it seems that avoiding nuclear war with Russia is most important. However, the continued material support to Ukraine raises the possibility that nuclear escalation might occur. Our strategy seems to rely on the rationality of Vladimir Putin to not go nuclear.

      "sentences": "What I find so interesting about that perspective, we can't operate in the world because we have to operate at home, is it presents a fundamentally false choice that is not at all who America is. We can both invest at home and provide for the safety and well- being of the American people, and we can lead in the world. And that's what we have done at our best. Under Democratic and Republican presidents for decades.The United States is capable, as a powerful, self-assured nation, we have the resources, we have the talents, we have the energies of our people to solve our own problems here, and President Biden has done more in two years to invest in this country, to build jobs, to provide for the social safety net, to deal with the problems that people sit around their kitchen tables and think about, while at the same time mobilizing a coalition of free nations to support the values that Americans hold so dear. So what I would say to those senators is, yes, let's do these things at home, but are you saying that America is incapable of also helping to serve a powerful force for good in the world? I don't think that the American people believe that. I think the American people think we are capable of doing both. And at our best that is exactly what we have done and I believe that a lot of the moments I've seen in this last year in Ukraine, from those flags waving in small towns to the people in the U.S. government who are trying to support folks like Yegor on the frontlines, that has been America at its best. And so I think that there is a pessimism in this argument that these senators are making. President Biden has an optimistic view, which is we can do it and we should do it and we are doing it. And as a result, I believe that democracies in the world are getting stronger, not weaker as the president said, and autocracies are getting weaker, not stronger. And that is better for every single person in this country. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Big companies suspended operations inside Russia. At the same time, other countries like China, India and Turkey, ramped up trade with Russia and Russia's central bank took steps to prop up its currency.Here to help us understand the full impact on Putin's war chest is the economist Larry Summers, former president of Harvard. He served as treasury secretary under Bill Clinton and the director of National Economic Council under Barack Obama. Larry, welcome. Explain to us first is economics really central to understanding where we are in this struggle with Russia? LARRY SUMMERS, FORMER U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY: I think it is, Fareed. War start as wars of maneuver and that is what Putin hoped it would be, and he would win quickly, but they evolved to be wars of attrition. And when it is wars of attrition, the economic strength on the two sides, the capacity to mobilize, to produce weaponry, to bring troops to the front becomes central. And that is the concern right now that this has evolved towards a war of attrition and that is going to make what happens to the Russian economy and of even greater importance what happens to the Ukrainian economy central to how this plays out.",

Resources of Iraq, after Iraq went into Kuwait, were seized to support the reconstruction of Kuwait and also to compensate other nations further away who have been victims of that conflict.And that needs to be the ultimately source of support in Ukraine. It needs to be an ultimate source of support for countries taking refugees from Ukraine. And it needs to be an ultimate source of support for countries in global south, the developing world that have paid and suffered enormously from higher food and energy crisis because of Russian aggression. I believe that if this sets a precedent that countries that engage in naked cross-border aggression will lose their state assets, that is a precedent that I think is a very healthy precedent to set.",

I want to ask you to start by talking about something that I found very interesting in reporting you've done before this article but including this article, which is President Biden has said a couple of times, I think, once the body bags start coming back, the Russian people will stop supporting this war.

In my reporting, across Russia what I found when talking to people, mothers of those who have been lost or relatives, people are finding that their losses are actually making them support the war even more. They're starting to feel it even more.And of course, the Kremlin has refused to actually release the full statistical data of how many people have been killed, how many soldiers have died in this war. You know, they've only released them intermittently and I believe the last full count was in September at 6,000. While western intelligence estimates that there have been 200,000 killed and wounded in this war of Russians only. So, of course, many Russians, most Russians don't know the full extent of this. But my reporting and reporting by other colleagues who remain in Russia and who have spoken to the mothers and relatives of these dead soldiers, find that this makes them supportive it even more because, you know, they feel a concrete sense of loss. They do believe, the propaganda that the government has been pushing, not only for the past year but also before. But it has really ramped up this year is that the West seeks to destroy Russia and this is an existential struggle for Russia's survival against the West. And they also are increasingly buying the line that, you know, actually the West was preparing an invasion and that Putin was smart to take a preemptive -- to preemptively invade Ukraine. It is quite surprising and quite shocking. But this is where we are right now one year in.",

You know, as you know, initially when this was planned, it was planned as a blitzkrieg. It was -- they thought they would take Kyiv in three days, change the government and just occupy.But instead, you know, this has required a societal transformation and Konstantin Malofeyev, this businessman said, this is great because, you know, if the blitzkrieg had succeeded, we would still have these liberal elements of our society. But now that the longer it goes on the more this changes into the society that Putin wants. The more liberals are either silenced or forced to flee, the more free speech is suppressed, and the more it is possible to create educational, cultural institutions and even civil society, into the type of organizations and bodies that the Kremlin wants to see, which are traditional, conservative and essentially define themselves as the antithesis to the values that the West professes to stand for.",

And much of that is due to the fact that the economy has sort of more or less remained normal. But it is possible that, you know, at a certain point that there may be some tipping point.
