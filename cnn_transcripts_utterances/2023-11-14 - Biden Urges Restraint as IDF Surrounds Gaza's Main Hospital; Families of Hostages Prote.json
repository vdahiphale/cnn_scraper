Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier who was captured in 2006, his family marched from Northern Israel to Jerusalem.

I mean, you know, social media, but almost a body man in terms of how much he travels and is close to the president. I want to use this word advisedly, but from a civic sense, what she is saying, Scavino is saying, We're not going to leave; we don't care. We're not going to give up power, is in a civic sense, evil. It shows contempt for our democracy on a fundamental level. And let me connect the dots here. It also is a foreshadowing for what we're seeing now in terms of the campaign Donald Trump is running, which is essentially a promising an authoritarian -- more authoritarian, autocratic-type campaign, as a matter of policy and rhetoric. Contempt for democracy. Contempt for democratic norms. That's the way they're campaigning.

Over the course of the last several weeks, U.S. officials, Chinese officials have been trying to hammer out agreements on a set of issues that the two leaders can talk about.Obviously, the two leaders, the two most powerful countries in the world. This is a critical, highly-consequential bilateral meeting, the second that the two have had in person since President Biden has been in office. And one of the areas where they are on the brink of agreement, I am told, according to two people familiar with the matter, is on the issue of fentanyl. Obviously, this is a major issue inside the U.S. It's a major issue for inside the Biden administration. And one of the issues that they have been trying to deal with, trying to grapple with are the precursor chemicals that can be put together in Mexico to actually make fentanyl. China has cracked down, at the administration's request, on actual fentanyl itself, but the precursor chemicals are still being shipped, as you see here from this map, on a regular basis, which are then put together for the fentanyl that has been so deadly inside the United States. How deadly? Well, if you look at this map -- of this chart in terms of how overdoses have risen over the course of the last several years, 112,000 overdoses in the U.S. back between May of 2022 and May of 2023; 77,000 of them were due to synthetic opioids or the fentanyl- related crisis. This has been a top issue from a domestic political perspective. Republicans asking President Biden to take this issue on when he meets face-to-face with President Xi on Wednesday. But also, globally. This is something the administration has been trying to key on. What the agreement would entail -- and it's not finalized yet -- but it essentially is that the Chinese would agree to crack down on the companies that make these chemicals and export those chemicals. The U.S. would be giving them something in return. We'll have to see the details when it's announced. But one of several issues that the presidents will be talking about. These leaders talking about a great power competition -- there's no question about that -- one of which has from a relationship perspective in a very, very low place over the course of the last year or so. One of the critical issues, one of the critical agreements that U.S. officials say they absolutely want to secure, along with fentanyl, is on restoring military-to-military communication, basically broke off all together after Speaker Nancy Pelosi -- then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi traveled to Taiwan back in August of 2022, trying to restore that, finally, at this meeting. Also the issue of Taiwan, always a hot-button issue between these two countries. Climate change, an area where U.S. officials say they can make real progress and have agreements with on China. And trying to mitigate conflicts. At least manage them, understand where both sides stand. That, more than anything else, at this stage with this type of tension around the globe, not just between China and the United States but in the Middle East, obviously in Europe, as well, that relationship, the ability just to communicate, that more than anything else is what U.S. officials are seeking.

      "sentences": "Well, let's first talk about these military issues that you raised, Phil, because certainly they are top of mind.And I think that we will see Xi really emphasize to President Biden that Taiwan is theirs. He also will likely raise some objections to some of the aerial surveillance that we've seen from the United States over the Straits of Taiwan, over the South China Sea. I was talking to one analyst recently, and he pointed out the fact that this relationship between the U.S. and China is one that could quickly spin out of control. And China, in particular, does realize that that would be a very bad thing, if that were to happen. So we're going to definitely see this emphasis on guardrails and red lines that cannot be crossed between these two nations. There are going to be some areas, though, where there is going to be fruitful conversation. I'm going to focus on economics. Right now, the Chinese economy is slow-growing. It's seen a lot of struggles. There's a real-estate crisis here. Young people are having a hard time finding a job. So expect President Xi to tell President Biden that China is open for business. We want foreign dollars. There has been a lot of regulation in the past, but perhaps we can make things easier. Also, expect to see President Xi really emphasize the fact of a successful trade relationship between the United States and China. This is a money-making venture for both countries. Lots of exports on both sides of the Pacific. So expect to hear that. But there's going to be some caution, as we've heard Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen say, this is all about de-risking and not de- coupling, Phil.",
