And breaking news of the investigation to the deadly Georgia school shooting at this hour. A source is telling CNN that the alleged gunman's father told investigators that he bought the gun as a gift for his son, months after son was investigated for a school shooting threat. Plus, a CNN exclusive, Putin's cruelty on display. Video of executions at the hands of ruthless Russian soldiers. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. The breaking news tonight: Kamala Harris with jaw-dropping fundraising numbers, just coming out. CNN is reporting that Harris more than doubled what Trump raised in August. We know that Trump raised $130 million. So just to state the obvious, that means Harris did better than $260 million in just one month. And that is a sign of what we have seen, of course, in polling, the enthusiasm around her campaign clearly very much alive and well, six weeks after she rose to the top of the ticket. Tonight, her running mate, Tim Walz and J.D. Vance, Trump's running mate, are holding dueling rallies, as I mentioned in crucial swing states, Tim Walz is in Pennsylvania right now, dead heat in the latest CNN poll, J.D. Vance wrapping up his remarks in Arizona, where Trump is marginally ahead in our poll, both on the attack. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. TIM WALZ (D-MN), VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Now, I'm going to quote, which I think is a brilliant quote by your great governor, Josh Shapiro. He often says, and I hear him say this, whenever Donald Trump's talking about America, he (EXPLETIVE DELETED) talking America. He does not believe in the promise of America, and he continues to put this country down, whether it's our veterans or working people, he continues to do it. And you know why he does it? You know why he does that? Because he can only think of himself. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And to give you a sense of where the campaign is spending their money.A lot of it is on ads, ads like one that again, airing today in the battleground state of Georgia targeting Black voters, talking about the conservative blueprint Project 2025, warning voters about the further erosion of reproductive rights and the possible elimination of the Department of Education. But the vice president is here in Pennsylvania but to get critical time, critical facetime with voters ahead of the debate. I've been speaking to voters here in Pittsburgh, and they have their head on a swivel to see if they ultimately spot the vice president. Many of them that I spoke to at the University of Pittsburgh and near the campus told me that a number of issues are top of mind for them as we head towards November, including the economy, including LGBTQ rights, including reproductive rights. And I'll end with this, Erin, I spoke to one young man and he is from New York. He just moved to Pennsylvania for grad School at Carnegie Mellon. And he told me that he changed his voter registration to be able to vote in this critical state.

We know that Brian Kemp, Nikki Haley, those are people he has targeted personally. There has been a lot of infighting in the Republican Party around -- unity around Trump for the past year. His bet, this is where you see this with evangelicals also on abortion rights is that they will come back to him in the end from a sense of negative polarization or anti-Democrat-ness, while he expands himself to the middle. We haven't seen him be the best messenger for that, but that's clearly the strategy. On the Democratic side, they have a consistent story they've been telling about reaching out to maybe your non-MAGA Republicans. We saw worked for them in the midterms. And we see kind of Harris and Walz making a concerted effort in the DNC to be for independents, to be for the middle of the base because if there's a warning sign for Harris right now, is that she certainly made up the enthusiasm gap among her base, to put her in the game that Biden was frankly, is completely out of. But we haven't fully seen the independents, the swing, the kind of middle of the road to be able to expand those margins, in particular, in swing-states. That's what her task is now.

The tip included photo attachments with a profile name in Russian, the translated to Adam Lanza, the Sandy Hook shooter.
