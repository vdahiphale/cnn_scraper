As we noted, it's believed that at least one staff member was shot and killed during this incident. We have a panel of experts with us, Ed Davis and Juliette Kayyem have been standing by. And, Juliette, first, I want to go to you. Just given what we've heard from the police chief there, pointing out that there are five deceased, five injured, but that he cannot get into the details of who those folks may be, in part, because families have to be notified that they've lost their next of kin. I do wonder what the process is like to identify a suspect in this situation, one that we should note in which officers discovered this juvenile already deceased when they arrived on the scene.",

I mean, this is a really intense search process. And then once the area is secured and all the victims have been removed, you really have to secure the crime scene. And that can be a multiple-day process. In the Marathon case, it was almost seven days of -- of securing evidence and recovering things. In an internal scene like this, it will probably be a couple of days. But they -- they really have to build a case on this, not for prosecution. Unless, as Juliette said, there's some other person somehow involved in the -- in the -- in the providing of the firearms. But -- but mostly, to just to make sure that we understand this thing right from the beginning to the end. We're trying really hard to figure out where the points of intervention are in situations like this, how you can stop it before it actually goes off. And to understand that, you really need to methodically put together precisely every bit of knowledge that you can glean from the scene, from the background of the shooter, what the online profile is. All of those investigative steps that you use in a regular case will apply here, so that we understand what happened.",
