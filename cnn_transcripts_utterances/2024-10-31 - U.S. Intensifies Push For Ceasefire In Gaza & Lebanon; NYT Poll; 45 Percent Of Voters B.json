I mean, look, and the fact is that the Lebanese prime minister does not unfortunately speak for Hezbollah.But the fact that there are U.S. officials from the White House, from the Biden administration in the region right now, in Israel tonight, and elsewhere in the region as well, is a positive sign that there is this push from the Biden administration to get some sort of ceasefire agreement over the line in the, sort of, the last days before the U.S. presidential election. There are also talks underway about a possibility of a hostage release from Gaza as well. But it's -- you know, it's hard to see at the moment. The Israeli government is going to want to go for something organized at -- at such short notice when there's this presidential election in the offing. Already, Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, has said that if there is any agreement to be had, a ceasefire in Lebanon, Israel must have the ability to enforce that agreement. So we're talking about the broad terms of a Hezbollah withdrawal from southern Lebanon, of a Lebanese army force being put in there to essentially make sure that Hezbollah doesn't come close to the Israeli border. And basically things like that that would allow Israel to send its population, who have been evacuated from the north of the country, back to their homes. In addition, Israel would want the ability to enforce that kind of agreement. And it's not clear that Hezbollah or their Iranian backers are at the point yet where there would be willing to accept that kind of an agreement.",

CHANCEbasically saying in the briefings that we've been having, is that, yes, a lot has been achieved when it comes to Hamas and Hezbollah. For example, there's still stuff that could be done, but the price of any further military action is kind of stacking up. And perhaps there's a way in which, diplomatically, these objectives could be achieved. It all comes down to a political decision. And that goes back to Benjamin Netanyahu, as you say. And he is at the head of a coalition which has right-wing elements in it that do not want the war in Gaza, for instance, even though Hamas has been degraded significantly, they don't want that war come to an end, right now. And so it's a political decision. But Benjamin Netanyahu is also hostage to the -- to the right-wing political parties in his coalition, who may withdraw their support if he backs down on Gaza or does some sort of ceasefire there in Lebanon.",

We've seen both parties try to do that through funding certain more extreme candidates in primaries. Are there any safeguards that you have in mind that might prevent that?",

And it will also do away with other types of gamesmanship.Right now, in Colorado, where there's Prop 131 on the ballot for this system, we're seeing in Colorado, the Democratic Party, which is opposed to this reform, they send out mailers to support a Libertarian candidate in one of the congressional races because they want to peel off votes from Republicans and help their own candidate. This system would also do away with that. It creates a more level playing field and gives a lot more power, more choice, more voice to voters. And it's remarkable to me that, in an election cycle where both parties are bitterly divided, the only thing that they both agree on is to help stop these reforms. The Republican Party in Montana, the Democratic Party in Nevada, they're opposing this because they are clinging to their own power. And I think voters will see through that and support these initiatives.",

Which shows how these reforms aren't about trying to tilt the scales towards one side or the other, but to give voters a lot more voice and choice in their elections. Now, Alaska is also on the ballot this year because opponents who lost under that system and it didn't represent a majority are trying to take that away. And so we're working to defend Alaska in addition to spread this reform in more states. I think it will be a big deal if we end this election cycle with more states having these reforms than we began. And this is going to be a multi-year effort both on the ballot, through legislatures, as more people come to realize and appreciate that, if we want to improve our politics, we have to fix the system.",

So you know whether people would continue to file those types of lawsuits, they certainly could. If there is a chilling effect on those who want to move forward, that is something that may play out. But each of these lawsuits that have been brought or before individual judges and there'll be evaluated on their individual basis, there are a number of allegations involving people who were minors at the time of the assault.
