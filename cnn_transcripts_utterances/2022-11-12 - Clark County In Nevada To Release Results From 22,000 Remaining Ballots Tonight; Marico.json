I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.We begin this hour in election overtime, with all eyes on Nevada, which could decide the balance of power in the Senate. Right now, fewer than 900 votes separating incumbent Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto and Trump-backed Republican challenger Adam Laxalt. The race is too early to call. But Democrats of course need just one more seat in the Senate to keep control. In Arizona right now CNN is now projecting that incumbent Democrat Senator Mark Kelly will hold on to his seat, fending off Republican Blake Masters, who has not yet called Kelly to concede. Here's where the balance of power stands in the Senate right now. 49 Democrats and 49 Republicans. So if Democrats pick up one more seat, Vice President Kamala Harris would be the ultimate tiebreaker, giving Democrats control of the Senate chamber. And on the House side, Republicans are inching closer to taking control, but that too is still being decided vote-by-vote and race-by-race. Let's begin in Nevada where thousands of ballots are still being counted. CNN's Rosa Flores joins us from North Las Vegas. Rosa, what's latest on your end?",

And they said, quote, \"We remain confident.\" Now here's a state of play in the state of Nevada. There are more than 50,000 ballots yet to be counted. Here's a quick breakdown, more than 1,000 are in the Republican stronghold of Douglas County. There's more than 12,000 in the swing county of Washoe. And the majority of them, more than 23,000 mail-in and also election day drop-off ballots are right here in Clark County.

And as you look forward, that is very good news for Democrats and bad news for Republicans because these issues are going to remain. The Supreme Court has ruled in the Dobbs decision. And as long as Trump is around, we're going to be having conversations about democracy. So that's good news right now, today, as they count the votes. It is trending well for Democrats.

I was talking to Trump advisers earlier this week about this. I have one adviser saying he was livid and he was -- you know, he was screaming at everybody.

It's not as easy as quitting Trump. You have to be willing to quit all of his voters. And a good number of his voters are QAnon, Proud Boys, anti-Semites, you know, racists.Not all his voters, but a chunk of them are really some, you know, terrible strains of hate and bigotry. And Republicans have been all- too willing to let those folks creep into the party because they were voting Republican. If you're not willing to say we don't want your votes, we disavow you and we don't want you in Congress either, then you're just going to keep getting Trumpism on repeat.

So they brought this footage to a former NASA astronaut, who looked at it and said, I think you need to bring it to NASA. They brought it to NASA and just this week, Jim, NASA confirmed that this is indeed a piece of the space shuttle Challenger. And the heat shield tiles, what they would have done, those white squares, is they would have protected space shuttle Challenger from the very high temperatures that it would have encountered when it reentered the earth's atmosphere. But of course, it never made it that far. Space shuttle Challenger, you know, blew up very shortly after liftoff back in January of 1986. And so now the big question becomes, you know, what does NASA do with this because by law any piece of a space shuttle, be it Columbia or Challenger or any other space shuttle, it belongs to the U.S. government and is still U.S. property.
