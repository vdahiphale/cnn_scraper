There were several warning signs, though. Most of the people in his camp, they had been telling me for weeks that they were going to press on until Iowa. Iowa or bust you would often hear. But his team had worried about qualifying for the fourth Republican debate next month after being the last candidate to meet the donor and polling thresholds to make last week's debate. Here's how they're thinking about this. They're telling us, \"Tim ran an optimistic, hopeful message, but that's not where the Republican base is right now.\" By leaving the race now, people close to his campaign say he can return to the Senate without an embarrassing finish in Iowa. But it is remarkable because he didn't even make it to his home state of South Carolina. And he has the money to do so. His opponents, like Nikki Haley, Chris Christie, and others, they're praising Scott for being a good man of faith, a man of integrity. Something else, John, that really sticks out to me, you know, he was the only candidate explicitly endorsing a 15-week national abortion ban in this contest. Something that he thought would really help him we with evangelical voters in Iowa. There is now no one else in the field, no one prominent in the field endorsing that 15-week ban. They're all saying leave it to the states. Perhaps a strategy to appeal to as many voters as possible.",

The new speaker is already facing some opposition from fellow House Republicans, potentially setting up a similar but no less challenging math problem for him. Lose a few Republicans means you may need to go get support from Democrats.CNN's Lauren Fox joins us from Capitol Hill this morning with the very latest.

This plan keeps government funding at the current levels that it has been at for the last year. So, that's a major victory for Democrats. And because of that fact, there are a number of conservatives who are now saying that they are opposed to this, that they will not support it on the floor. More than four Republicans now saying that they will not back this. And that means Johnson's going to have to get some Democratic support when this comes to the floor as soon as tomorrow.Now, one thing to keep an eye on is how many Democrats get behind this proposal. And are Republicans able to pass a procedural rule vote tomorrow on their own, or do they need Democratic support for that as well? Those are some of the key things to keep an eye on. Meanwhile, in the United States Senate, you also have a lot of Senate Democrats keeping their powder dry about this. An initial statement from a Democratic leadership source was essentially that this is a bill that keeps spending at current levels. Obviously, Kate, that's another big victory for Democrats. But, again, this is going to set up a very unique fiscal cliff because it's going to happen in two parts. If this bill passes, part of government agencies will run out of funding on January 19th. The other half will run out of funding on February 2nd. So, it's going to be a very busy winter if, indeed, this bill can get through the United States House and Senate and signed by the president by Friday.",

SUSAN PAGE, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, \"USA TODAY\": Yes, this is not the year of the happy warrior. This is the year of the apocalyptic message on both sides about how catastrophic things are in this country, or how catastrophic they'd be if the other guy was elected. So, he was -- he was out of step. Now, that doesn't mean we won't have the possibility of seeing him again because I was struck by his answer last night to whether he was interested in running for vice president on a Trump ticket, and he said that was, quote, \"not on my to do list.\" Well, that is not exactly a Sherman-esque statement of saying, if elected I will not serve. I mean how hard would it be to put it on his to do list if Trump did that? BERMAN: That's like, I have no plans to be on the ticket. Well, you know what, you make those plans later on. These things can change. He did not shut the door to being anyone's running mate there. There was actually a fair amount of establishment support for Tim Scott.

But with Trump's really formidable lead, they may also be nervous about supporting anything but Trump.As you saw the - the -- Scott himself did not make any endorsement in the race.

And the reason I think that's important is because we have to remember that we're talking about the sitting mayor of the largest city in America. And the FBI felt the need to present a case to a district court judge to get a probable cause search warrant to get a hold of the mayor's phones.Now, we don't know why exactly just yet, but certainly these FBI investigators seem to think there is some sort of evidence in those electronics that they needed to get a hold of. Whether they show that there was a crime committed, we just don't know that. We also don't know if it will show that it was the mayor who in any way is culpable here so far. He has not been named as an official part of the investigation. Then we flash forward to the weekend, and on Sunday we learned that part of this investigation is specifically looking into whether or not the mayor used his authority in September of 2021, shortly after having secured the Democratic nomination, to help out his constituents. The Turkish consulate, as you said, was rushing ahead to open up their headquarters. They had yet to secure a certificate of safety. And Eric Adams allegedly stepped in to try and get the fire department to approve that quickly so that the Turkish consulate could have its event and open on time. The mayor has issued a statement in response to this. Essentially acknowledging that he did try and help the consulate. He said that, \"as borough president, part of my routine role was to notify government agencies of issues on behalf of constituents and constituencies. I have not been accused of wrongdoing and I will continue to cooperate with investigators.\" So, Fred, what the mayor is saying there is that he believes that this communication with the Turkish consulate was just part of his job he was doing as borough president. But that will, of course, be determined by investigators who are also looking into whether or not the campaign accepted donations from foreign nationals. Fred.",

Everybody had existing heart disease, so a prior heart attack, stroke or peripheral artery disease. And everybody had a BMI of at least 27. So considered in the overweight category. And what they found, and surprisingly, is that there was weight loss of almost 10 percent in this clinical trial of a patient's body weight. They also saw improvements in blood sugar, blood pressure, triglycerides and a marker of inflammation. And, most important, that heart result, a 20 percent reduction in the risk of a heart attack, stroke or heart related death. So, that is the key finding.
