Sullivan acknowledging that Navalny's death complicated the ability to move those talks forward, but eventually they got that deal. And that deal, he said, did not involve at any point what (INAUDIBLE) Brianna, Boris?",

She also said that at times when she was walking through Capitol Hill, she was afraid to run into her because the Congresswoman was so forceful and single-minded in her effort to persuade folks to jump on board the issues that she was working so hard on. A touching moment there from the Vice President in dedicating that eulogy for the Congresswoman.Later today, Harris is expected to return to Washington, where the news today is of historic proportions, this prisoner swap between the United States, its partners and Russia, a big moment that Harris apparently played a role in as well. Let's take you live to Houston now with CNN's Arlette Saenz. And, Arlette, this also comes with the backdrop of a presidential campaign. And just 24 hours ago, we heard former President Donald Trump in Chicago questioning Harris' racial identity.",

That was conveyed to the U.S. Intelligence Community just a few weeks ago, and this took so many twists and turns, Boris and Brianna.What was made clear, I was told, in November of 2023, so almost a year ago, was that the Russians would not accept any deal without Vadim Krasikov, the FSB colonel who carried out that assassination of a Chechen in Berlin. The U.S. had tried all different kinds of combinations to have a deal in which they would - in which Russia would get back a couple of their spies from other countries. The U.S. would get back Gershkovich and Paul Whelan. That wasn't going to happen, according to the Russians. So the discussions continued throughout this year. The name Alexei Navalny was floated, of course, the biggest Russian opposition figure. He was in Russian custody. The Germans wanted him out. So that was being discussed. But then he died in Russian prison in February. So then the U.S. started applying pressure to the Germans to try to figure out what they could do or what - or who they could - who else could be released to the Russians in order for the Germans to release Krasikov. They eventually got to this extraordinary deal that we're seeing take place today: Some 24 detainees from seven different countries, all being exchanged on the tarmac at Ankara airport. Just a tremendous feat of diplomacy, of alliances, as Jake Sullivan just said, at the White House, a truly historic moment, not just in terms of the size of the number of prisoners being released today, but also the number of countries involved.

They'll conclude and try to spread propaganda to the effect that they've successfully traded what they consider to be spies for spies. Of course, that's not true because Putin is a liar. And because if you just look at the people that he released, journalists, political dissidents, against the people that he wanted, murderers, thieves, and thugs, you can see the difference between who each side values.The American side valued people that spoke up for human rights, including people who spoke up for human rights inside Russia. And Putin valued spies, murderers and thieves. And so you can expect Putin to try to spin this as a win. But I think for any fair-minded person who's not consuming Russian propaganda, it's pretty clear what makes our two countries so different on this very important day.",
