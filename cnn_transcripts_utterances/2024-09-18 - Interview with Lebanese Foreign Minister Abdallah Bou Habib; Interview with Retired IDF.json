Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. Walkie-talkies exploded today in Lebanon, a day after Israel remotely detonated Hezbollah's network of pagers. Israel's defense minister today says a new phase of war is beginning, and that the center of gravity is moving north, meaning towards Lebanon. The two stunning attacks killed more than a dozen people and injured thousands. Hezbollah is vowing revenge. The group, which while the West designates it as a terrorist organization, is actually also a powerful political party with 13 seats in the Lebanese parliament. Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib was the country's ambassador to the United States, also worked once as the economist at the World Bank, and he is now joining us from Beirut.

I don't think they can return -- the those who -- refugees who went from their villages in the north in this way because Israel was in Lebanon and had to run away in Lebanon. Of course, they stayed 22 years, but there were too many killings of Israelis there. So, I don't think Israel would want to occupy South (INAUDIBLE), because this time there is just as stronger than it was in the past. So, I really don't understand the Israelis because they -- if they want to go to get back their people to the north, those who were displaced to the north, to their villages and settlements, they have to negotiate.

Pamela Harriman, daughter-in-law of Winston Churchill and eventual American ambassador to France, was frequently dismissed as little more than a sexy social climber. But nearly three decades after her death, a new biography is re-examining the legacy of Harriman and her extraordinary life. \"Kingmaker\" reveals an amazing tale of subterfuge, seduction, and high society that ended in shaping some of the 20th century's critical moments.

So, I knew about her then but I also knew that her own papers, huge numbers of letters and diaries and minutes and transcripts were going to be made open for the first time in the Library of Congress. Now, this was during COVID, but I beetled over there in a window in the lockdown and went into the library there. And what I found really blew my socks off. I thought this was going to be a book that might take me two or three years. In the end, it was five years. She did so much more to create what you just described as modern history than even I had any idea. And I'd already looked into her past a fair amount.

Bosnia was her big test. She remembered what it was like from the war, what it was like to be in the blitz. She gave birth during an air raid. She knew the horror and terror of war in a way that these guys that she was working with didn't. They were too young to remember or they'd been born after the war. She brought her a moral compass, if you like, to those negotiations.

Very, very few, probably numbered on the fingers of one hand, ever quite achieve it in the way that she did.

Why did you want to approach all the conversations that you featured in this book with this particular band or this thesis? AYANA ELIZABETH JOHNSON, AUTHOR, \"WHAT IF WE GET IT RIGHT?\":  The title question really helps to frame or reframe the climate conversation around solutions. I think so often we're talking about the problem or we're talking exclusively about technology and electricity, and we're not really thinking about all the solutions we have at our fingertips and the transformation that's required to our economy and society in order to accelerate implementation of all of those. So, I really just wanted to say to people, we have the solutions we need, right? We know how to do clean energy and public transit and green our buildings and shift our agriculture and protect and restore ecosystems, right? None of this like a big mystery. We -- it's just a matter of the speed and scale at which we're able to get those solutions happening out in the world.

And the constituents, when you poll, there is definitely a difference between Republicans and Democrats. But interestingly still, the majority of people would like our government to do more to protect clean air and clean water, right? So, we don't actually have to spend all of our time arguing about the details of climate change or even the origins of it, we can just agree to get to work on the solutions. People in Ohio and Texas are very excited that their states have the biggest amount of wind energy. Those are good jobs, right? It's not just for hippies. It's like a really financially viable market, renewable energy, right? And for young people, there is a ton of concern across party lines but much more than others might expect for young Republicans who are like, well, you're setting our planet on fire. Can you please stop? Right? So, there's this generational shift happening, which I think is really promising. And there's also very significant differences across race in the country. It's something like 47 percent of white Americans are concerned about climate change compared to 65 percent of black and Asian Americans, and 70 percent of Latinos. So, when we think about the typical environmentalist, we probably are thinking of a notion that's not actually borne out by the demographics and the polling.
