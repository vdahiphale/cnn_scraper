They're trying to get more information and we don't note know a lot right now. But, Kylie, one area that you do have a ton of expertise is on is uncovering how the United States operates in situations like this. Much of that is behind the scenes. Very little of it is known that well.And I think one of the questions is, do we have any idea who this individual may be? And also, what is the United States doing in a situation where there are no diplomatic pipelines open, no contacts that actually exist with the country where a U.S. person has been detained?",

      "sentences": "Yes. Well, I do think we need to note that we don't know much at all about who this American is right now. We don't know if it's a male, if it's a female, if they were just, you know, an American who is going on one of these joint security tours when they were visiting South Korea or if they were a member of the military.We just don't know right now who this person was, and that is a critical question because that will influence, kind of, the conversations that are had between the U.S. and South Korea, and then, of course, potentially North Korea to try to secure their release. But to your point about the fact that the United States doesn't have regular diplomatic relations with North Korea, particularly right now in the Biden administration, that makes a situation like this even more complicated at this moment in time because it's not as if there have been lines opened between the two governments so that U.S. officials can pick up and call over to the North Koreans. The Biden administration has repeatedly said that they are open to talks with North Korea. They are open to talks without preconditions, essentially saying that North Korea wouldn't have to break down its nuclear program in order to engage in those talks, but we haven't seen any interest in the North Korean side up until this point during the Biden administration. It was very different during the Trump administration. As we recall, there were two summits between President Trump and Kim Jong-un. And so, there were open lines of communication. But when you talk to officials who were in the Trump administration leading those conversations, those lines just aren't open in the way that they used to be. So, that makes a moment like this even more complicated, even more challenging, even more delicate. And rest assured that the U.S. is going through their incredibly close ally South Korea right now to try and figure out what they can do on behalf the United States to really work on this situation. As Will was saying, this demilitarized are between North Korea and South Korea has a lot of different assets to it. You know, I've have been to this area. It's an area where you can look over and you can see the North Koreans, but the North Koreans aren't right there in front of the U.N. Command who is in charge of maintaining this area. They are quite far ways away. So, it's interesting that according to the U.N. Command that this American crossed over this demarcation line without authorization and then is believed to be in North Korean custody. What that indicates is that the North Koreans were in some way ready for it, potentially, and were looking to potentially detain someone. Of course, we'll learn much more about this, you know, in the hours to come.",

What we do know is that according to the United Nations Command on Twitter, a U.S. national has crossed the military demarcation line into North Korea during a joint security area tour.Priscilla, at that -- on that issue, specifically, White House officials are clearly aware of what's going on right now.

What was the circumstance that this U.S. national may have crossed or how -- that we know crossed into North Korea.So, in a situation like this, officials are backchanneling. They're trying to get information from the allies they have in the region. As you heard from Will and Kylie, this is complicated because there is no line of communication with North Korea. But what can be done in the region or with the United Nations Command to try to understand how this U.S. national crossed into North Korea and got -- was -- is now in custody are all questions that White House officials have that they're working on getting information on. I have asked the White House for any comment or any information they can share us with. They haven't provided any yet. But, Phil, let me remind you that this is a White House that cares deeply and has made detained Americans a priority. In fact, just last week, we heard from President Biden about a separate case, an American journalist detained in Russia, but he said this in his response to reporters when asked about that. He said, \"I'm serious about doing all we can to free Americans who are being illegally held in Russia or anywhere for that matter.\" So, this is top of mind for President Biden and other cases of detained Americans. You can imagine that the White House working furiously around the clock to try to determine what happened here and what is going to be done moving forward.",

And the detained Americans issue, as Colonel Leighton was just saying, it builds on itself that when a rogue state like North Korea sees what Russia does, it seems to embolden them in some ways. Will, I want to go back to you on the question of where do we go from here. And as Kylie said, South Korea is a key ally, likely to be leaned on by the United States in figuring this out. But what about China? What role do you think China will play as they are a close ally of North Korea's? And while they are not necessarily allied with the United States, there is some communication that happens there.",

U.S. officials have constantly said, look, if there is one issue, we should constantly be talking about it's about North Korea. There is interest on both sides in terms of North Korea not doing the next nuclear test that I think everybody has long been expecting. There has been a shift in terms of U.S. contacts over the course of the last couple of weeks. We had Secretary Yellen go over there, I believe the president's Climate Envoy, John Kerry, met with Wang Yi, the top foreign policy official for President Xi Jinping yesterday, I believe, if my timing is correct.I'm interested in if you think that that could end up being a helpful line of communication that's been, sort of, reopened over the course of the last couple of the weeks?",

And when you do have what is becoming more regular contact between the U.S. and Chinese officials, that is noteworthy in a situation like this.John Kerry is actually in China right now meeting with his counterparts over there. Talking, of course, about climate change. But we should note that John Kerry was the former secretary of state. He is someone with an incredible diplomatic history. You know, he is someone that is probably being alerted to this situation right now, and potentially, you know, could play a role. We don't know what that looks like. But it is noteworthy that he is there. That the Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, traveled to China just last month, and also that the secretary of treasury was also in China earlier this month. I think, also, we should note the timeline here when it comes to Americans being detained in North Korea. Just to sort of give people context about how North Korea has used Americans who are wrongfully detained to engage with the U.S. side. Otto Warmbier was released in 2017. There were then three other Americans who were detained in North Korea and released in 2018, and later that year was when we saw the first summit between President Trump and Kim Jong-un. There was a second summit that following year. So, it's very clear that in the past these, Americans have been used as leverage by North Korea to engage with the U.S. side to get something out of the United States that they want in that situation. It did lead to them getting accolades, getting attention on the world stage, standing by the leader of the free world when President Trump was in office. So, that's noteworthy, and I think we should consider that context when we're having this conversation. But clearly on the China front, very important to watch that John Kerry is there right now.",
