The U.N. can confirm at least 180 dead after three days of fighting, at least 1,800 wounded, although the actual numbers will almost certainly be much higher. According to residents in the densely populated capital, Monday saw the worst of the fighting with heavy shelling late into the night, while airstrikes and artillery fire have left many parts of Khartoum without power, water and internet service. Witnesses report heavy clashes in the presidential palace and the army command building. Khartoum's airport is no longer in operation after airstrikes from fighter jets and attack helicopters. Each side accuses the other of violating a temporary ceasefire. With the violence forcing the U.N. and other humanitarian groups to shut down aid programs nationwide. Residents of the capitol have been told to stay indoors. Both sides are accused of targeting hospitals, which are short on blood and other crucial supplies. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with leaders of both military factions urging a ceasefire and sources say Egypt and the United Arab Emirates are working on a peace plan. But the U.N. envoy to Sudan says neither side is willing to negotiate. We have more details now from CNN's Nima Elbagir. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIMA ELBAGIR, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Sudan's military with a show of strength over the capital Khartoum. As birdsong and artillery fire echo, this country roiled in recent years by conflict and coups, is once again the placing of strongmen and what the military is calling an attempted coup. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, Sudan's military's leader, is fighting for dominance with Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, who leads the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, which gain notoriety in the western Darfur region, and it is the most vulnerable who are paying the price. Two doctors organization say that in Khartoum, both sides have hit hospitals in the fighting, at least half a dozen, though both sides deny it. CNN obtained eyewitness accounts from doctors on the ground who told CNN that the paramilitary Rapid Support Force directly targeted a hospital where wounded armed forces, soldiers and their families were being treated, including one doctor who says she witnessed the RSF approach Al Amal (PH) hospital in central Khartoum. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): I have to be strong enough to speak to you, you're the one that's going to tell the world what's happening to us. The evacuation was chaos.

Because first of all, you alluded to that you have to remember what kind of baseline we are comparing these numbers against. In 2022, especially the month of March, because the first two months of the year, always seeing things slow down because of lunar new year holidays. So March is what matters. March 2022 what was happening? That was when Shanghai, the financial hub of the country, the biggest city of this country, was about to enter a very brutal two-month lockdown. So that was the kind of baselines were against, these very healthy rebound numbers against. So not entirely surprising. And the other thing is these rebound not evenly distributed across different sectors and across different segments of the population. For example, the officials here very proud to talk about consumer spending, especially in the service sectors. Anecdotally of course, we have seen that. Hotel rooms, flights and resorts once empty, now filled with people again, with prices for airfares and hotel rooms shooting through the roof in some cases. But people are not buying new homes, not buying new cars. These big- ticket item purchases not coming back. Speaking of homes, the real-estate sector still described by some experts in a slow motion crash as developers are running out of money to not only not starting new projects, but even having difficulties finishing already pre-sold apartments. Same thing about unemployment. Officially urban unemployment, 5.5 percent, very low. But when you dig a bit deeper, youth unemployment -- that's the people between the age of 16 and 24 -- that number shot up to 19.6 percent in March. That's the second worst number on record. So as you can imagine, that is very worrisome for this -- for this leadership, who, of course, is very much always concerned about social instability.

It is a huge franchise, with not one but two movies to its name, plus a lot of Angry Bird game versions. Just look at all of these: Angry Birds Star Wars, Angry Birds Reloaded, Angry Birds Football. In fact, you could question whether there is any room for growth when it comes to Rovio's star franchise. But secondly, it gets a company that has seen huge success in mobile gaming. And this is an area that Sega Samy wants to grow in. The company sees this segment outpacing others in terms of gaming growth. They expect mobile gaming to account for 56 percent of the global market by 2026.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) (GUNSHOTS) VEDIKA SUD, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Gunshots fired over and over again. Seconds later, police officers restrained two men chanting Hindu religious slogans. They pinned down a third. These dramatic scenes of the cold-blooded assassination in India's Uttar Pradesh state were broadcast live on television. It all went down within minutes.

Police believe both men were part of a local organized crime ring, handcuffed and flanked by policemen, Ahmed was being escorted to a hospital when approached by reporters. The attackers were hiding among the TV crews. Ahmed carried questions from the journalists, his response brief and dismissive. Seconds later, the first gunshot went off. Ahmed fell to the ground. And then more gunshots, over a dozen, killing him and his brother. Facing heavy criticism from opposition leaders, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, a Hindu nationalist, ordered a probe into the killings.

What's surprising about them is that they form old reef structures. We haven't found such extensive and developed coral reefs in this depth. They are at least thousands of years old or more, and they are in original state. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
