Walter Isaacson speaks to Bush's attorney general, Alberto Gonzales, about why he thinks his fellowRepublicans are wrong about bias in the Justice Department. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in Kyiv, Ukraine, at a time when the country is under the microscope for any progress in its critical counteroffensive. Breaking through Russian defenses in the south, the Ukrainian military is reporting advances in the near Robotyne in the Zaporizhzhia region. As battles continue along the front lines, some local officials say they're evacuating children from areas close to the fighting. Now, Correspondent Melissa Bell has found out all about that despite these military gains, little has changed for civilians living amid the toll of war. And she has this report from Stepnogorsk, just four miles from the Zaporizhzhia front line. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MELISSA BELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): The water is for the animal left behind. Svetlana (ph) draws some each week as she waits for her own supply, or rather her villages. It's too dangerous for emergency services, so she will carry it the rest of the way. I can't abandon the people, she says, the elderly. And quotes a Soviet era saying, if not you, then who? But even in the center of Stepnogorsk there aren't many people left. The Russians are only five kilometers away.",

So far, they say that the counteroffensive hasn't made things much worse in terms of shelling nor though they say has it made things any better. BELL (voiceover): It's dangerous every day, say Igor Samsonenko (ph). Overnight, the roof of that house was hit, there was shelling yesterday afternoon and a building was on fire just the other day. As we inspect the damage done by last night's artillery fire, a Russian drone inspects us, exploding just as we leave. But little phases the local emergency services who've been showing us around. People are used to the war, says Mikola Malikin (ph), before a shell interrupts him. Those the emergency services can't get to rely on people like Svetlana (ph). She will now walk with what she can push on her bike for more than an hour towards enemy fire. But with her dog for company, she says, she's never afraid. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

You're seeing really the future of warfare at a small scale, short distances, not long and not linked to satellites and so forth, but really very impressive. Well, the Russians have used electronic warfare quite effectively. Both sides have figured out how to shoot down drones. So, you're seeing this back and forth. And again, to be very fair to them, they established a very formidable defensive system in the south in particular. Ironically, of course, the general that oversaw most of that, Surovikin, has actually been fired. That was part of the purge associated with Prigozhin. He was seen as too close to Prigozhin. So, again, they have adapted, but so have the Ukrainians. And again, they understand what they have, they understand what they don't have, and they're making the most of what it is that they do have. When it comes to manpower, I do think we should remember though that while the Russian population may be three to four times larger than that of Ukraine, Putin has never fully mobilized. He's tried to have the brunt of this war fall not on the Moscow elite or the well-educated and wealthy, it's on those that are much farther from the capital. And we'll have to see if that is sustainable over time. He's only done partial mobilization, as you'll recall. This is still a special operation, in his terminology, not a war. And he's trying to shield much of the population from it. But again, this summer and how the Ukrainians do and whether they're able to cut the lines of communication that Russia uses, along the southeast coast of Ukraine from Russia proper and then up through Crimea. Again, if the Ukrainians -- they don't have to actually cut the actual routes, they just have to be in range of them with artillery to disrupt them, to degrade them and to take out, for example, the bridges and other routes that come from Crimea to Southern Ukraine. If they can do that, they may be able to change the dynamics of this war. While we are, of course, also leading the effort, the U.S. is leading the effort to impose greater, tighter sanctions on financial, personal, and economic entities and also, to expand export controls and to enforce those to the greatest extent that we possibly can. At the end of this day end -- end of the day, this war might possibly end with some kind of negotiated resolution.

I mean, it appears after the Prigozhin events that, you know, any attempt to step out of line against Putin is going to be twice, thrice and, you know, 60 million times rethought.

And I -- you -- as you well know, I had a little bit of second guessing. You know, I had five combat commands as a general officer, and, you know, occasionally the backgrounders back in Washington or something like that could be, you know, a bit frustrating. But at the end of the day, this will come down to results on the battlefield, just as it was with the surge in Iraq. I remember being told that we had a P.R. problem out there. I said, no, we have a results problem. And once the results change and they're demonstrably better, the P.R. problem will go away. And they're in the process of trying to achieve those demonstrable results that will have real operational significance as well.

I'm not going to get into anything less than full liberation, but again, we'll see, especially if it includes, of course, a very substantial marshal like reconstruction plan. The E.U. and others are working hard on that, and it's desperately needed, as you've seen in the country now, there again. And also, if it includes a, a guaranteed pass to NATO membership. All of that, I think, could change the dynamics just as could in awareness in Moscow, that, you know what, this is our new Afghanistan. It -- they only lost \"15,000\" troops only in 10 years in Afghanistan. They have lost many, many times that much just in the first year and a half of this war. So, again, whether Russia can sustain this, noting that yes, their economy is many times that of Ukraine's and yes, their population is several times larger as well, we will have to see how that evolves, but the Ukrainians certainly are intent on demonstrating to the Russians that this is a losing proposition and we need to do everything we possibly can together with our allies and partners around the world to enable them to do that.",

And so, you invite great danger if you start making decisions like that. And so, that's why I really questioned this notion that the department has become politicized simply because it's prosecuting Donald Trump, because he's the leading front runner for Republican nomination. And I've tried to emphasize, remind people or tell people that, in my judgment, even if he weren't running for president, he would be investigated and be prosecuted for the things that he's being accused of committing.

It's the only thing that I could think of why Republicans are now upset. The other reason they might be upset is because of the special prosecutor. Before the appointment of the special prosecutor, I think that they had hopes that they would have access to internal DOJ documentation. But now, with a special prosecutor and an ongoing investigation, those documents are going to be shielded from the Congress until the investigation or prosecution is finished. So, there's some level of frustration. So, I think as an example of, you know, that old adage, be careful what you wish for, because once you get it, you realize this is not what we wanted. But at the end of the day, the main objective here is to investigate Hunter Biden and to prosecute him if, in fact, he's engaged in criminal wrongdoing. And one, there shouldn't be any connection between what happens there and what happens with Donald Trump. Every prosecution is based upon the facts of a particular case, and there is some discretion, obviously, in the prosecutor that's looking at the evidence and deciding whether to move forward. But again, every prosecution is going to be different.",

And yet, on top of that, the fact that that is very typical of Donald Trump conduct. And so, maybe we've become sort of immune to the kind of rhetoric that he says. But I think he needs to be careful. The judge, with respect to the January 6th cases, appears to be a judge that's pretty strict and is going to be held -- is going to held everyone accountable in connection with that trial. And so, I think he needs to be careful. I think he's -- obviously, his lawyers are speaking to him about this, whether or not he abides or listens to what his lawyers say I think is open to question.
