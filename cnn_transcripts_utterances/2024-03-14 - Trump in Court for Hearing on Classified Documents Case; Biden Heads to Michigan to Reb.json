      "sentences": "Good morning. You are live in the CNN Newsroom. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.Donald Trump is off the campaign trail and back in the courtroom. Just minutes ago, he arrived at the federal courthouse in South Florida for a hearing in his classified documents case. Trump and his attorneys will ask the judge to dismiss the charges or at least grant them a delay in the trial. A delay could also be looming in Trump's election subversion case down in Fulton County, Georgia. At any time now, the presiding judge there could announce if District Attorney Fani Willis is disqualified from the case, and a decision that could derail the trail from starting in August. Let's begin with the classified documents hearing today in Florida. CNN's Katelyn Polantz is outside the courthouse. Katelyn how likely is it that Judge Aileen Cannon will dismiss the case there?",

They should be starting any minute now. Donald Trump and his two co-defendants are there as well as all of their lawyers as well, as the special counsel's office.This is a critical hearing, not one that's going to result in a ruling today. There will be a rolling on it eventually. Very unlikely that ruling would happen today, but it's a critical hearing because it is the first and very likely a series where Donald Trump's team is going argue he shouldn't go to trial at all, he should not be charged because of things that he had or did whenever he was president. In this particular hearing, his team wants to argue that those documents that took from the White House to Mar-a-Lago at the end of his presidency and then held on to them for several months, more than a year, those were personal records because Donald Trump said so. He wanted to keep them, and thus, because he was president, he should be able to. The Justice Department has made very clear they do not believe that is the law or the situation at all. They think that Trump is obstructing their ability to get back not just any documents, not records that he might want to keep, but records are so sensitive that it would jeopardize national security for them to be out of the hands of the federal government or the rightful owner of them at the time. In this case, they say these records are defense secrets. They are secrets that strike at the heart of U.S. nuclear capabilities and how the United States would respond to foreign attackers, the sort of things about weapons and other defense strategies that are very important at a national security level.

How long is it going to take Judge Aileen Cannon to resolve not just questions like the arguments that are being presented to her today, but how long will it even take for her to decide when this trial should take place? Will it happen before the election? Everybody on both sides, Trump's team, his co- defendants and the Justice Department, they've all proposed dates for before the election.

And the argument that you can just take classified documents with you, that your personal property that is not something that is going to succeed in a court of law.Even if Aileen Cannon, who has surprised us before, agrees with this, a court of appeals is going to reject that argument. That that is false on its face. Even his description of what happened is contradicted in the indictment itself, I mean, even him saying, we're not hiding anything. Well, if you weren't hiding anything, why didn't you give all these documents back when you were first asked? Why were boxes moving around? I mean, put one of the charges here is obstruction.

I mean, these are sensitive documents, some of them pertaining to nuclear secrets. These are not personal in the sense of, oh, I have a memento, a letter I exchanged with someone. It doesn't make any sense to treat them under that category at all.And it's a problem here with the way Judge Cannon treats this, because by not setting the trial date, she really wants to give us like a full kind of airing out of it and may even allow for appeal. You know, that may come up as well. She could have set the trial date. This kind of thing has so little legal merit. She could have just taken care of this right on the papers. I mean, it's really his trial defense he's trying to mount. He's trying to make it like a pure immunity defense, like I don't even have to go to trial to present the defense.

He is choosing to be there.Now, the one thing to note is that this is not going to be your traditional Donald Trump in court campaign stop because there just aren't any cameras. You're not going to see him. He's not planning for any remarks. But we do know that he wants to partake in his defense. He wants to be there. And we were told that about New York too, because remember in New York, he's going to have to be there for that case at the end of the month, that trial. They are talking about how that's going to look. He's going to be there every day. How is he going to run a general election campaign in between going to court every single day, except for Wednesdays? So, you can imagine Wednesdays, Fridays or Wednesdays, Saturdays are likely to be the actual day that you are on the campaign trail. But he wants to do this. The other part of this that we've heard is that he wants to show the judge and show the jury eventually in New York that he is a willing participant in this, that he's a willing defendant and he wants to participate in the case.",

The one thing we know is there's no way the case would go before the election.But even if she's not disqualified, this is a gift for Trump because this is about optics. This is about trust in the judicial system.

And to me, it will be a big upper hand for either one of them if they can focus on the future and not on the perceived sleights or on the perceived lack of credit they're getting.
