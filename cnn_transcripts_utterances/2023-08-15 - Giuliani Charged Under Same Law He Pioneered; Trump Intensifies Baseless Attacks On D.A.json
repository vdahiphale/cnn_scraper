I'm Laura Coates.And tonight, the explosive fourth indictment of Donald Trump and 18 of his allies in Georgia is moving pretty fast, and they just have days to turn themselves in. It's coming up next Friday. We've got a great lineup of smart and thoughtful voices: Jamil Jaffer, Kara Swisher, Matt Lewis, Gwendolyn Keyes Fleming, Daniel Dale, and my interview with the one and only Morgan Freeman. But first, an ironic twist, everyone. Before 9/11 and, of course, before becoming Trump's wingman, a man by the name of Rudy Giuliani made his name for putting mobsters behind bars. He did so, I might add, using the very same laws that are being used against him now. Two decades ago, he actually wrote in his book on leadership, and I'm quoting here, \"I dreamed up the tactic of using the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act to prosecute the Mafia leadership\" -- unquote -- otherwise known as RICO for those following along. Now at the time, the law actually was relatively new. But Giuliani, well, he popularized it, making it the model for state and federal prosecutors for decades to come when it comes to large groups attempting a type of conspiracy, including, I might add, Fani Willis. The Fulton County D.A. is now charging Rudy Giuliani with several crimes for his efforts to allegedly overturn the election, including racketeering. Now, the RICO law, something that he has -- well, he has championed for years. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

If you look at our other racketeering indictments, you will see that those are the same things that we do in all of these cases.

We're hearing a lot about this woman and about her as a prosecutor. A lot of it coming from Donald Trump. But I'm curious as to what is true and what is fact and fiction. I think I have a sense of what is what.

He could have said that Atlanta's 2022 murder number, which was 170 homicides, was the highest since 1996.But it is not a record. In fact, according to statistics that a consultant named Jeff Asher provided to me, it is only the 23rd highest homicide number for Atlanta since 1960. It's like 35th if you do per capita numbers. So, no, not even close to a record. It's about a hundred lower than the record said in 1973. And I'll make another point. The Trump campaign released an attack ad attacking Willis and other prosecutors for prosecuting Trump. And it included a quote in big text. It said that so far this year, Atlanta has nearly 60% more murders. So, you see that and think, oh, that's terrible. This year must be bad.",

Because he likes drama. He likes to kind of mislead people and maybe swoop in at the last moment. Strategically speaking, he might not want his adversaries to know if he's going to be there. That way they have to prep two different -- you know, we prep for Trump there, we prep for Trump not there. So, I've always thought, look, Donald Trump loves attention, he craves attention, and he has this need to also demonstrate his toughness and his machismo. And so, for those reasons, I always thought it's probably at the last minute, Trump would decide to show up, if for no other reason for the attention.
