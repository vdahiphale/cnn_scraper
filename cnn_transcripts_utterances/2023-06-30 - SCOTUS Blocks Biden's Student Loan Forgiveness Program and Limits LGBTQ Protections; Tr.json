      "sentences": "Good evening, everyone. I'm Alisyn Camerota. Welcome to \"CNN Tonight.\" It has been a week of monumental decisions from the Supreme Court, decisions that will affect millions of Americans. Today, the conservative majority blocked President Biden's student loan forgiveness program. The president fired back, saying the court -- quote -- \"misinterpreted the Constitution\" and vowed to put forward another plan to help student borrowers. What will that look like? We're going to ask former education secretary Arne Duncan.Also, today, the justices ruled in favor of a Christian web designer who refused to create websites for same-sex weddings. But there's a twist that make many think this case might have been manufactured and that no gay couple asked for a website. Now supporters of LGBTQ rights fear the court may go even further. Plus, it was a big week in the various Trump investigations. Remember back on Monday when CNN obtained the audiotape of former President Trump talking about those classified secret documents that he held on to? Well, the week ends with members of Trump's inner circle talking to investigators. We'll get the latest on where everything stands tonight. Let's begin with the Supreme Court on LGBTQ rights and President Biden's student loan forgiveness program. Here's what the president said today when asked if he had given students false hope.

      "sentences": "Well, I mean, these rulings are enormously significant in their own terms and they are enormously significant in the broader pattern that they reveal. I think, you know, what we have seen from this six-member Republican- appointed court majority consistently is that they are ruling to impose the values, priorities, and even grievances of the coalition that nominated and confirmed them.And they were nominated by Republican presidents and confirmed almost entirely by Republican senators who represent the parts of the country least touched by all of the demographic and cultural changes remaking American life in the 21st century. And whether it was the affirmative action ruling yesterday or the LGBTQ ruling today or the student loan decision or affirmative action last year or previous and coming rulings on climate, they are imposing the priorities of that coalition which in many cases collide not only with the preferences but the intrinsic identity of the younger generations that are much more diverse, much more secular, and much more likely to identify as LGBTQ. So, in all of these ways, Alisyn, the big picture is that in many respects, the America of 1950 is seeking to write the legal rules for the America of 2050 and that is a tourniquet that is just getting tighter and something is going to give sooner or later if Gen Z continues to see its values and priorities rejected by this -- by this court that reflects an earlier political majority and at in many ways an earlier America.",

In all the entries, he kept them every day as president except when he was shot, the one that jumped at me is Reagan said, I'm not trying to destroy the new deal, I voted for FDR four times, I want to unravel and unroll the great society.And starting in 1982, during the Reagan years, you had the birth of the federalist society which was created by Harvard and Yale lawyers wanting these kinds of outcomes. They wanted to do away with the EPA. They wanted to do away with affirmative action. They wanted to stop the women's right movement. They wanted to undo Roe v. Wade. The list is long and it has been a long march of decades to get to this point. The people most celebrating toning are groups like the federal society or the Cato Institute or anti-government groups. Republican politicians have a tougher time because they got to be reelected. And as we pointed out, many Gen Z people are going to be angry. You're going to have LGBTQ people angry, minorities in America for discrimination at universities and colleges.

He is looking now to the Higher Education Act to use it as a way to accomplish what he wasn't able to accomplish today. Under Donald Trump, over $700 million -- $700 billion, I should say, was forgiven for large corporations who used that Payroll Protection Act. This was $400 billion for students. So, somehow, the Supreme Court allowed billionaires and major corporations to benefit from having their debt wiped out, but the hypocrisy of not allowing the student loan debt to be eliminated or to be reduced in the way that Joe Biden tried to. This controversial major question doctrine act that is relied upon, you know, is questionable, and I think Joe Biden is right, the court got it wrong.",

Because African Americans have less money, they have to borrow more to go to college. So, going to college can actually exacerbate that wealth gap. We are also facing a teacher crisis. As you know, many folks want to go into teaching. But because it's not a lucrative profession, they need that loan relief.

Not a big number.If you look at what's the real affirmative action at those universities, it's the wealthy. It's those related to donors and legacy students. Those affirmative action for the elite for the wealthy, for the privileged and primarily white, that's been strong forever. If you look at some of the public universities in the southern states, University of Alabama, University of Mississippi, wherever might be, University of Tennessee, if you look at the black populations of those states, usually 30%, 40%. If you look at Black enrollment in those black universities, it is 10%, 11%, 12%, 13%. So, the real disparity and real affirmative action is not for a very small percent of Black students.

That's absolutely true. And it is strange actually, by the way, that I think the more conservative framing of the case actually favors the LGBTQ side.

And so, that hope was snatched away. I think that there are political implications for this. In the election, people will be watching to see what President Biden does about this. The black community, in particular, NAACP president, said, you know, there is a risk of us growing disillusioned, right, because of so many big promises that were made. And for minorities in particular, student loan debt is different, right? It is that difference between being able to get a home or make investments in yourself. Many of these students are coming into college at a disadvantage. Many don't even get to go into the field that they studied because they have to take a job right away just to pay those bills.

We've learned that investigators spoke with Rudy Giuliani and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. And now, former Trump campaign official Mike Roman is cooperating with investigators. Here tonight on all of this is CNN legal analyst Joey Jackson. Joey, thanks so much for being here tonight. Of everything that's happened this week, I mean, it's hard to remember that it was just Monday when we heard that audiotape that CNN obtained of President Trump talking about the classified secret documents. What's the biggest problem of this week for Donald Trump?",

      "sentences": "I think there are many, Alisyn. It's very difficult to pinpoint one in particular. I know that he certainly had a good justification, maybe not so good in many eyes, as to the issue of whether or not that tape that was released actually were classified documents or they were the ruffling of many newspapers having nothing at all to do with any classified documents. So, I think that was certainly significant.What else was significant, that, of course, relating to the 37-count indictment in which obviously that audio was obtained. And then, of course, you look to the issue of Mr. Raffensperger on the Georgia front. We know in Georgia, he's being, that is Mr. Trump, looked at by not only the state. We know the district attorney is assessing whether or not there was election interference or any crimes committed in his phone call to the secretary of state as we look at the many investigations, but that, of course, he is expected, that is the district attorney in Georgia, at the state level to give some indication of whether she's pressing forward against Mr. Trump in September. And then we know, of course, the feds, Mr. Smith, right, that's the special counsel, invited Mr. Raffensperger to speak to him with respect to the federal investigation. So, there's just a whirlwind of events that are occurring. How this ultimately ends is going to be in a trial. I think certainly that the federal trial relating to the federal indictment will go before the New York City trial which we have not yet talked about, and that's in Manhattan for next year and that, of course, deals with the hush money payments. So, I know it's a whirlwind of activity. Very difficult to pinpoint one that has precedence over the other. All are significant and all represent significant trouble for the former president.",

The Coast Guard only came clean and told members of Congress about it after CNN started asking questions. Here's chief investigative correspondent Pamela Brown.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAMELA BROWN, CNN CHIEF INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The multiyear investigation was called \"Operation Fouled Anchor\" and uncovered a history of rapes and assaults at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy that were ignored or even covered up by high-ranking officials. But Coast Guard officials have kept the investigation secret since 2019 and never released the report, only approaching Congress this month after CNN asked about it. During the investigation, the Coast Guard found evidence of dozens of cases of sexual assault, even though they only looked into a specific time frame, from the late '80s to 2006, overlooking many years when other assaults had been reported. A report on the investigation found suspected attackers were not criminally investigated. Punishments, if they happened, were sometimes as minor as extra homework. Victims sometimes faced punishment for fraternization or lewd acts. Many suspects went on to have successful military careers while victims were sometimes kicked out of the academy. For those who stayed, it could be just as difficult. UNKNOWN (voice-over): I was sexually assaulted three times. It was completely toxic and devastating to my sense of self and left lifelong damages to my physical, mental health. BROWN (voice-over): This young woman is a recent cadet. She graduated in 2022 and says the Coast Guard culture has not changed. UNKNOWN (voice-over): The Coast Guard academy employs reinforces and cultivates a system that thrives on the trauma and pain of women and minorities. It's designed for their failure. BROWN (voice-over): The Coast Guard secret investigation revealed that female cadets describe survival tactics they had to use while at the academy. They would rig their doors to make it hard to get in, prop rifles against the door or utilize a trash can, and that cadets were hesitant to report for a fear that as female cadets, they wouldn't be taken seriously. One woman described a fraternity of male cadets that hated women and didn't think women should be in the Coast Guard. UNKNOWN (voice-over): You realize that if you say something, you are blacklisted because now you're the girl who cried wolf. BROWN (on camera): Even if it really happened? UNKNOWN (voice-over): Even if it really happened. BROWN (on camera): It sounds like, from what you've described, the survivors are the ones who are punished and those accused of sexual assault go on to thrive? UNKNOWN (voice-over): Exactly. When cadets get in trouble, there is this intense shame, this group shaming. BROWN (voice-over): The Coast Guard did investigate one of this victim's assaults but told her they didn't find enough evidence. UNKNOWN (voice-over): I was 17. I needed my mom. I needed somebody to stand up for me in those moments and it just -- it broke me. BROWN (voice-over): Democratic senators Maria Cantwell and Tammy Baldwin sent a letter Friday to the head of the Coast Guard that called the information -- quote -- \"disturbing and demanded answers.\" They committed to pursuing full accountability for perpetrators and investing a meaningful support for survivors.

The Coast Guard owns this failure and apologizes to each of the victims and their loved ones.And I will tell you, Alisyn, that my colleagues here on the investigative unit are going stay on this story.
