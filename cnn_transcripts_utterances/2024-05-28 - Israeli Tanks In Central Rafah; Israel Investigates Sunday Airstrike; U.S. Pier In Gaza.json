Closing arguments aren't finished yet, but he's already calling them boring. Donald Trump's take on proceedings in his hush money trial. Taiwan turmoil. Thousands protesting as the island's parliament passes a controversial bill. And it literally makes a flyby in JLo's new Netflix movie, \"Atlas.\" Well, maybe one day, but here, back on the ground, solar EV maker, Aptera, charging ahead with its production plans. That conversation and plenty more coming up. But first, Israeli tanks seen in Central Rafah for the first time as Israel steps up its assaults on the southern city, that's despite mounting international pressure. At least 29 Palestinians lost their lives in two separate strikes on Tuesday. That's according to Palestinian officials. They say tents for displaced people were hit and that some of them were just a short distance away from a camp that was devastated on Sunday. An Israeli strike and ensuing fire at that camp killed at least 45 people, many of whom were women and children. Israel says an investigation into the cause of the fire is underway. White House spokesperson John Kirby said the U.S. will be watching the results closely as he was grilled by reporters just hours ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN KIRBY, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL COORDINATOR FOR STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS: We have been, I think, very strident in our condemnations about the deaths of innocent civilians. These deaths are not excused from that. But we have to understand what happened here. There's going to be an investigation. They've already said it was a tragic mistake. They're looking into it. They have been able to investigate themselves and hold people accountable in the past. We'll see what they do here. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The temporary pier constructed bythe U.S. military broke apart Sunday in choppy seas. You can actually see the extent of the damage here in these before and after satellite images. The pier, which cost $320 million to build, had only been operating for just a matter of days. Officials say it will be reassembled and reconnected to the parking area when sea conditions allow. Natasha Bertrand is in Washington for us on this. Natasha, we know these waters are incredibly choppy and this was always going to be at least one of the challenges.

And that is going to take just over a week, according to the Pentagon's deputy press secretary, who briefed reporters on this today. But this is a system that really does not do well in any kind of remotely challenging weather environment, even though it is a pier and it is meant to be kind of stationed obviously off the coastline and help to deliver aid into different countries that need it, it can only operate really in about three-foot waves as the maximum and in winds that are below 15 miles per hour. So, it is very susceptible to being damaged. And this is what many officials had predicted might happen, given the sheer complexity of this operation. And the fact that this pier and causeway was going to be based off the coast of Gaza for quite some time. Usually JLOTS, as the system is known, is not necessarily stationed at one point right off the coastline for so long. And so, these problems, they were foreseen. The administration is saying that they do believe that even the, you know, short number of days, very limited amount of time that they were getting aid into Gaza was worth it because they managed to get about a thousand tons of aid and medical supplies and food into Gaza. And that is not insignificant. But still, this is a very expensive project. It is one that involved over 1,000 U.S. troops who had been operating there over the last two plus months trying to build this system. And of course, now, it remains to be seen just when it is going to be operational again. And importantly, for how long it is actually going to stay operational once it's back in action, Julia.",

The former U.S. president's fate will be in the jury's hands as soon as closing arguments wrap up. The defense was first, targeting the credibility of prosecutor's star witness Michael Cohen once again. At one point, a Trump attorney called him the \"GLOAT, greatest liar of all time.\" The prosecution, meanwhile, is arguing now that there's plenty of evidence to support to back up Cohen's claims. They don't have to purely rely on believing him. They also said that the catch and kill scheme \"could very well be what got President Trump elected.\" A short time ago, the former president posting boring on his Truth Social account.

I want to talk about the prosecution closing, they get the last word, of course, and this, I think, is part of what's key here. They pointed to two things, the conspiracy and the cover up. And, of course, in order to get a conviction, they have to prove both. The cover up, the falsification of the documents, of course, to cover up the payments.

I think that the prosecutors have definitely provided enoughevidence, mountains as Zach just said in his report, to sustain a conviction and to persuade a jury to convict. That doesn't mean it will happen, especially where you only need one juror, if you're Donald Trump, to create a mistrial, a hung jury would be a mistrial. So, the burden is on the prosecutors not only beyond a reasonable doubt, but to get a unanimous verdict. And to get 12 New Yorkers to agree on anything is a challenge, and that is the challenge that the prosecution is facing. They have done a masterful job today in navigating and narrating a story, a narrative that weaves all of that evidence together. So, it's not just a mountain and the jury's -- jurors forget what it all means, there's a story that Joshua Steinglass, the prosecutor who's doing the closing statement for the prosecution is weaving. Whereas the defense counsel today, their strategy was basically to zero in on Michael Cohen. Michael Cohen in the defense counsel's view is the key to the case. And if you don't trust Michael Cohen, and why could you trust Michael Cohen, everything falls apart. The prosecutors say the reason to trust Michael Cohen now, even though he's an avowed liar, is that all of the evidence corroborates the testimony that he's provided in this case.",

We know that he's got a sort of ropey track record in terms of fabrications, to say the least. There's greater backup for that. Just what do you make of how the defense did? Because the beauty of being the prosecution in New York, at least, is that you get to go second.

Very quickly, and I certainly take your point that getting 12 New Yorkers to agree on anything is quite difficult. Perhaps Trump is the man to do it in a predominantly democratic state, in fact.

But given that it's Donald Trump, the possibility that there might be one person in that room who wants to present themselves as the hero who saves MAGA, so to speak, that's a real possibility. It's a wild card. It's the kind of thing that you really just can't predict. Predicting juries is hard.

Two Italian newspapers say Pope Francis made the remarks while meeting bishops in a closed-door meeting last week. The Pope has instructed bishops not to accept gay men for the priesthood, and this is the context in which he was making his reported remarks. But in a new statement, the Vatican insists the church welcomes everyone. The Pope's remarks have caused a real stir because of the use of an anti- gay slang word, something that he used whilst discussing with Italian bishops whether to admit gay men to the priesthood. But the Vatican in a statement stressed the Pope never intended to express himself in homophobic terms and said Francis apologizes for any offense. It also says that the Pope has repeatedly stated that the church must welcome everyone, including \"everyone as they are.\" Now, of course, this has been the Pope's consistent message during his pontificate when it comes to LGBTQ plus Catholics. Pope Francis is the Pope who said, who am I to judge, at the beginning of his pontificate when asked about gay priests. He's also opened the possibility for same sex couples to receive blessings. So, the Pope's remarks, as they're reported in the media, caused surprise. It's also been suggested that Pope was not fully aware of how offensive the term he used was, and the statement that the Vatican has issued is clearly saying that Francis did not intend for it to be homophobic. Francis is a pope who apologizes for his mistakes and he clearly felt it was necessary to rectify the situation given this story and these reports were threatening to damage or undermine the work that he's done to welcome gay Catholics.

And a soldier says in the video that's released by state broadcaster CTV, \"It can serve as a new member in our urban combat operations, replacing our human members to conduct reconnaissance and identify the enemy and strike the target.\" Now, a CCTV video from last year also highlighted China's rifle armed electronic canines and a joint exercise with the Chinese, Cambodian, Laos, Malaysian, Thai, and Vietnamese militaries. The dogs have been popping up on China's heavily regulated social media. And this is the latest instance of that happening. Mike Valerio, CNN, Hong Kong. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
