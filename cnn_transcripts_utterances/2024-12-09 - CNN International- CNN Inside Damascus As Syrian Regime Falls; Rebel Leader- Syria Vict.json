Smoke was seen rising across the Damascus skyline on one day, on day one, rather, after the fall of the 50-year dictatorship. Jubilant Syrians, both rebels and civilians, ransacked one of al-Assad's presidential palaces. The man responsible, the main rebel group's leader is Abu Mohammad al-Jolani. He is a military commander and former al-Qaeda fighter. I want you to listen to some of what he had to say.

Of course, there are many experts around the world who cover Syria, and they are shocked by the sheer speed of what has happened. Now, it did, as you say, just take a matter of days. In fact, just on the weekend, we heard from the Biden administration saying Damascus could fall within days. It actually took hours. So, there was no one that was predicting that this was going to be quite as swift as it was. Of course, the question now is, what does come next? The fact that it has been so swift leaves somewhat of a vacuum to be able to have the organization in place already once Assad had left.Now, there is believed to have been some kind of organization behind the scenes. We know there has been cooperation between these anti- Assad groups, who have, in their words, liberated Syria, liberated Damascus. But, of course, the difficult task now is to bring those groups together and to bring it under a transitional format. Now, of course, HTS is the most prominent group of all of that, but there are many other groups, some with different ideologies, some with different strengths in different parts of the country, Turkish-backed, U.S.- backed, another group, which Turkey considers to be full of PKK, which they believe is a terrorist organization. So, now comes the intensely complex process of trying to bring these groups together into some kind of transitional format. Of course, they were all united by a common enemy, by Assad. They were united by a common goal, to topple Assad. Now that has happened, it is a very different matter. We heard, for example, from John Kirby from the Biden administration in the United States, Speaking to CNN, he was asked quite bluntly, who is running Syria? And he said, it's an open question, and that this is a discussion now that these groups are having among themselves. So, it will be very interesting to see the coming hours, the coming days on what kind of format this transition will take. Zain.",

There has been assurances to the minority groups, the Christian community, the Kurdish communities, even to some of the neighboring countries, Jordan, Iraq. And the deeds have been quite pleasant, and I myself have been very apprehensive about this phase, if and when it ever comes. And you're seeing that existing ministers who did not flee like Assaddid, have been treated humanely, and some actually have been asked to manage the affairs during this transition period, while new names and faces emerge, obviously. I think what's going to be important is the process itself, beyond it being semi-orderly and hopefully peaceful, how representative, and dare I say, democratic or inclusive is it going to be? And is it going to be dominated, for example, by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and Mr. Jolani, or by a more representative cross section of Syrian society, civil society, ethnic and religious minorities, as well as rank and file members of the bureaucracy who perhaps have not been responsible for the horrors and the atrocities of the Syrian regime?

Look, Turkey has made no secret of its discomfort and quite disdain of the Syrian Democratic Forces. They wish them not to exist, or at least to be moved away even further from their borders with Syria.I think you're going to see a lot of discussions between the Americans and the Turks on this issue. And there are semi-hopeful indications if you look at northern Aleppo, the Turkish-backed groups ended up negotiating the departure of a group affiliated with Syrian Democratic Forces, the YPG, more or less peacefully, and I think that's a decent model for at least dialog, as well as coming up with new arrangements that are acceptable to all the parties. That's going to be a very difficult, challenging piece. But, look, Syria is no longer under Assad. So, the oil and natural gas that the Syrian Democratic Forces are sitting on and have been selling for a number of years, is really -- it's going to be required for the reconstruction of Syria. And I know that there are discussions about this as well, and then -- and the priority needs to be on resolving this peacefully. The last thing we need is to see the Turkish-backed groups or HTS fighting with the SDF in this critical moment, or, God forbid, for Turkey to be sending its troops or to be at odds or even confronting the United States itself. So, it's a very delicate period.

There is a buffer zone of about two kilometers where Israeli troops have not been positioned for more than 50 years, but now Israeli troops are inside that buffer zone. And we're also told, according to the Israeli Defense Ministry, that Israeli troops have also captured positions beyond that buffer zone as well in Syrian-held territory.You can see my camera man, John (ph), is now zooming in on a building here where, moments ago, we just saw some Israeli troops who were positioned inside that buffer zone. This gate that is over here is where we have seen Israeli military vehicles have gone back and forth throughout the day. Yesterday was the first day that Israeli troops began going into this buffer zone after the Israeli Prime Minister said Syrian troops left their position on the other side of that buffer zone. According to the Prime Minister, that meant the collapse of the 1974 agreement between Israel and Syria that has held for more than 50 years, and he then sent Israeli troops to go and take over those positions, effectively positioning Israeli troops between the communities here in the Golan Heights and those newly victorious Syrian rebels. So, as you can see, this gate is open at the moment, and we expect that Israeli troops will continue to go inside and outside of that area. Now, in addition to what we're seeing here in this buffer zone, we also know that the Israeli military has been conducting airstrikes inside of Syria. We have been hearing and seeing those jets overhead throughout the morning, and we know that the Israeli military said they are going after strategic weapons of the Syrian Armed Forces going after ballistic missiles, air defense systems that the Syrian -- that were previously held by the Syrian regime. So, a lot of military action is taking place here as a result of the fall of the Assad regime yesterday, which stunned the region at large, of course, and of course, in this community as well of Majdal Shams, where we are now. We also know that there are people who have family on both sides of the border. The people in this area consider themselves to be Syrians, of the Syrian Druze community, and many families here are separated by this 1974 demarcation line with families on both sides of that border.

But, at the same time, the President said there are significant risks and uncertainty with this situation, and managing those risks will be a key priority for the President and his team going forward. The President, in the coming days, is expected to speak with counterparts about the situation, and he will also deploy top U.S. officials to the region for conversations about the future of Syria.Now, among the top priorities for the Biden administration is trying to assure that there isn't any type of resurgence of ISIS. The President said that they are very clear-eyed about the fact that ISIS might try to take advantage of this -- the power vacuum at this time in Syria to try to re-establish their capabilities in Syria and other parts of the region. That is something he says that the U.S. is going to try to prevent. That is why the U.S. launched dozens of airstrikes against 75 ISIS targets in Syria on Sunday. They used a variety of Air Force assets like B-52 bombers and F-15 fighter jets. That is something that the administration will be focusing on in the days to come, as they are hopeful that ISIS will not try to use this moment to re-establish their capabilities. Now, another issue that the Biden administration needs to navigate is how exactly to work with the incoming Syrian government, whenever one is established. The main rebel group that has really taken a lot of the control and power in recent days is HTS, which the U.S. has deemed a terror organization, and a senior U.S. official said that they believe significant portions of that group does have ties to ISIS. Now, earlier today, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan indicated that the U.S. is ready to work with any group that is focused on democratic institutions in Syria. But, both the President and Sullivan said that right now, while they are hearing the right words from rebel groups, they will be judging them on their actions going forward. Now, this is all playing out as President Biden only has six weeks left in office. This is an issue that President-elect Trump will inherit come January. As the rebel forces were making their way towards Damascus in recent weeks, President-elect Trump said the U.S. should stay out of this situation. And so far, he has given very few clues about what he thinks the future of Syria should look like. For President Biden's part, he says that's a decision that's up to the Syrian people.

And we asked here at the embassy, and folks here told us that the embassy is actually working as normally, even though the transition in Syria is already very much taking place. For the Russians, however, they were one of the biggest backers of the Assad regime, and of course, still have major military assets inside Syria as well. They have an air base in Hmeimim, close to Latakia, which is very important for them, not just for air operations in Syria, but also to project power into the Mediterranean and even all the way into Africa.

It's unclear now if this person is the suspect.But, there is a lot of things that are pointing to it being positive, a tip that led to this person in the investigation, and some of those things are like you just said that this person was traveling by bus, and during a search of this person, they -- police were told by sources, it found a suppressor, which is really another word for a silencer or something to muffle the sound of a gunshot, and also a number of fake IDs. Now, of course, this is all big developments, because we know that on Wednesday, during that deadly shooting of CEO Brian Thompson in midtown Manhattan, a silencer was used during the act of that shooting. And we also know that the person that police were really looking into was believed to have checked into a hostel on the Upper West Side, and it was believed that he didn't use, obviously, the ID of his. He was using some sort of fake ID. So, the fact that they found these two things, and that we're learning that from sources it's pretty significant. But, of course, a lot of questions here, as investigators right now are questioning that person in Altoona, Pennsylvania, and we're still working to figure out exactly who this person might be. But, a big development in this case. Certainly, this is something that investigators all over the country have been looking for this person. They've been sending out the pictures of anything that they could get of this person traveling around New York City. They know that that person left New York City, according to the police commissioner here in New York. So, again, a lot of things are pointing in the right direction from what we are learning, but still waiting to hear what else they learned from this person that is now being questioned by authorities in Altoona, Pennsylvania, Zain.",

Listen, we've talked to sources all since this happened on Wednesday, and there was really a lot of names that were sort of being floated out there as possibly people who might have some sort of vendetta against Thompson, and they were running down every tip that they have been given at this point, including why that person -- why this backpack had, like you said, Monopoly money? Why did the shell casing and the live round have the words written that were sort of similar to what is said in the healthcare industry? And these are very significant clues now that investigators can match up to this person at least and try to build their investigation.Another one that's very important, Zain, is the fact that when this person tried to get away from the scene, they dropped some really good clues, and one of them was a burner cell phone, which investigators were able to get a partial fingerprint off of, and also a water bottle and a wrapper from a bar, an energy bar. And we know that investigators ran those through all of their systems for DNA and fingerprint analysis, but nothing came up. Well, now, if they have a person who they believe is their shooter, and they get far enough in their investigation that they can actually collect that person's fingerprints and DNA, now they can go back to what they found at the scene and maybe make that connection. So, again, these are big developments, and we'll see where it moves from here.",

They were considering a lesser charge after jurors could not reach a unanimous verdict on a manslaughter child, charge, rather. Daniel Penny, a 26-year-old former Marine, would face up to four years in prison.Let's bring in David Weinstein, a former state and federal prosecutor, to talk about this. So, the manslaughter charge was dismissed. He has now been acquitted of criminal negligent homicide. We know the jury did deliberate for 19 hours on the second-degree manslaughter charge. They deliberated it for about an hour on the criminal negligence charge. Just walk us through your reaction to the verdict. Obviously, the manslaughter charge was dismissed, and on the lesser charge, he was acquitted. Give us your reaction to the news. DAVID WEINSTEIN, PARTNER, JONES WALKER LLP, &amp; FORMER STATE AND FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: It doesn't come as a great surprise to me. I don't think you can really separate the 19 hours from the additional one hour. They were considering the same facts and the same intent, the recklessness, the reckless disregard and the negligence when they were deliberating on the higher charge and now came back on the lesser charge. The prosecution felt that by dismissing the second-degree manslaughter charge, they would avoid this compromise verdict type of issue, and it did indeed do exactly that. They couldn't reach a verdict on the higher charge, and by coming back today, they decided they really weren't going to reach the verdict. The prosecution was looking for on that charge either. So, they found that Daniel Penny was not reckless. He did not have any negligence involved with what he was doing, and a lot of that hinged upon the testimony that was heard during the case, whether that chokehold was placed on too long, whether he was defending himself, whether he should have known that his actions would have resulted in the death of this individual. And then there was the conflict in terms of the medical examiner's testimony. What really was the cause of death? And so, my reaction is that these jurors deliberated long and hard, couldn't reach a verdict on that manslaughter charge. It was perhaps someone who is now, in hindsight, holding out for that charge and would have found him potentially guilty on that and then when they re- evaluated, reassessed, they came back and they said, you know what, we couldn't find him on that higher charge. There was an element, again, of recklessness in the manslaughter charge, and we can't find it here either. So, there needs to be an acquittal.",

The defense lawyers argued that essentially Penny acted to save subway riders from what he said was threatening behavior. They argue that just in terms of the length of time that he held on to Neely, it was long enough for police to arrive so they could take him into custody. And they also claim that the chokehold wasn't what killed him. They argued that there were other factors involved, including schizophrenia, synthetic marijuana and also a sickle cell trait that led to his untimely death.Just give us your take on the defense strategy here. Ultimately, that was what convinced the jurors.",
