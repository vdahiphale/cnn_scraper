You really have to get into his state of mind. He's got to take a substantial step into taking action. I mean, it's always a possibility. But generally, those kinds of charges are really at the state level rather than the federal level. But make no mistake, I think this guy is in a whole world of hurt.

In fact, they've shut down the road, one major road, outside of Mar-a-Lago, even when the former President is not there. And that's the consternation of the Palm Beach residents.Now, in West Palm Beach, it's much harder to shut down the roads. You've got major roads, right outside of the golf club, which you're correct, about 10 to 15 minutes away. There's also those large shrubbery, the trees, that are right in front of the fence, and so someone could hide in that. And it's a very large perimeter. It's very difficult to monitor that entire area. Especially if you've got someone willing to wait for 12 hours to go there in the cover of darkness. This is not the first time you've seen someone breach the trees into the fence. There have been paparazzi, been media members. Now, a lot of times, the media will alert Secret Service. Sometimes, they don't. And they take pictures of the former President while he's golfing. This is just the first time someone has pointed a rifle, at the former President, at least in his direction.

But he only got as far as the county north of Palm Beach, Martin County, where the deputies did a great stop. And I think this shows also that the suspect is used to this. Maybe not this type of crime. But he's got a long felony rap sheet, back in North Carolina. So, he knows enough not to try to do anything weird, on that traffic stop, or else he could get shot. He knows enough not to talk. Apparently, he didn't. He clammed up, didn't say anything, when he was stopped. And now, he was joking with his lawyer today in court.

Didn't seem like much of a joke. He had his hands and his feet shackled together, as he was facing those two federal gun charges that we mentioned.A short time after that, we learned that Routh had actually popped up on the FBI's radar, back in 2019, after there was a tip about a felon in possession of a gun. Even as law enforcement tried to run down that, what led up to this, we should note, tonight, the Secret Service is still facing a pretty immense challenge, which is what comes and what happens with Trump's golf course, and just how accessible it is. We know this firsthand here at CNN, because take a look at these images. As Mr. Aronberg just mentioned, when Trump was in office, our photojournalist could often capture video of him golfing at Trump International. Now, this would come, if the White House didn't say whether or not the President was golfing or who he was with. Journalists often relied on images like the ones that you're seeing here, to get a sense of the President's schedule. But to capture these images, CNN photographers were not on the property itself. Instead, we were positioned across the street, on public property. Oftentimes, officials knew we were there. Sheriffs would ride by. But Trump was often still very visible, through our cameras, through the tree line of the property itself. Our top law enforcement sources tonight are: CNN National Security Analyst, and the former Assistant Secretary at the Department of Homeland Security, Juliette Kayyem. And also, former FBI senior Intel officer, Phil Mudd. It's great to have you back, Phil. Because what we heard from the FBI today, and this ties back to what Dave was just talking about there, a potential, maybe, insanity plea, if that's what the suspect goes for here. They're talking to witnesses who were at the scene. They're talking to members of his family. What are those interviews? What kind of questions are they asking? PHIL MUDD, FORMER CIA COUNTERTERRORISM OFFICIAL, FORMER FBI SR. INTELLIGENCE OFFICER: Boy, there's a lot of them. The first questions are going to be about whether there's -- there are other people who are involved in this. You got to ensure. Even if you're 99 percent certain there was no conspiracy, you got to ensure that nobody was helping him. Nobody told him that Trump would be there. You also have questions, obviously, about who provided the weapon. But then the investigation gets more complicated. As you add in things like, what's on his cell phone, what's his email, what's his Google search history, you might be going back to re-interview people with what happened a year ago? What happened two years ago? How did he get motivated to do this? Was he inspired by somebody? So, the initial questions are about threat. But then the investigation starts to get more complex, as you get a timeline going back, maybe two, three, four, five years, Kaitlan.",

He kind of seemed to imply it was a last-minute trip to the golf course that it wasn't really on the schedule. It certainly wasn't on any public schedule. But instead of securing and sweeping the whole course, an agent was just moving one to two holes before him, gratefully, because that's how they saw this guy. But given its public knowledge, Trump regularly plays golf. It was a Sunday afternoon. He's got a big motorcade. It's not hard to know where he is at a given time.

But when you ask for that level of security and assurance that the President will never be touched, what you're going to get is a president, who is not accessible to the American people. That's not been the American way. Think about when President Obama won, 20 years ago. I remember that. Fewer than 20 years ago. I remember that. There were thousands of people in Chicago, watching him. Should he have not done that? Think about when President Bush, that was 20 years ago, President Bush went to Ground Zero in New York. Should that have not happened, because he was accessible to people? If you want assurance of perfect security, you're going to have presidents who aren't accessible.

But one of the biggest offenders of escalatory rhetoric is Donald Trump and J.D. Vance. And the very clip where J.D. Vance says that he's going to work on himself, he's basically accusing Democrats of their rhetoric leading to this.

And unfortunately, it doesn't seem to be a self-reflective moment, even though it was the candidate, Donald Trump, that himself was a victim.

That's the kind of language our adversaries love to hear us throwing around. It tears us apart from within. And, by the way, it does put people at risk.

We even heard from President Biden, on this, today, who said, what's going on is not sustainable. He said the Secret Service needs more help, and I think Congress should respond to their needs, if they, in fact, need more Service people. Are we going to see a congressional response to this? REP. JIM HIMES (D-CT): I think we will. I think that Jared's committee is going to do some good work, and really get to the bottom of what happened the first time. The first time, the attempt on the ex- President's life, in Pennsylvania, was obviously an egregious failure, operationally. The question of whether more resources are needed.

And, by the way, it's precisely what they shouldn't be doing, at a moment, when they should be taking down the political temperature. The other thing that has just made me bristle, when you said it is, Senator Mike Lee and others who are saying they don't trust the Feds. The misinformation and the notion that the federal government -- and look, we do oversight of the federal government, so we'll be the first to tell you that there are challenges inside the federal government.
