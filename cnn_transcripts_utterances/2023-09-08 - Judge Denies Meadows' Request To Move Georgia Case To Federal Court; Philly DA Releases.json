A judge late today denying Mark Meadows' request to hold his Georgia RICO trial in federal court. US district court Judge Steve Jones ruling that his alleged crimes did not involve his official duties as White House chief-of-staff, and I'm quoting from his order now: \"The court finds that the color of the Office of the White House Chief of Staff did not include working with or working for the Trump campaign, except for simply coordinating the President's schedule, traveling with the president to his campaign events, and redirecting communications to the campaign.\" Bottom line says the judge: \"The court concludes that Meadows has not met even the quite low threshold for removal.\" It comes at the end of the day that began with the release of the full report from Fulton County's factfinding special grand jury. That panel first recommended charges against Meadows and 18 others including the former president. In addition, we've learned, providing a fascinating and rare look inside the process, the report included the 21 additional people that they recommended for indictment, but whom the district attorney, Fani Willis declined to pursue and they included both Georgia Republican senators at the time, former National Security adviser, Michael Flynn, and sitting Senator Lindsey Graham. Today, despite being not indicted, along with 20 others, Senator Graham said this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): I think the system in this country's getting off the rails, and we have to be careful not to use the legal system as a political tool. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, in the indictment, they lay out eight overt acts that Meadows took in furtherance of this alleged conspiracy. His lawyers insist all eight of them, that was all part of being a White House chief-of- staff. But the judge here saw it differently. He said no, these were political activities. And then points to his testimony, noting that when he was asked to describe the limits of his power as chief-of-staff, he couldn't. And then they also note that in that infamous call with the secretary of State, Brad Raffensperger, he points to the fact that the lawyers in the call, those were campaign lawyers, and the judge firmly rules that these were all political activities, which is why he's not going to be able to remove this case to federal court. His lawyers had hoped that they could get this removed to federal court and then get it dismissed because there are certain immunity protections afforded to federal officials. But of course, it does not appear that that is going to work out for them here, though we do expect they will try to explore all of their appeal options.",

But I've talked to lawyers who represent defendants in this case, they were all watching the Meadows case.Some haven't even filed yet. They're like, I'm not even going to bother until I see what happens with Meadows because if he's not successful, my client sure as heck is not going to be able to meet this bar because they believe that as the White House chief-of-staff, he had the greatest chance of successfully removing his case to federal court. So it's not a great sign for the other people have tried to do this. Now former President Trump is not similarly situated. It's a different -- it's just a different case. It's going to be a different set of considerations for a judge, even when he formally files to try to remove his case. But Anderson, this is significant because even the judge overseeing this case talked about this appeal and the potential for other appeals and how that could impact the timeline for a potential trial.

I think it's important to look at his analysis with respect to Georgia's RICO statute, and specifically Meadows team really attacked the overt acts. But you really don't have to prove the overt acts in order to get to Rico and get to the conspiracy. They're really they're just kind of as almost as flags or placeholders. And so, it is interesting, because really, the prosecutor doesn't have an obligation to plead over acts necessarily and can even prove other overt acts during the trial. So focusing just on those acts that aren't criminal in nature and that's really what they did, even in terms of the messaging, right? They wanted to say, oh, this was just him setting up a meeting and you know, this is what he is supposed to do as chief-of-staff and really just kind of focusing on those acts.
