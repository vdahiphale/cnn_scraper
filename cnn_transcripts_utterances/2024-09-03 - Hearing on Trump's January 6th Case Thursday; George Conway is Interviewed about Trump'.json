      "sentences": "Yes, John, this is really the first opportunity for Judge Chutkan to offer some clarity around how this case is going to move forward, and specifically how she plans to deal with the issue of presidential immunity and whether or not it applies to certain parts of this revised indictment that's been brought by special counsel Jack Smith.Now, look, neither Jack Smith nor former President Donald Trump's legal team seem to be in any rush to try to get this case to trial before the November election, or really even before the end of this year. But it will not surprise you to learn that there is still significant disagreement between the two sides over how this case is going to proceed. Now, Jack Smith, in the joint filing status report that they filed last week, Jack Smith didn't offer any definitive recommendations as far as timing goes, as far as what he wants to see this timeline look like going forward. But he did indicate that he wants to move this case along. He wants to have Judge Chutkan consider the issue of presidential immunity while also dealing with a variety of other issues Trump's legal team is going to raise. Now, Trump's legal team is saying basically the exact opposite. They want to deal with a different issue, Jack Smith's alleged illegal appointment first before getting into presidential immunity, really separating these issues into a more extended trial timeline that they say could go all the way into fall of 2025. So, look, it ultimately is going to be up to Judge Chutkan to determine what the schedule looks like going forward. Jack Smith has said that he's ready to brief on the issue of presidential immunity at her convenience and at her request. Tomorrow, though, is the first time the two sides are going to sit in front of a judge and try to hash all this out. And we could get our first indication of what a roadmap going forward looks like.",

And what was taken out were the allegations that Trump had had conversations pressuring the Justice Department to bring an illegitimate investigation into this supposedly fraudulent election. That clearly is out of bounds under the Supreme Court's decision, and Jack Smith was absolutely right not to waste any time on it.But the fact remains that all of the other charges suffice all the other factual allegations in the complaint, in the indictment, suffice to allege three separate crimes that Trump did - that Trump has - has been alleged to have committed. And I think actually the case gets stronger because it becomes more focused. And I think, you know, the more you focus it in on in particularly false electoral certificates and attempts to pressure state officials, I think the stronger the case becomes.",
