It's going to continue. Tune in tomorrow at 9:00 a.m. for part two. And, of course, that brings us to the other big case today, the so- called other white meat, Donald Trump and the adult film star. A judge throwing out his attempt to dismiss the New York hush money case, and they have set a trial date, and it is next month, and it's March 25th, and that is the trial date by which time the former president could already be the presumptive GOP nominee. And by the way, only in Trump world could a case that might cause him 370 million bucks being afterthought. But here we are, America. Case number three. Donald Trump might just find out tomorrow how much a judge will order him, and by the way, his business, to pay for what? Fraudulently inflating his financial statements. That's the Letitia James case, the A.G. in New York, and she is asking for a whopping $370 million. But let's just start where we began, with Fani Willis taking the stand. Joining me now, Renato Mariotti, a former federal prosecutor and host of the \"It's Complicated\" podcast, James Schultz, a former Trump White House lawyer, and Patrice Sulton, an attorney and professor at George Washington Law School. I'm glad to have all of you here today. First of all, raise your hand if you were surprised to see Fani Willis suddenly appear in your screen to testify. Here's my hand going up.

And we have -- you know, outside of the legal rules that are at issue today, we have ethical rules that really encourage prosecutors to err on the side of disclosure. We have APA standards that would suggest that this is something that should have been shared with other people in the prosecutor's office and on the team that is working on this case, and there really hasn't been any reason that that was done, and we'd hate for the jury to be distracted by that when they're supposed to be deciding something else.",

Remember, he is charged with falsifying business records with the intent to conceal illegal conduct connected to his 2016 presidential campaign. Back with me now, Renato Mariotti, James Schultz, and Patrice SultOn. So, it's pretty unbelievable. It took all of what? Two minutes, two minutes for this judge, Renato, to make a ruling that's going to go forward. It's not getting dismissed. It's coming in 39 days. What was your takeaway?",

And, you know, ultimately, Laura, I think I, along with others, have been critical of this case from time to time.

And, you know, at the end of the day, the problem for Trump is there are false statements in those books and records, and explaining that away is going to be challenging. And as you pointed out a minute ago, he has the choice to take the stand. The question is, does he even want to? You know, criminal defendants often are in a minefield if they take the stand. I don't really know if he can win this case and get the not guilty verdict without taking the stand.

The question is now that the shoe is on the other foot and you've got a bad source providing information about a Democrat, you know, whether or not there's going to be that same level of scrutiny.

And Congress, on the other hand, is by its nature a very political entity.So, I think any time you see something where you have this conflict between the pursuit of a criminal investigation and trying to bring somebody to trial versus a set of folks who have a political agenda, unfortunately, what we're seeing here willing to take information from anywhere, I mean, Rudy Giuliani and Ron Johnson and Chuck Grassley were taking information from a guy named Andrii Derkach, who the U.S. government has said is an active Russian agent, when you get political players who are willing to take information from foreign governmental entities and agents, that becomes really problematic.
