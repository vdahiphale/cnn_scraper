We won't know how the judge decided on these more complex legal issues until those jury instructions are read to the jurors. Those will not be made public beforehand. But let's walk through exactly what's coming up next. On Tuesday when court resumes, seven men and five women and the six alternates will return back to court. And they will hear closing arguments from both the prosecution and the defense. Now that can likely bleed into Wednesday. After those are complete, then the jurors will hear the jury instructions from the judge. We expect those to take about an hour. And then deliberations of course, begin. Nobody knows how long deliberations will last. However, we understand the former president will stay in the courthouse in a sort of separate war room while that is happening. Now when a verdict is rendered, our understanding is that each count, the 34 separate counts, will be read one-by-one, a guilty or not guilty verdict for each. Now if there are any guilty verdicts, it's going to be up to the judge to make the penalty, the punishment for that. Our understanding though, of course, is you have the first set, a sentencing date, and it's possible he may not set that until after the election.

It's not like he was there and ducking with his family while bullets were flying. And I think we have to -- everyone needs to understand that language and rhetoric have consequences, right? And people, if the wrong thing are said, particularly when you have a bully pulpit like he does, where he has many millions of followers, people can take it in the wrong way. When you're talking about law enforcement and what they're not doing, right, he's saying they are doing, trying to assassinate him, it puts people in danger and jeopardy. Last point and I will continue to say, we saw this as it related to the former Speaker of the House and what happened to her husband. Some deranged person goes and really attacks him, right?
