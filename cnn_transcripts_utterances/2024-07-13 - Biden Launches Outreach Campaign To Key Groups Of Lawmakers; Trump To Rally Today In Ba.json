Today he is taking a short break from the campaign trail as he scrambles behind the scenes to shore up support from members of his own party who are unsure if he should continue his race.Over the next few hours Biden expected to hold phone calls and conference calls with groups of moderate and progressive Democrats in Congress in an effort to convince them that he can win in November. So far nearly 20 Democratic lawmakers have called for Biden to step aside. But at a rally in Michigan last night, Biden was defiant, vowing to stay in the race. He returns to the campaign trail on Monday. We have a team of correspondents covering this for us. Priscilla Alvarez is covering the Biden campaign. But let's begin with Capitol Hill reporter Annie Grayer. Annie, what's at stake today as President Biden reaches out to elected Democrats on Capitol Hill?",

      "sentences": "Fred, everything is at stake with these calls. Biden is trying to make direct outreach to House Democrats to try and stop the bleeding of Democrats calling for him to drop out, as we've seen a slow trickle of Democrats making those calls ever since Biden's disastrous debate performance more than two weeks ago.So Biden is going to speak with two key groups of House Democrats. First, the progressive wing of the caucus, and then a more moderate group, many of whom are running in very competitive House races who have raised serious concerns about the president's ability to remain atop the ticket. Now, Biden started his formal outreach last -- started his formal outreach yesterday, and he heard in the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, he heard from Democratic Congressman Mike Levin, who said to him directly I think it's time for you to step aside. I'm going to read to you a portion of Biden's answer from a source that was provided to me. Biden said to Levin, quote, \"It's a legitimate concern for people, but that's why I think it's important I got to get out and show people everything from how well I move to how much I know, and that I'm still in good charge.\" That's according to a source. So these calls are happening later this afternoon. We're going to keep you posted on all of the updates from them. And the question, Fred, really is, will these calls be enough to House Democrats who've been asking the president to speak to them directly for over two weeks. It's taken this long to make this direct outreach happen. So we will see what happens in these calls later today.",

      "sentences": "Well, there's a private and a public strategy unfolding here. The private strategy is these behind-the-scenes calls with key groups of lawmakers and allies. It's been an outreach campaign that the president has been engaged on over the course of the weekend especially in these last 24 hours as he tries to get the Democratic Party in line because there are still multiple concerns that are held by corners of the Democratic Party about his viability as a candidate and as a nominee.And of course also seeking reassurance that the president can serve a second term. So as all of that is underway, the president is also publicly keeping the focus on Donald Trump and using opportunities on the campaign trail to draw the comparison between his record and that of Trump's. That's what we saw in Michigan yesterday. It's what we anticipate seeing in Texas and Nevada next week. So the president being on the campaign trail is also a critical component of all of this because it is what his allies have asked of him. They want him to have unscripted candid moments on the trail. They want people to see him and engage with him in addition to these calls to try to alleviate any sort of concerns that members of Congress have. So it's not easy. Clearly these concerns persist despite what the president has done already, especially this week with his solo news conference. But it is these moments that the president is trying to capitalize on to assuage the concerns that are held within his party and also just try to keep moving forward because as we heard from the president yesterday in Michigan, he is defiant that he wants to and plans to stay in the race.",

A very rare move for the first lady who has for the majority of Donald Trump's campaign remained out of the spotlight. Since he actually launched his third presidential bid in November of 2022 she's only appeared publicly with him twice. So keep that in mind. Now there's also going to be a lot of celebrities who are going to be seeking. That includes Dana White. He's the president of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, as well as Amber Rose. She's a reality television star. She surprised many people earlier this year when she came out and endorsed Donald Trump. So they will be speaking as well. And then you have really a large list of congressmen, senators, governors, all of them were going to be taking the stage and defending Donald Trump.

When we talked last week and I was in the operations center for all of last weekend preparing for the storm, we as the state were ready. We did not take any chances at the storm, wouldn't be the worst scenario. You pray for the best. And I've talked to their CEO Jason Wells and I've said, look, anytime there's a tropical depression that could turn into a hurricane or tropical depression, whether we know it will or not, you have to assume and be prepared that it will come into the greater Houston area, and for people around the country who don't know Houston is a city of over 2.5 million and a county of another 2.5 million. So Harris County, if it were a state, would be like the 25th or 26th, 27th largest state in the country. It's a huge population center. And the weather casters as much as they try are wrong more than they're right. And even the hurricane center will tell you that even when they give you a prediction of landfall, two or one day out, it could move 50 or 60 miles. So we were prepared at the state, everything we were asked for at the state, we've provided everything. We're on top of our game. CenterPoint was not prepared as they should have been. And that's created a lot of these problems. We're going to have hearings, we're going to have investigations, but I'll get all the answers from them later. I want the power up right now.",

In fact, we have a -- we put a loan program out to build more natural gas.Look, we are the fifth renewable leader for wind in the world. So we have plenty of renewables. We don't have plenty of dispatchable because renewables have gotten all the federal subsidy. And so the people who invest in dispatchable and natural gas do not invest. So we've increased that investment. But we received the same report, by the way, Fredricka, that every states and every country because of AI now, not then, but now AI between EVs, between data miners for crypto, and data centers everybody's utilities, the need for power is going to skyrocket. We have 85,000 megawatts of power now in Texas. The prediction is in six years we have to have 150,000 megawatts. So everyone is going have to face that challenge and Texas is facing it. But this is different. This was just the storm. This wasn't the grid. This was massive trees, massive trees, falling on lines. Power lines are there. You can't bury power lines. Number one, the cost would be tremendous. It would take decades and decades. And even when you get the lines underground, water seeps in, water and electricity do not mix. And if you have a problem, you can't fix it as fast underground as you can when you can see where the damage is. So all the people say everything should be put underground. It's not practical and it doesn't work and it makes recovery even longer. But this is a situation where we love our trees. We have trees all over East Texas. It's the piney woods of Texas. And in Houston, we have massive trees everywhere and 80 percent of the reason the power is down is because we had 80-mile-an-hour winds sustained for a while and gust higher than that when the eye went over Houston for hours. But the bottom line is, even when that happens, you should have been prepared if you're CenterPoint sooner and locals, look, our county judges and city mayors have done a really good job, the state really has done a good job. But if you don't have power, if you don't have electricity, nothing works. And there's going to be a big shake-up at CenterPoint I believe after this because they weren't ready and their communication skills were terrible to the public, to the media.

And so I hear my colleagues when they talk about their fears because I also have my fears. I fear for my 8-year-old black son, who is growing up in a country where we have someone who has all of his people that wrote Project 2025. I know what their hope is for my black son, for my family, for my husband. But then we have a president who is looking to bring our country together. And at the end of the day, all of my colleagues who have called on the president to step down, we still want the same end goal, defeat Donald Trump. So that's what we're focused on. We have different paths that we think we need to get there. But right now we have President Biden at the top of our ticket. I watch that rally in Detroit yesterday. He was on fire. He spoke like the person who we need on the campaign trail between now and November 5th, to bring it to Donald Trump, call him the liar that he is, a failed former president, and he also laid out his vision for the next term, standing the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, making sure that we can codify Roe v. Wade giving women the protections that we need when Trump has bragged about overturning Roe v. Wade. So there are real things at stake in this election. We understand that wholeheartedly as a caucus, and we're united on defeating Donald Trump. And after our convention, when we nominate officially President Biden we'll be united in supporting him as well. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Certainly this is a major component. Almost 30 percent of cancer deaths are attributed to smoking. It's not just lung cancer, but also pancreatic cancer, bladder cancer, and a host of other smoking-related cancers. So something you can certainly do is stop smoking and if you do smoke, get into a lung cancer screening program. But there are other ways ensuring that healthy lifestyle, healthy diet, active living, and reducing alcohol can contribute. But a third component that's so important is prevention through vaccination. We know that there are a host of cancers that are associated with infection from virus, including the human papillomavirus, for which we have a highly effective vaccine.
