It gives it affront to our men and women in the military that protect these secrets. It's also important to me, I am a former federal prosecutor. I've handled classified information. I understand the complexity in the courtroom when you have classified information that's being dealt with and it's going to be a longer trial.

But set that aside, selective prosecution is not a legal defense in a case. And so, there's moral outrage about it and understandably so and there needs to be reform of our federal law enforcement. But each individual in our society is responsible for their actions. And you don't excuse the mishandling of classified information, you don't dismiss it and we should hold our presidents and those that are responsible to a higher standard.

The second thing you've got to do is make your own case, and that's where I enjoy the town hall meetings, that's where you can talk about my experiences, head of the DEA, Homeland Security, where I had border security challenges. There's no one that has more experience in the breadth of challenges we face in this country, and that's the case that you make. When I've been governor for eight years, there's balance of budget.

And so, this race, to me, is about the direction of our country, failed policies on the border, failed energy policy in America.

We have seen large fines for things likeprivacy around Cambridge Analytica, but we are right on the cusp, I think. I've seen some pretty major action when it comes to this -- the mental health and safety of children. As the surgeon general said in his advisory, just two weeks to go, and for context for people, the surgeon general has only issued about 15, maybe less, advisories over the last 60 years. These aren't things like seatbelts save lives, smoking causes cancer, things that are kind of like duh issues today, but they were ambiguous before. And the thing that I think is going to be super interesting is the part that I was nodding at, which I had forgotten about, I don't have like a highlight reel of moments like this and I don't see them very often, is he was described what's going on right now as a national experiment. Like we are experimenting on children.

I can once spend time with my friends in person, but if they want to be online, I don't really get to make that choice. So, I think the way that we actually intervene with kids, as we start having conversations about how to target networks, target schools, you know, you say, in this community, how do we want to interact with each other?

This gave the public a place to focus their demands for improvements to cars, how can we reduce the impact of a second collision? Why not look at similar data from social media? What are the equivalent fulcrums? Of course, there was a huge amount of public support for seatbelts once they understood it.

There was this majorlegislative package that set the groundwork for early childhood programs, which Mississippi historically had been awful at, you know, in pre-K and getting kids, especially really needy kids, access to pre-K. And then, there was another, you know, key component, I think, where there was a real major effort to get every kid reading by the end of third-grade. And as part of that, there was a third-grade gate set up so that kids had to pass a reading test at the end of third-grade, or they would be held back. And there were a lot of reasons to be concerned about that, and whether that would, you know, hurt the morale of kids, whether that would disproportionately hurt low-income kids or kids of color. In fact, I think it created accountability. It made teachers, principals, families and kids themselves who care very about making sure they learn to read by the end of third-grade. You know, and then, test results began to improve. I think that made the legislature more inclined to increase early childhood programs. Last year, to pay teachers more. It created a virtuous cycle of investment. But there -- you know, look, a lot of states talk about the importance of getting kids to read. What I saw in Mississippi was a just real determination. They used tutoring to use sort of career development of faculty and skills development of faculty to make sure they were teaching a curriculum that really would work and would get kids to read. And all coupled with, I think, an administration to state level that made sure these goals were being implemented in every district in the state.",

So, it's extremely important, you know, any of the research that you read around that transition from learning to read to reading tolearn shows that that transition from third-grade to fourth-grade is extremely important. There's so much scaffolding that's done between kindergarten and third-grade where students are learning to read, right? They're learning all the foundational skills. Once they enter fourth-grade or when they enter fourth-grade, the text becomes a lot more complex. And for those students who do not have really a strong hold of those foundational skills it becomes extremely difficult for them to be able to transition and to be successful in those upper grades. So, it is important because, just historically or across the country, there really hasn't been any accountability in kindergarten through second-grade. Our state of assessments begins in third-grade, right? So, even though we call this a third-grade gate or a read by three policies or any of the other terms that you may hear, this is not just a third-grade teacher's responsibility, and I think that that's the important lesson here, that when students enter kindergarten, we are supposed to ensure that we're identifying those early who have or who may have reading difficulties and provide them with all of the support. So, with our law, it allows for that. It allows for not just screening students but providing interventions. It allows for teachers to be trained in the science of reading so that they'll know how to respond to students who have reading difficulties. So, there are all these supports. And so, we always talk about it as third-grade retention, as an intervention tool, but mostly, that entire time from kindergarten through third-grade is spent on -- very intentionally on prevention, prevention of reading difficulty.",

Mississippi generally does not spend all that much on per people education.

I think it was as much that emphasis on rigor and evidence that help bring about the changes. But also, it wasn't just Barksdale, I mean, it was essentially a state was willing to rethink how it did education.

You know, on the other hand, around the country, we have an awful lot of school systems that fail kids, and we tend to say, well, too bad. We can't really address these problems because there are so many kids living in poverty and you can't really do much education for kids who are living in poverty. And Mississippi is the rebuttal for that argument, because Mississippi has shown that even if you don't solve child poverty, even if you don't solve racism, then you can still get kids reading by the end of third-grade.
