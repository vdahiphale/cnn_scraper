We'll explain that a little bit more. It was only 20,000 feet up in the sky. That's lower than the cruising altitude of a commercial airliner, and about half as high as the other objects shot down in Alaska and Canada on Friday and Saturday. The suspected Chinese spy balloon that flew across the United States about a week ago was also flying much higher, around 60,000 feet. The Pentagon says it will sort through all the wreckage of the different objects to figure out what they are exactly. People want to know.

You know, Pentagon and other administration officials have given some information after each incident. But what the American people have not gotten yet so far is sort of a fulsome explanation from the president on what to make of all of this. Should people be concerned? Is there reason for alarm? You know, one Democratic congressman I was speaking to just last night, he was saying to me that the silence, frankly, is odd. Especially given that people genuinely are freaked out right now by the headlines. But as of this morning, as of right now, we don't have any indication from the White House that the president is going to deliver remarks. There is nothing on his public schedule.

COY WIRE, CNN SPORTS ANCHOR/CORRESPONDENT: What a game? This was one of   the most evenly matched Super Bowls we've ever seen, featuring two of the most talented, best coached teams in the league. A dang shame, Don, that one of them had to lose. There were stunning running touchdowns, passing touchdowns, a defensive touchdown and a superstar hovering high like a diamond in the sky at halftime. This game had it all. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WIRE (voice-over): History made at Super Bowl LVII. The Chiefs' Patrick Mahomes and the Eagles' Jalen Hurts shining in one of the highest-scoring Super Bowls ever, and one featuring two black starting quarterbacks for the first time. The grass was an issue at times. Players losing footing repeatedly in the first half. And Mahomes would get his ankle rolled up on. Same one he injured a few weeks ago. The MVP writhing in pain.

It's hard to even digest that number. But as the aid and rescue efforts are intensifying in the region, we're only learning more about the recovery effort.

We're in Adiyaman, and this is a city that did not see a lot of help in the beginning. It's way, way up. And it was hard for people to get here. Now they are here, but they are facing this kind of destruction. This is actually two separate buildings that collapsed. Now, we are told by the people who were here when it happened that the first building collapsed. They called that the bad building. One that didn't seem to be built properly to withstand the kind of shaking that these two earthquakes actually brought to this area. And the second building, it was actually collapsed upon by the first building. So you have this horrible effect. There are about 200 or so people living in these buildings. And I want to show you something. Because now the heavy equipment has come. And they're starting to try to dig out. They do believe yesterday that they heard, potentially, someone alive in this incredible amount of concrete and rebar. And what you are seeing, if you take over to the right -- Byron is taking these pictures -- you see people standing there. Some of these people are here to try and do some work. And some people on the other side -- and let's swing the camera over here, if you look along the street, if you come with me -- and we're going to try to be careful of the work that's going on. But if you look along the street and standing along here, these are family members. These are people that are simply hoping beyond hope that their loved one is found. Some people are hoping that they're found alive. But many people are hoping that they can at least see a body here so that they can bury their loved ones properly. We have seen mass grave sites already, because there are simply too many people. We're talking more than 30,000 people now who have died in this earthquake. But every day, even eight days on, every single day, we are hearing of rescues. We have seen one ourselves. We were able to speak to a child that was rescued after seven days in the rubble. And here, they have pulled someone out just today. And they hear signs of life in another part of this city. But I mean, the destruction cannot be underestimated. It is all over the place. You can drive for miles and miles, and suddenly, you're seeing more and more piles of rubble. Now you'll notice that there are buildings standing. But most of them cannot be occupied, because if we were to take you up, there are cracks all throughout that building. And no one feels safe enough to stay in them. They are not safe to be occupied. So people are in the streets. I want to mention one more thing that a lot of people don't think about, because their hearts are so broken. All they want to do is see their family members who are stuck in this rubble. But I don't know if you've noticed all of this dust all over the place.
