In 2011, Barack Obama roasted a private citizen.BARACK OBAMA, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT:  Donald Trump is here tonight. Obviously, we all know about your credentials and breadth of experience. For example -- no, seriously, just recently, in an episode of \"Celebrity Apprentice,\" at the steakhouse, the men's cooking team did not impress the judges from Omaha Steaks. And there was a lot of blame to go around, but you, Mr. Trump, recognized that the real problem was a lack of leadership. And so, ultimately, you didn't blame Little John or Meatloaf, you fired Gary Busey. And these are the kind of decisions that would keep me up at night.",

Hello, everybody. Why is it so quiet? What's happening? It's quieter than Sleepy Joe.Hello, Joe. How are you? Great to see you. We're going to debate, right? That's what they're saying. There's a lot of stars here. There's a lot of great people. There's Scarlett Johannesburg (ph). Scarlett is here from \"Black Widow.\" I love the blacks. I really love the blacks. It's true. You have a lot of people that could potentially be a vice president. You have Lara Trump, who's a lot better than Ronna McDonald. Who's who doesn't love Ronna McDonald, right? I'm loving it. Who like -- you like a happy meal, right? You like that. But I will tell you this dinner -- you're so tight. It's so uptight, right? This dinner is sadder than Taylor Swift's new album, the tortured president's department, right? He's -- look at him with a white tuxedo. He doesn't like me too much, right? But I will tell you the Chinese apps are being banned. It's horrible. We have to post our David Peckers on Snapchat now. That's what they're saying. Let's face it, folks. I'm on fire right now. Like the guy outside the courthouse, right? Not soon enough. Not soon enough. But I will tell you, I am killing this dinner harder than Kristi Noem kills the puppies. Moving on, please. Even Bernie has something to say. Mr. Trump, you have no idea what the ordinary experiences everyday Americans are. I am concerned with battling the ruthless dictators like Vladimir Putin. Can we all agree on that? Can we all agree? Even Mitch would agree with that right now. Mitch? Well, let me begin by stating what a privilege it is to be at this dinner celebrating ordinary Americans and African-Americans. Scoobity doo. And let me toss it to Barack to close it out. Everybody, D.C., you've been a lot of fun. And I have to close it out by saying, when I was on the campaign trail in 2008, I led a chant with the crowd, and I would say, you're fired up. The crowd would say, I'm ready to go. So, you have a long show. Are you fired up? You're fired up? I'm ready to go. Goodnight, guys. Back to Kelly. Thank you so much. Goodnight. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. KELLY O'DONNELL, PRESIDENT, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENTS' ASSOCIATION: Talk about making an impression. You have just seen a man of more than 200 voices who can capture the essence of anyone. So, please give it up for Matt Friend. Thank you, Matt. Putting this evening together is just one part, one important part of being president of our association. I'm happy to welcome a good friend who will succeed me later this summer. And we promise a peaceful transition. Please welcome from Politico, Eugene Daniels.",

To my surprise, I didn't think he was going to be that great, he was very honest, I think as you mentioned earlier, someone mentioned here on this panel earlier that there's truth in every joke, I thought there was so much truth in a lot of the jokes in which he said.I love that he made fun of just about everyone, no one was safe. But more importantly, at the very end, to your point, there were two things that really caught my attention that I really enjoyed, please come up to my wife, she doesn't love her privacy, everyone say hi to her. That's what she wants. I love that moment because she's sitting here laughing -- like, she's laughing really hard, like, you better not. I -- please do not come up with -- and I love that because it tells me who he is and who she is, and they have that moment together. I love that his family was there. I just -- I really thought he hit it out of the park. And last but not least, the decency clause. I'm a fan of that. I think that everybody should be decent. I think we've been really nasty, and when I say we, society as a whole, what we read and what we see and what trends on social media doesn't speak to our heart and our kindness. And for him to say that, that gave me a new perspective about who he was and I appreciated it. VAN LATHAN, HOST, \"THE HIGHER LEARNING PODCAST\" ON THE RINGER:  I was really surprised with President Biden. I thought that he knocked it out of the park. He was funny, but more than that, he showed the charisma that people sometimes don't see from him. He was dripping with it. He understood the joke. He was in on the joke. As far as Colin, like he did the \"8 Mile\" thing. He gets up there, if you guys have ever seen \"8 Mile,\" you've seen \"8 Mile\" before?",

And then, you get a chance to spend some time with him, either in person or here, and you remember, as you've said, Van, this guy has real charisma.There's a reason that he keeps exceeding expectations. He was counted out many, many times, but it's because of that. I thought it was smart for him to keep it short. Other presidents could maybe take a cue from that. He kept it short.
