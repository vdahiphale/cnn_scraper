On the diplomatic front G20 diplomats have gathered in New Delhi where the United States has warned it would be aggressors who might attempt to imitate Russia on the international stage. But George's sentence Alex Murdaugh to two consecutive life sentences for killing his wife and son. The jury took just three hours to return a guilty verdict on Thursday. And a juggernaut IPO is on the horizon for Abu Dhabi. Its national oil company ADNOC has drawn record demand that is now valued at $50 billion. All right, you're with us for the second hour of \"Connect the World\". Israeli troops have prevented dozens of pro-Palestinian activists from trying to visit Huwara calling the area a closed military zone. Well, the Israeli protesters there in a show of support for the West Bank village, which was torched earlier this week by Israeli settlers. Tonight we take you inside Huwara ground zero in the battle between an emboldened Israeli far right and Palestinians and ask has it become a symbol of resistance against Benjamin Netanyahu's right wing government? Well, CNN's Hadas Gold shows us how that violence built up and begins to answer that question. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) HADAS GOLD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): This is the Palestinian village Israel's far right Finance Minister said needs to be erased. Huwara where Israeli settlers tried to do just that on Sunday, revenge attacks after the killings of two Israeli brothers by Palestinian gunman hours before, days later, the smell of burning rubber still lingers in the air as residents clean up shattered glass, burnt out cars, black and buildings one Palestinian man killed in the ensuing chaos. Huwara has long been a flashpoint for violence between Israeli settlers and Palestinians partly due to the highway that runs through it. Residents say Sunday was some of the worst attacks they have ever seen.",

And actually today, the EU Special Representative for Palestinian Affairs brought a delegation there as well and mentioned on the ground that the EU has intervened. He said at the highest levels for both Israel and the Palestinian authority to try and calm situation. But what are most interesting to me were the statements from the U.S. State Department from Ned Price, because I can recall the last time I heard as strong of a rejection as strong of a statement from the U.S. administration against a specific Israeli Minister. It's bringing to mind the years of Ariel Sharon, when he was a Minister of Defense, and the American government essentially wouldn't talk to him. And so I'm very curious to see whether Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will come out and condemn Smotrich's comments that are what Ned Price essentially told Netanyahu he thinks he should do. And we haven't heard anything from Netanyahu specifically about what's Smotrich about his comments specifically condemning them or anything like that.

To also add to the understanding of where Huwara sits, not only does it sit along that main route that both settlers in Palestinians use in the West Bank, but it's surrounded by several Israeli settlements that are known to be particularly nationalistic so all of this sort of combined together gives you a recipe for essentially violence. But I do think that Huwara has been sort of picked up especially by the Israeli left as a symbol of resistance, because actually, during these anti-judicial reform protests, these anti-Netanyahu protests in places like Tel Aviv, we've been hearing chants of where were you in Huwara? Those are chants that are being chanted towards the police when they come to respond.

We've seen these images of Yevgeni Prigozhin, the Head of the Wagner Mercenary Group now claiming urging Ukrainians to leave the town as quickly as they can because his men are moving in like - in a pincer movement he says threatening to be there sooner. We've geo located that image he is to the north of Bakhmut not in the center as he claims just as his men that we saw in a video they posted yesterday who claimed to be in the center were actually just outside on images geo located by CNN. So I think it's important to remember that what the Ukrainians are saying for the time being is that they continue to defend this town and a huge cost them. Those supply routes of course, a huge hit to their efforts to do so. Because of course they were down to a couple of supply routes. That bridge was key to getting in and out because all that's left for the time being are dirt roads. So clearly they're on the back foot. We asked one Ukrainian soldier yesterday what he believed would be the length of time they'd be able to hold out, given the nature of these much more experienced units that are coming out on the Russian side? He said it could be two days it could be 20 days. It's impossible to tell Becky.",

Blinken, Antony Blinken, Kylie meeting with his counterparts on what is known as this QUAD, this is a U.S. led alliance of Australia, Japan, India and Russia. They talked about and sorry, and India. They talked about Russia. But we didn't get a sort of outright condemnation. But most of the incendiary comments though were directed at China today. Just explain where we're at and what you took away from these Blinken meetings? KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Yes. Well listen, what we've heard from Blinken, over the course of the last two weeks here really is a pretty full throated criticism of China particularly because the United States is watching so closely because they believe that China is considering sending lethal assistance to Ukraine, and sorry, to Russia to then go to Ukraine. And so what we've seen from the United States is them really trying to rally allies around this concept that it would be awful if China actually did that. And interestingly, we heard from Chancellor Scholz of Germany this week, reiterating the messages we've heard from the U.S. that China shouldn't move ahead with that support. So it was interesting to see Blinken on this trip, you know, with the QUAD again, be pretty critical of China, but listen to how he put it during that meeting. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: If we allow with impunity, Russia to do what it's doing in Ukraine, then that's a message to what the aggressors everywhere, that they may be able to get away with it too.

It was a very intense period. And I would say that on the Sunday morning of March 6, when I went out to cover what I thought would be a civilian evacuation route, civilians fleeing. I ended up covering the death of a mother and her two children and a church volunteer who had gone to escort them to safety. And that was an attack that I myself was in a mortar round landed really just directly between us not more than about 30 feet from each one of us. And really, I think it's very different. I've covered war for two decades. And I would say it's, it's very different to come upon a scene and to try to have to piece it together. And to understand what happened, then to be in the midst of the attack and to watch rounds being bracketed onto a civilian evacuation route intentionally with the intention of killing women, children and vulnerable.",

I'm looking for ways to tell that story in an evocative way and in an emotional way, a way to connect the viewer with what's happening on the ground. I think our viewers are really jaded, the world is sort of jaded to violence right now, we've been looking at images of war for 20 years, if not longer.
