      "sentences": "Yes, that's exactly right. It's really crucial to how they'll conduct their deliberations. Today couldbe considerably shorter than we had yesterday since the judge has already said that the jury will be dismissed around 4:30 pm if they haven't reached a verdict yet. And then their deliberations would continue tomorrow. So the jury is just about to get into the courtroom. The judge is expected to take one hour laying out how these 12 jurors must apply the law to all of the evidence they've heard and seen throughout this trial. And this is somewhat of a complicated case, legally, because, in order to find Trump guilty on any of these 34 felony counts of falsification of business records, the jury must also find that there was some sort of underlying conspiracy or other crime. Like, for example, interfering with the 2016 election or even tax fraud. It was that interfering with the election that prosecutors really stressed during their closings yesterday. So the judge here beginning any minute now, he'll have to lay out how the jury goes about finding those elements and then applying it to the law. Now once the jury begins deliberations, which we're expecting will happen probably in the 11 o'clock hour, all of the parties, the prosecutors, the defense lawyers and even Donald Trump, they will I have to stay close to the courtroom just in case there are questions from the jury. Because then everyone will be called back into the courtroom. And then of course, they have to stay close in case there's a verdict. So Erica, we will see what the day brings. It's likely that the jury will probably only get to deliberate maybe about four hours or so before they're dismissed, since they usually don't deliberate when they take that hour-long lunch. But we'll see if they do this quickly or if this might take a few days while we're waiting and watching.",

Good to see you with us again this morning. Let's start this off from that judge's perspective. Right.

When you go 2.5 hours in, you are not really in any way, shape or form, creating a flow of thought. And that's what it seemed like to me when I was reading all of it. It just seemed like Mr. Blanche kind of went after Michael Cohen just a little bit too much. I think they felt that that was all they could do. But I think there was more that he could have done and he chose not to do it. The prosecution on the other hand, did exactly, I think, what we talked about yesterday. They started the beginning of their case. They went through the things that Mr. Blanche brought up and then they started at the beginning and worked their way through every witness and how they connected with each other. I know it took a long time but I think it was important for the jury to hear it again in a more succinct way.

So why are you going after her if it really doesn't make a difference whether it happened or didn't happen? The issue is whether there was an attempt to cover it up. Whether it really happened or not really isn't the point. The point is that he paid $130,000 in order to keep her from telling a story, whether it be true or not. So I think that he should have avoided that. He could have gone after more of the documentation. He could have gone more after the absence of some of the witnesses that were there and their import and really put the prosecution behind the 8 ball on how they could comment about that. I thought he lost some of his credibility with the jury by doing that. And as important as Michael Cohen was, Michael wasn't the whole case.

Israeli operations are obstructing access to the Emirati Crescent Hospital with both entry and exit impossible, according to the head of the health emergency committee. At the same time, the World Central Kitchen saying it is pausing its operations in Rafah due to ongoing attacks. And in another stunning blow to aid efforts, the temporary pier constructed by the U.S. military to help get aid into Gaza that cost over $300 million has broken apart. I want to discuss all of this with our Katie Bo Lillis at the Pentagon for all U.S. lines. And we've got Jeremy Diamond standing by from Jerusalem as well.

So the -- CNN was able to geo-locate imagery from the strike location of this deadly strike onSunday, matching up images of the gate entrance to the camp, for example. And what they were able to see, what we were able to see was evidence of the tail section of an expended munition. Now several weapons experts took a look at this imagery and said there's no question that this is a U.S. made small-diameter bomb. It's very particular model known as the GBU-39. This is a U.S. made weapon. It's made by Boeing. It has a 17 kilo payload. It is in fact designed to be a precision weapon that is meant to minimize civilian casualties. But of course, in such a densely populated area, such as Rafah and where more than 1 million Palestinians have been sheltering, this, the amount of collateral damage, the amount of potential civilian casualties that you're going to see with the use of any munition, of course, the risk is very, very high. Now the Biden administration has been very clear that they have said that any kind of full invasion, any kind of large ground operation into Rafah could result in the conditioning of military aid to Israel. President Biden telling CNN earlier this month that, if Israel were to go into Rafah, then he would move to cut off the military aid of some weapons that the U.S. has been supplying to Rafah. But of course, the million dollar question is, what qualifies as a large ground operation? What qualifies as going into Rafah, what would meet the standard for the Biden administration's red line in this in this context, given that Israel, of course, has been carrying out airstrikes like the one on Sunday that killed, that killed civilians in this, in this tent encampment? Take a listen to what National Security Council spokesman John Kirby had to say just yesterday in defining the administration's red line. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ADM. JOHN KIRBY (RET.), COORDINATOR FOR STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS, WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL:  We still don't believe that a major ground operation in Rafah is warranted. We still don't want to see the Israelis, as we say, smash into Rafah with large units over large pieces of territory. We still believe that and we haven't seen that at this point. But we're going to be watching this of course, very, very closely. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Yes.And I want to pick up right where Katie Bo left off and that is, with the fact that we are witnessing, on the one hand, an Israeli military operation in Rafah, that is certainly more limited in scale than the types of ground offensive that we have seen them launch in northern Gaza, in places like Khan Younis. But at the same time, we are also witnessing Israeli tanks moving into the central part of Rafah and we are witnessing that even this kind of more limited scale operation in Rafah is already resulting in enormous humanitarian impacts on the ground. Not only in terms of the civilian casualties from some of the strikes that we've seen, most notably the one on Sunday night that killed at least 45 people in that camp for displaced Palestinians in Western Rafah. But also just in terms of the humanitarian impact on the grounds. More -- at least 940,000 people have now been displaced from Rafah, according to the United Nations. The Emirati hospital in Rafah has been closed off from the rest of this city due to ongoing Israeli military operations, with a doctor there describing it as a red zone. And as you mentioned, the World Central Kitchen is also now being forced to shut down its main kitchen in Rafah as a result of Israeli military operations, citing ongoing attacks in the area. The World Central Kitchen is saying that they will increase capacity elsewhere. But it just speaks to the impacts that all of these humanitarian operations, which have really been based in Rafah for the most part because of the number of people who were sheltering there, how this whole network is being disrupted now. And then there is the case, of course, the situation related to humanitarian aid. The Rafah border crossing has been closed for weeks now, since Israeli troops first went into Rafah and took control of that Rafah border crossing. Egypt last week, agreeing to send the trucks that would normally go in through that crossing via the Kerem Shalom crossing between Israel, Gaza and Egypt instead. But we are witnessing as even that is proving tricky to actually result in aid being distributed in Gaza. Take Monday, for example, 370 trucks arrived at the Kerem Shalom crossing from Egypt on Monday and were brought into Gaza, according to the Israeli government. But UNRWA, the main U.N. agency in Gaza, says that only 30 of those trucks were actually picked up for distribution. And that speaks to the impact that the security situation, the ongoing fighting between Israel and Hamas around that Kerem Shalom crossing, the enormous challenges that this is posing for humanitarian aid groups who are trying to get that aid to those who need it the most.",
