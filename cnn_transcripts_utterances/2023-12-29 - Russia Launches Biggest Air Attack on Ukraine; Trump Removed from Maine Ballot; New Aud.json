And now we have two states, Colorado and Maine, coming to the conclusion that he is not eligible because he engaged in insurrection. That's the finding of the Colorado supreme court, the highest court in that state, and then Maine's secretary of state.One of the things that is happening here is, it's not over. That is quite clear. Even with this definitive ruling from the secretary of state, Shenna Bellows, last night out of Maine, and from Colorado's supreme court, there are going to be additional court challenges. There's already a petition before the U.S. Supreme Court asking the Supreme Court, the nine justices, to look at what Colorado is doing and determine whether that is something they can even do, to remove someone from the primary ballot. One of the things in that Supreme Court petition, the Colorado Republican Party warned the U.S. Supreme Court, watch out, this is going to be picking up steam. It's going to create chaos. There's going to be other states that follow this. And Shenna Bellows did say yesterday in her ruling that she acknowledged what was happening in Colorado, looked at some of the things that that court had determined. And even if the Supreme Court steps in, she did not feel that she should be making the judgment call based on what could happen potentially at the Supreme Court, that the possibility did not relieve her of her responsibility of acting here and making a call. And so, in Maine, it may go to the state courts next. The U.S. Supreme Court, we are still waiting to see exactly what they may do to sort out what should be the law across the land, or will states continue to make decision by decision on what to do with Donald Trump and his name for primary ballots in 2024.",

Just one quick question on Marshall Cohen and our team's fantastic reporting here on Kenneth Chesebro. The guy seems to know a lot and be saying a lot. As part of their reporting, they noted that Chesebro reached out to Jack Smith's team before he reached the plea deal in Georgia, and he hasn't heard back yet from Jack Smith's team, the federal prosecutors pressing this case. Why might that be? TIM HEAPHY, FORMER LEAD INVESTIGATOR, HOUSE JANUARY 6TH COMMITTEE: Yes, good question, John. My guess is that Chesebro's information, which is new, he asserted a Fifth Amendment privilege when we interviewed him, the select committee interviewed him, will factor into the special counsel's investigation. The fake elector plot is part of the evidence that will be presented by the special counsel that bears directly upon the president's -- former president's intent to disrupt the joint session.

What we talk about in Washington and in New York is not what people talk about in North or South Carolina, New Hampshire or Iowa or anywhere else in the rest of the country. Look, it was a mistake. It was a bad answer by Nikki Haley. TheRepublican Party and the Republican candidates have a real problem talking about obvious truths, that Joe Biden won fair and square, that slavery was the root cause of the Civil War, that Duke basketball is evil, that the sun rises in the east, and that when your opponent is indicted you use it against them. But that's not the conversation that voters throughout the country are having. That's not where New Hampshire voters are. So, the problem for Haley here isn't just what she said, yes, that's a problem, it's the timing. And the time is a problem for Haley because we heard for weeks and weeks about Nikki-mentum. The reality is, it wasn't there until the last week or two when we really saw a shift in the polls. That's the problem for Haley now. She can pivot around this. Look, we're not at -- we're not at New Year's Eve yet, much less New Year's Day. That's when New Hampshire voters are going to be even more focused on this.
