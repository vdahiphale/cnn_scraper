It`s designed to be able to hold about 1000 migrants at a time. And as you can see, construction crews are working to expand. And we`re told by CBP officials in June they`ll have room for another 1000 migrants to hold at this facility. (Voice-over):  In Brownsville, dozens of buses line up near an intake facility, but a major humanitarian group in the area tells CNN they only had one bus of migrants arrive today. About 155,000 migrants were estimated to be in shelters and on streets in Mexico waiting to enter the U.S. A source familiar with federal estimates said migrants will still risk their lives to make it to the U.S. And from now on, people who cross the border illegally will face a tougher path to requesting asylum. Many will be deported, like this group who were shackled and led onto a repatriation flight, like this one, leaving for Guatemala on Thursday. (On camera):  In the days leading up to the end of Title 42, this alleyway, be kind of migrant shelter in El Paso was packed with migrants sleeping outside. All of that has changed. And what several migrant advocates tell us is that for now, they think that migrants on the Mexican side of the border are reassessing the border landscape, trying to figure out when the next best opportunity might be to cross into the U.S. Ed Lavandera, CNN, El Paso, Texas.

And my grandmother is a big advocate of education.She knew that college was coming down the pike for me, but, you know, there was no college fund. My grandmother began researching various scholarships online that I would be eligible for. She said, I don`t see any for young people like yourself who have incarcerated parents. And I kept that in my mind. When I was a junior, I went through a social entrepreneurship program for teenagers, and we had to come up with a social venture. So I pitched ScholarCHIPS. And the CHIPS, of course, is an imperfect acronym for Children of Incarcerated Parents. And the judges, they love the idea. And so here I was, 16 years old, with $1,000 seed grant. I wasn`t even old enough to have a bank account. ScholarCHIPS is a nonprofit organization that provides college scholarships, mentoring, mental health supports, and a robust support network to college bound young adults who have incarcerated parents. The main objective is to help directly address the financial gap and challenges that many of our scholars face. Our scholars are provided with brand new laptops. We also have an emergency fund. And so when scholars have unexpected challenges that come up, we definitely step in to help.",
