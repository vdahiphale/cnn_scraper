New this morning, CNN has learned that top aides to Vice President Harris are wrestling with how much space she should put between herself and President Biden. CNN's Isaac Dovere has this new reporting. All right, how exactly does this manifest itself, how strong is the feeling, and how might it affect plans over the next 30 days? EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER:  Well, it's a big question for the Harris campaign over the course of this next month. One person that I spoke to called this the ultimate balancing act. Harris has to speak to the change that voters clearly say that they want but also be credible about this. She is -- she has been part of this administration, and she continues to be part of this administration. But you look even at what's going on this week. Even today we are talking about how she and Joe Biden are marking October 7. She has not distanced herself from Joe Biden on any of the policy issues when she is also sitting in the Situation Room with him dealing with these things. But they put out separate statements this morning marking the anniversary. They will have separate appearances. Joe Biden lighting a candle in the ceremony at the White House; Kamala Harris planting a tree at the Naval Observatory. They will not be together. That is not a mistake. They're both in Washington. They could be together, John, but they are choosing to be separate as Harris looks for various ways to show that she's separate from Biden and also talk about policy ideas and more promises that she will have -- that she will try to put in place should she be elected president.",

Any time she said this is what I would do differently than what's been there that did better.That data has gone through a bunch of people on the Harris campaign. They are aware of it. They are paying attention to it. And that is part of what is going to continue driving this here with Harris looking, whether it's on abortion, or immigration -- what's going on at the southern border -- or economic proposals. Ways that she can say there is more work to be done rather than the Biden approach, which has generally been this has been successful.",

Tehran's effort to arm Palestinian militants in the West Bank. And then, of course, Iran itself.

And I think what Netanyahu's comments and the present situation -- the new attacks in Gaza point to the operational success of this -- these efforts this past year, but the political failures of Israel and Netanyahu. I mean, they have not made any progress on a two-state solution and that's the only way this is going to end. Otherwise, Kate, we're going to be having this conversation in a year. I mean, they've been able to control Gaza. They essentially have an occupation force there. They've been able to take a lot of leadership in Hamas and Hezbollah. They've had remarkable success there. Their intelligence has probably penetrated the Iranian leadership. But we still have 101 hostages, seven of whom are Americans. It's been an absolute humanitarian disaster there. Over 40,000 Palestinians have died. The Israeli economy is in bad shape. They had to mobilize for the past year. And there has still been no accountability for the egregious failures on the seventh of October to protect the Israeli people.
