Civilians flee after Russia mounts a surprise assault on Northern Ukraine. Michael Cohen, Donald Trump's former fixer set to take the stand Monday at the hush money trial. And a new advert for iPads leaves Apple, well, crushed. Live from New York, it is Friday, May 10th. I'm Julia Chatterley in for Richard Quest and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. And a good evening once more. Ukraine's President Zelenskyy says a fierce battle is underway to repel Russia's biggest cross-border assault in years. Civilians of fleeing villagers near the city of Kharkiv after Russian forces crossed the northwestern border and penetrated several kilometers into Ukraine. Zelenskyy says Kyiv was anticipating the move. Russia has been intensifying its counteroffensive to capitalize on the Ukrainian weaponry and ammunition shortage. Jim Sciutto is in Washington, DC for us. Jim, this is exactly what you were hearing and exactly what you were predicting. They are clearly making grounds and Kyiv was anticipating it, but how strong is their defense?",

The intention appears to create what Russian officials are calling buffer zone inside of Ukraine. Of course, this is sovereign Ukrainian territory, but they are attempting to take back Ukrainian territory that you may remember in the early stages of the war, Russia took and then Ukrainian's pushed back with their own counteroffensive. The thing is there are just throwing so much at the frontlines, there around Kharkiv, columns of armored personnel carriers, a heavy bombardment that has been taking place for days and weeks. The concern is, can Ukrainian forces now hold the line? Our understanding is that they are sending reinforcements, but Julia, this takes place not just in the context of the delay, the long delay in US military assistance, but also a manpower shortage on the Ukrainian side of those front lines on the Ukrainian side of the battlefield. So the concern is, how much territory can Russia again here? Can Ukraine hold them back? Could this amount to some sort of breakthrough? I mean, certainly Russia is at least trying.",

Obviously, this gives the initiative back to theWar Cabinet, that very small War Cabinet, the prime minister, the defense minister, and Benny Gantz, so the onus is on them. They have the authority now to expand. I think you can pass the language over you know, what is a major offensive, the White House's red line, if you will or partial red line and what is just a small expansion. But the IDF is positioned and ready, and I think that is perhaps their difficulty. They face these challenges this week of the United States and President Biden coming out very clearly and setting out his red lines over in the early hours, Monday. They dropped leaflets telling Palestinians to leave Rafah, the eastern part of Rafah, 110,000 have. The places they have gone to aren't safe, unsanitary, don't have all the things that they require. The UN is talking about a disaster. But in terms of where the military goes from here, it either has to go ahead or it has to get out of the way because they've got troops in the middle of Rafah. They've got troops in the border crossing area, significant numbers. So their posture to go forward if they need to, and I think there was a significant development -- military development this afternoon. The IDF said that Hamas fired nine rockets on Be'er Sheva, that's about 30 miles away from Gaza. There haven't been rockets fired there for months and months and months. One of those rockets was intercepted, some got through. One lady was slightly injured, not a high casualty rate, but missile landed in a children's play park. So, the IDF is saying those missiles came from Rafah. It hardly seems likely that they are going to sit back and let Hamas, if that is what is happening continue to fire those rockets in that way. You know, really, you could look at it this way that Hamas is testing the resolve of the IDF under this increased international pressure. It does seem to me that the operation is going to go ahead and the speed of it, the scale of it, I think we are just going to have to judge when it happens.",

It was a very emotional testimony you heard from the Palestinian representative at UN today talking about the Palestinian flag flying above US university campuses. So yes, absolutely. Hamas fills emboldened by what it is seeing there. The fact that Israel doesn't or won't be able to drop such large ordnance potentially on Rafah doesn't necessarily mean that less civilians will be killed. They may not just be killed in such significant big numbers, you know, scores upon scores upon scores in some of those very big military operations in the north of Gaza when the offensive began. So it potentially makes it a little more dangerous for the IDF troops on the ground. You had the IDF yesterday saying that they stood on \"a hornet's nest\" in Rafah, and nine soldiers where lightly injured. One soldier moderately injured when as the IDF says, those soldiers were stung. When the IDF began these operations in the north of Israel, they did it with maximum ordnance to protect the troops. Potentially, the operation in Rafah, won't use such big ordnance and perhaps will put troops in harm's way. But absolutely, civilians there.

We heard from representatives from Verizon, from AT&amp;T, they brought in phone records that presumably we will see next week when Michael Cohen testifies. We also saw staffers from the District Attorney's Office who had reviewed social media posts, also texts that have been subpoenaed from phone companies, and again, this was all just to get everything into the record so that when Michael Cohen takes the stand starting Monday, the prosecutors will be able to sort of bolster whatever he says with actual records. We saw that earlier in the week as well when they brought in the various checks that were written to Michael Cohen, the ledgers, the accounting records. So all of this because Michael Cohen is a problematic witness. When he gets onto the stand and when the defense team gets to take their crack at him with cross examination, they are going to hammer the point that Michael Cohen is convicted -- is a convicted felon, convicted of lying to Congress, and they're going to use that to try to erode his credibility and tried to say to the jury, how can you believe this guy, he has been convicted of lying. So, the prosecution needs to do all it can to bolster whatever Michael Cohen is going to say on the stand with cold, hard evidence, and that's what they've been working bit by bit to get into the record. So maybe a bit boring at times for those of us watching from afar, maybe a bit boring for the jury, but it is all what the prosecution needs to have done to get this all in before Michael Cohen takes the stand. Interestingly, the prosecution has said they only have two more witnesses to call. They will call Michael Cohen on Monday. Then there will be one more before they rest their case. Then the defense can put witnesses on the stand. It is still unclear if Donald Trump will testify in his own defense. Most legal watchers are saying, he won't, that it just wouldn't be smart for him to take the stand. So it is going to be interesting to see because presumably maybe by the end of next week, although it is a shortened week, we only have three days next week, so maybe by the end of next week or the beginning of the following in week, the prosecution could have its case-in- chief wrapped up, then we will see what the defense does with it. It is possible this jury could be in the deliberating room by the time we get to Memorial Day. So Julia, it is going to be really must-watch testimony or at least must-watch what we are getting from the courtroom in terms of what we are seeing, the information they are sending out from the courtroom because Michael Cohen, probably the crucial witness in this case for the prosecution, for the prosecution to prove its case, we saw how riveting Stormy Daniels' testimony was, especially how riveting and at times combative the cross-examination was expected to be even exponentially more interesting and more explosive when Michael Cohen takes the stand.",

Now, it could cause major issues for GPS systems, power grids, and radio communications. A sunspot cluster is directing flares at Earth, disrupting the planet's magnetic field. Those same forces are also creating dazzling displays in the sky. On New Zealand's South Island, people living in Central Otago were treated to this stunning display of Southern Lights. Meanwhile, forecast to see the northern lights may be seen as far south as the U.S. states of Alabama and Northern California. Wow. Chad Myers is at the CNN weather center for us.

Now, Apple is apologizing and says it \"missed the mark\" on an ad that critics say celebrates technology's destruction of human art and creativity. Just take a look and see what you think for yourself. The ad shows a hydraulic press crashing musical instruments, pink cans and other creative tools, compressing them into an iPad. It's a rare misstep for the company which has strong ties to creative industries of course. While some people are also noting the ad similarities to the one put out by L.G. 15 years ago, they didn't face the backlash that Apple is receiving now. Clare Duffy is in New York for us. Everything you guys can do, iPad can do better, which is perhaps innovation. But I think the key point is 15 years ago, we didn't have Hollywood spending half the year protesting, it wasn't in the shadow of A.I. and we didn't have game studios making people redundant and tone deaf, I think is the word or the phrase I'm looking for here.",

Workers say that since then,they have not had their core demands met by the company. So they're actually going to be voting this weekend on whether to authorize a strike. And this is really significant, because you have to imagine that there are many other Apple retail stores around the country that will be watching to see what these Apple workers in Maryland can convince the company to do. There's already one other Apple retail store that's voted to unionize a third store that will be voting on whether to unionize this weekend. And of course this Apple Labor Movement comes as the company is already facing pressure in so many other areas. So, just one more thing on CEO Tim Cook's plate, Julia.",
