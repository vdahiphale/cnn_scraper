Here are today's top stories.World leaders and veterans are gathering in France to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the Allied Forces' invasion of Europe. The White House says U.S. President Joe Biden's speech will focus on the power of democracy and the sacrifice of soldiers who fought on D-Day. Elections for the European Union's Parliament are now in their second day. It's the world's largest multi-country vote with 720 seats up for grabs. Far-right leaders have been making a push for more influential positions in the bloc. Voting wraps up on Sunday. Israel's military says it killed nine Hamas fighters in a strike on a U.N.-run school in central Gaza. But Palestinian officials report at least 40 people were killed. Israel says there was a Hamas compound operating inside the school. CNN cannot independently verify that claim. A new report from the U.N.'s World Food Program says more than a million people in Gaza are expected to face death and starvation by mid-July. That's half of the enclave's population. The report cites the war's rising death toll and mass displacement combined with the heavy restrictions on access to humanitarian aid. The U.N. says this is likely to continue, especially in light of Israel's expanding military operations in Rafah, which included seizing the border crossing with Egypt in early May. Gaza's health ministry says no sick or wounded person has been able to leave the enclave since then. The Hamas-run ministry says more than 25,000 people need medical treatment. Well for more on the humanitarian crisis, I'm joined by Rachael Cummings. She is the team leader for Save the Children's Gaza Response. She joins us now live from Deir al-Balah in central Gaza. Thank you so much for joining us. Explain to us the state of the humanitarian situation right now.",

So it's a very odd scenario that we're seeing playing out with the commercial trucks coming through from Kerem Shalom to Israel. So there is food available in the markets, but people don't have money to buy. So the risk is, of course, the most vulnerable populations will go into debt. But the massive majority, as you said, a million people are at risk of death from lack of food, which is an extraordinary situation when, of course, there is food around.So WFP and other partners have been trying to push out flour and other food items. Save the Children also trying to push out food items across the Gaza Strip. But we're very, very restricted in terms of the supplies that we're able to bring in. So there's one crossing in the north that we're able to use, but it's very, very unpredictable. And again, for Kerem Shalom, since that Rafah crossing closed at the beginning of Egypt, the routine and the regular supplies that we were able to bring in before then, that is very much complicated now with the closure of the Rafah crossing with Egypt. So people are desperate. You know, there's some hot kitchens providing food, but there isn't enough food and we're not doing enough for the population. We know that. We're acutely aware of that. You know, it's deeply frustrating. We know how to react and how to support populations in need. And yet it's impossible for us to do that with the safety and security of ourselves, but also at the scale that's required.",
