And when it was learned that these five officers were part of that SCORPION unit, many of the community members and of course, Nichols' family all came out asking that the police chief disband this unit. Now what this unit does is that they drive around in unmarked cars aggressively fighting crime and some of their tactics have come into question. And because of the concerns raised by the community, the police chief said that she met with officers in that unit. And they all decided that, in the interest of trying to heal the wounds here and try and help some of the work that the police department and the community knows they are going to need to do to try and win back the respect, she is going to disband it.

I am also encouraged by the U.S. attorney's office and the press conference and the statement they gave, indicating that there is a federal criminal Civil Rights Action that is being investigated. And I also hope the Department of Justice goes into that that Memphis Police Department and does a widespread investigation of its practices and policies. It is clear to me, like the chief said, there was no evidence of reckless driving on the part of Mr. Nichols. And perhaps he was racially profiled. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

However, both the Russians and the Ukrainians believe that whoever controls that town also controls some pretty important routes, both to the south and to the east of Ukraine. And that whoever controls that area obviously has a much better position in trying to maneuver both in the south and to the south as well, that's in the east and to the east. Of course, right now, that's where most of the massive front lines are. And the Ukrainians have been saying that the Russians have really being hitting Ukrainian positions in that town and around that town of Vuhledar and trying to make some advances as well, really using some pretty strong weapons, also, including thermal barrack weapons, which is an awful multiple rocket launching system which does inflict a big toll wherever it lands. However, so far, the Ukrainians are saying that the Russians are not having very much success in Vuhledar. In fact, there was some video that was released by the Ukrainians showing or appearing to show a failed Russian assault on Vuhledar, with the Russians in the end having to abandon their vehicles and some of the wounded having to crawl away, who were left behind by the Russian infantry. So right now the Ukrainians are saying they're taking a lot of fire from the Russians in that area. However, they're also saying that the assaults so far have not been successful by the Russians. But in general, Lynda, one of the things we've been seeing throughout the past couple of days, maybe the last couple of weeks as well, is the Russians have really fortified their positions in the east of the country. They've brought in a lot more heavy armor. It goes all the way to the north through the area around Kreminna, obviously, around the area where we are, near the town of Bakhmut. There's some really heavy fighting that's been going on as well where we can really see that the Russians are moving a lot of gear and moving a lot of soldiers into this area, obviously trying to improve their position and also trying to go on a counterattack as well, Lynda.

Now this comes after the latest shooting was stopped by two civilians carrying licensed weapons. Police say both of them shot and injured the suspected gunman after he wounded two people in Saturday's attack. And it happened less than a day after another shooting left seven people dead. In Jerusalem, hundreds of Israelis mourned the victims of Friday's attack during a protest against Israel's government. Let's get more from Elliott Gotkine, who joins us from Jerusalem.

And I want to read out to you the kind of six-point plan that was outlined by the security cabinet last night. So first of all, they said that they would seal the home of the Palestinian gunman on Friday, who killed seven Israelis, and that they will seal the home with a plan to destroy it. Now the police have confirmed that's already been sealed. Benjamin Netanyahu saying the plan is to destroy that home later. They're talking about the national insurance rights, additional benefits from the families of attackers that support such acts will be revoked. They're talking about legislation. They're going to be discussing legislation to revoke the Israeli identity cards of families of attackers that support terrorism, in their words. That's something that they were discussing today. And as was mentioned earlier, they're talking about expanding and expediting the licensing of firearms, noting that two of the group that came under attack from the 13-year-old Palestinian boy on Saturday, when they were shot by him, that they were able to fire back and prevent any casualties in that particular incident. The next point was that they were going to decide on strength -- on steps to strengthen settlements in the West Bank. Now again today, Netanyahu referred to this but didn't actually give any specifics. Those specifics will come at a later point. But he said that this was to show that, for those that are trying to uproot Israel from its home, that there is a price to be paid. Finally, talking about the expansion and reinforcement of military arrests, to collect illegal weapons to be carried out. So those are the main plans from Netanyahu. But I should say that after yesterday evening and also this morning, there have been more violent incidents taking place. There was an attempted shooting at a settlement by the Dead Sea, by a Palestinian attacker. It seems in that instance, the army says that the gun malfunctioned. At another settlement in the northern part of the West Bank, that there was an attempt to infiltrate that settlement by a Palestinian and that the security guard killed that attacker as well. And then Palestinian officials talking about dozens of settlers setting fire to cars and property and even one house last night as well. So no signs of de-escalation, I'm afraid, here, Lynda.",

Good to have you with us.Well, the Memphis Police Department has announced the permanent end of a special anti-crime unit known as SCORPION. It comes just a day after the city released graphic videos of five SCORPION officers fatally beating 29-year-old Tyre Nichols. Police have confirmed all of the officers were with that special unit. It's not clear why they targeted Nichols or became overly aggressive toward him. As Nichols' family grieves and prepares for his upcoming funeral, U.S. President Joe Biden spoke with the victim's parents on Friday, sharing his own personal experience of losing his son. The street corner where Nichols was brutally beaten was only a short distance from his home. The site has become a makeshift memorial, with people stopping by to pay their respects. Steve Cohen represents parts of Memphis in the U.S. Congress and, on Saturday, he spoke with CNN's Pamela Brown about the duty of other police officers who may be present and could have intervened in a situation like this. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. STEVE COHEN (D-TN):  The duty to render aid is a major part of a police officer's job to protect and serve. And those officers did not do that. There were probably other officers involved. There was an officer back at the scene who was, I think, a sixth member of the SCORPION unit who didn't go to the scene. He was the person who drove up in the first video that had his body camera -- camcorder working. And he said, \"I hope they stomp him.\" I'm afraid what he said was indicative of the attitude of the SCORPION unit and maybe police in general but more likely the SCORPION unit specifically to take their aggressions out and take the law into their own hands. And this is always wrong. So I think -- I don't know how they've been trained. I'm sure they've been trained well but I don't know if this group particularly learned their lesson and they acted on basically blue testosterone and ego. But it started with that. When they grabbed him out of the car, it wasn't, excuse me -- excuse me but show us your driver's license. And why did you run that light or why did you run out of the lane or whatever? We saw them giving what were probably George Santos-type descriptions of what he did earlier, he was in the wrong lane, he reached for my gun. These were alibis that they were posting knowing they were videoing and they were laying out their defense. And I couldn't trust any one of them because they didn't take their oath of office to heart and they just beat him to hell. And there were three of them, two of them, one kicked him, one punched him and one hit him with a stick, a baton and the other two helped. All five are rotten apples. And I commend the police chief for doing what she did. But she and Mayor Strickland both of whom, want to do right. They had the toughest job of coming forward. They need to clean the department of bad apples. They need to get intensive training. They need to make sure de-escalation comes first. I've had a bill for about eight years in the Congress that George Floyd saying that we need to have training of officers in other ethnic differences and to look at de-escalating intense situations. The Memphis Police Department trains but they need to make it more of a regular part of the curriculum that is undertaken and observed and protocol taken out by the officers to deescalate. There was no effort to deescalate. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
