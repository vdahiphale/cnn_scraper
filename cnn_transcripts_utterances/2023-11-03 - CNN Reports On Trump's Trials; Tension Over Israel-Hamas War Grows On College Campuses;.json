But the former president of the United States is spending his getting ready to testify, and this time, it's under oath, tonight on LAURA COATES LIVE. It's almost here. Donald J. Trump is going take the stand on Monday in the quarter of a billion-dollar courtroom drama unfolding in New York. That means he's going to face questions about the business that he loves so much that he put his name on it. And this one is really hitting him where he lives or actually really where he used to live. And so, he packed up and went down to Florida, because if the judge rules against the Trumps, they could be forced to pay back millions, and I mean a lot of millions. Perhaps more importantly to them, they could lose their business license in New York. And the former president, well, he is reacting exactly the way you would expect him to. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Maybe it's chump change, as my dad used to say, for the former president.But today, the judge expanded the gag order to now Trump's attorney, the one standing behind him, because it is written order citing hundreds of harassing and threatening phone calls and voicemails and emails and letters and packages, not from the attorneys, of course, but in the wake of Trump's and his attorney's comments about the judge's staff. Well, never a good strategy to upset the judge, because remember, this is not a jury trial, this is a bench trial, meaning it's that judge who's going to decide the case. Meanwhile, it's turning into a bit of a Trump family reunion in the courtroom. We heard from Don Jr., heard from Eric Trump taking the stand this week, accused both of them of knowingly participating in a scheme to inflate their dad's net worth to obtain financial benefits like better loan or insurance policy terms. Eric Trump is using that common refrain, calling the trial a witch hunt. Wonder where he may have heard that before. And he's also -- well, he's blaming New York for what's happening.

I think the president, the former president, is going to be well rehearsed. I think he's going to stick to a very tight script about what he knew and what he didn't know.I know his lawyers are coaching him right now on perjury, Laura, and they're telling him you got to keep it tight because if you perjure yourself, that's going to be a worse crime than just the fraud. You know, that comes with criminal penalties. So, my guess, though, is he's a stage performer, as we both know, but I think he'll perform on that balance beam pursuant to the coaching of his attorneys.

I agree with you in that the prosecutors in the case of this stature has got to dot there Is cross their Ts. But I'm really curious about Ivanka in particular. Why do you think she does not want to testify? Is it something as simple as, look, it's my brothers. It's my father. I don't want to be on the stand when their names are the defendants.

If your dad and your brothers are on trial for something, do you actually want to go and testify? You know you have to go under oath. You know that puts pressure on you. You certainly don't want to say something in the court that's going to hurt your dad or your brothers. And so, I think it's as simple as that. I don't think there's anything beyond that. And also, she has been very public about wanting to stay out of the political process this time. You know, if the president returns to the presidency, I think she has been very clear that she's likely not to return to the White House. So, I do take her at her word.

It was a cross-cultural experience as well. So, I'd been curious about what the experience had been like on college campuses.

All of us are on the executive board of Hillel International's Israel Leadership Network, which is a group of students from -- one each from 150 plus campuses across the country. And what we're hearing directly from students who are part of that network is this culture of intimidation, is students constantly protesting, horrifying terrorist attacks, harboring terrorist sympathies, really creating this culture of intimidation and, in some cases, violence against students on campus.

The passengers say that Joseph Emerson, who was flying as a standby employee passenger, should never have been allowed in the cockpit because they say he was suffering from depression and a lack of sleep.The lawsuit says the incident left them struggling with anxiety, insomnia, and fear of flying. Emerson is facing 83 felony count of attempted murder. He has pled not guilty. Joining me now, Paul Stephen, who was on that flight and one of the three passengers suing Alaska Airlines, along with his attorney, Daniel Laurence. Thank you so much for being here. You know, when we first heard about this story, it was unbelievable to think about. And Paul, in a statement, Alaska Airlines said that it's reviewing the incident and said -- adding -- quote -- \"The pilots and flight attendants operating Flight 2059 responded without hesitation to ensure the safety of all onboard. We are incredibly proud and grateful for their skilled actions.\" So, talk to me about what it is you experienced on that flight.",

I think in this case, there could have been a fear that he had something -- was afraid of losing a job or whatnot. I don't know.

If the court denies that, they'll be pursued individually.We already, since we filed this action, have numerous other passengers contacting us and telling us similar stories. Those passengers were in the FlightAware app, were actually in contact, and could hear the air traffic control that was telling the pilot to describe what the -- quote -- unquote -- \"threat level\" was, and the pilot saying we have them under control. So, there's a lot more going on than meets the eye. We have (INAUDIBLE) not only for emotional distress but also -- and frankly, primarily, our clients are interested in finding out, having the airlines tell us truthfully what they did, if anything -- this is omitted from their public relations statement -- what, if anything, they actually did to evaluate Mr. Emerson and his fitness to be in the cockpit, and what policies and procedures they have or should have. We'd like the court to mandate some kind of check that would challenge people, just like you're challenged by a police officer if you're stopped, just like you're challenged if you go across an immigration border, just like you're challenged in almost every court.

I think all six of them did that. All six of those cast members were able to extend the character beyond any expectations. And Matthew had a gift of -- he would hit a particular word in a sentence that emphasized that word that nobody else had any idea of doing that.
