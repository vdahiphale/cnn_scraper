Had the two stayed the same political course, they may have actually founded Trump/Oprah ticket or an Oprah/Trump ticket for that matter might appeal to many voters who find themselves drawn to both celebrities. And we bring this up because of our friend of the show, Republican pollster Kristen Soltis Anderson, writes this about people that she has spoken to recently. \"When I interviewed a dozen women who voted for Mr. Trump in 2020 and asked them who else they'd like to see run for president, the first responses from one Republican and one independent were emphatic, Oprah.\"The notion of a Trump/Oprah voter is a strong reminder of the power of celebrity to shape public opinion, policy considerations, ideological positioning, and partisan cues all warp around the gravitational pull of mega stardom in America.

He turned himself into this kind of creature, partly because by the time he got into politics in 2016, back in 2000 he was still a medium successful business - by 2016 he's in - in debt up to his eyeballs. He's got a career of crime. He had to shut down the law - he had to become this assault on the legal system because you could either have Donald Trump or the rule of law, or a Trump president to the rule of law but not both.
