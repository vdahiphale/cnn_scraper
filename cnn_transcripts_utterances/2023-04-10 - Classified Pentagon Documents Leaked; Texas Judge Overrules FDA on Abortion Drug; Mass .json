And so I'm just going to say this. We have to advocate for ourselves. It's nice to be nice. And I say that because I have responded to a mass shooter incident on LAPD where the shooter went in the workplace with insider knowledge from cubicle to cubicle. And he said, when he encountered one person: \"You were nice to me. I'm going to let you live.\" So it's nice to be nice, because you never know what someone is going through. You don't know what their proclivity towards violence might be in the workplace. They have insider knowledge. And so that too makes it very difficult to overcome. And so treat people kindly, because you never know when it may come back and be helpful in saving your own life. PHILLIP:  Well, that is a very sobering a kind of assessment of the situation, that people who are dealing with disgruntled colleagues could face being massacred, potentially, at their workplace. But, Steve Moore, it does -- all of this raises some questions here. I mean, we are sitting here two weeks to the day since the Covenant Elementary School shooting.

And so, yes, I mean, you break it down into random shootings, people just walking into malls, people walking into schools, and this is less random, because it's a -- it appears to be a workplace-type violence shooting. I was kind of surprised that, in a bank, you can have that level of casualty, because banks are -- tend to be secured for the customers and for the employees. It also speaks a little bit about the hazards of the law enforcement responding. As we saw in Nashville, it was picture-perfect, textbook response to an active shooter.

And, right now, the Biden administration is gearing up for a fight on a different matter, after a federal judge in Texas suspended the FDA's two-decade-old approval of the popular abortion drug mifepristone. The Justice Department now says it is quickly appealing that ruling. And it would impact tens of millions of women if it is upheld. Now, banning the drug even in states where abortion is legal is what is potentially on the horizon here. It is also important to note that the drug, mifepristone, isn't just used for abortion. Women also use it to safely manage miscarriages. And the judge's ruling could essentially ban that option for them as well. So, some Democrats, including New York's Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, are calling on the administration to simply ignore the Trump-appointed judge's ruling. Now, the White House has pushed back on that idea. But, just this morning, a Republican lawmaker, South Carolina's Nancy Mace, says that she actually agrees with her Democratic colleague. Watch that moment. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. NANCY MACE (R-SC):  This is an FDA-approved drug. I support the usage of FDA-approved drugs, even if we might disagree. It's not up to us to decide as legislators or even as the court system that -- whether or not this is the right drug to use or not, number one. So I agree with ignoring it at this point.

They need to make sure that they have a stay for this, so that mifepristone isn't pulled from the shelves while this litigation is playing out. So that's going to be their main goal. So they may ask him for an additional stay. They have asked the Fifth Circuit for a stay. If they need to go to the Supreme Court because the Fifth Circuit and Judge Kacsmaryk don't extend, then they will do that. That's their primary goal. But I think that's right. If there's a conflict between two judges, you do need to know what to do. You don't want to have the FDA, I think, out of compliance with a federal judge's order. So I think they're doing the right thing here. Aggressively appeal. Work outside the judicial system where necessary to try to make this problem get fixed.

And CNN has its own polling also. This was earlier this year. Two-thirds of Americans support access to medication abortions. That's half of Republicans. It's two-thirds of independents. And it's more than eight in 10 Democrats. That tells you why this is volatile. It is the version of abortion that more Americans are comfortable with, take a pill early on. And the ability to claw back, for one judge to claw back a 23-year-old policy that allows this medication, and to claw it back in a way that impacts handle -- safe handling of miscarriages, as well as abortion, that is -- that is something that many Republicans are concerned may go too far in the public eye, as well as legally.

Who leaked it? How was it leaked? When? And what was the purpose behind this? That's the criminal part of this. The Defense Department, meanwhile, has been doing its own review, along with the interagency, to figure out how best to shore up this sort of very sensitive, highly classified information to make sure it doesn't continue leaking. CNN has reviewed 53 pages that were leaked. But it still remains very possible that there are other documents out there that have been leaked, and simply haven't been discovered, or that could be leaked in the future. So that's part of what the Defense Department is doing to try to lock in on this and make sure that this specific leak doesn't continues. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was briefed on this last week on April 6, and, according to the Pentagon, he remains deeply involved with senior Pentagon leaders about how to make sure this doesn't happen again. Meanwhile, the Pentagon has also been in touch with other allies and partners because of the damage this has caused. And, for that, let's look at what's in these documents. Part of it is about the war in Ukraine with detailed assessments of battlefield updates, as well as Ukraine's military capabilities and its air defenses. It is worth noting that some of this is a bit dated. The documents are dated from late February to early March. But this sort of information, especially at this level of granularity, is still very important, and very -- frankly, very critical to somebody like Russia, who would be interested in learning whatever they can from these documents that come from the highest levels of the Pentagon. It's also damaging from another perspective that you mentioned. And that is, it shows U.S. spying, not only on Russia, for example, its adversary, but also the intel U.S. is gathering on countries like Israel and South Korea, some of its closest allies. Israel, for its art, has essentially dismissed this and said this wasn't too serious or damaging in terms of the relationship. But South Korea had a different sort of reaction, saying they were looking for an explanation from the U.S. So you get a sense there, Abby, of how critical this is, first for the U.S. to get a handle on it and make sure it doesn't happen again, but also for the U.S. to smooth over the relationships with all these countries.",

So, Colonel Leighton, when you look at the scope of a leak like this, in the midst of an ongoing, very hot war between Ukraine and Russia, what is the most concerning to you about what might have been revealed? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Look, Abby, I think the big thing here is the fact that we're in a hot war, like you mentioned. The Ukraine war is one in which the U.S. is providing a lot of support to the Ukrainians. NATO countries are doing the same kind of thing. And it really boils down to the sensitivity of the operations involved. In some ways, I would compare it to the Snowden leak, not in terms of volume. The Snowden leak was much more voluminous. But the types of information that this leak it deals with, that becomes a really important piece of this, because it is so sensitive, and it deals not only with adversaries like Russia, but also close allies like Japan -- like South Korea and Israel. PHILLIP:  And, on that front, I mean, the spying of the U.S. on others, including our allies, should anybody be particularly surprised that that is happening?
