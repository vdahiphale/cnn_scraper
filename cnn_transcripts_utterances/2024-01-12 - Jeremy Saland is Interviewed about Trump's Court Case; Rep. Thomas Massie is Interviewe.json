We're not going to talk about things beyond the four corners of this courtroom. And what did Donald Trump did? That's exactly what he did.To a certain extent I think Judge Engoron is doing that to give Donald Trump that lead and that latitude because he knows there's going to be an appeal and he's taking some wind out of some sails. Whether or not that sort of appellate issue would have any value, you know, I don't know, but he's nonetheless giving Donald Trump that - that sort of space to make those statements, as ridiculous as they are.",

So, where is this going to go? Is there a way to thread this needle for Republicans right now? Let's discuss.

Now, that is the law. The Senate and the White House, right now, have buyer's remorse, I think. They wish they had never agreed to those spending cuts. So, what they tried to do over the Christmas and New Year's break is renegotiate the deal with the new speaker. Now, the problem is, the speaker doesn't really have the authority, or we haven't granted him that authority, to renegotiate that deal. So, myself, and folks like Jim Jordan, we want to stick with the deal we made this summer. Now, there are some folks who want to add to the deal and try to get a border security package in there.

The FAA just announced it will audit the Boeing 737 Max 9 production line. That was the plane involved in last Friday's incident. As you mentioned, all 171 of those planes remain grounded in the U.S.The audit will focus on Boeing and its suppliers. And that is key because a contractor, Spirit AeroSystems, builds the fuselage. This is in addition to the investigation into Boeing's quality control that the FAA announced yesterday. And here's what the FAA said in its announcement of that investigation. It said, \"this incident should have never happened and it cannot happen again. Boeing's manufacturing practices need to comply with the high safety standards they're legally accountable to meet. Remember, this investigation is focusing on the Boeing 737 Max 9 door plug. That is the part of Alaska 1282 that blew out a week ago. And since then both Alaska Airlines and United Airlines found issues with their door plugs. United said it found loose bolts related to possible installation issues. Still a very controlled media message from Boeing. It says this is a result of an escape of quality control. John.",
