It's wonderful to have you with us. President-elect Donald Trump will set foot back in the Oval Office again today for the first time since he departed Washington in disgrace in 2021. We can't show you pictures of the traditional luncheon between the outgoing president and the incoming one from 2020, because it didn't happen. This is the day that President Obama invited Trump to the White House back in 2016. Trump denied Biden this courtesy in 2020 as Trump denied that he had lost. In 2016, Trump was relatively unprepared to govern. This time, Trump's visit to the Oval Office comes as the president-elect is already planning to remake government in his own image, and that includes the U.S. military. Donald Trump announcing last night he selected FOX News host Pete Hegseth as secretary of defense. Sources telling CNN that decision was based in part on Trump's respect for Hegseth's service in the Army and on optics, with one source saying, quote, \"Trump also thinks he has the look.\" The two have a long-standing relationship, with Hegseth having been interviewed Trump a number of times on FOX, including this summer, when they had this now telling exchange.
