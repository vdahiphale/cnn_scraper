      "sentences": "Good morning. You are live in the CNN Newsroom. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.It's the last business day for former President Donald Trump to make a nearly half billion dollar bond payment in his New York civil fraud trial. This morning, he claims to have most of that cash, saying in his Truth Social post, he's dipped into his campaign war chest to back it. But if he can't pay up, New York Attorney General Letitia James is prepared to seize some of his prized properties, starting with his Seven Springs estate and golf course. You can see it right there on the screen. And CNN's Kara Scannell is live in New York with the details. Kara. I mean, the clock is ticking down with -- the sand is going through the hourglass. How is the New York attorney general preparing to seize these assets if Trump doesn't pay this bond?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Jim, the clock is ticking. And as we've seen through this paperwork being filed in Westchester, her team has taken the first initial step of what would be many if they were to begin to move to see some assets.There are, as you said, that golf course in Westchester, as well as the family estate known as Seven Springs. There's also a host of properties in New York directly under the nose in the New York Attorney General's Office, including this office tower, 40 Wall Street, Trump Tower, and Trump's triplex apartment at the very top of that skyscraper. Those are all things that she could potentially seize as well as bank accounts, put liens on some of the apartment buildings he owns. And it all comes down to this deadline of Monday. And will Donald Trump come up with enough money to post the bond? He's saying today in that post that you read that he has $500 million of cash on hand. And his lawyers have told the appeals court that he doesn't have enough cash to cover the $464 million judgment because all the insurers that would underwrite a bond want that size in cash. They want that amount of money in cash, and he doesn't have that amount. Now, his attorney was clarifying Trump's statement to me this morning, saying that Trump was referring to the cash that he has made through running his business, which he has disclosed in his campaign forms, but that's not the actual amount of cash that he currently has on hand. Remember, he already put up a $91.6 million bond to satisfy the judgment in the E. Jean Carroll defamation case. Trump's team is still working to see if he can come together and come up with enough money to satisfy this judgment. Ultimately, the decision is still with the New York appeals court of whether they will grant his request to post a lower amount or not require him to post any money at all until the appeal's over. The New York Attorney General's Office has opposed that. The court is giving them time to respond to Trump's claim earlier this week that no insurance company of the 30 they were in touch with would underwrite a bond. So, they're going to have a chance. That gives you a sense that there's not going to be a decision imminently as this is still being chewed over by the court. Jim?",

I mean, you know, he was saying during the campaign back in 2016 he's a rich guy. He's got $8 billion. Lately, he's been saying he doesn't have the money.

But this has been an absolutely tortured process to get to this point.Remember, the government funding is actually due by October 1st of last year, but they've had to approve short-term extension after short-term extension, avoid near shutdown after near shutdown. And now, finally, they could put last year's business to rest. But remember what happened at the beginning of this process last year. That led to the ouster of the then-speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy, who had to agree to his short-term extension. That caused the revolt among his right flank, and, ultimately, it led to this historic and unprecedented chaos in the House. Mike Johnson had to come in as his speaker. He ultimately cut a deal to keep major federal agencies open. It split up into two separate bills. Today's bill will deal with other major agencies, like the Homeland Security Department, Department of Defense, and the like. But this $1.2 trillion proposal was unveiled yesterday morning at about 3:00 A.M. [10:10:00] They have to pass it by 11.59 PM tonight to avoid a shutdown. And the whole process is causing major concerns within the ranks, particularly among Republicans. And I put the question to many of them about whether they would move to try to oust Mike Johnson. At the moment, they're saying no, but they are not hiding their disdain. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP.

Eastern Hour in the House, they'll have to try to get it out of the Senate. And can they do that today? That is still an open question because it requires all 100 senators to agree to attend time for a vote. One senator can drag out this process, pass the deadline into next week.

They are currently all being processed. And these are for legal assistance and all these other things. It's not for stopping people at the border, as you saw the rush.
