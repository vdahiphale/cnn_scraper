I suspect on both sides.They jam everything. GPS is jammed, but also communications is jammed. So normal drones don't work. So the Ukrainians have taken cheap drones and added additional antennas. One of the things that I learned is something called a kamikaze drone which is a $400 Chinese drone that carries a small payload that moves so fast you can't shoot it down. I had thought that that was the innovation of the war. Two generals yesterday told me that I'm wrong and that what they really need are cruise missile drones which can go really far and carry it with wings and keep carrying more payloads. I don't think the Ukrainian drone strategy is completely formed. But they're building a completely new theory of war. ZAKARIA: And this is where we get to the solution.

It's very inexpensive.I think the goal that we should have for Ukraine is to establish the principle that there will never be another land war where you can invade successfully. That we're expecting the sovereignty of the land is important. If you're mad at them, that's fine. You can negotiate, you can put pressure.

They're moving so quickly.Remember, this is all a year old. Their operating systems and software aren't very integrated. They can't speak to each other. All the problems that you would imagine. Now if it were peace time, you'd an overall strategy, you'd get them organized and so forth. What's interesting to me is this is both a broadband war but it's also a technology war in the sense that it's innovative. And innovation occurs in small companies not in the MOD. The Ukrainians were interesting. I think you know as well that the Ukrainians set up their drone operation outside the military and the drone guy, his name is Fedorov, is busy supplying them to the military. But he controls the money. He controls the strategy. They told us that the biggest problem they currently have is that at the moment they're taking these tiny little essentially pipe bombs and dropping them on to tanks. And what they want is laser-guided ones which America has had for a long time that can follow the target. Again, this is stuff that America did 20 years ago that they're just catching up on.",

The surprising end of Mark Rutte's leadership of the Netherlands came after his conservative government's strict new immigration proposals were rejected by coalition partners.The thorny issue of immigration is hardly unique to the Netherlands. In May, the U.N. Refugee Agency announced that the number of refugees worldwide increased from 27.1 million in 2021 to 35.3 million at the end of 2022. That was the biggest yearly increase ever recorded. In large part, due to the war in Ukraine. In response, many countries have vowed to create tougher environments for asylum seekers. To help us better understand how the politics of immigration is playing out around the world we're joined by the journalist Christopher Caldwell who has long written on these issues. Welcome. So, when you look around this is separate from the Ukraine issue. What you have is this very large influx of migrants who are coming in and as in America they claim to be asylum seekers. And that is, to my mind, at the heart of the controversy. Is it not that there is this feeling that these not really asylum seekers? CHRISTOPHER CALDWELL, CONTRIBUTING OPINION WRITER, NEW YORK TIMES: Well, yes, and that has -- that feeling has kind of increased since the migration from the Syrian war in 2015. You know, up until then I think that most immigration, you could say, was labor related. It was not asylum-related. But you got people coming from the Syrian war. But then in their train came a whole bunch of people from all sorts of different countries. From -- you know, from Afghanistan, from as far away as Pakistan. And they were coming into this asylum-seeking group. So, yes, there is impatience and skepticism about that. But there is -- there is also a kind of a backdrop of -- there is a -- there is a demographic sort of like weather system kind of on the horizon which is sort of you have a -- you have a lot of demographic pressure building up in Africa which is destined to gain about a billion people in the next generation. And you have a shrinking population in Europe. And that means that whatever we're seeing in the Mediterranean now, is going to increase, you know?
