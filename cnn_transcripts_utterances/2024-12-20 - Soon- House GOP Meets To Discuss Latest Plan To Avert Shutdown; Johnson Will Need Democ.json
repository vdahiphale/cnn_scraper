      "sentences": "Today on Inside Politics, the nightmare before Christmas. In exactly 12 hours, the federal government will shut down unless Congress acts fast. Speaker Mike Johnson claims, he now has a plan, but does he have the votes? CNN is live on Capitol Hill with the fast-breaking developments.Plus, who is the boss? I will talk to a top Democratic senator about his party's negotiations behind the scenes, including why they think it is Elon Musk calling the shots in the GOP. And where is Joe? The current president is noticeably out of sight as the government he runs braces for a potential shutdown. We have new reporting on the waning days of Joe Biden's administration. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. We start, of course, on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers are scrambling to figure out a way to keep the government lights on through the holidays. About 30 minutes from now, House Speaker Mike Johnson will try to sell his colleagues on what we are now told is a three-part plan to fund the government and do so through March. Now, one notable aspect as of now is that it does not include what the president-elect Donald Trump had wanted in this -- in the first place, which is a plan to raise the debt ceiling now. CNN's Manu Raju joins me from Capitol Hill. Tell us more about this plan, and the obvious question is, will he have enough votes to pass it?",

      "sentences": "YEAH, CNN CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT. That is the big question. But we now know they are settling on a plan to essentially move these pieces of legislation separately. Remember, this is all tied together as one big package to keep the government open along a whole wide range of other issues, $100 billion in aid for natural disasters that have hit across the country.A directly to farmers have been hit by bad conditions and the like. And Donald Trump injecting that last toxic effort to raise or suspend the national debt limit. He asked for that in the 11th hour that scuttled that bipartisan deal earlier this week. But we are now learning, according to our sources inside a closed-door meeting with the speaker of the House, that they plan to separate out each of these bills and move them individually. That would include a three-month extension of government funding, $100 billion disaster relief package and a $10 billion farm package. Now here's the other catch, that push by Donald Trump to spend the national debt limit will be set aside because they simply do not have the votes to move it ahead. That's because of opposition, not just from Democrats believe that they -- that would allow Donald Trump to move his agenda next year, if they were to agree to that now, but also conservative Republicans who don't want to raise the national debt limit. So, now this is the big question. Will Democrats support this? Because Democratic support is necessary. I caught up with Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic leader, ahead of a closed-door meeting, and he indicated for the first time in recent days, the negotiations are ongoing. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-NY): Lines of communication have been reopened? We're going to do everything we can to avoid a catastrophic government (Ph).",

The question is, how will Trump react to this?I am told that there is going to be a Republican agreement to try to move on the debt limit next year, not deal with it this year. And Dana, where will the votes ultimately come down? The other discussion is, will they vote tonight on this, using a procedure that will require two thirds majority of the House to advance it. Meaning a lot of Democrats are to support each of these individual bills in this separate vote strategy or wait to tomorrow and try to do it along party lines or during a separate procedure. That will be passed the shutdown deadline at midnight tonight. They plan to huddle behind closed doors at 12:30 eastern, Dana, to try to figure out their way forward.",

I think that is part of the strategy here.I also think part of it is just getting as many votes as you can on the items that people agree on and breaking this down. There was also some entertainment of whether or not they would add the debt ceiling as a separate vote as part of this. Clearly, that's not the strategy that they're contending with, but that was another way to sort of try to satisfy Donald Trump. So right now, I think this is one of those sort of -- it's all the same bill, but it just looks a little different than it was before operations. Sometimes that works on Capitol.",

There were signs that this was going to be a problem over the weekend. And not just from -- there's been, I think, kind of a mis narrative that you know that the Democratic goodies are in here, which is true.But there was also, as you reported, a lot of a farm state Republicans who were wanting farm aid in there and hurricane assistance. So, there was a lot of grumbling. I started hearing it Sunday and Monday from Republicans about Speaker Johnson and his staff, that they simply did not sort of get this going. But I'm still struck by the image last Saturday at the army navy football game when the president elect the vice president-elect Elon Musk, Speaker Johnson and Senator Thune were in the same space. I mean, watching this football game in a suite at Northwest stadium here, just, you know, miles from the Capitol. And this was not a part of this, of the discussion. They were already looking beyond this. So then, why did Donald Trump get involved in this at all? He could have kept his hands clean from this. Was he sort of dragged in by Elon Musk? Was he following him? Was Elon Musk sort of the canary in the coal mine here? I think my biggest question going out of this is, A, does speaker Johnson survive in January? But B, what does this do to the long-term Trump-Musk relationship? I'm not sure we know that yet.",

He's going to have Republicans will have unified control here.

And so, if it is fundamentally not something they want to do, the pressure from Donald Trump and knowing that he might change his mind in a week and a half. That is starting to eat away at his power over some of these Republicans. Dan Crenshaw made this point to me yesterday. He said we would be willing to eat a crap sandwich, and yet we are.

From Texas Chip Roy is getting in the way as usual, of having another -- yet another great Republican victory, all for the sake of some cheap publicity for himself.

I'm not sure that we -- I think there are limits to what we can read into by this messy episode right now, however it ends, what next year will forte.
