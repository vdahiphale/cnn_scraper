Welcome to CNN Newsroom.Coming up, concerns that the United Nations won't be able to carry out critical relief work as nations cut funding following stunning allegations about some workers in Gaza. U.S. President Joe Biden hits the campaign trail in South Carolina, telling voters why he expects to defeat Republican frontrunner Donald Trump. And the mother of convicted Michigan school shooter is on trial, raising questions about parents' responsibility for their children's actions. The head of the U.N. agency helping Palestinian refugees in Gaza says the group might have to end operations there. These nine countries paused funding for the U.N. Relief and Works Agency, known as UNRWA, after accusations by Israel that a handful of their workers were involved in the October 7th Hamas attack. UNRWA fired nine accused staffers and launched an investigation. The U.N. says one accused staffer has died and the identities of two others are being verified. The U.N. secretary general is asking that countries continue to fund that agency, saying the abhorrent alleged acts of these staff members must have consequences. But the tens of thousands of men and women who work for UNRWA should not be penalized. The dire needs of the desperate populations they serve must be met. 2 million civilians in Gaza rely on that aid from UNRWA and those needs are growing. As Israel continues its military operation in Khan Younis, families are evacuating, struggling to find a safe haven, besides hunger, fierce rain and cold weather are making their escape even more miserable. And further north in Gaza City, Palestinians rushed to grab sacks of flour that were delivered Saturday. The U.N. warned this week that parts of the territory are facing famine and residents say the aid isn't reaching everyone. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

This U.S. provided M109 Paladin Howitzer near Bakhmut is often silent because they don't have enough shells to target the Russians, the commander tells me.We cannot fulfill our tasks 100 percent, he says, although we really want to. My crew and other crews are just waiting for it and are ready to work around the clock. But it gets even worse, finally, resupply does arrive, but it's only four rounds and this type of ammo won't hurt the Russians much. This really illustrates the shortages that Ukrainians have to deal with, four rounds. That's all they're going to get right now. And, by the way, they're not even explosive rounds. They're smoke rounds. These shells will barely explode on impact. It's almost like firing cannonballs in medieval times. But the commander says sometimes it's all they can do. Every shell that is suitable for the Paladin we use, he says. It's better than no shells. The Russians face no such shortages in this area. Ukrainian military intelligence believes Russia produced around 2 million rounds last year and acquired around one million from North Korea. Massive barrages have laid waste to Bakhmut and much of the surrounding area at the headquarters of the 93rd Mechanized Brigades Artillery Division, the frustration is palpable. From their drones They can see the Russians gathered to continue their assaults on Ukrainian positions but they often can't take them out because they need to conserve ammunition, the commander tells me. The ratio is about ten to one he says. Ammunition is very important to us. Russia is a country that produces ammo. They have strategic reserves. Yes, they use old Soviet systems But Soviet systems can still kill. Even without enough ammo, the Ukrainians say they are stopping most Russian assaults here and the M109 crew did manage to fire at Russian positions. But they know they'll need a lot more firepower to stop Russian advances. Fred Pleitgen, CNN, near Bakhmut, Ukraine. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Unidentified government killed nine people on Saturday in the border city of Saravan. According to Iranian state media, no group or individual has claimed responsibility. French farmers angry over government regulations and falling prices are taking to the streets and threatening to converge on Paris on Monday. They blocked a major highway out of the capital Friday. The prime minister says a planned phase out of subsidies for diesel fuel will be scrapped. The farmers say their protests will continue. Their grievances include environmental policies and competition from Ukrainian farmers. France is Europe's largest food producer, but other E.U. nations have seen similar protests. And it's not just farmers. French reproductive rights activists are also making their voices heard. They're hoping to permanently secure the right to abortion care. Next week, French lawmakers are expected to vote on a bill that would change the Constitution to do just that. But the fight isn't over just yet. Melissa Bell explains.

And then the really disturbing evidence, it just gets worse and worse, is that on the day that they're at the school and the school has called them in, they didn't tell the school officials that he had access to a gun, that the gun was in an unlocked case. They didn't ask that his backpack be searched, or that he leave with them to go to get medical care, again, despite all of his efforts to get some kind of medical attention. So, jurors are going to have to weigh all of this evidence against Jennifer's defense, which is that she didn't know that her son was going through these, this mental health crisis and that she shouldn't be held accountable for what may look like bad parenting.",

And the appellate court said, we're not too concerned that this will set a precedent for the future that says all parents in all situations will be held accountable for the intentional actions of their children. They said that this case, though, was so egregious and that the evidence was so overwhelming that they could find that this case could proceed to trial without setting a precedent for every subsequent case where a child may engage in some kind of criminal behavior.So, I think in the eyes of the appellate court, this is a very narrow case based on these very specific set of facts.",

Museum officials say the artifacts were taken from Ghana during the 19th century. They add that many of the objects, including more than a dozen pieces from the Ansante royal court were looted during war. Some of the relics were believed to hold the spirit of past royal figures. Well, earlier, I spoke to Human Rights Attorney Jeffrey Robertson who is in Melbourne, Australia. He's the author of Who Owns History.

To get around it, the museums who want to do the right thing do not include the British Museum, but other museums will, in fact, loan it back, and perhaps they won't seek in three years' time to collect on the loan.
