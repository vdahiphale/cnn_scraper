And a warm welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Paula Newton in New York sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. Russian President Vladimir Putin is using his virtual podium at the BRICS summit in South Africa to once again blame the West for Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Saying the West desired to maintain its global dominance, that's what triggered the conflict. And this comes after a night where drone strikes were traded between Ukraine and Russia. And as Moscow dismisses top general, Sergei Surovikin, from his post leading the country's aerospace forces. Now, Surovikin briefly led the Russian army in Ukraine but hasn't been seen in public since that failed rebellion by the Wagner Mercenary Group to which he in fact had ties. Meantime, Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, is back in Kyiv ahead of the country's Independence Day tomorrow, and that wraps up a whirlwind European tour, that saw him bag guarantees of F-16 fighter jet deliveries from both Denmark and the Netherlands. Now, I spoke about all of this earlier with retired four-star general, David Petraeus, the former head of the CIA, also commanded U.S. forces in Afghanistan. He's currently chairman of the KKR Global Institute, which does advice the KKR Investment firm about international matters, and that includes Ukraine. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I mean, it's clearly important to Zelenskyy. He brought a flag from Bakhmut to congress. And yet, there is this issue that U.S. officials keep pointing to, off the record, that Ukraine is stretching itself too much in this counteroffensive.",

      "sentences": "I might suggest to those who are doing that, if you will, that perhaps we should be focusing on providing additional assistance to ensurethat they're going to be able to carry out this offensive for another four months or so. Keep in mind, we're just at the 10-week mark. You know, this is like a third of the way through the surge in Iraq, when I was also getting lots of questions and comments, and people were wondering whether the surge had failed and so forth. First of all, no plan survives contact with the enemy. They have adapted, I think, very impressively. And that final element of stretch, starve and strike -- and I believe stretch is appropriate, contrary to those that think we should mass it all in one location, if you do that, they'll be able to reposition their forces. And to blunt that, you've got to keep them stretched out. The Ukrainians still have important reserve units that have not yet been committed, some of which have American provided Striker vehicles, other have western tanks and infantry fighting vehicles. And when they have the conditions set, when they have sufficiently degraded the Russian's capabilities, including their logistics and headquarters and reserve forces and artillery, and are able to work their way through the first belt of minefields, then I think you'll start to see them try to exploit this and push it farther. There are two locations in particular, in the south, in western Zaporizhzhia province and then -- (INAUDIBLE) and then Eastern Zaporizhzhia, both of those show modest but promising advances. And if they can crack through there, then we're also going to find out something we really still don't know, and that is how effective the Russian second line units will be, and whether or not they can actually muster reserves. Keep in mind, the Russian forces have been in these lines since the very beginning of this offensive, and in many cases, months prior to it. And to be fair to the Russians who have not distinguished themselves with professional expertise, certainly didn't during the first year, they have established a very impressive defensive in depth, and that's very difficult to penetrate.",

But if we underscore that and then take something else that you said, given air superiority, which has clearly been a point of contention, we see that perhaps the F-16s, Ukraine might get them by the beginning of 2024, they say it's a game changer. What do you say? Do you think that could potentially change the course of the war or is that opinion overblown?",

Because keep in mind thatPutin has tried to keep Moscow somewhat insulated from this. He's never fully mobilized. It's always been a special military operation. The brunt has fallen on these communities that are way outside the major cities of Russia. And so, this is all of a sudden reminding the Russian people that there is a war going on. Also, it will remind them, of course, that they started it, and that it's been carried out in quite a brutal manner.",

      "sentences": "Well, because they left. Russia suffered a huge brain drain, and then it suffered another loss of military age males. More left last fallthan go to the conscription stations. So, to a degree, this brings that war home to them. It certainly forces Russia to have air defenses in many of the locations where it thought that wouldn't be required. The key would be certainly keep it focused on military targets, don't go after civilian infrastructure. Don't do what the -- certainly, what the Russians have done. They're attacking clearly civilian infrastructure and locations. But at the end of the day, this is going to be about what happens on the front lines, and that's where the focus should be. And frankly, I think, again, that the Ukrainians have adapted very impressively. They know their forces far better than we do and their capabilities and their lack of capabilities. They know the terrain far better than we do. They're fighting their war of independence. We shouldn't forget that. This is total mobilization in Ukraine and they are keenly aware of the need to achieve results during this particular offensive. The objective of which is, of course, to crack and then hopefully bring about the collapse of the Russians, at least in some areas, to enable them to cut that ground line of communication that comes in from Russia across Southeastern Ukraine and then connects down into Crimea, ideally then, even to isolate Crimea a bit more to put the air bases and naval bases at risk there as well.",

But the question should be, how can we ensure that this is sufficiently firm? And I'm not sure we always have been sufficiently firm and we're not always across the board, but not needlessly provocative. I don't think that those actions are needlessly provocative. I think they're part of ensuring that deterrence is very, very solid. And deterrence rests on a potential adversary's assessment of two elements, they are your capabilities on the one hand and your willingness to employ them on the other. And yes, what happens in Ukraine reverberates out there and it does affect calculations of our willingness to do something and our capabilities to do it. Let's not forget, President Xi seized on our decision to withdraw from Afghanistan and then the way that we conducted it, commenting that, see, you can't count on the Americans. And look at that, they're a great power in decline. Ukraine shows that we can and will lead the world. The $44 billion worth of arms, ammunition, and other assistance are just extraordinary. So are the sanctions that we've led the way on with our western partners. But we do need to do more, and we do need to have a greater sense of urgency about some of these issues that have just been hanging fire, waiting for key decisions.",
