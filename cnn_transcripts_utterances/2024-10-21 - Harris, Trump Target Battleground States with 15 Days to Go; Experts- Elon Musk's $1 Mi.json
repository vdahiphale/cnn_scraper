Now, what the campaign is trying to do here is to target a small, but potentially decisive group of voters and that is Republicans who are turned off by former President Donald Trump and they are taking this message to suburban areas in these key swing states. As you mentioned there, Pennsylvania, crucial state, that's where this began in what is a series of moderated conversations. But let's fast forward to when the vice president will be here with Cheney later this afternoon, and this is Waukesha County. It is a long longtime GOP stronghold. It is also an area though that President Biden did slightly better in 2020, even if he lost, he performed better than any Democrat in decades. So it is these types of areas that the Harris campaign is now seizing on, hoping that they can try to reach those disaffected Republicans. Now of course, this is not a new strategy. This has been deployed since August of course, during the Democratic National Convention, Democrats also had a part of their programming specifically focused on Republicans who are going to vote for the vice president, crossing party lines because again, they were putting democracy first, that according to their words. So this is a broadening out of that strategy, but it is also telling, Richard, because this is the part of the strategy that they are going to use in the closing weeks of this election. What that tells you is that they know, this is a race that is very tight, exceedingly tight and they are going to have to reach those Republicans and bring them to the vice president's column to try to eke out that win in November.",

But itsonly available, the giveaway, to people in seven swing dates. And you have to be registered to vote to take part and sign the petition. Now, let's just go through that clearly. Here you have a petition, but you have to be able to sign the petition -- you to sign the petition, you have to be registered to vote; therefore, if you want to take part in the petition and sign it and you're not registered, you have to register to vote and that has raised questions on whether this is against the law, because you have to have taken -- you have to have registered, and election law experts say, because you have to have registered, it may be illegal. Here is the law. It is Title 52. It is subsection 103-07. I've got a copy of it here, just in case you want to follow along. Federal law says it is a crime to pay someone or offer to pay or accept payment for registration to vote or for voting. It is a $10,000.00 fine, five years in prison, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. Tim Walz has responded, speaking on ABC's \"The View.\" He said, the fact that you have to be registered and it is paying people to register, well, that makes it almost illegal. Brendan Fischer is a campaign finance lawyer, deputy executive director of \"Documented.\" I tried to do my best there. It might have been a poor best to get to the point, but the point is, it is the sine qua non of being registered to take part in the new petition that you say is illegal. BRENDAN FISCHER, CAMPAIGN FINANCE LAWYER, DEPUTY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, \"DOCUMENTED\": That's right. So the law clearly prohibits paying somebody to vote or to register to vote and the reason that Elon Musk's plan is unlawful is because in order for a swing state voter to be eligible for the $100.00 payment or eligible for the $1 million payout, they have to be registered to vote. Your eligibility is conditional on registration, and that's what renders the plan illegal. It would be a different story if any swing-state resident could sign the petition and then become eligible for the pay-off, but it is the conditioning of that dealing that renders it unlawful.",

So he continues to blow it up and in a sense, and I am not going to be able to do this because I've never been able to tie a balloon -- you just have to pretend you can see that there is the deficit as such. However, Vice President Harris is also ballooning the deficit. In her case, it is only $1.2 trillion because child tax credit takes part of it, but she is also going to have higher corporate taxes, which remember, Donald Trump says he is going to cut corporate taxes.

But in this case, it has actually gone after non-military targets with these strikes, going after several branches of this financial institution that alongside the United States and other countries have accused of being effectively Hezbollah's kind of banking infrastructure that helps finance its militant activities. And now Israel carried out these strikes in multiple parts of Lebanon, including in the Lebanese capital of Beirut and some densely populated areas. We saw some pretty striking images of explosions very close to Beirut's Rafic Hariri International National Airport. And the reason why Israel says it is going after these targets is to kind of continue with this strategy of using military pressure to put internal Lebanese pressure on Hezbollah as well, to get them to try and agree to some kind of a ceasefire that would be more favorable to Israel's terms, meaning not just stopping the fighting, but also moving its forces away, dozens of kilometers away from the Israeli border with Lebanon. And in this case, a senior Israeli intelligence officials says that the aim of these strikes is to try and sever trust within the Shia community, which relies on this banking institution, relies on Hezbollah social services, in many cases, to try and sever the trust of the Shia community with Hezbollah. And this is just another layer of pressure that the Israelis are attempting to bring on Hezbollah. Not clear whether or not that strategy is going to be effective, but it comes as the Biden administration's special envoy, Amos Hochstein has now arrived in Lebanon today to try and see if these ceasefire negotiations can move forward. He arrived with a new list of demands that Israeli officials have been making, setting out a much, much harder line than they had before for all of the heavy blows that they have dealt to Hezbollah over the course of the last month -- Richard.",

And many people are unhappy with this, especially you think about artists, comedians, certain subject matter experts who are worried that their content, both their written posts and images that they shared to the site could be used to train this A.I. system that could eventually replace them. Some people are also worried that personal information that they have shared to the platform could start to show up in answers from this A.I. chat bot Grok. So, we're already seeing people going back and deleting some of their posts on this platform. And it's also notable because this is a pretty significant change. You said they didn't hide it in their terms of service, but they also didn't come right out and say it. Previously, X was allowing people to opt out of having their content used to train Grok. It was saying it wouldn't train the A.I. system on private accounts. But it is not clear whether those carve outs will still be available after these terms of service go into effect.",

Of course, you say that holding your breath because over the last few days, you would start seeing the power was coming back and then it would immediately crash again. You drive up an hour in any direction, it's a very, very different story. People are now going into their fourth day without power. Millions of Cubans still are in the dark. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) OPPMANN (voice-over): Near empty streets in Havana, devoid of light and life. On the third night in an island wide blackout in Cuba, residents of this neighborhood play dominoes to pass the time and distract them from the worsening situation. Children are sleeping in the street, she says, because there's no food, no water, no electricity in this country. Tensions are running high as Cubans increasingly are taking to the streets to beat pots and pans and protest the government's failure to keep the lights on for more than a few hours. OPPMANN (on camera): Already, four times the Cuban government has been in the process of restoring power and had it all come crashing down in a complete loss of power on this island. So, that is what worries people, is that the longer this goes on, we already know that school is going to be canceled here for several days. Life really can't return to normal until the power gets on. OPPMANN (voice-over): The Cuban government blames us economic sanctions for the crisis, but has made little investment in the aging, jerry-rigged power grid that has been fading for years. Officials say more than 52,000 workers are on the job, 24/7 trying to restore power, and that they understand the growing anger. Without electricity, there's no water, he says. No medicine production, no food distribution. Electricity affects everything, and it frustrates everyone. In 2021, power outages sparked the largest ever protests against Cuba's communist-run government. Hundreds of people were arrested and given lengthy prison sentences following mass trials. Cuba's president on Sunday, warned people not to take to the streets. We're not going to allow acts of vandalism and much less alter the tranquility of our people, he says. That's a conviction, a principle of our revolution. A stern warning, but one that likely falls on deaf ears for the millions of Cubans still in the dark. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
