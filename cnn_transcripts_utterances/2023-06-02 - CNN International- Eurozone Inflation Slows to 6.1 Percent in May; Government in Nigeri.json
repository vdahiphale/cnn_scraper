Food inflation dropped by 1 percentage point in May compared to April. Although it remains high at 12.5 percent. And at this early stage, it's unlikely households and consumers across the block are feeling much benefits from this improvement.While the glimmer of good news caused some economists to question whether the European Central Bank might ease up on its rate hikes. The general consensus is that there will be a rate rise this month and another to come this year. Not least after ECB President Christina Lagarde spoke about the bank's determination to bring inflation down to 2 percent in a speech in Hanover Thursday. Adding, we have made clear that we still have ground to cover to bring interest rates to sufficiently restricted levels. One other headwind for the ECB is wage growth in the eurozone. Unsurprisingly given how costly life has become thanks to inflation, workers have demanded higher wages. Wage growth in the eurozone was 5.1 percent year on year in the last quarter of 2022. Now that is not enough to offset the cost of living but it does contribute to inflation. So, the ECB will no doubt be watching that indicator as well as CPI before considering a new phase for interest rates. Anna Stewart, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

We know it's adlibbed because we received a copy of the speech before he delivered it. And those remarks were not there.What he meant to say was that the previous administration had not left anything in the budget beyond the end of June for him to pay for the subsidies. And he was deciding actually after the end of June we have to review the spending on this. It's not sustainable, he said in that speech. Nigeria is spending around $867 million every month on fuel subsidy. It's a very expensive venture for a country which is over $100 billion in debt. And that budget debt is actually more than the education and health budget put together that the country spends. But you know, Nigerians are angry at the manner in which it was announced. It immediately caused panic because people suddenly stormed petrol stations trying to stock up. Some gas stations stopped selling all together because they sensed a greater pay day ahead. Not Nigerians consider the subsidy or cheap gas, part of their inheritance if you like. Citizens of oil a producing country, they receive so little. And it's something that is very dear to Nigerians. But the reality is that the country just cannot afford it. But the manner in which it's been done leaves many feeling a little angry. We've been speaking to people on the streets of Lagos. Take a listen to their reaction. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
