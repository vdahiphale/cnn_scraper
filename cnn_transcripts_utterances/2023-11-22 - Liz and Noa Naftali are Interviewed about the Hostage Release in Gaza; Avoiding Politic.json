We know there's sort of, you know, the details, 50 over a four-day period, hostages released out of Gaza in exchange for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli prisons. But I asked Mohammed al-Khulaifi, you know, how are they going to make that hostage release work and how are they going to ensure that both parties in this deal stick to the parameters, the details of the deal. This is what he told me. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MOHAMMED AL-KHULAIFI, QATAR MISTER OF STATE: Within the four days pause, in each day there will be an obligation on each side, on obligation on the Israelis and an obligation on Hamas, making sure that they are going to fulfill those obligations each day. So, on each day we aim to have a number of releases because the number is big. So, we try - the - we've managed to get the parties to agree on the releases systematically. In other words, there will be an organized schedule allowing the releases in each day. And each party is quite familiar now with their obligations. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And if they - if they fulfill that over the four- day period, then there is an opportunity for more to be released over a period of days. You know, every ten that I'll released, that increases this truce period potentially. And they need to see a list every day of the names of those who will be released because at present we do not know who we are going to see released by Hamas on the first day, for example. That being, as we are reporting, likely 10On the other side, Kaitlan, and I think this is really important, on the aid coming in through Rafah, this is something they've been able to achieve, which is has been really difficult, there is fuel included in those aid shipments coming through Gaza. And that aid, that fuel, is specifically for humanitarian infrastructure throughout the Gaza Strip, both in the south and the north. Hospitals, education facilities. This is much needed. So, they've wrapped this hostage release around a humanitarian opportunity as well. That is why they are calling it a humanitarian pause in the Gaza Strip. They hope that this will hold. They hope to get some success in these first four days. And then they hope that they can add layers to this going forward. Kaitlan.",

They have been in the dark. We, as you understand information-wise, we are in the dark. But they are truly in the dark. And we wouldn't people to understand that these are 230 people. They're not numbers. So, when we talk about ten coming out, ten coming out, these are ten people that belong to a family. The first ones will be children.
