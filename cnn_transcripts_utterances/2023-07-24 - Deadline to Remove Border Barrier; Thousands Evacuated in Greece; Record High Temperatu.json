The owner of this property tells us that she's upset, frustrated, because she doesn't have access. Well, U.S. border patrol doesn't either. This is what it actually looks like. You can see here. It's a mound of dirt. There is no access. And the owner of this property tells us that border patrol is actually leasing this space and it could be used to provide more humane conditions for migrants. Take a look here. They've got porta-potties, a washing stations and tents that could be used to process migrants while they are waiting to be sent to processing facilities. And, John, instead, you can look around me, there are no migrants here. We just saw a very large group of migrants walk through the river. But these resources that are already here, not being used.

Now, this really doesn't look like they're removing the buoys. It looks more like maintenance on the buoys. And, again, because the water levels are so low, John, you can see that even the individuals who are working on the buoys, the workers, are maybe at thigh-high water.So, earlier today, we started seeing some of that construction equipment go up and down the river. It appeared like they were trying to assess the situation. But it really does look like it's just -- the water levels are really low today. And those buoys, if you take a look closely, actually, you can see the anchors for the buoys, it's that low. Those -- there's concrete slabs that are right by the buoys. Those are the anchors. You can see them right next to the buoys. And, John, to your point, these buoys, according to the state of Texas, they're supposed to deter illegal immigration and costing the Texas taxpayer about $850,000. That's according to an information request that we obtained. And you can see that it is not deterring illegal immigration. I mean this is just a portion of the river. And what we've seen are migrants literally walk along the water to turn themselves into immigration authorities. And, John, I have to point out that normally, if this concertina wire was not here, those migrants would be able to walk on solid ground rather than walking on the river. Now, the other complaint - I want to show this air boat because the other complaint that we've been hearing from migrants out here is that law enforcement in these air boats have been circling them, knocking them over. And that's another one of those humanitarian issues, humanitarian concerns raised by critics is, is that humane behavior to try to corral, if you will, migrants on the water using air boats. So, a long list of concerns, John. It's unclear again what Governor Abbott will do come the 2:00 p.m. Eastern deadline. We are here. We'll take a look. But at this point we're not seeing any movement in regards to the removal of the buoys. John.",

Command says that King's welfare is now the primary concern. In Spain now a chaotic situation in the country's parliament. The country's ruling center left party lost its majority after calling a snap election, but none of the other parties won enough seats to form a majority government. So that means they are likely headed for a round of painful political negotiations as the various parties try to cobble together a ruling coalition. And in China at least 11 people have died after a roof collapsed at a middle school gym. The girls volleyball team was training in the gym at the time and a preliminary investigation suggests that the collapse may have been caused by materials that were being stored on the roof.

KEVIN FOSTER, ARIZONA BURN CENTER DIRECTOR, VALLEYWISE HEALTH MEDICAL CENTER: The pavement is so hot that it only takes a fraction of a second to get a pretty deep burn.

But since then it's been over 100 degrees with the average temperature above 110 for several of those days. And July is on track to be the hottest July on record. So, you can see that these numbers are just going in the wrong direction. In Phoenix they're looking at the 25th day -- consecutive day over 110 degrees. And I was in Phoenix last week looking at what they're dealing with there and how they are handling this issue because one of the doctors told me that when the body gets to about 107 degrees, that's when you can start seeing symptoms of heatstroke fit into the body and that is when they have to get into the ER and really help them. In fact, take a look at how Dr. Frank LeVecchio showed me how they work to immediately cool down the body. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. FRANK LEVECCHIO, EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN, VALLEYWISE HEALTH MEDICAL CENTER: Try to throw a little bit of ice, you know, on here, on the bottom, get a little bit on the bottom. And then when they get their body on here, we like to throw it all above them. So, what's going to happen then is the only thing showing is going to be their head. OK. That, in an ideal world.

So, people, if they're collapsing because of heatstroke or if they're homeless and they're hitting some of that hot asphalt, they're getting very severe burns. So, obviously, this is a concern here throughout the southwest.And this heat, which is about 10 degrees, 15 degrees above normal, is now going to start shifting east. And so we're going to see more people in the center of the country starting to see these extreme heats being about 20 degrees above average. But, obviously, this heat cycle that we're seeing is showing the difference here because of human-induced climate change. And that is why you're seeing some of these desert communities in particular looking to find ways to mitigate some of this heat moving forward and trying to find ways to figure out what they need to do. Maybe some of it is painting some of the ground white. All of these things they're looking to do because this does seem to be the new normal where each year does seem to get more and more extreme, Rahel.",
