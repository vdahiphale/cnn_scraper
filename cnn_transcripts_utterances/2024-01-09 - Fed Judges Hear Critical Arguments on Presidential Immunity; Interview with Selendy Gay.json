I think -- to pick up on my response to Judge Childs, we certainly stand by our view in the brief that some substantial number of allegations would fall outside of an outer perimeter. And that, I think, is enough to affirm. I think either parties are urging the court at that point to then send, of course, the case back to the district court. I think that then would create a series of challenging questions that I mentioned earlier. What are the evidentiary theories under which that evidence could potentially come in?And -- but it would be our strong view, and we would want, if the court follow that route, which we urge the court not to, to make clear that immunity is an on-off switch, right? This is the immunity appeal. If the court says we affirm, we send it back, there's no immunity. Then other things become evidentiary questions or questions really up jury instructions which any appeal is then an appeal from a final judgment if any final judgment.",

And I think now, before this court, I understand the arguments to be principally -- sort of the principal submission to be as you've just described. This -- what we call in our brief, the condition precedent argument that there is only liability, criminal liability for a former president if that president has been impeached and convicted.And that is wrong for textual, structural, historical reasons, and a host of practical ones. One of which I'll start with, again, just to just amplify the point, it would mean that if a former president engages in assassination selling pardons, these kinds of things, and then isn't impeached and convicted, there is no accountability for that individual, and that is frightening. Now, to go back to some of the textual and historical and structural, you know, my friend on the other side sort of suggests this is what the founders were talking about and this is what they were worried about. I think that's entirely an inaccurate representation of the founding era history. There's basically no discussion of the impeachment judgment clause, which I take the defendant's principled textual arguments to be. What the impeachment judgment clause did was two things, as the district court described, right? It constrained the sanctions that Congress could place on an impeached and convicted officer, not only a president, any kind of officer to removal or disqualification. And then it made clear that that impeachment did not impose some sort of preclusive bar on subsequent criminal prosecution. You would think that if there was this kind of impeachment first requirement, impeachment and conviction first, you might actually find something somewhere in the sources the framing -- the convention in Philadelphia, the ratification discussions, early history, there is nothing of that. We've cited certain things in our brief from James Wilson, from Edmund Pendleton, from Representative Dana that say this, just a story. I don't hear the defendant to offer anything other than -- well, Hamilton. All that Hamilton was describing was the undisputed point here that a sitting president can't be subject to criminal prosecution. Until that sitting president is no longer in office, whether the removal from office is through impeachment and conviction, or simply the end of the term. Now, a structural point as well that I just want to quickly make, the district court made this which is if this rule were right, that would put -- if the condition precedent rule were correct, it would pose significant separation of powers problem of its own. It would basically mean that the executive branch would only be able to prosecute someone if Congress had acted. And there are all sorts of reasons why, of course, Congress won't act. For one, they've never believed that it was required. And also, in certain instances they may decide that they don't have jurisdiction. Many of the members of Congress seem to hold that view with respect to the defendant's second impeachment.",

We've been hearing from the appellate court in a very consequential case today involving the big question, whether a president of the United States, a former president, will experience immunity for what they did while they were in office. We went through a whole lot of very interesting points. A very major concession that was made almost at the beginning of the entire discussion was that the counsel for Donald Trump's legal team, D. John Sauer, said that a president could be prosecuted under certain circumstances. It was not a case of absolute immunity. But here was the big condition for everyone at home, that if a president were impeached, and if that president were convicted, that would be one of the singular ways for a president to then be criminally prosecuted.

But when you hear that, trying to go through the hypotheticals, trying to follow that thread of common sense and logic, what struck you about that moment where he essentially has a qualified guess that a president could actually order an assassination and if he's not impeached or convicted, immune?TEMIDAYO AGANGA-WILLIAMS, PARTNER, SELENDY GAY ELSBERG:  I think he's really making the arguing for Jack Smith. This is exactly what Jack Smith has been worrying about, that are we a country of presidents or a country of kings? And I think what Trump's lawyer effectively argues that we are a country of kings. That the president can act as he wants, as he chooses, whether it be violence. You know, we had violence on January 6th, but he's saying the president can take it a lot further. The president himself can direct that violence openly, using official government resources and that's fine. I think what it does, it establishes how dangerous this presidential immunity argument truly is. And to your point, Elie, you know, we could -- had the -- kind of, the original argument that spoke about the so-called outer perimeter, which is saying, hey, I was just doing my job and to protect me and to protect institution, I should be given some coverage. The same way presidents get civil immunity. What they've done is say, let's go further. That the president, even when he effectively is not upholding and basically executing the laws, in that scenario, he's still covered. When he's breaking the law, he's still covered. That no one gets to sit in judgment over a president, and I think that danger was seen by the court today.",

I mean, Judge Henderson who is the senior judge out of these three, the Republican -- who was appointed by Republican presidents, said at one point, I think it's paradoxical to say that his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed allows him to violate criminal law.But what Judge Pan also noted is that that is not the understanding that that senators have, because when Trump was actually impeached and then it went to the Senate, a lot of them, including Senator Mitch McConnell, said this is something for the courts to take care of. This is something that he -- should be handled in a criminal prosecution or that could be handled in that way.",

      "sentences": "Yes, that's a great point. There's obviously two very different talking points. The problem with the argument that Trump's lawyers just staked out there has to be an impeachment and a conviction before there could be a prosecution is it leads to absurd results that cannot be the way this works. We all know impeachment is entirely different. A judgment about whether to impeach could be political. It could be based on any number of factors. That is just a different ballgame altogether than a decision whether to prosecute and eventually convict somebody.And the thing I keep coming back to is, they had an easier way. Trump's team had an easier way. They briefed a better way. They just made the traditional argument of what he's charged with doing here was within the scope, within the outer perimeter of his job as president. And if they stuck to that, I still think they probably would have had a losing argument, but they wouldn't have had a preposterous argument, and I think they would have had a stronger case to make.",

What that would suggest, as long as I can hide my behavior, long enough to be in office and avoid impeachment, I can get away with anything I want. All I have to do is not have transparency or eyes into what I'm doing because the only way to have an impeachment is if one, I know about your behavior, right?If the House is going to bring the impeachment articles. If then we'll actually have the actual moment to conduct an actual trial. So, all I got to do, if I'm the president of the United States is just bide my time. That's part of that argument. But there was a moment here, too, when the council -- I mean, the special counsel from DOJ, spoke about this issue. But I want to go back for a second to the lawyer for Trump, because in this sound bite here, he talks about the idea that the notion for criminal immunity not existing is a shocking holding. They are standing tall and saying, look, there has got to be some level of immunity because they're talking about President Biden and other people. Listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Both sides have this slippery slope argument that they're putting forward. But I think -- you know, an important argument from the Jack Smith side, speaking about history here, there's a whole lot of talk of what's happened in the past and the example of President Nixon, right? President Nixon engaged in his conduct, and what did he do? He accepted a pardon, right? He talked about -- we have special -- we have the Iran contract investigation, right? We have -- and Ronald Reagan, no one there thought that he could not be prosecuted. So, I think the slippery slope argument. I think there's something there on both sides. But importantly, that is the nature of all prosecutions. We've both been prosecutors. For a system to work effectively, you have to have prosecutors that are acting with a sense of justice, that are using discretion appropriately. And that is true in every scenario for everyday Americans and for former presidents. So, that faith in our system, we have to have that for our system to make sense no matter who the defendant is. So, I don't think it's an especially strong argument to say someone could abuse this. We have courts that will review indictments. We have standards of -- burdens of proof of reasonable doubt, you have to do a trial. So, we have other fail safes that's not just -- you know, a rogue prosecutor can go after a former president without any recourse. So, I do think Jack Smith's side had the better of the argument there when it comes to the slippery slopes. COATES:  There was this huge moment -- and I mean, maybe some people might have lost it because when I hear the words ministerial or discretionary, I was probably like, just say what everyone's thinking, official or unofficial acts. Whether a president can do it or they can't do it. That's important because the crux of this matter is going to come down to whether his actions around January 6th leading up to it were officially presidential actions. They were talking about it in the form of ministerial versus discretionary. And they talked about this thing called the Take Care Clause, which essentially says the president has the duty to ensure that the laws of this nation are executed and enforced. But this idea, Elie, of whether what he's doing is official or rogue in some way, plays very big in this case and could end up back before Judge Chutkan.",

And that's what it looked like the argument was going to be is, was Donald Trump's conduct around January 6th within the scope of his job or outside the scope of his job. Now, I think the argument that it's outside is laid out in the indictment. This is not what presidents do.Donald Trump's team actually puts on a pretty spirited case in their brief saying, well, what was he doing? He was speaking with members of Congress. He was speaking with election officials. He was using his powers under that take care clause, which is a very broad power of the president to make sure that laws are properly enforced. Therefore, he was within his job as president. And if this case goes up to the Supreme Court, I think they're going to be looking at that question.",
