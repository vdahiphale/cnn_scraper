And I'm campaigning to every single vote because I intend to be a president for all Americans, no matter their political party, where they live or where they get their news. On that point, last night, you may have seen that I went on Fox News. Meanwhile, Donald Trump joined a Univision town hall yesterday, where a voter asked him about January 6. Okay. Now, we hear know January 6 was its a tragic day, a tragic day for our country it was a day of terrible violence with attacks on law enforcement 140 law enforcement officers were injured that day. Law enforcement officers were killed that day and what did Donald Trump say last night about January 6. He called it, quote, a day of love. And we are all clear, the American people are exhausted with his gaslighting, exhausted, enough! Enough! We are ready to turn the page. Turn the page.",
