Dr. Jill Biden, of course, President Biden and prime minister of Japan, Fumiko Shida, and his wife, Yuko, the first time that we have seen a leader from Japan represented here at the White House in almost 10 years. So, a pivotal moment. A historic moment, I think, for these two nations, particularly with the discussions to come. MJ Lee is at The Whitehouse for us. MJ, two Nations united, I think, in their desire to keep the Indo-Pacific region as they would describe it free and open and recognizing, I think, that if there is a more material conflict, whether it's Japan, China, South China Sea, Taiwan, North Korea, they'll both certainly be involved.

That's after the state's Supreme Court revived a law dating back to 1864 banning the procedure, except in the case of saving the mother's life. The ruling could have far-reaching consequences for women's health and for election year politics in a battleground state. And beyond, Elie Honig joins me now. Elie, I think we have to start with the basics here. How did we get to a point where you've got a state upholding a law that dates back to 1864 before actually women had the right to vote in the state and actually before Arizona was considered a state in the first place? How did we get here?",

That was the Supreme Court ruling that had been in place for 50 years and protected a woman's right to an abortion across the United States. Now, two years ago, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed that in a case called Dobbs. And that essentially said, we're going to leave it up to each state individually to decide what its laws will be on abortion. And as a result, we've seen wide divergence. There's some states where women have full rights to abortions, and other states, including now Arizona, where it's been completely outlawed. And you're right, this is a bizarre scenario where this 160-plus year statute has suddenly been revived. And according to the Arizona Supreme Court, now that will be the law of the state for the time being.",

First of all, the state attorney general in Arizona has said that they will not enforce this particular law.And I will say that is within a prosecutor's purview. We have something in the United States called prosecutorial discretion. It happens not uncommonly that prosecutors say, I will not enforce the laws against, for example, marijuana in recent years, certain prosecutors have said. But as you said, the other issue though is you have county level district attorneys who may not agree with that and they're on their own. Now, there are a couple things legally that might happen to change this. First of all, the law is on hold for at least a couple weeks. Second of all, the Arizona state legislature can repeal, can undo this law. And there actually is some bipartisan support. There are some Republicans in Arizona who have expressed support for repealing it. And then the final option is Arizona can amend its own state constitution. Now, that's a complicated process. You would, again, need some sort of bipartisan support. They could theoretically appeal this to the U.S. Supreme Court. But as we said in the beginning, the U.S. Supreme Court has said it's up to you, states. So, the Supreme Court is not going to be an answer here.",
