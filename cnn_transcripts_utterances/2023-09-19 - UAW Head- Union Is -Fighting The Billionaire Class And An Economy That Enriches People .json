He was no friend of unions, but yet he is able to go out there and speak to working class voters in a way that we see resonates.And so that is the challenge that Democrats face. They often point to the media and say, you're not holding him accountable, but the voters are not holding him accountable. And so he also sees an opening with the transition to green vehicles and seeing the divisions among Democrats and the uncertainty with what that means for these types of union jobs and It's going to seize on that and speak to work workers who have frustrations about that.",

So the millionaires and billionaires, that is directed at the former president.But look, it's smart for him politically to go there. Who knows what the conditions will be? What if they reach a deal the day before he goes there or something? So, his going there is a bit of a theatrics here. But look, he's playing the long ball.

And in that meeting, he has said that the U.S. Attorney David Weiss had expressed during this meeting that he didn't have the ultimate decision making authority on whether to bring charges against Hunter Biden and that he had sought and was denied special counsel status. So the testimony from these three officials who were in the room are casting doubt on Shapley's memory because one of the officials, the FBI official said, with respect specifically to Weiss saying that he did not have decision making authority, he said, \"If he would have said that, I would have remembered it\". And the other two officials also testifying that they do not recall this. You know, so that bolsters some of Weiss statements because he has denied that that had taken place. Now, Shapley's attorneys are saying that he has handwritten notes from the meeting where he is confident in what he took down and that he memorialized those notes in an email to his boss soon after the meeting. So they are sticking by that position. Of course, you know, the -- it is not all casting doubt on it. The officials do say that they back up some of Shapley's claims, including that the U.S. attorney in Washington, D.C. and the U.S. attorney in Los Angeles did not want to partner with Weiss on this investigation. They do support some of his testimony, but of course, this isn't over. The committees have subpoenaed two DOJ officials for testimony and Attorney General Merrick Garland is on the Hill tomorrow.
