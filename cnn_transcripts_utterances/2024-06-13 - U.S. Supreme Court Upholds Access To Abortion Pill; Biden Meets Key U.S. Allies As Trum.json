Also, Democrats are now leveling a brand new claim against Justice Clarence Thomas. It's breaking right now. But let's start with what you need to know about the headline you've seen all day that the justices unanimously ruling that yes, as of now, women can still use the abortion pill mifepristone. That is far from the end on attempts to limit abortion and abortion medication, in this post-Roe era, of course. The justices' reasoning in this case is important. The court found that the doctors in the anti-abortion groups who had challenged access to mifepristone did not have this standing to sue. So this was not a decision on the merits of mifepristone and access to it. So that does leave the door open for other potential challenges to mifepristone in the future. Justice Kavanaugh wrote in the opinion for all nine justices: What we recognize that many citizens, including the plaintiff doctors here have sincere concerns about and objections to others using mifepristone and obtaining abortions. But citizens and doctors do not have standing to sue simply because others are allowed to engage in certain activities -- at least not without the plaintiffs demonstrating how they would be injured by the government's alleged under-regulation of others. In addition to that news breaking, right now, Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, a Democrat, is now claiming that Justice Clarence Thomas took several additional free trips on the private plane of GOP megadonor, Harlan Crow. Thomas traveled on Crow's private jets, Durbin says, during trips within the United States in 2017 and 2019 and 2021, as well as on a previously known 2019 trip to Indonesia, where Thomas and his wife Ginni, stayed on Crow's mega yacht. Senator Durbin says, Thomas did not disclose these additional trips on financial disclosure forms. Now this all comes after last week when we brought you the reporting that Justice Thomas is far and away the justice who has received the most gifts while serving on the court. The liberal organization Fix the Court told us that Thomas received 103 gifts worth more than $2.4 million. We're going to go deep on both of these stories today. But first, let's get straight to CNN's Paula Reid, who has been poring through this opinion about mifepristone all day. Paul, what does this opinion say exactly?",

And let me just bring you into the room as Justice Brett Kavanaugh began to read and the courtroom's packed, his wife, Ashley Kavanaugh, is there in special guest seats. He goes on for ten minutes explaining that there is a very important threshold question here before the justices could even assess where the FDA was right to find mifepristone safe and effective and to actually enhance access to it. That was key in terms of if they had reached the merits, there would be things about how easy would it be for women to obtain these drugs at, for example, 10 months of pregnancy. Pardon me, 10 weeks of pregnancy rather than seven weeks, and whether so they could get it by mail. But Justice Kavanaugh laid out exactly what the barrier is for people trying to bring cases and he went through the group of anti-abortion doctors who tried bring this, had said, for example, that they have conscience concerns that because of religious and moral reasons, they don't want to be backed into performing abortions, for example, under emergency situations, if the -- if mifepristone is improperly used. And he said there's no problem with that because there's already a conscience provision in federal law. So no physician is going to be forced to perform an abortion.

This is about additional safeguards that were removed in 2016.So you don't have to see a doctor beforehand. You don't have to have a follow-up visit to make sure there isn't excessive bleeding. You don't have to test for ectopic pregnancy with the doctor. All of those things do decrease the safety.
