A scenario that some leaders around the world are expressing concern over. Let's get live to London and bring in CNN's Max Foster. Max, good morning, always wonderful to see you.Trump is honestly on a glide path here to the Republican nomination with Ron DeSantis dropping out, you know, our polling shows it's more likely than not to push Trump over 50 percent here in New Hampshire. It's really hard to see how anyone else keeps going and face that. We'll see, obviously, anything can happen. But this has got to have world leaders -- I know you and I spent a lot of time talking about those even earlier this year, the kind of nervousness especially around his feelings for President Xi, his attitude toward Vladimir Putin, compared to his attitude toward NATO. I know a lot of these leaders were in Davos last week. How do you see this? I mean, what are -- what is the mood among European leaders around this right now? MAX FOSTER, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR &amp; CORRESPONDENT:  Well, I think amongst the leaders, there -- particularly amongst the allies, they're staying out of it, frankly. They are -- you know, Macron even suggested this recently, France, where he is -- you know, we will deal with whoever America votes for. Obviously, behind the scenes, there's nervousness, but still so much chaos around Donald Trump's previous presidency, and also because Nikki Haley is seen as a diplomatic force, she understands the world stage and how to -- you know, how it's done, really out there. Trump doesn't really do things out there -- done -- does he? But I also think -- you know, it's interesting. DeSantis, such a huge story pulling out, wasn't a big story here in Europe, and I think that's one of two things.  It's like they didn't necessarily know he was, because they're not that engaged in the campaign simply because they are assuming that Donald Trump will win at least the Republican nomination. So, there's not a huge amount of engagement here because the leaders aren't talking about it, because they don't want to, and the public aren't really talking about it because they haven't seen any big surprises yet, I think.",

Obviously, the one thing they do concern themselves with is what happens with Ukraine, particularly here in Europe, if America stops funding it, who is going to fund it because Europe can't afford to and what that means. And we're seeing fortifications along the NATO frontline with Russia for example in Estonia, they're digging bunkers. There is a real concern beyond Ukraine that the war could spread. We heard the Swedish Defense  Minister or Swedish Defense officials, rather, warning they're preparing for war.  We saw NATO officials saying they're preparing for war.

Temperatures generally in the upper 30s this afternoon, at least Tuesday afternoon across the south and right near the freezing mark the farther north you travel. But there is some serious weather to get to this morning, particularly across an ongoing ice storm throughout the nation's midsection. This is the mid-Mississippi River Valley, and you could see St. Louis, all the way to Oklahoma City and Little Rock, that is ice. We have ice storm warnings and Winter weather advisories. A quarter of an inch of ice, perhaps locally, even higher amounts where the warnings are located across southern Arkansas. You can see the sheet of mixed precipitation moving throughout the region. Drive with care between St. Louis and into Little Rock. It is going to be treacherous on the roadways. And then the warmer part of this storm bringing a considerable flash flood threat in and around the city of San Antonio, impacting 1.5 million people. There's already been 2 to 4 inches of rain that fell overnight, this is radar-estimated rainfall you can see right near the metropolitan of San Antonio as well. Another 1 to 2 inches according to the National Weather Service, hazardous life-threatening flash flooding ongoing with this storm system that's moving northward and going to overspread the precipitation into places like Chicago, Detroit, behind another weather system that will bring more rain with several days of flash flooding at least across the deep south. So, yes, we need the rain across this region, but too much is too soon, and that could be a problem anywhere you see that shade of yellow, that's where we have a moderate risk of flash flooding going forward through the middle of the week.
