Coming up this hour,for the first time in years the U.S. President is hosting a summit at Camp David, this one with the leaders of Japan and South Korea, in what is meant to be a show of force amid growing threats from North Korea and China. The U.S. commits to approving the transfer of F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine as soon as pilot training is complete. We'll discuss the impact that might have on the battlefield. Russia is blaming Ukraine for an attempted drone strike on Moscow. City's man says Russian air defenses shot down a drone overnight following a series of attacks on Russian territory. And finally hundreds of wildfires are burning across Canada. The newest area of concern is in the Northwest Territories where thousands of people are evacuating. Well, the U.S. is hailing a new era of cooperation between Washington, South Korea and Japan. President Joe Biden is greeting the leaders of South Korea and Japan this hour at Camp David. The first time he has hosted Foreign Leaders at the Presidential retreat. The two Asian countries are setting aside years of animosity in the face of growing concerns of China and North Korea. And against the backdrop of this summit there is the specter of North Korea and its nuclear program. Pyongyang reportedly has condemned the three way partnership as an Asian version of NATO. CNN's Will Ripley tells us it's expected to make a military show of force in protest. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): All eyes on the skies over North Korea. South Korea's spy agency telling lawmakers in Seoul, Pyongyang is planning a provocative show of force, including an intercontinental ballistic missile launch. The military is detecting signs of possible ICBM launch preparations, monitoring active movement of ICBM launch related vehicles in Pyongyang expecting drills including tactical nuclear capable missile launches in the coming days. The latest intelligence as North Korea faces growing international pressure. U.S. and South Korean military exercises begin next week. North Korea considers the annual drills a dress rehearsal for war. Those drills coming as President Joe Biden prepares to host the leaders of Japan and South Korea on Friday at Camp David, China and North Korea high on the agenda. At the U.N. Security Council, the first meeting and more than five years on North Korean human rights.",

Now, when you get into the details of that, what senior administration officials have outlined is that it will include annual military exercises. Discussing intelligence sharing agreements, as well as setting up a three way hotline and in making this trilateral summit an annual event. Now President Biden has sought to foster individual relationships with these two countries over the course of his presidency. But this is an opportunity for the three of them to be in a room and to talk about their shared interests, like you heard there from, Ivan, about those mounting security concerns. But what senior administration officials have noted that this is not, there's no expectation of a formal Alliance commitment or a collective defense agreement. This is a conversation about what their shared interests are and how they can work together moving forward?

So it really took courage, first by President Yoon, to really resolve the issue or work time labor issue, forced labor issue that has been a stumbling block and to really have this forward vision of moving forward with Japan. So first, it took courage by President Yoon, and then also from Prime Minister Kishida to accept that approach, and be pragmatic about it and to really improves relationship with South Korea. But also the Biden administration really deserves a credit because again, all the previous U.S. administrations and Presidents have tried to do this and was such a, it was very hard thing to accomplish.

This is the foundation laying you know, you have to lay the foundation so that this relationship, the trilateral relationship can be strengthened and expanded. So in this regard, that's why they are establishing our hotline, they are institutionalizing. So every year they will meet, they are going to it's going to be a multi-year commitment to exercises and so on. So no matter what happens domestically in South Korea, in Japan, and in the United States, that this relationship is will be strengthened.

And it's potentially just 13 days away. So it was remarkable how this timetable keeps shifting. Now the public discussion of it has got slightly more pointed. But let me just explain to you how this whole very, very complicated process is going to work essentially, to train Ukrainian pilots to fly and also service these jets. That's something that European allies of Ukraine will undertake. Now they need the Americans who essentially these F-16s technology belongs to sign off on that training because it involves simulators, all sorts of different things. Now, we could be looking at about six months training potentially, that's one of the documents suggesting out that timeline that could possibly be sped up. But then once that training is complete, the U.S. have said as they have for a while that they will supply the jet, this is always going to be them way more complex part of the arm supply from NATO to Ukraine, because of the huge strategic advantage it gives Ukraine because potentially how closer it might get to Russian Air Space with these jets. And because fundamentally F-16s are so complex, they're going to need an awful lot more hand holding from NATO to keep these jets running. And so yes, Ukraine yesterday said that we're not expecting to see the jets this year. That's probably just a realistic reflection of where we are right now. But you got to remember Lynda, you know, these timetables keep shifting. When NATO wants something to happen, it is able to speed it up.

And then release half metric ton guided bombs and slow roar into Ukrainian positions and the towns where they try and get some kind of shelter. As they begin to move forwards. They're doing enormous damage, particularly we saw ourselves around -- and the idea that Ukraine could put in the high tech American jets that could potentially counter that Russian threat. Or at least make it much more challenging for Russia and reduce Russia's sense of air superiority that will be a phenomenal change potentially, to their ability to prosecute. This counter offensive won't necessarily get rid of the risk of the missiles, or the indiscriminate, intense shelling that we've seen from the Russians. But it will certainly reduce some of the risks and to it will make Ukraine skies generally a bit safer. And that might deter some of the bombing runs we've seen against civilian areas by Russian jets too. So potentially a significant change, I think the issue now is it's going to be too late for an impact this summer, this fall.

Apparently, airports were kind of diverting flights from landing in Moscow, in the immediate aftermath of the strike, some of them had to go to sort of neighboring countries to land. Earlier today, there was an evacuation of the office buildings around there as well, with hundreds of people being sort of ordered out of their workspaces because there'd been a false alarm that another drone strike was coming in. And so yes, individually, it didn't cause much damage, it caused some disruption. But when you take them all together, there's been an almost daily kind of barrage of these kinds of small scale drone attacks over the course of the past several weeks, and they're all adding up to, you know, a sense of uncertainty on the streets of the Russian capital elsewhere, as well.

So far has been found in four countries, Denmark, Israel, the UK and the U.S. Health officials say there's been an uptick of COVID cases over the past few months as people travel and stay indoors to beat the heat. The new variant doesn't seem to be spreading widely, thankfully. But there are concerns about what this might mean for the upcoming cold, RSV and flu season. Well, I want to bring in our CNN Chief Medical Correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, always good to see you. DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: You too, you too.",

In fact, the World Health Organization calls this a variant under monitoring. Couple things to point out, you mentioned the four countries. But if you take a country like Denmark, for example, the three patients over there where they found this this new variant, they were in different parts of the country, they didn't seem to have a relationship to each other. So that gives you some idea that this may be more widespread than we're just seeing initially. It's also very different Lynda than the previous variants. So there are a lot of mutations here. And that's relevant because you can sort of count on some immunity from either having been previously infected or vaccinated. If a variant is very different, you may not have that same protection again, we don't know for sure. So the open questions are how contagious is this? How sick might it make people? And will your previous immunity provide you that protection? And so far at this point, we just can't say so it's being monitored.",

      "sentences": "Yes. And sort of, it's hard to ascertain those answers if fewer people are getting COVID tests compared to back at the height of thepandemic. But what does this all mean for the upcoming cold and flu season? DR. GUPTA: Well, the point that you're making, I think is a really important one. I mean that we don't have as much testing. So it's a little harder to get a sense of just where we are in the United States, for example. They're doing a lot of wastewater surveillance. So looking at wastewater, trying to get an idea of how much COVID is out there. If you look at the United States, as an example of a country, we see some places in the country, that's those are the places in red and orange, where the numbers have gone up in terms of hospital admissions, yellow, it's sort of flat, and in some a few states, it's actually gone down. But you can expect as we go into cooler and drier weather that these viruses will spread more. Let me just give you a little bit of context quickly, Lynda. If you look over the last two years, for example, in the United States, at all the various trends of COVID transmission and hospitalization, you find, for example, this August, which is the far right of the screen there. We're about a quarter of last August a year ago, that huge spike in the middle that was Omicron, the spike right before that was delta. So you know, right now the numbers are going up, but they're starting from a much lower level.",

      "sentences": "That is a positive sign. And Sanjay, we talk to you almost every day, during the pandemic. Can you just remind us what the latest guidanceis if you do get sick, especially if you get COVID-19? DR. GUPTA: You know, I think that one piece of guidance that has been true even before the pandemic is that if you are sick, you should stay home. We know that you can, you know, be contagious spread the virus to others. With COVID, in particular, it's the first five days after symptoms where people tend to be the most contagious, we can say that now. So as a general rule, after you test positive, it's basically five days of isolation. One caveat there, let's say you didn't test right away, you test it on day two or three, isolation period should begin when you are sick. So your days of isolation start from your first day of symptoms, not necessarily your first day of testing. You don't need to test to get out of isolation. But if you have two tests in a row that are negative, that means you don't need to mask, you're not really, you're not going to be contagious anymore, so you can sort of move on with your life. Of course again, Lynda, that all means that you're not sick. If you're sick, obviously you stay in isolation.",

So eight men for every woman who play so we have these special events, women's events, open to transgender women, who are an important part of the community but the events, the idea is to provide a safe space for women and to have some fun, meet some other women who play the game. They're really important to me. And I feel that people who play them often have a fantastic experience.
