      "sentences": "Well, good evening, everyone. I'm Laura Coates. Tonight, a really bad day in court for Donald Trump. Yes, he is the clear frontrunner in the race for the White House. He is neck and neck with Joe Biden, according to polling. But now, a New York judge says the candidate and his adult sons are also now liable for fraud, saying that they gave false financial statements for years, committing fraud over and over again by inflating the value of their assets.Now, newsflash, this is the man who could be running the country if the election, of course, goes his way, and on top of, as you know, four criminal indictments as well. And just when you thought the circus on the Hill could not get any wilder, well, you have Matt Gaetz again issuing this time new threats to McCarthy's speakership. Senators are working together to have a backup plan, of course, and McCarthy is saying that there is a plan, but they won't actually vote on it until Friday. Now, mind you, the government shutdown happens at 11.59 p.m. this Saturday if they're unable to avert it. And there is a heartbreaking story that's near and dear to my heart. A young Black girl ignored as all the white girls around her were given medals at a gymnastics competition in Ireland. And what if it were your daughter or mine who is now a gymnast? The video has gone viral and even Simone Biles says that it broke her heart. I want to begin now with major legal trouble for the former president tonight, this time in the New York attorney general's civil case against Donald Trump and his family business. A judge finding that Trump and his adult sons are liable for fraud, also canceling the business certification of the Trump Organization. Now, that move alone deals a major blow to the former president and, of course, his businesses. Joining me now to discuss is CNN legal analyst Norm Eisen and former Trump White House associate counsel May Mailman. Glad to have both of you, guys, here. I want to begin with you, Norm, on this because this is so significant. Um, this was a summary judgment motion. Taking a step back, tell us what that means and why it's significant.",

Politically, it's tough to say because we're dealing with Trump. So, you really never know. Also, summary judgment motions are appealable, and I expect that to be appealed. I think in Trump world, the thing that people are going to take away is that this judge was so Trump unfriendly, it was really hard for him to mask. I mean, the opinion he finds the lawyers for bringing legal arguments saying, I've already considered these legal arguments, yeah, you did, at a motion to dismiss stage, they are different under a different standard of review.

If there's anything that's objective in the world, Laura, it's like you got a ruler, okay? That is the definition of objective.And it's the same way with these crazy valuations that they were pushing. Seven Springs, the maximum valuation, usually 30 million, one year 56 million. They argued that it was legit to have a $292 million valuation. That is a 400% increase. So, these kinds of arguments -- the judge warned him. He told him he was going to come after him. I think they're lucky. The sanctions were light, a little over $7,000 per lawyer. In some of the other Trump cases, the sanctions against Trump's lawyers have been much greater.

Now, in New York which, of course, he has already walked away from, he lives in Florida now, he said he's not a resident of New York any longer, that's impacting how he may be able to present himself.

You know this well. You were a prosecutor here in D.C. If I shoot at somebody and I happened to miss, my fraud doesn't work, you still get prosecuted even though you missed. It's dangerous to lie and the judge makes that point. New York law doesn't care about the loss or the gain in the end. What they care about is people who do business in New York have to be truthful.

You've got -- you've got Wael Hana, the New Jersey-based Egyptian-American businessman who is meeting with the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, bringing together Egyptian intelligence officials, Egyptian military officers, Egyptian government officials, and getting deals done to unfreeze aid to Egypt that had been put on hold by the State Department and release weapons that was destined to be delivered that was also on hold. So, he is doing these things in the interest of the Egyptian government as is alleged in the indictment. He's innocent until proven guilty. But then one has to ask why. Is he just somebody who is doing this out of the goodness of his heart? Is it because he got a monopoly to be the clearer for halal beef being shipped to that country at a great profit? Or is there something more? The question that's on the table, Laura, is, is it possible that they could have actually been using the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee as an Egyptian asset in return for bribe money being funneled by a businessman without the Egyptian intelligence services who attended some of these meetings not knowing about it?

How can you compromise that person? Do they have a propensity towards corruption? Can you fulfill a need or exploit a weakness?And where you have a U.S. Senator who has received a lot of publicity for being charged in a corruption case, who was a hung jury, the rest of the charges were dropped, he surfaced in another investigation before that one, it does introduce the kind of vulnerabilities that could be attractive to a foreign intelligence service, especially if they have a way in. Consider this, Laura. Wael Hana, the New Jersey businessman, was friends for years with Nadine Arslanian before she suddenly started dating Senator Menendez, then became his wife. And during that period of years, 2018, 2019, all the way up through recent times, according to the indictment, she was the middle person, the broker, who put together the meetings between the businessmen and the Egyptian officials. So, that's a lot of coincidences. One other thing, there's a case involving a businessman, a vice president of a bank, name is Pierre Girgis, charged last year, an Egyptian-American who was allegedly trying to infiltrate U.S. law enforcement and recruit U.S. law enforcement, including NYPD officers, to get information on Egyptian dissidents on U.S. soil. He was charged with being an unregistered agent of the Egyptian government. And something very interesting buried in those court papers was an assertion that there are nine Egyptian operatives aimed at cultivating unwitting assets and recruiting them to carry out the interests of the Egyptian government. So, it's interesting that someone who was trying to recruit law enforcement to get confidential information is charged as an agent of the government and an individual who was allegedly funneling half a million dollars, gold, and convertible to a United States senator is being described in the case that so far is only bribery, and on the senator's part, bribery and extortion.

We'll talk about that next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [23:36:29] COATES: Now, imagine that you're a young girl, you've just competed in a gymnastics event, and you're standing in line with all the other gymnasts waiting for the medal that you've earned. But you're the only one who doesn't actually get that medal. And you're not sure why, as a little girl standing there, that you have been skipped over. That's exactly what happened to one young girl, and it was all caught on camera. There's newly resurfaced video now viewed over 50 million times from a meet that happened a year and a half ago. And it shows an official who's handing out medals, getting to the only Black girl standing in line. She pauses, appears to skip over her, and continues passing out medals to everyone else. Now, a parent complained about alleged racist behavior and a resolution was somehow reached. But now that the world has seen the video, Gymnastics Ireland has now been forced to comment, telling CNN, what happened on the day should not have happened, and for that, we are deeply sorry. Joining me now to discuss Fisk University Gymnastics coach Corrinne Tarver. She was the first Black gymnast to win an NCAA all-around title in 1989. Corrinne, a pleasure to see you, especially -- I have a little girl, she's nine years old, she's now on a gymnastics team, so watching through the lens of a parent now, I have a whole different view of the entire gymnastic community and the work that you guys do. But let me tell you, when I saw this, the mama bear came out through my computer screen on behalf of this young child. What was your reaction when this resurfaced video came out?",

And as a coach, I'll look at that and say, there's no way. I mean -- and I talked to other judges sometimes and, oh, well, her feet weren't pointed or her legs were so bent and things of that nature.

That's the message the Supreme Court is sending Alabama lawmakers today in yet another five to four decision rejecting now their second attempt at a congressional map that fails to add another majority black district.Now, in a June decision, SCOTUS ordered the state to provide more representation for Black residents. Alabama's population is more than a quarter Black, but only one of the state's seven congressional districts is currently majority Black. Now, the Supreme Court decision could have huge impacts for the state and Democrats' hope of retaking the House. Joining me now is Alabama's only Democratic congressmember, Representative Terri Sewell, who is the first Black woman to represent Alabama in Congress. Congresswoman Sewell, thank you so much for joining today. This is quite extraordinary because the Alabama Republicans who drew these maps have now been rebuffed by the Supreme Court twice in a span of months on this issue. Why did they not understand the first time? REP. TERRI SEWELL (D-AL): Well, first of all, Laura, thank you so much for allowing me to be on your show today. You know, when I went to law school, I don't know about you, but when I went to law school, when the Supreme Court said you won, you won. (LAUGHTER) So, defying the Supreme Court was not a great idea. But despite the efforts by state officials in my state to obstruct, to delay, to defy, the Supreme Court was unanimous in its decision to stop them from trying to reinstate those old maps. And I am just thrilled. I think the real winners here is the state of Alabama, all of the voters, because it's about fair representation. Twenty-seven percent of the Black voting age population in my state is African-American. There are seven seats. Only one seat allows us to choose a candidate of our choice and that's simply only 14% representation. So, this was really about diluting the strength of the Black vote in Alabama. And so, I'm just thrilled that today, we are celebrating that Alabama can't go backwards, we're going forward, and we're going forward with fair congressional maps.",

That would be fairness.But you also have razor-thin majorities in the House that could actually determine control of the next Congress if you add an additional seat. This is quite significant.",

And frankly, I can see lawsuits in Mississippi and South Carolina as well.All of these states -- all of these states only have one majority minority district, one representative in Congress as a Democrat, and yet these are six seats in Mississippi, you know, four or five seats in South Carolina. So, this is really not just about congressional maps. It also has consequences for our county commission and our state legislative maps. All of these maps, to the extent that maps are drawn by, you know, governments and not these legislatures, and they're not -- and they don't fairly draw Black voters in, that they pack Black voters and try to make sure that we are -- our full voting strength is not there, that those maps will be thrown out. And so, this is a real warning to state legislatures across this country that the Voting Rights Act is alive and well. You know, I'm really proud of the fact that last week, we reintroduced the John Robert Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act because we want the full protections of the Voting Rights Act. As we talked about earlier, Section 2 is just one part, but only Congress can get back a Section 4 by coming up with a modern-day framework for determining which states are discriminated against, you know, minority voters.",
