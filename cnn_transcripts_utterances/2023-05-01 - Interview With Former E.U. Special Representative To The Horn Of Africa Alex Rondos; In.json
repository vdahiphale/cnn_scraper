Earlier today, a ship carrying 100 Americans arrive in Jeddah, more than 500 people have been killed in the conflict, which is entering its third week, including at least two U.S. citizens. So, what can the International Community do? Many are looking to the United States and also to Saudi Arabia to help bring the two-warring general to the negotiating table.

And let me start anecdotally, because two days ago I was listening to the prime minister of Sudan -- the former prime minister,Abdalla Hamdok, who had to resign at the end of 2021. But he was asked publicly what lessons he drew. And he made this point that after the incredible scenes of a rising from a population, a peaceful rising, which resulted in a government in which he was asked as a civilian to take a lead, he said he had spent all his -- all that time trying to demonstrate that Sudan could do something unusual, which was that civilians and military could work together to arrive with an eventful democratic and civilian rule. And the lesson he's learned is that, unfortunately, that didn't work. So, we need to ask ourselves, whether from very early on, were we too much of a hurry to find a solution which we thought was pragmatic but actually tilted towards those who controlled all the money and the weapons? And that the civilians gradually got squeezed out? So, that is a lesson we got to learn. Which means the international system, which was backing this, needs to go back and rethink whether the processes, of which I was involved, but as I look back, we overcomplicated it. I think we may have needed to rise to the occasion by bringing together two or three of the most serious states and institutions at the highest levels in order to bring that level of political attention to bear. Don't forget, the last two or three years, the world has been otherwise engaged and distracted. That strategic distraction became an opportunity for real serious mischief, which is going to possibly have real strategic implications.

And one other thing, I beg everyone to understand, that this is the country through which the Nile flows. There's, what, you know, technically is called critical infrastructure. There are dams, there's electricity. This is a city without water and water supply, without electricity, and it is vitally dependent on all of that.

You probably know that Ambassador Tracy had a chance to see Evan at Lefortovo Prison on the 17th of April. She had a chance also to sit in his court hearing on the 18th of April. And sadly, she just -- we just found out that her request to see Evan on the 11th of May was denied by the Russians. But the bottom line is we continue to press the Russians, we continue to strategize on how best to progress, and a lot of this is going to play out overtime. In a perfect world, we are able to work on getting Evan home before a trial starts. As the Russians, however, indicated, they often hold someone until the end of a trial process and only even then begin negotiations to bring them home.

We essentially begin to negotiate in public, and that to my mind might decrease our chances of bringing Paul home. And as you can imagine, I would never want to do anything that would decrease those chances. I should say, there's a good chance Paul will probably end up seeing this interview. So, if you don't mind, I talk to Paul probably once every week or two when he calls from Russia. I'd like to say hi to him, if he gets a chance to see this in his Russian prison. But aside from that, we talk to the family, not even just weekly, we talk to them continuing throughout -- continually throughout the week.

I talked to the families quite often. Secretary Blinken talked to all the families. And we take his pleas very quite seriously. But just can't get into the details of that. But in terms of the -- I would say, the tensions between us and the United States or whether -- I'm sorry, us and the Iranians and whether it kind of affects the negotiations, I would assume there be an aspect of that in the negotiation we've had.

Iran's been frustrating because it has been taking so long. There's a saying that, we have in my office that the other side gets a vote. So, no matter how much of time, energy and creativity we put in to trying to bring someone home, at the end of the day, the other side holds the key to the jail cell, and it's our job to try to find a way to get them to turn that key.",

And I'd like to read you something that someone with good knowledge of Siamak and others in the case has said to me, and I want to put it to you. This person is telling me, clearly, President Biden is not prioritizing bringing home the American hostages in Iran. The objective way to judge is to observe how he acts when the detained American is a famous WNBA player or a globally learned journalist at a top American newspaper in Russia. In these cases, he talks about the Americans personally. He makes calls to the families. He meets the families, and the White House and its staff has seen making moves and speaking about their efforts. It's clear to the world repeatedly that the president is personally committed to bringing them home. But in the case of the Iran hostage families, the president has literally ignored their desperate pleas for help and support. And the families are repeatedly blocked from accessing anyone in the United States government that has the power to reach a deal to bring them home. I know you've just said the secretary of state has spoken to them. But I also know, because I've asked many in your administration, that this message somehow is not getting to the president. Even though one of the hostage families delivered a letter to the president herself at the Norwuz ceremony and told us about it. What do you think is preventing the president from doing what he does for just about every other detained American from meeting as a comfort call these Iranian American families?",

So, there were 25 Americans that were brought home in the last -- over two years whose families never met with the president of the United States. And what that says is that the president's committed to actually getting a job done. The real metric, the real measure of success is whether someone comes home, steps on a tarmac on U.S. soil and falls into loving arms of their family. That's the metric they we're shooting for. So, whether the president speaks to a family or not it doesn't stop the machinery of trying to get the job actually done. I can tell you the president is committed. I know that for a fact. I know Secretary Blinken is. I certainly am. And I think in terms of what -- that your commenter said, we -- in the 27 Americans that we've brought back, they come from different financial backgrounds, different races, ethnicities, different parts of the United States. They're all very different in many ways, but they all share one thing in common, and that is the hold a blue passport. So, if an American holds a blue passport and they're wrongfully detained or held hostage by a hostage group, the United States of America is going to work overtime to come and bring them home. I can assure you that the president is committed and we're going to find ways to solve all these cases. But hear me, they're hard and sometimes they take a while.",

And so, part of that, I think, is that individuals are using previous top 10 list to determine what books they want to see challenged without understanding the context of it. And that helps us as library workers to be quite honest because we can see the trend, we can -- it also helps us to determine what organized efforts there are or when individuals are not challenging books in good faith and are not interested in having a conversation about whether it is right or wrong for our community library.",

However, we have recommended practices, such as when you receive a formal challenge, you don't remove the book off the shelf until a committee had has time to review it so that everybody still has access to that information, to that book. But what we're seeing also are a number of libraries and jurisdictions who are jumping over those policies and procedures and just removing the books straight out, whether it's because they are part of these organized attacks or they are using it for their own moral agenda.",

And I mean, I'm sure you've heard that 100 times. What's kind of your last response to that line of thinking? PELAYO-LOZADA:  Yes. So, it's really important for us to remember that parents absolutely have the right to parent their children. They have the right as a family to decide what they read together, to decide when their children are ready for certain topics. But they don't have that right to make that decision for other people's families. We know that our children develop so many skills through reading, whether it's empathy, whether it is, you know, scientific skills, skills that they need for school are also skills to understand how to deal with the complex issues that they are dealing with in their lives. And our children and our families go through so many different stages and experience at different times that we have to make sure that families have access to these materials when they need them and are not being restricted by others who disagree or want to dictate when they need those resources.",

It's not just the local library level or even a citywide level, it is a statewide level that they are trying to restrict access to information but also, trying to restrict access to individual rights and liberties. So, in Florida, we're seeing the Don't Say Gay bill and then, we're seeing a ton of LGBTQ books on the list for removal. Previously, it was critical race theory related books like \"The 1619 Project\" that were under attack in those spaces as well.

And so, I think that we have to remain steadfast and ask our individuals to unite against book bans with us because we cannot do this alone as library workers.

But I kind of wonder how you deal with the content or you just say, this isn't about continent all? PELAYO-LOZADA:  Yes. So, I think the same principle applies. You know, we do look at content when we are deciding what books to put into our libraries because we want to make sure that they represent our communities' values as well as the larger broader society that we are living in. And so, it's really important for us to also remember when we are looking at books who are considered classics, right, often \"To Kill a Mockingbird,\" also shows up on banned book lists. So does \"Of Mice and Men.\" And so, these are things that we are often taught in high schools and part of our curriculum. We have to remember to take these into the historical context that they were written in and find the value, just like when we look at our banned books list today and things are trying to be banned for being sexually explicit, it's often one or two passages that are within a larger text that to help us to understand the journey of a character or the journey of the history of an individual. And so, it's important for us to remember, again, that, you know, everyone has the right to decide what they want to read but they don't have the right to dictate or decide that for other individuals.

But I think that really understanding the context that our books were written in is essential to understanding how our society has changed over the years. And I think that one of the things also that we kind of get mired in is that books that we read as a child, we have to have our children also read, even though they may be outdated, and I don't think that that is a viewpoint that we need to hold anymore. I think that sometimes they are wonderful to share, but sometimes they were right for us in the moment. They were so many things that I read as a kid in the late '80s, early '90s that I probably -- I would not share with children today. And as a children's librarian, I need the choice to not share because they did what they needed to do for me, but our children have so many wonderful stories to be able to pick from today, why don't we choose some of the new things that are out there as well?",

And so, we have funds like the merit fund that individuals can donate to, to help them ensure that they are able to live their lives while they are experiencing this. And then, we also provide emotional support. These are really challenging times. As you've said earlier, you know, our library workers are experiencing mental health crisis and coming out of the trauma, also, of a pandemic where many library workers were on the front lines every single day and did not have the opportunity to work from the safety of home.

PELAYO-LOZADA:  Yes. We are frequently on the chopping block because I think that the value of libraries as being intrinsic to a successful community is often underappreciated. And so, what we're seeing now with book challenges in Llano, Texas, for instance, a judge ordered that books that had been removed from the collection be put back onto the shelf. And so, the city officials held an emergency meeting to try to defund the library, to try to close stores. They'd rather have no library than have a library that has books that represent everyone in the community. And so, the community came out. They protested. They showed up to that meeting. And the board decided to not close the library. And so, when we are able to articulate the value of our libraries, not just during book challenges, but during every day where we can demonstrate the impact that the life-changing transformative impacts that we make on individuals, it's really essential for those funding conversations when politicians and city officials have to make really difficult decisions.",
