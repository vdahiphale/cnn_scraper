Their trip home has now been delayed three times. This, of course, after a launch that was troubled by several issues, including a helium leak and a problem thruster. Well, just minutes ago, Starliner officials said they haven't yet figured out a permanent fix for those issues. So what does that mean? Joining us is former NASA astronaut, Garrett Reisman. He's also a professor of astronautical engineering at USC. Good to have you with us, Garrett. I know you've been listening into this briefing as well. What do you take from it in terms of what this means for a potential return date for these astronauts or a return to earth?",

And NASA does everything they can to make them as possible.They -- they're saying that Boeing, the Starliner is ready to bring Butch and Suni home right now, if they had to. But engineers always want more data and more certainty. So they're doing more testing on the ground. And until they finish all that testing, they'd rather not bring Butch and Suni home until that's done. They don't know exactly how long that's going to take so that's why they're not saying exactly when Butch and Suni are coming home, but hopefully not too much longer.",

And that's the -- that's the other key thing here is they don't have to leave. They - Butch and Suni are having a great time looking out of the windows. They're helping out the ISS program, doing more work up there. So there's no rush. And so, because of that, that's why we don't know exactly when they're coming home.

These are the unknowns that they're trying to resolve with that testing. So as an astronaut, and you know that you have a problem what your vehicle, that's not a great feeling. But you have confidence that the testing and all the work that the engineers on the ground are going to do are going to find a way to make this safe. And you have confidence in that team.

And do we need to change the design? Do we need to change the way we operate the vehicle? So those are the questions that NASA will be asking Boeing when this is over to make sure that -- they don't want to go through something like this again, obviously.

And it's important to note, and I think this is really critical, that we oftentimes see incumbent presidents in their first debate do poorly and then come back in the second and do very, very well, Ronald Reagan, Barack Obama.

This is a talking point we've heard from Republicans before. But I would imagine we will hear more of it at this point. She's raising the issue of she doesn't believe Joe Biden is fit for the job today, let alone for the next four years. And has questions about what is happening inside the White House and who's in charge? As a narrative, Larry, how tough is that, or not, for Democrats to push back on? LARRY SABATO, FOUNDER &amp; DIRECTOR, CENTER FOR POLITICS, UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA: You've got to remember, Erica, who believes that narrative. The Trump base believes the narrative. And none of them, no matter what happens, will be voting for Joe Biden. That was true before it. It's true after it. I don't think it changes anything at all. And by the way, there were people who asked, because of some of the things that Trump did and said during his one-term as president, was he really running things or was it his chief of staff or was it one of the other key people in the White House, you know, Ivanka and Jared?

They're not people who are lacking in self-assurance. And so I think we'll see President Biden continue on. But to your earlier point, it's very clear that Donald Trump was quite articulate in the lines that he was telling, in the untruths he was telling. His relationship with the truth is clearly a distant one. So I think we have a case here where the American people heard a president who was incapable of making his own argument, incapable of making his own points.

Last night didn't change that. And it's why so much is at stake in November.\" That's really echoing what we just heard, of course, from Biden at his rally in North Carolina. I wonder what you think about -- I go back to this. I was covering Obama in 2012 during that debate that he flopped against Romney, and there we're a lot of concerns on his side because Romney did appear -- you can picture him doing the job and it seemed that Obama wasn't prepared for it.

I listened to Donald Trump, who, by the way, in a vacuum, would not be called the winner of any debate. He wasn't impressive either. Even when you excluded the lies, which you really couldn't do since most of what he said was a lie? When you look at the presidency, what really matters? Don't you want people to look at a president and believe the president is at least telling you the truth? He may not be telling you articulately but he is telling you the truth. So there's a good argument to be made to people that they need to consider what really matters in life. And often, it -- it is character, much more. Look, nobody's ever thought George -- nobody ever thought that Joe Biden was Cicero. He's never been Cicero. He will never be Cicero, OK? That's a given.
