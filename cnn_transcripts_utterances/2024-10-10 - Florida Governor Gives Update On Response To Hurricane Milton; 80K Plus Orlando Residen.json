And as we monitor that, we want to go to Orlando, where more than 80,000 residents are without power as the damage from Hurricane Milton is becoming more clear.Democratic Congressman Maxwell Frost represents Orlando, and you see him joining me now. Congressman, thank you so much. I know you rode out the storm last night. You are out, you're in a car right now, surveying the damage. What are you and your team seeing? REP. MAXWELL FROST (D), FLORIDA: Well, thanks for having me on. A little earlier this morning, we were at the joint FEMA and state command post -- initial damage assessment. They're still out there assessing the damage far and wide across the state, but especially central Florida region. It looks like what we mainly have are widespread down trees, creating a lot of roof damage and a lot of homes. And I'm actually right now in a community called Tangelo Park where we have a lot of seniors, damage from big trees, a lot of debris and widespread power outages as well. Last night, we experienced some of the most intense wind gusts that Orlando and central Florida have ever experienced since Hurricane Charlie years ago. And that wind is powerful and can create damage. Objects and debris can be flying all around and creating damage to people's homes. And so we're out serving that right now. Thank God, for now, it looks like we don't have mass health issues or casualties in Orlando reported so far. It's still being looked into, but there was a lot of death due to the tornadoes that came with the storm all across the coast of Florida.",

But never just stays in there, especially when it has to do with hurricane preparedness and disaster response.You know, a lot of times the power goes out, communication goes out and we rely heavily on word of mouth within communities. And if there's someone in that community who says, something false about FEMA, something false about getting help from the federal government to take your home, something that money's already been accepted, send your information to this random link that got texted to me, that breathes (ph) like wildfire. And I've had several constituents come to me to ask about things. And we've had to dispel these myths for some people. There's been rumors left and right about FEMA. And the problem here, when politicians like Donald Trump use a natural disaster, a horrible disaster for political points, it can cost human lives. In this environment, every second matters to save lives and to save property and help save people and their livelihood. And we need people to understand that government, state government, local government, and the federal government weren't there to help you. (Technical difficulty) to be afraid to reach out for resources that they deserve, that their taxpayer money goes towards. And that's exactly what's happening now because of Donald Trump. And so how do we combat it? Being out in the field. I'm out speaking with people one on one, dispelling these myths. If they want proof, I got proof for them. I got -- I'm here to help them out, learn what FEMA is, see what the information is so they can understand.",

The Harris team has raised $1 billion, with the b, $1 billion since she entered the race just in July of this year. Now, even with all of that money, the race is stagnant. Begging the question, has the Harris joy ride reached a plateau?My panel is back. And let's just put some numbers with that. Laura, I'll start with you and also bounce off of what MJ was saying before the break. Michigan, Harris, 48 percent, Trump, 47 percent. Pennsylvania, same. Wisconsin, 49 percent, 46 percent. And we obviously show you those three states for a reason, the blue wall, which is the ballgame for her. LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Right, all within the margin of error. And Harris is trying to figure out exactly how she's going to build this coalition that they're attempting to build in those states. Which is, if she continues to lose in states like Michigan, with some of the young voters, some of the Arab Muslim voters, can she make up in that gap with the independence and the moderates that we were talking about earlier. Are there enough of them? It's the same math game that she's playing in a state like Arizona. If she's losing working class Latinos, because some of them are moving a little bit more towards Trump especially men, then can she make up for them with those Republicans, Independents who used to vote for John McCain and Mitt Romney and who now feel a bit homeless in the Republican Party.",

In its efforts, it seems to shield Harris from gotcha moments. It's robbing her of chances to have transcendent moments in which her appeal crosses over from those who strongly support her to those who remain wary.\" Now, of course, he wrote this before, five minutes ago when we announced that Harris is --",

What's happening? Is Pennsylvania over? Here's my hot take in, you know, early October of 2024. No state is over that's going to matter. OK, is Ohio done for Trump? Yes, right? We can be fairly confident on that. But none of these states have been decided and it's going to be incredibly close until the very end and it's going to be in the -- it's going to come down to tactics at the end, it's going to come down to strategies, it's going to come down to everything we're talking about at this table, it's like, what can the two sides do to gin up their base and to actually appeal to independence.",
