And also it's going to be harder even next year to do that, when the power is divided between Congress.So I do not expect to see action on that front. However, we can expect to see action on a number of other fronts over these next few weeks. Number one, Congress needs to tackle, two, different must pass items, that include funding the government by December 16. That's when the current funding patch expires. They're also need to pass a bipartisan defense policy bill. That's something that gets passed every year. So we are expecting that to happen. And then there's another number of other items on the wish list. Same sex marriage bill. They've already begun work on that. We are expecting them to finish it and pass it. They've also been working on election reforms to prevent another January 6, that's bipartisan. We could see action there, and they're also trying to figure out whether they can lift the debt ceiling. That's not something they need to do until next year, but there's concern over whether GOP House would be able to do it. So it's going to be a very, very busy few weeks over here on Capitol Hill, Victor.",

So Melanie just went through how realistic any of this action on an assault weapons ban really is. Is there any investment from the White House beyond a statement here, a speech there, a remark outside of a firehouse? LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, that's a really good question, Victor, because the President has long called for Congress to pass an assault weapons ban, essentially since he ran for the presidency, and he has repeated it after each mass shooting that has occurred while he's been president. But there's a big difference between calling for it and also, as he said recently, saying that he was going to try to count votes and make a push for it. So how much muscle the White House actually puts behind this in the lame duck is something that remains to be seen. Again, though, to Melanie's point, I -- the votes aren't really there, even though there are senators like Senator Joe Manchin, a centrist Democrat who has expressed --",

This is -- you saw there the President, the First Lady who were leaving Nantucket Bookworks, doing a little shopping on this Black Friday as they take a break from Washington there in Nantucket. So what to tell you, what you were looking at there.Let's turn now to this dinner at Mar-a-Lago. Former President Trump hosting Kanye West, or Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, Nick Fuentes, a holocaust denier, what is happening here? We know that the former president likes to surround himself with anybody who likes him. But to suggest that I have no idea who Fuentes is, he clearly knows what Ye has said over the last couple of months. What do you see happening here with this dinner? BARRON-LOPEZ: The former President has repeatedly said that he doesn't know people when he does know them, when there has been photographic evidence of him with people, with extremists. And Nick Fuentes is an extremist who's labeled a white supremacist by the Justice Department. And to me, Victor, look, what we're seeing is the President to continue to surround himself with yes people, to continue to surround himself with people who push antisemitism, push racism, and push white supremacy and white nationalist ideologies. That is not new for the former President. It's something that he did when he was in office and it's something that he has continued to do since he's been out of office. Now the question is whether or not the base supporters, Republican base supporters, continue to vote for him since he has announced that he is going to seek the presidency yet again. Even though voters did reject election denialism, extremism, you know, a lot of statewide races, there were still more than 100 election deniers that were elected to seats in the House, some seats in the Senate, and some gubernatorial seats. So the extremist element that the former President has tied himself to isn't going anywhere. And we could definitely see more of it, gain a stronger voice among the House Republican Conference as they take the majority next Congress.",
