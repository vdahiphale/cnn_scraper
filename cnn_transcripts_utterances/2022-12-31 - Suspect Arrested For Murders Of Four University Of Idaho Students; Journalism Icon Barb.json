Jim Acosta is off today.New information on the suspect in the murders of those four college students in Idaho stabbed to death in their beds last month. Twenty- eight-year-old Bryan Kohberger now faces four counts of first-degree murder after his arrest Friday in Pennsylvania on Friday. A law enforcement source says Kohberger drove across the country in a white Hyundai Elantra from Idaho and arrived in Pennsylvania at his parents' house right around Christmas while law enforcement was tracking him every step of the way. There are lots of new developments in the case, including how authorities identified and arrested the suspect. So let's get right to Jean Casarez. Jean, you just spoke with the suspect's attorney.

They are really in awe over everything that's going on. As you're aware, the FBI, local police, Idaho state troopers were at their house at approximately 3:00 a.m. yesterday knocking on the door and announcing themselves to enter, out of real shock and awe to them.

Let's do some of the steps along the way. First, you're on a long stretch of barren highway. You don't want a lot of cars around. An individual might say what are all these cars doing here. That's possibly an airplane surveillance.Let's say the suspect pulls off at 2:00 into a roadside place to go to the bathroom. You've got to ensure that he's not there alone. How do you get a vacant roadside rest stop surveilled? Let's say he goes into a shopping area where there are hundreds or thousands of people. How do you ensure that you have people around them so that, a, you can ensure their security, but, b, he doesn't make the people who are following him.

The reason is the public conversation right now is different from the conversation I would have been having with colleagues when I was back at the bureau. The public conversation obviously, as soon as the person is picked up is, what's their motivation. My first question would be, how confident are you that you can understand the motivation on someone who committed an act like this. You could jump to a conclusion and say he wanted, for example, I don't know, but he wanted to commit the perfect murder and he was researching stuff to get there.But the private conversation I said might be a little surprising and why I'm not that interested. A private conversation to me goes strictly to how confident are you that he did it. I don't care why. And how confident are you that you could prove that in a court of law beyond a reasonable doubt, which is why authorities are saying we still want more tips.

But if you take a knife like that, and we're talking about six weeks he's been gone, how do you go into a courtroom as a defense attorney and say there's no way you prove this without the knife. I think the more interesting questions and the harder questions, we have already seen hints of this, are going to be questions about ensuring that the prosecution can say, a, he's in the area. He was in the area. I think he was only living a few miles away. They're going to be able to prove that.There's going to be questions about the DNA in the house. Can you prove that was from that night? Can you prove he was never there for a party? Can you prove that he was actually there at the time in the house? I think that's the question that will come up. And it's not whether we think we can prove that. I'm pretty confident they got the right guy. It's whether, remember the O.J. trial, it's whether you can convince a jury that there is no doubt.

And Benedict's funeral will be held in Saint Peter's Square on Thursday. CNN's Delia Gallagher joins us now from Vatican City. Delia, talk to us about the former Pope's legacy and the reaction to his death. DELIA GALLAGHER, CNN VATICAN CORRESPONDENThis legacy, we should separate his legacy as Pope and his legacy overall, because, of course, he was cardinal and professor and theologian for many years before he was Pope, which I think is probably the more important legacy in his writings and in his discussions about faith and the importance of keeping faith in God in the world. But in terms of his legacy as Pope, one of the outstanding things, of course, was that he was Pope during -- when much of the sex abuse crisis came to light. He had to deal with that. He had to deal with it for a few years under John Paul II when he working under him at the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. And he was the one who set up the first sex abuse office to handle those cases here at the Vatican. He worked towards a zero-tolerance policy, and indeed as Pope, laicized 400 priests, 400 or so priests during his tenure as Pope. So he, by his own admission, said that he wasn't a very good manager. He didn't like those kinds of things. So I think his larger legacy, Paula, is this one of being a theologian of being an intellectual, all the hundreds of books and articles that he wrote to really shore up Christianity in the world. In terms of reaction, of course, we have had people coming down to the square, but it's not the same reaction that you would see, perhaps, with the death of a sitting Pope, of course. However, we have had a wonderful evening because we've had Pope Francis in the square to visit the nativity scene, and indeed before that in St. Peter's Basilica. And he gave his own reaction. Let's take a listen to some of what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) POPE FRANCIS (through translator): We are moved as we recall him as such a noble person, so kind. And we feel such gratitude in our hearts. Gratitude for God for giving him to the church and to the world, gratitude to him for all the good he accomplished, and above all for his witness of faith and prayer, especially in these last years of his life. Only God knows the value of his sacrifices for the good of the church. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And they're raising a lot of questions about his finances, like why did he pay little or no federal income tax in some years? Take a look. In 2016 and 2017, Trump paid only $750. In 2020, the final year of his presidency, he did not pay a dime in federal income tax. Trump offsetting his income by millions of dollars in losses, raising questions about the former president's business failures. The returns also show Trump maintained foreign bank accounts while serving in the White House, including in China.Joining me now, CNN contributor and Trump biography Michael D'Antonio. He's the author of the book \"The Truth about Trump.\" Michael, we know Trump famously fought hard to keep these returns from being made public. Now that they are out, what does he do? MICHAEL D'ANTONIO, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Well, it seems to me that he's got both an image problem and maybe a legal issue, although others can speak perhaps to the legal problems better than I might. Politically he has got two sub issues here. One is that it suggests, these returns suggest that he isn't the great businessman that he claims to be, and certainly all these losses would cause many of us to think so. On the other hand, he might argue that these are paper losses and they're not really a sign that he wasn't doing well or that he wasn't living well or that his personal wealth was suffering. That explanation actually leads to the other political issue that he has, that being that someone who lives so lavishly and who claims to be worth up to $10 billion or $11 billion in net worth should be paying some sort of tax for the system to be fair or were he to be a good citizen, because paying our taxes is part of participating in our society. Actually, you might say it funds the defense of democracy both internationally and at home. So he's got big political issues here.

Your take on that?D'ANTONIO: Well, I think he's got dozens and dozens of people around him who are smart when it comes to taxes. This is another case, just as with his claims to knowing more about the law than most lawyers, where he's just making stuff up. He doesn't exhibit intelligence himself when it comes to tax policy. He only knows enough to hire people who know all the tricks. So none of these methods are new. What's I think remarkable is that he uses every single one of them. And I've noted this before in other arenas of his life, and that is that he will grab, as aggressively $1,000 as he will $1 million. We have all heard of stories of people that he's decided not to pay, small contractors or people that he's interrupted transactions with just to make new demands. So, sure, he's hired a bunch of smart people. But if he were truly smart, he would have paid some taxes knowing that eventually all of this would come out.

This was in testimony from Trump's former press secretary Stephanie Grisham, quote, \"I heard from several people in the West Wing, more on the military aid or Secret Service side and then a couple just people, that he was sitting in the dining room, and he was just watching it all unfold. And a couple of his comments, some of his comments were that these people looked very trashy. But also looked at what fighter -- looked at -- looked like fighters.\" What is your impression of that?D'ANTONIO: Well, I think that day, January 6th, was in some way a culmination of all the dreams that Donald Trump has ever had. When he was a very young fellow, he went to a military academy where they did pretend soldiering. And I think that was something that instilled in him this idea of being a leader of a violent organization. Later he would say that the movie \"Patton\" about a general who abused his troops was one of his favorite movies and that Patton represented the kind of leader that he hoped to be. So now we have on January 6th him watching what is essentially a mob with both some revulsion because he's actually someone who looks down on ordinary Americans, but I think also some real pleasure because he's activated people to risk their lives and to risk almost, I guess, in one case take the life of someone in the melee.

Like, literally if I took three more steps, I would be in the Bosporus Strait.And the light that you see over there, that is Asia. That is the Asian part of Istanbul. The tower there you see is the Camlica Radio Tower. And then you can also see further on in the distance the Martyrs bridge, and that's where we expect the fireworks to get going tonight. And then if you look over this way, you can see the crowds have really started to pick up here right along the waterfront. And you will notice that there is still a lot of decorations up right now, Christmas decorations up. And this is one of the curious things that I found about being in Istanbul is that Christmas in this country is really synonymous not so much with the birth of Jesus but instead with New Year's Eve. People have little trees in their houses that they don't call Christmas trees always. They call them New Year's trees. And so people are doing all of the things that much of the Christian world would be doing on Christmas. Here in Turkey, they are doing it on New Year's. And one other thing to point out to you, and that is that the other popular thing to do in Turkey is to buy lottery tickets. And I have done exactly that. And so this is the chance to win 200 million lira, which I think by my rough translation is about $11 million. So if you any spare cash in Turkey these days, chances are you have gone out and bought a couple of these. It's a popular New Year's tradition here.",

A lot of deejay sets, a lot of lives taking place across the city until the early morning hours. And there is this tradition in Greece very often to usher in the new year with going for breakfast. So the idea is you stay up all night and then you book a very nice table at a very nice hotel or restaurant that serves breakfast, and you go there at 5:00 a.m. with your friends. And that's how you usher in the new year. This is something a lot of Greeks and visitors alike will be doing in Athens once again. The hotels are full. There are people from all over the world in Athens this year. It is a city that's becoming increasingly a year- round destination. It's not hard to see why.
