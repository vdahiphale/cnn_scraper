If you are just joining us, let me bring you up to date with our top story this hour.The U.S. Justice Department made an unprecedented move indicting former President Donald Trump on Thursday. His attorney says Trump is facing seven counts including an Espionage Act charge, conspiracy, obstruction and making false statements. Now it's all related to the former president's alleged mishandling of classified documents after he left the White House. FBI agents seized about 100 documents marked as classified when they searched his Florida estate last August. Trump was at his golf resort in Bedminster, New Jersey when he was informed of the indictment. CNN's Alayna Treene reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "Former President Donald Trump was indicted Thursday night in the special counsel's investigation into the alleged mishandling of classified documents. Sources familiar with the indictment tell CNN.And this is really a stunning development in the classified documents case. It's the first time that a current or former president has faced federal charges. Now, Trump has been charged, we're told, with seven counts in the indictment, and one of those counts is a conspiracy charge, a source tells CNN. The special counsel has been investigating Donald Trump's handling of classified documents ever since some of these classified documents were found in his possession at his Mar-a-Lago Resort in Florida. Now, the former president wrote on Truth Social, Thursday evening that he's expected to appear at a federal courthouse in Miami at Tuesday at 3 pm. We're also told that, you know, here at Bedminster, we're very nearby to where the president is, and he's huddling with some of his aides. He's feeling emboldened by this news. That is his first reaction to this. He's thinking that, you know, potentially this could have a political boost for his re-election campaign. But other advisers of his say that there are some concerns and reservations about how this could affect Donald Trump in the long term and affect his reelection campaign. Now, the special counsel, Jack Smith, was appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland seven months ago to look into this case once they learned that they were still classified documents in Donald Trump's possession, but also, once it was clear that Donald Trump was running for reelection again.

Was he just being arrogant when he left the White House and said screw the federal government, I'm going to play footsie games with these documents. Well, what's his motive for not returning this. I mean, the Justice Department day after day was saying these don't belong to you, please return them, and he wouldn't do it.So I think one of the mysteries as this unfolds in the coming weeks and months, is why Trump -- what did Trump do with these documents? Did he show them to anybody else? Was he using it as a bargaining chip in some way to help Trump's international holdings with countries? That's not -- we won't know. So Tuesday we're going to learn a lot more when the court unseals the documents and we see an ex-president in deep legal trouble.",

And there will, probably will be some of his supporters in Miami that, you know, are trying to own this. They're trying to own the story, get ahead of it if you're Donald Trump.We've had in American history a candidate running, Eugene Debs, Socialist Party leader who went to jail and was campaigning from prison. So things are possible. But also in Miami, Gen. Manuel Noriega, former leader of Panama was convicted and put in prison in Florida. So Trump is playing a lot of bravado with all of this. And I think what he's going to try to sell the public on, is I'm not just an ex- president, I am probably the frontrunner, and certainly frontrunner for the GOP, and Joe Biden the sitting president is trying to put me in jail. That's what Trump -- the narrative Trump's will spin. While truth of the matter is the law is the law. And an ex-president is just that, an ex. He's just an American citizen facing the justice system like anybody else. There is no big-time special privilege for Donald Trump except he will have a security apparatus, Secret Service and others surrounding him when he appears in the courtroom on Tuesday.",

Well, Nixon was wrong. Yet Gerald Ford replaced Nixon, pardoned Nixon. So we never had any sort of an indictment fever that we're seeing right now. That's what makes this so unique.We're not seeing -- we are hearing Republicans, some, running for president saying if you elect me, I will then pardon Donald Trump even if he gets busted. But I think the real story here is the clock. Donald Trump's lawyers are going to kick this story down the road as far as they can. The strategy of Trump is to win. And once he's president, these charges can be dropped. He'll find himself in free light and sunshine. And so, it's a game running against -- the November 2024 election.",

There are more to come when you look at what happened in Georgia. But this is a lot more significant than Stormy Daniels and hush money. This is Trump versus really the, you know, Justice Department. And it's quite serious. He may be in over his head here. We just don't know how much information against Trump has been accumulated. We won't know for at least until Tuesday just the full breadth of the charges here.And that's -- but it does seem like at this juncture nobody is understanding Trump's motive. That might work in Trump's favor. And look, we call him -- many people whether you love Trump or dislike him, they call him \"Teflon Don.\" He seems to have these multiple lives that he's able to survive. His whole life has been a dance between what is ethical and unethical, what's legal, what's illegal. And in his view, I'm leading the Republican Party and I'm on my way to getting reelected. So screw the Justice Department. And we'll have to see. It's very unsettling for the American people, but we've been living in the age of Trump for a while and this seems to be just another act. The question is when will his act run dry?",

And the government has cooperated in a spirit of candor and transparency with that inquiry. It's actually already handed over 55,000 documents to the inquiry. So, you know, there's no question that we believe that the right thing to do is cooperate and provide that information.There's a specific issue about text messages that are not to do with COVID and whether it's reasonable for those to be handed over. Things to do with people's private lives. And I think on that very specific point that is subject of a legal proceeding and I can't say much more than that. But people should know that we remain committed to the important work that the inquiry is doing. Because it's right that we learn the lessons from COVID. And that's why the government has handed, as I said, 55,000 documents already.

We've shed blood together. We've shed blood together. We've fought for peace together. Those bonds are incredibly strong. And the relationship between our countries is an abstract. It's rooted in our people.And I was talking earlier in the White House press conference about John Winthrop and his famous speech, if people remember, about building that city on a hill. He actually first used that phrase in my hometown in the U.K. where I'm from. Yes, and I think that speaks to those links between our people. But look, we can't dwell on history, is my view. We have an incredible history together, our two countries. But we've got to reimagine our relationship to make sure it's relevant for now. That it's dealing with the particular opportunities and challenges that we face today. And that's why the declaration that President Biden and I announced today, that closer partnership between our two countries is so important. It's the first type of agreement like that that either of us have reached. And it speaks to making sure that we are ready for the future. And that's what I'm excited about. And our values are enduring, the strength between our two countries is evident for everyone to see. It's delivered incredible benefits, I think, not just for our two countries but for the world.
