We'll talk all about that.As soon as Biden announced he was out, a tidal wave of money started coming in. And its back to the drawing board for Donald Trump's campaign. After crafting a campaign to take on Joe Biden, he's now focusing attacks on Kamala Harris, of course. I'm Sara Sidner with John Berman and Kate Bolduan. This is CNN NEWS CENTRAL. KATE BOLDUAN, CNN ANCHOR:  What a year this last week has been, and what a week this one now is setting up to be. With Biden out and Harris jumping in, the latest was today at this unprecedented moment in presidential politics as now independent senator from West Virginia, Joe Manchin, suggesting he's dipping his toe in the waters, maybe saying on CNN just this morning he's pursuing the process. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. JOE MANCHIN, (I-WV):  I have been very humbled by people calling and asked, would you consider, would you consider, would you talk about us. My main thing is that we have a voice. I want the middle to have a voice. And I think it would help Kamala to have a little bit of a process to where she could explain, articulate, and have a dialogue. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The country is just 100 days out, just over 100 days out from Election Day. Some voting begins in September, just to show you what the timeline looks like. A huge number of Democrats have now endorsed Kamala Harris. We're going to hear from her this morning at a previously scheduled event, but one that will now include her first public remarks since the entire political world shifted, and since she said in a letter that she intends to earn and win the nomination.

She had a conversation with her pastor where he prayed over her, because the next few weeks will be trying.I spoke to the head of the Congressional Black Caucus. And he told me though President Biden endorsed her, she is under no illusion that this is going to be a coronation. She very much understands that she is going to have to battle it out over the coming weeks. Now, I've been on the campaign trail with her speaking to voters. Many Democratic voters told me that they were excited about the prospect of Harris leading the top of the ticket. Other voters, though, although they are excited, they are still concerned about this last-minute shakeup and are concerned about her ability to win. Let's listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

For as long as those 24 days felt to many Democrats, yesterday was simply a time warp of how fast this came together. Really, you could just feel, just to talking to a variety of Democratic officials, elected officials, party leaders, this cloud lift from the party and a sense of optimism set in, and a sense of purpose.However, going forward here in the next couple of days, what we have our eye on, is Vice President Harris going to complete her consolidation of the party? We saw one endorsement after another yesterday, really hour by hour by hour. We know she spent time on the phone, as Eva was saying there, with 100 different lawmakers, party officials, et cetera. So we also saw state delegations, these Democratic delegations coming out in support of her. I'm told hold more will do that today. Several are meeting today. So this idea of an open convention has largely been closed. She has the support of President Biden, which of course is key, and the support of labor unions and different groups. So the biggest challenge for her next is deciding, and she'll of course be doing this on her terms behind closed doors, finding a running mate yesterday, she started out as Joe Bidens running mate. Today, she is looking for one of her own. And that of course is top of mind for her and her biggest decision that voters will judge her on.",

Shed definitely played the role of loyal vice president, but of course she was thinking about what was to come. And the names of the potential candidates, likely looking togovernors. Look at Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper. This is very interesting because she has an existing relationship with Roy Cooper. They both served as attorneys general together. Arizona Senator Mark Kelly as well, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear. That is slightly more difficult because if he would be a pick, the lieutenant governor of Kentucky is a Republican. So would she want to sort of upset that. Potential other governors as well, J.B. Pritzker from Illinois, perhaps Gretchen Whitmer from Michigan. That would certainly be historic in its own right. But really Shapiro and Cooper are people who many Democrats believe she has her eye on. But going forward, I think also John, is it anyone else going to sort of stick their head up? Joe Manchin did a little bit. He put it right back down. He's not running. So as Elaine (ph) Kamer (ph) told you in the last hour, unlikely that any Democrat well challenge her in Chicago, John.",
