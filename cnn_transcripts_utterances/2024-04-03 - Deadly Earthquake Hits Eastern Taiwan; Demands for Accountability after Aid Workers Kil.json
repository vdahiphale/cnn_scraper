And this is about 160 kilometers away from the epicenter. For example, our camera man, he had glasses falling and he was rushing to protect his children and thought his TV would fall over. Now the real damage and the loss of life is in this tourist region, in rugged mountains on the eastern coast, called Hualien. And it's around there that at least nine people have been killed and at least 934 people injured. There are several buildings there that have collapsed. The authorities say that the residents there have by and large, been rescued, there have been big rescues throughout the day because there are tunnel networks for the highway that runs along the rugged east coast. And there were scores of people who were trapped in different stretches of tunnels who have been successfully rescued. But the authorities say there're still around 140 people that need rescuing, some working in a mine, others that are hotel workers, others that are tourists. This is a big tourist destination that people flock to because of the rugged topography there. And that means that some of the fatalities have actually been people who were hiking and hit by falling rocks or, in one case, one individual killed driving on the highway by rocks falling down the mountain side and hitting them. So the epicenter, this town of Hualien, which has a population of about 100,000 people -- I just got off the phone with somebody there. They said the electricity is working right now, that people are actually walking around and doing their shopping. It's on the eve of the tomb sweeping holiday. That said, some parts of the town are roped off as the military and rescue workers are on the scene, working on collapsed buildings. So a big deal for this earthquake prone island. But as you can see here at night, even after a 7.4 magnitude earthquake, the capital at the very least is back up and running almost as normal.",

But so far they haven't been able to turn that majority into a decision. And that's exactly what we all now are waiting for. And it is urgent.",
