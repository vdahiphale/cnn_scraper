I'm Max Foster, live from London with our continuing coverage of the Israel Hamas war.It's now the 4th day of the temporary truce between Israel and Hamas, and Israel says discussions are underway after received a list of hostages expected to be released from Gaza in the hours ahead. On Sunday, 17 hostages were freed, including Israelis and foreign nationals, today set to be the final day of the agreement. But Hamas says it wants to extend the pause in the fighting beyond the four-day deal. A source tells CNN, Israel's war cabinet is also discussing that possibility -- or it was on Sunday night. As part of the existing deal an additional 39 Palestinian prisoners and detainees were released from Israeli jails on Sunday. All were males 18 years old and younger. Clare Sebastian, following all of this from London. So today is the last day of the truce. So, what do we expect to happen today?",

They're going to release more information when they when they have it. I think all eyes right now because it's the last day of this sort of proposed 4-day period, is will it get extended? We're hearing of course from Hamas that they would like it to be extended. Israel discussing it. The Prime Minister Netanyahu said in discussions with President Biden that he would welcome it if more hostages could come out.This is not a new breakthrough, right? This was baked into the deal from the start, the option to extend by an additional 24 hours if an additional 10 live Israeli hostages were released. So, we're waiting to see if that might happen. There's pressure from the outside. Qatar has made it clear -- the key mediator in all of this -- all along that they would like to see this extend not only into several more days, but into something more sustained, even a ceasefire. And even President Biden in the U.S. said on Sunday that he hopes that this won't be the end, he hopes that given that this has worked to an extent so far that they will move to get more hostages out. FOSTER: Hamas said Israel broke the agreement on Saturday. Today, Israel is saying Hamas broke the agreement. Just take us through some of the delicacies here.",

But there have been things that have gone wrong. There was a significant delay on Saturday. Hamas said that it was because Israel was not keeping up its end of the bargain, that not enough aid trucks were getting in specifically to northern Gaza. And then we later learned that there was an ongoing dispute because one of the hostages to be released on Saturday was a 13-year-old girl without her mother. Israel said that that showed that Hamas broke the agreement. And I -- CNN's Kaitlan Collins asked the IDF spokesman Colonel Conricus why he thought Hamas did that, take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And it feels that it hasn't done that yet. So Prime Minister Netanyahu was actually in Gaza, according to Israel on Sunday and said, you know, we're going to keep going with this until victory.

Maybe a day or two longer to do that to ensure that the Hamas forces are better equipped with new ammunition, new supplies, you know, the essentials that every soldier needs, food and water.

But what they would be doing is gathering intelligence, watching what the Hamas forces are doing in terms of how the Hamas redeploy their forces and where supplies are moving across the battlefield. They'd also potentially be doing what's known as electronic intelligence and signals intelligence -- or ELINT and SIGINT, as it's known -- to try and monitor any transmissions by Hamas. And yes, it's known that Hamas used that tunnel network to communicate, but there would be some radio emissions potentially.So, it's possible that the Israelis are gathering intelligence that way. The Israelis have spy satellites, so they'll be watching things from space. They'll be watching things from the air.

And when this ceasefire comes to an end, the Israelis will launch their campaign once again with that initial ferocity that they began with, and they would have fresh intelligence on what Hamas are doing and where they're positioned. So, I would expect the resumption of the conflict to be very intense indeed.You know, Hamas doesn't have a comparable intelligence gathering network. So, they would be at a disadvantage in terms of understanding and knowing the battle space compared to the Israelis. But you know, the Hamas group can hunker down inside, bombed out buildings, prepare booby traps, position snipers.
