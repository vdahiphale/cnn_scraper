So, he said that the most intense phase is over. But this means that the military can now focus on the northern border with Lebanon where we have seen an increase in cross-border attacks over the last few weeks between Hezbollah and the Israeli military.Now, Netanyahu, in this interview with Channel 14, did also say that this doesn't mean the end of the war in Gaza. What it does mean is that the current stage in Rafah, where we have seen the most intense fighting over the last months, has come to an end. Now, he also said something interesting that he supports and is ready to sign up to a partial deal with Hamas, saying that that would be a deal to release some of the hostages, saying that after a ceasefire the war, in his mind, would continue because he wants to continue to try and eliminate the group, the Hamas group, saying he hasn't given up on that idea. Now, on the face of it, it does appear to be at odds with this ceasefire hostage deal. The U.S. backed deal that the Biden administration has said Israel signed up to. And we have heard from some but the hostage families saying - they condemn it. It's simply not good enough. It has to be all of the hostages or none.",

They voted for Joe Biden by, get this, 21 points. That's a very wide margin. Look at how they lean today, though, who they say they'll vote for in 2024. They only leaned for Joe Biden by four points, which, of course makes sense, John, with what we've been seeing among non-white voters and younger voters generally. Groups that have traditionally leaned Democratic but have been trending in this election cycle to be more Republican.

So usually I think there's a little sleeper effect in the first debate for the incumbent president. If you remember, Obama had it when he debated against Mitt Romney. He came out very soft and almost they thought like he was a little sleepy. And then Mitt Romney took care of that debate and had a really good one.So, I think that's important that both Biden and Trump, who have not debated - this is the first time we'll have a debate between two debaters who haven't debated in four years. This is the first time this has happened in a long time. So, what we need is both of them to go over their old notes and try to get better because, unfortunately, every time I watch them in a new debate after four years, no matter if it's a primary or general election, they usually have a very poor first debate.",

But Trump had them in - I don't know if he had them in 2016, but I know he had them in 2020, and people in that debate prep talked about how it wasn't very useful, it didn't get a lot done, et cetera, because he didn't want to be criticized in the debate.So, that's just one of the things that he's used to.

But helium leaks and issues with the thrusters have delayed the space's return. Now NASA says the craft and its two person crew won't return to earth until at least July 2nd.

TERRY VIRTS (RET.), FORMER NASA ASTRONAUT: I wouldn't call it concerns. This is a test flight. And you're always going to have issues that happen during test flights. During my last flight on the Space Station, when I was commander, we had three different cargo ships blow up at different times. And when the Russian one blew up, we - we ended up getting stuck in space. So, I understand what this Boeing crew feels like getting stuck on the Space Station.

So, I don't think there's any immediate concern that they can't come back the earth, they just want to take time to understand what's happening. And also the Space Station is a busy place. They have two spacewalks coming up. There are other vehicles coming and going. You can't just do an undocking any day. Plus, they have to wait for the orbit to go over their landing site.
