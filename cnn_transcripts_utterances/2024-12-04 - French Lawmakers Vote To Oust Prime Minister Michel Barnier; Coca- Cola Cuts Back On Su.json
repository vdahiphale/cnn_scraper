The main events of the day that you and I will talk about over the next hour. A manhunt is underway for the gunman who shot and killed a top chief executive. The police believe the suspect was lying in wait. France's prime minister has lost a vote of no confidence and now France is in political chaos. And Coca-Cola once pledged to recycle the equivalent of every plastic bottle. Now, it is backtracking. Live from New York, Wednesday, December the 4th. I am Richard Quest, and I mean business. Good evening. Some breaking news that we've had during the course of the day. A manhunt is underway in New York after the chief executive of UnitedHealthcare was murdered outside a Midtown Manhattan hotel. The man who shot him, the murderer remains on the loose. The police are calling the killing of Brian Thompson a brazen targeted attack. CNN's Josh Campbell is with me. What happened and do we know why?",

First, we know that the suspect was essentially lying in wait for several minutes. He knew when the CEO apparently would be coming towards this area. This was a conference that the CEO was set to attend. I want to show you some video. This is graphic in nature. This shows the incident where you see the CEO coming into view there. Look behind that black suburban. You'll see the gunman step out. He raises his gun. It is up on target. He then begins to fire. Now, we are not going to show you the aftermath, but the CEO then goes down. Interestingly, and I can tell you this as someone who formerly worked in law enforcement, that what we see is someone who clearly knows how to use a weapon. At one point, that gun jams, then the shooter, then quickly does a resolution drill where he essentially clears the malfunction on the weapon, points it back at the CEO. He continues to fire. Sadly, we know that the CEO died from those gunshots. We also know that this shooter was able to flee and is still at large right now. NYPD continuing to look for this individual. Of course, in the city of New York, this is an area that is blanketed by surveillance footage and so this is someone who, you know, you could see in some of the images there that was dressed in a way that would obscure his face. To this point, we haven't heard any indication that they actually know who this individual was, which finally brings us, Richard, to the investigation into the motive. We don't yet know why this individual did this. Was this someone who was himself aggrieved? Was this someone who was tasked or hired by someone else? Authorities don't yet know. It is a mystery. But the first thing they're trying to do is get this person into custody.",

The protesters have been filling the streets of Seoul overnight. They've condemned his actions. They've called for his resignation and the main opposition party says it is formalizing treason charges against Yoon. CNN's Ivan Watson has been on the streets of Seoul and had been speaking to the protesters.

At South Korea's National Assembly, troops face- to-face with civilian protesters. A lawmaker challenging a soldier grabbing his gun and shaming him, yelling -- (UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE speaking in foreign language.) WATSON (voice over): \"Aren't you embarrassed?\" Hundreds of troops were deployed here in the predawn hours on Wednesday, some landing by chopper sent to enforce the shocking declaration of martial law made by President Yoon Suk Yeol late Tuesday night. But they weren't enough to stop 190 lawmakers, including 18 from Yoon's own party from voting unanimously to overturn the president's decree. It may have been the shortest period of martial law the world has ever seen. WATSON (on camera): President Yoon's martial law decree only lasted around six hours. He withdrew it before the sun even came up on Wednesday, and now, the opposition is calling for his impeachment. Opposition lawmakers are pushing for a vote to oust the president as early as Thursday while his chief-of-staff and Defense minister have both submitted their resignations. Yoon's aborted power play barely affected business in the Korean capital, and at the airport, international flights also faced no disruptions. But there is anger among some ordinary Koreans.

Thank you.Now, Coca-Cola is scaling back its goals when it comes to plastic and recycling. So if I look carefully, this bottle does say I'm 100 percent recycled bottle except the cap and label. The company now says it will take some time for that to become the norm. Its new goal is to use 30 percent to 45 percent of recycled material in packaging by 35. Coke said in a statement the decision was based on identified challenges. Now, Julia Chatterley spoke to James Quincey a few years ago back in Davos, then the plans were pretty ambitious. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAMES QUINCEY, CEO, COCA-COLA: By 2030, we want to collect one bottle or can back for every one we sell. It really can be done and we already have countries in our business system where the collection is over 90 percent, and we will very soon have the first country where all the packaging is made from 100 percent recycled plastic. It's doable. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

By my count, this is the fifth time that Coca-Cola has done something like this since the mid-1990s when it first started making big environmental pledges about recycled content and its packaging. And to be honest every time they make these promises there's a big splashy announcement. A couple of years go by, the economy gets into trouble or the company needs to boost its earnings and they quietly abandon it. So this is unfortunately the latest in a long and sorry pattern.",

You mentioned one which is in the U.K. Everything under half a liter is now supposedly produced by 100 percent recycled plastic even though that's a misnomer. We won't go into it.

I'll be charitable, and maybe reformulating their commitment? FRANKLIN-WALLIS: Well, I think that unfortunately this is the start of a pattern. We're starting to see other very large plastic producers doing the same thing, watering down their commitments, moving dates further back into 2030, 2035, 2050. So we are seeing that. I think if we go by the last Trump administration, you know, spent a lot of time watering down environmental protections at the EPA, I think that the new appointment, Zeldin at the EPA, is likely to do similar. And they've particularly mentioned that they want to supercharge the U.S. as an energy producer. That's code word for amping up oil and gas production, which means that the price of virgin plastic, the price of raw plastic, is going to fall through the floor. And that means it's going to be even cheaper for companies like Coca-Cola to make things new, whereas recycled plastic, because you've got to collect it, you've got to clean it, you've got to sort it and remake it is a bit more expensive. So for them it's about profit margins. Coca-Cola is already making a pretty healthy profit margin every year, and as they proudly say in their financial statements, they've increased their dividend every year for 61 years in a row or something crazy like that. So they don't need to do this but I think it's an opportunistic move by one of the world's largest plastic producers to unfortunately prioritize their profits over the rest of our well-being.",

Two previous attempts of returning her had to be abandoned. Her flight as you can see at the moment is making its way across the Atlantic. There you are.

She reports that Dali is, quote, \"calm and compliant\" throughout the course of the entire flight. Now to answer your question in terms of what we can expect afterwards, there's a team of federal agents here at JFK that are preparing to speak to her, to interview her. To be clear, she is not currently in custody. She's not detained. Those two security officials that are flanking her on the flight, they are simply there as a precaution given her history. When this past Saturday, during the first attempt to bring her back to the United States, where she holds a green card, she created a disturbance and that led to her being removed off the plane. Yesterday, Delta wanted no part of flying her given that experience so obviously some precautions were taken that security is there and now they want to make sure that doesn't happen again. So that explains how we got here in the first place. After this conversation happens between her and federal agents, it's expected that eventually they will decide whether or not any charges will be filed. There is a myriad of factors here that they're going to consider, exactly what possible alleged crimes may have been committed here. Even her state of mind at the time that she managed to duck or at least go around to either security checkpoints last Tuesday. All of that will be considered when they decide -- Richard.",

So there was no concern that she may have had any sort of weapons on her.
