He made the announcement this morning on TRUTH Social, writing that he will be -- quote -- \"doing a general news conference.\" The Trump campaign has been pressuring Vice President Kamala Harris to answer more questions from reporters. She's not held a press conference since elevating to the top of the Democratic ticket. We're also watching as Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, push ahead on their battleground blitz. They are set to speak in Detroit very soon. And CNN's Arlette Saenz is live on the trail in Detroit. Arlette, the Trump team has ramped up its attack on both Harris and Walz. Is there any indication she will be taking questions from reporters today?",

This is part of the campaign's push to reach out to working-class voters and specifically rank-and-file union members. The Harris campaign has earned the endorsement of the UAW leadership, as well as other leaders of major unions across the country, but there has been some concern about efforts by former President Donald Trump to also try to appeal himself to rank-and-file members. That is an area where Harris will have some work to do as she is heading into this November election. Now, while they are making this appeal to union members directly here today, the Harris campaign and specifically Governor Tim Walz are navigating some fresh rounds of attack from the Republicans, specifically Senator J.D. Vance. Vance has tried to accuse Walz of ducking serving in Iraq when he had retired -- then he had left the Army National Guard to run for Congress in 2005. It really highlights the latest effort by the Trump campaign to try to define a relatively unknown governor. Now, Walz had served in the Army National Guard for 24 years. He retired two months before his unit received those orders to deploy. And so we will see if there's any way that he might respond to this over the course of the coming days. But I will say that, even as the Republicans are leveling these fresh attacks against Walz over his military service, I took some time and spoke to some voters, union members here at this event. Three told me that they had heard nothing about these attacks on his military service, another woman telling me that she basically thinks it's nonsense. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHRIS MARDEGIAN, UAW LOCAL 900:  I think that's such a -- it doesn't even make sense to me. The man has been in the National Guard in service of this country for over 20 years or so. How can anybody be that stupid to say that because he didn't go to Iraq? (END VIDEO CLIP)",

[13:05:19] DEAN:  All right, Arlette Saenz with the latest reporting from Detroit, thank you so much. Let's go now to CNN's Kristen Holmes, who's live in West Palm Beach, Florida. Kristen, we're about to hear from the former president in about an hour. At this point, we haven't heard from him in a while. He's been pretty quiet lately in terms of speaking on camera.

We are in a room where we have access to the former president, so we are within shouting distance. But he has billed events as press conferences in the past, only to have them be him delivering remarks. And you mentioned the fact that we just have not seen him in public. The campaign will push back on that. They will say he has done a number of interviews. He has sat down for podcasts. He has sat down for streaming interviews. He has been on FOX News. But in terms of actual events, when you see the split screen, you can see Kamala Harris and now Tim Walz really crisscrossing these battleground states, while Donald Trump himself has been nowhere to be seen publicly. He has his first rally in about a week tomorrow in Montana, not clearly a swing state. But because we have not heard from him publicly, that is likely why he is called this press conference. We are told he's going to talk about a -- quote, unquote -- \"wide-ranging number of issues.\" We will see what that looks like, but I'm imagining your typical kind of rally speech with a lot of Donald Trump rants and riffs as he goes through at this event today. Again, we will be here to try to ask questions. Now, while I have been here in Palm Beach, I have been meeting with campaign officials, with senior advisers asking them what they think about how this race has shifted with Kamala Harris and now Tim Walz at the top of the ticket. They are projecting a level of optimism. They are acknowledging that she is still in a boost, that this is still a honeymoon period for Kamala Harris, but they point to the fact that she is inextricably linked to Biden's policies, particularly the policies that Donald Trump polls ahead of Biden on and now Harris, immigration, crime, inflation. And they say, once this honeymoon period is over, once this enthusiasm dies down, that those issues will be on the table again. But talking to those same advisers, they do acknowledge that this has lasted a little bit longer than they would have liked. But a lot has happened since we have last seen Donald Trump out there in public. We have a lot of questions for him.",

He is the mayor of Dearborn, Michigan, which is home to a large Arab American and Muslim community. Mayor, thank you so much for being with us. In the primaries, of course, an overwhelming number of Dearborn's voters chose uncommitted. It was 57 percent that voted uncommitted, rather than vote for Joe Biden. First, I want to get your reaction to the vice president's response to those hecklers last night. ABDULLAH HAMMOUD (D), MAYOR OF DEARBORN, MICHIGAN:  Yes, I would have advised the vice president differently. I think what you have is people who are hurting, people who feel dehumanized. And I think, in that moment, there could have been an opportunity to recognize the disenfranchisement that many voters not only in Michigan, but across this country, feel as it pertains to the genocide that's unfolding in Gaza. And what I'm hopeful for, though, is the opportunity to have constructive dialogue. We have seen Vice President Harris have some tough rhetoric following her private meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

And an offensive arms embargo is one of those assurances that we believe has to be enacted in order for us to get to a just Palestinian state. The reality is, we can no longer go back to the status quo. It no longer exists. We have to find a pathway forward in order to ensure that the Palestinians have the right to self-determination.

And so we have to do something differently. And we believe the only way to do so is to lead with international law or ask in force for Vice President Harris, a prosecutor, to uphold international law. This has now been litigated by the ICJ. We have seen the U.K. suspend arms sales.

He won because 80,000 people in the state of Michigan skipped the top of the ballot and they refused to vote for any presidential candidate.

The policing for this, sporting events, is something that they very much have a handle on. And I think, frankly, to admit publicly that they are concerned that this may change the need for precautions here would suggest they're not doing everything they can every day. But I think certainly this will make people double-check everything that they have been thinking of, but there's no public sign at this stage that London authorities are changing their tack because of what we have seen in Vienna, a shocking incident indeed, particularly given the age of those involved -- Brianna.",

ISIS is trying to get a bunch of people to move from their countries to Syria or the Syrian area to do what -- to fight a war. Now they're exporting. And we're seeing that throughout Europe.

And then the other is going to be -- and that -- and we don't know what triggered them knowing. They knew -- what we do know now is that they knew one of the suspects. That's the same suspect who was what we call the insider threat. He had a job with one of the planning groups that was helping with these concerts. That's a little -- that's very close, right? He's in the room. He probably has credentials, so he's able to have access. So this was a good arrest, in the sense that this was a real threat. The other is, of course, defensive, which is, how are you going to prepare for these mega-events? Taylor Swift has concerts in areas. We know what happens at these concerts. You get supporters and fans surrounding them. So public safety officials are going to have to look at these soft targets. In other words, outside the security zone -- this is starting to sound familiar for those who followed the Trump assassination attempt -- outside of the security zone begins your soft spots. And, unfortunately, for so many Taylor Swift fans, those areas may be more regulated. They may be harder to access just to protect them, because it appears that these ISIS supporters were not trying to get inside the stadium, but wanted to do a lot of harm in the sort of soft areas outside of the security zone.",
