He's asking the justices to overturn the Colorado Supreme Court ruling kicking him off the state's primary ballot. He was also removed from the primary ballot in Maine, although that one is pending. And in the last 24 hours, voters in two more states, Illinois and Massachusetts filed similar cases claiming Trump should be disqualified under the 14th Amendment's insurrection clause.CNN's Zachary Cohen is with us now from D.C. There is a very tight timing on this. The clock is ticking. Colorado expected to certify their primary ballot today. Do we think the justices are going to jump on this fast?",

But that remains to be seen if they will or if they'll continue to deliberate over this matter, because it is a complicated one and the stakes really couldn't be higher. But there's been calls for urgency from both sides. Trump's team saying they want the Supreme Court to take this up and do so quickly, as have the challengers trying to remove him from the ballot in Colorado and Maine and other states.And, look, Trump's lawyer has been out publicly trying to project confidence about the Supreme Court -- their chances with the Supreme Court if the court does take up this case. Listen to what Alina Habba, one of Trump's lawyers, said yes when asked about Trump's chances in this case. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And as you mentioned, too, in the meantime, two more states are facing calls to remove Trump from the ballot. They're going to have to weigh that at the state level because until the Supreme Court does weigh in, this is a live issue across the country and we could see even more challenges pop up in the meantime if the Supreme Court does not come out today or in the near future and say they're taking this case up.",

      "sentences": "All right, with us now is Democratic Congressman Jamie Raskin of Maryland. He is the ranking member on the House Oversight Committee, which just release a report on foreign money going to Trump businesses while Trump was president.We'll get to that in just a second, Congressman. But first, since you were a constitutional law professor, let me ask you about this case that the Supreme Court might take up. What specific question do you want the court to address in terms of states and the ability to invoke the 14th Amendment to keep Trump off the ballot, and do you trust these nine justices to do so? REP. JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD): Well, the text of the Constitution is unambiguous. It's -- it's just perfectly clear. If you swore an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution and you violate that oath by engaging in insurrection or rebellion, you are never allowed to hold federal or state office again. And the purposes behind it are clear, which is to prevent people who have proven themselves from be untrustworthy in office from getting back into a position where they could also threaten the constitutional order again. So, I guess my major question is, given the comprehensiveness and the airtight logic of the Colorado decision, why would there be any reason to depart from the clear text of the Constitution and from the original purposes? And I would pose that specifically to the so-called textualists and originalists on the court. BERMAN: Congressman, as I said, the Democrats on the Oversight Committee released a report yesterday which documented how Trump businesses took in more than $7 million from entities connected to foreign countries while he was president. You issued that report. Like I said, there was documentation to prove it. What is Congress now going to do with that? What are the Republicans who run the committee doing with this new information?",

      "speaker": "RASKIN",
      "sentences": "Yes, it's 150-page report with 750 footnotes. And as far as I know, nobody has questioned a single fact that's in there. It's based on a seven-year investigation that began with my late beloved colleague, Elijah Cummings, who originally blew the whistle about this when Donald Trump entered office and said he would not divest himself from more than 500 businesses and would not establish a rule that he wouldn't take money from foreign governments. And so the White House was open for business and we've been able now to document with the receipts $7.8 million that came in from 20 countries, the leading country being communist China, and after that the royal crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman and a bunch of other unsavory regimes that are a part of it.That -- the report just scratches the surface. It's a two-year period. And it's just four of Trump's businesses out of more than 500. And it's just 20 countries out of 195 in the world. So, a lot of people have expressed surprise that he took only $7.8 million, but we're trying to show people that it was just a snapshot because the Republicans on the Oversight Committee have done everything in their power to sandbag our investigation and to shut it down. When Chairman Comer came in at the beginning of last year, he told Trump's lawyers to tell Mazars, the accounting company, basically to stop complying with the court order. So, given all of this, what's going to happen now? Well, you know, if Donald Trump had any shame he would return the $7.8 million to the U.S. Treasury. That's money he's not allowed to accept without coming to Congress first. And we would get together on a bipartisan basis, as we've been urging the Republicans to do, to establish very strict rules about how public officials, like Trump, who are taking money from foreign governments, have to immediately report it to Congress and then give Congress the opportunity to say whether or not they can keep it. That's what the Constitution says. I cite in the report Abraham Lincoln, who got two elephant tusks he liked very much from the king of Siam, and he brought them, in 1862, to Congress and he said, can I keep these, and Congress said, no, you can't keep them, turn them over to the Department of Interior, and he promptly did that. Compare that to Donald Trump, who's been pocketing millions of dollars from foreign governments, and then says it's OK because he didn't take his presidential salary. That's all he's allowed to take. The reason why the Constitution fixes the president's salary is so that he will be loyal and faithful only to the American people, not to Saudi monarchs and Chinese government bureaucrats.",

And they put in, I think, a half a million dollars, which kind of gives the game away. They know they're taking millions of dollars in unlawful, unconstitutional foreign government payments, but he says, trust us, we'll do our own accounting. We're not going to show it to you, but we'll give some money back.The Constitution doesn't say that you can't keep profits from foreign governments. The Constitution says you can't keep any payments at all without going to Congress to have it accepted. And we're talking about an unbroken line of presidents accepting that and always coming to Congress to say, we received some trinkets, we received a statue, we received a painting, whatever it is, and then it's up to Congress to decide what to do with it. Only Donald Trump has arrogated to himself the decision of whether or not he can keep the money and then he will deign to give us back what he calls the profits. It's an outrage. It's absurd.",
