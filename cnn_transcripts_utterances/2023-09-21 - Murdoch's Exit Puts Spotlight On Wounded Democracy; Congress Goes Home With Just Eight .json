And then the major studios could turn their attention to the actors union, which is also still on strike tonight. Even an agreement with just the Writers Guild though could mean the return of some talk shows. We've seen that in the news this week, not just daytime, but also late night. We'll see how that goes.

Instead of desired or even required, the republic has, of course, always faced threats to it, even before Rupert Murdoch.  But so much of the current state of our democracy can be traced back to the beast of his creation.Good evening, everyone. I'm Abby Phillip, and Rupert Murdoch is stepping down as CEO of Fox News tonight. His legacy is outrage porn, partisan red meat, stoking relentless culture wars. But it all started with what you could argue is a noble vision to create a center-right news network, to elevate more perspectives that aren't based in Gotham or in Washington, but instead, stoking division seemed to become Murdoch's mission, so did power and so did the money. Fox became a mouthpiece for Republican administrations, a mouthpiece really for Donald Trump, and eventually a vehicle for his baseless conspiracies. Before we discuss this tonight, it's important to really illustrate just a small taste of this mission 25 years in the making. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

They are features, not a bug. And one of their tricks of the trade is repetition, daily, even hourly. If you say the talking point consistently enough, Americans become addicted to the outrage. In fact, in the case of January 6th, people blindly believed those talking points. They acted on them. And many of those defendants have testified in court before being sent to prison that that was the case. Now, I asked in a recent deposition whether the rationale for allowing those lies to spread on his platform was, quote, not red or blue, but green, Murdoch replied, correct. Now, in recent years, it's been reported that Murdoch has been furious with Trump. And it makes sense. His network repeated these lies and it hit the kingmaker in his pocketbook. But Murdoch sowed that fabric and he rewarded the loudest voices in the room. He accelerated this idea that if someone called out a lie and called it a lie, you're a liberal stooge, you're a hack, not to be trusted, you are woke, whatever that means. And there is no doubt that it's working for his bottom line, at least. But the question is tonight at what cost? At what cost to America? And at what cost to all of us?

That is why we are in the situation we're in right now, because the mayor has misinterpreted that right to shelter law and insisted that these individuals had to be housed. Do you know what happened in my district? They took away an assisted living from our senior citizens.

These individuals have actually committed crime in our city, and that's a problem in itself.But the problem really is that it is unsustainable, and that's why I say the mayor opened these cans of worms. He should have not done this, and he should have allowed groups, outside groups, to sue him if he wanted, and then go to court. But what I'll say is this. The reality is that federal solution is necessary. That's why we passed a border security bill to stem the flow. I am open to working on issues of increasing visas so we can track who's coming in and out of our country. People can come, as my parents did to this country, and have opportunity and pursue a better life. But we need to know who is coming in and out of this country. In a post-9-11 world, of all places, New York should be concerned that there are 1.6 million individuals that have come in the country. We don't know who they are, where they are, or what their intentions are, in addition to the six million that have been encountered at the border and have made their way, you know, throughout the country, including New York. So, I would say to my colleagues, Senator Schumer, work with us. We have a solution that we passed to secure the border. You may want to see some other aspects, work authorization work. You know, let's come together. But the Senate has to pass something in order for us to do that and reconcile our differences. I think -- I think, this is the right opportunity for Republicans and Democrats to come together.
