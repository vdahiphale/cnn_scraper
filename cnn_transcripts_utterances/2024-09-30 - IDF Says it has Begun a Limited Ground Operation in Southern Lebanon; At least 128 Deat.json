Now, the Israeli military is taking pains to try and describe this as a limited ground operation. In a statement, they said that this is limited localized, and targeted ground raids based on precise intelligence to go after Hezbollah targets. But make no mistake, Anderson, what we are seeing tonight is Israeli troops in a very official capacity for the first time since the 2006 war with Lebanon, sending ground troops into Lebanon and going after Hezbollah targets. And that is of course, a very significant escalation following several weeks of escalatory actions by the Israeli military, a slew of very heavy airstrikes in Southern Eastern Lebanon, as well as in the Lebanese capital of Beirut. And of course, the killing of Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah. But Israeli officials who I've spoken to, Anderson, say that they see this as the moment to go after Hezbollah at a time when they are in disarray, when they have been significantly weakened by those airstrikes. And so tonight, Anderson all around us, we are hearing that ground operation in action. We have been hearing the helicopters overhead. We have been hearing outgoing artillery fire from very near our position, just a couple of miles away from the Israeli border. And then over the hill, in Lebanon, we have been and seeing some of those explosions happening, plumes of smoke, flares as Israeli ground forces under cover of night advance into Lebanon.",

That's thousands of troops being moved to the northern border.As we were driving here today, we saw about a hundred tanks and armored personnel carriers parade along a highway headed for Northern Israel. And of course, there are forces that we are not seeing in this area as well. We don't know exactly how large the forces that is actually going into Lebanon right now. Israeli officials who I've spoken to declined to get into exactly how many forces there are, but they are trying to emphasize that this is limited. They say that it is targeted to take out immediate threats along the border, including the threat of Hezbollah carrying out some kind of incursion into Northern Israel. One senior Israeli official also telling me that they do not intend to carry out any kind of long-term occupation of Southern Lebanon, but they're also not saying, Anderson, exactly how long those Israeli troops are going to be remaining inside Lebanon, how long this operation will last or how deep into Lebanon they intend to operate.",

But make no mistake, this is the first time that the Israeli military is confirming that Israeli troops have now crossed into Lebanon since the 2006 war. And this does indeed take this war between Israel and Hezbollah to a very new level. We are still hearing the whir of helicopters in the distance, even as that artillery has kind of started to quiet down for the moment at least. Earlier today, we were seeing across this hill in southern Lebanon. We were seeing some of those explosions happening as Israeli troops moved in. Flares overhead to give them light as they moved in overhead. One of the major questions now, how long is this operation actually going to last? And on that point, Israeli officials aren't giving me any firm answers. What they are saying though is that they do not intend to occupy southern Lebanon, no long-term occupation, as Israeli officials seek to emphasize that this is a limited operation, which is also what we are told they conveyed to the White House so the U.S. administration in recent days. A. COOPER: Have there been any alerts from Israeli authorities to Israeli citizens just in terms of restricting movement or seeking shelter?",

People are told to remain relatively close to shelters, but there haven't been the kind of massive preparations being made or restrictions on civilian life that you might expect in a moment like this.And that actually really speaks as I'm just hearing once again, some more artillery overhead, Anderson. That speaks to the fact that Israel is carrying out this ground operation at a moment when Hezbollah has been significantly weakened by these airstrikes over the course of the last couple of weeks, those pager attacks, and of course, that airstrike that took out Hezbollah's longtime leader, Hassan Nasrallah. This is a moment where Hezbollah's organization is in disarray, but also where Israeli officials believe that their operational capabilities have been significantly dismantled to the point where Hezbollah has not been able to carry out the kind of overwhelming response that you might expect. Hundreds of rockets fired simultaneously. Thousands of rockets a day intended to overwhelm Israel's air defenses. It seems like Hezbollah, at least for this moment, doesn't seem capable of carrying out that kind of response. Anderson? A. COOPER: Jeremy Diamond, thank you very much.

So there is a concern that this operation could expand beyond limited raids to an incursion, perhaps to an invasion, which has happened in the past. So the concern is that this is perhaps just the first opening round of what could become something much larger. Anderson? A. COOPER: Is it clear how badly damaged Hezbollah is? I mean, obviously, their, you know, their leader has been assassinated. Many others in the leadership and also the rank and file have been wounded or killed.",

Because Nasrallah was not only a charismatic figure but he was a feared leader. There were -- feared by Israelis and respected by Israelis.The fact that he was taken out and the fact that the entire leadership of Hezbollah has been decapitated. And your reporter, Mr. Diamond, you know, I thought I was very struck by his report that so far you have not seen this barrage of Hezbollah rockets that you'd expect right now on the border suggests that their command and control a structure has been severely damaged. Now, can it be resurrected quickly? I don't know. I don't think I'd be -- I'd like to be that the new head of Hezbollah is stepping into that job right now, given the fact that Israel's clearly penetrated the whole organization and it almost pick off these leaders one at a time. So we just got to watch for this to play out. But it's really -- it's going to be a game changer. Iran is now on its back foot in a way it hasn't been, Anderson, since the start of this war. A.

New preliminary crime statistics released by the FBI today back up a more comprehensive report which was released last week, and that stated violent crime declined last year, including a dramatic drop in the number of murders. Perspective now from Matt Mowers, a former Trump administration official, Ashley Allison, former National Coalition's director for the 2020 Biden-Harris campaign, and David Axelrod, former senior adviser to President Obama.

So my point is, she needs to speak directly to those folks. I mean, Trump is like a fire.What do you do with a fire when you're trying to put it out? You suffocate it. You give it no more oxygen. Ignore it. At this point, I think she should be hyper focused on telling her own story, answering the question I open up by saying that the question she's not yet answered is why, why Kamala Harris? Why at this moment is she the right leader? That's what people I think want to hear from her. And so I just suggest she takes bigger risk and telling that story. Do more town halls, more intimate settings that they launch a first ever for the Democratic Party, an influencer strategy campaign that will go directly to where voters are. That she bypasses national media, sorry, Anderson, and go right into local media and do more specially media. If all politics is local, she needs to get immersed and intimate with voters. So that's really my perspective on it. I think she's done a spectacular job. I mean, there's no doubt her ascent has been remarkable to say the least. But I think at this stage now, I want to see a second gear and I think she needs to go bigger and take greater risk and really tell people why and ignore Donald Trump. A.

I think when we were all talking a few days ago new CNN poll had come out, showed undecided voters at something like 2 percent of the electorate. I mean, we are looking at an ever- decreasing number of people who haven't made up their mind at this point.Most folks have a team jersey on, and it's all about just getting as many of those folks to the polls as they can. And so, you know, what Donald Trump's going to do over the next 35 or so days is go out there, largely try to gin up enthusiasm from his base, make sure -- and in part because if you look at polling, he's actually doing better with registered voters than even some of the likely voter samples, which is actually the inverse of traditionally what happens with Republican candidates. Usually a Democrat candidate needs higher turnout in order to win. Donald Trump's support actually comes from a lot of voters who are less engaged in the political process. Folks who don't prioritize politics every single day. A lot of them are actually young men. And so, he's doing everything he can to kind of cut through that filter, energize them and get them to show up. And I think as far as, you know, the stuff he says that a lot of folks obviously find offensive, so much of that is baked in the cake form at this point. Eight or nine years really now at this point of campaigning and essentially being unapologetic for who he is. And I think for those who that offends, they've made their decision on him long ago. A. COOPER: To that point, I mean, I guess, David, the idea of, you know, police roughing up people or being ultraviolent for one hour or a day or whatever in a sort of purge style event, it obviously, you know, offends a lot of people, but for people, I mean, there are plenty of people applauding in that crowd.",

So he's gambling.I agree very much with actually what both Matt and Ashley said. I think that he's looking at these disengaged voters and he knows he has to get him out. He doesn't have a great as great a field organization as he should, I think, and I think this is his means of getting them out. But I agree with Ashley that a more engaged media strategy on the part of the vice president to give people a sense of her own motivation, not just why they should be for her, but why she is doing what she's doing.
