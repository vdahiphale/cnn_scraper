(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [10:28:36] WALLACE: For all the attention pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses are getting, polls show the war may not sway young voters in November. This week, we saw more protests broken up by police, students opposing the war in Gaza, and Biden administration policies toward Israel. But polls show the conflict in Gaza barely registers among young voters. According to a Harvard youth survey in March, only two percent of those age 18 to 29 said it was their top issue. The immigration and the economy ranked much higher. Still, President Biden appears to be hemorrhaging support in this age group. Back in 2020, Biden beat Trump among young voters 60 percent to 36. Now a recent NBC News poll shows a dead heat, Trump leading Biden 43 percent of 42. So Lulu, how much is the war in Gaza actually hurting Biden among young voters?

And the takeaway is this -- this is something that was not spontaneous or organic. This is something that started being planned way back in November. And the scary thing is that there are many mainstream progressive funders behind training these young people in hand-to-hand fighting tactics and a variety of other just very bizarre and, frankly, frightening measures.",

It's unusual. They've taken it back. They were trying to show how everything fits in this skinny little iPad, which it is a very skinny. It was a rare misstep by them. They'd been known for their terrific ads, and they had put out a number of great ads. But this one, I kind of like it because it's a trend on TikTok to crush things. But in this case, it looks like they're crushing creators, a big tech company. And so rare misstep by Apple.",
