California Democrat Adam Gray currently leads Republican incumbent John Duarte by a couple hundred votes in the last remaining House seat to be called after a month of vote counting. Gray's expected win leaves Speaker Mike Johnson with a thin majority that is squeezed further by Donald Trump's selection of several House Republicans to join his administration. That balance of power will give a single member of the GOP conference a whole lot of sway over Johnson's agenda in the time before those seats are filled. Do you remember how that went last time?

And you have some customers that say, you know what, fine, stick me in the overhead bin, I don't need a bag, I don't need legroom. Give me a fare that's $30. And so the idea of these - they're calling them junk fees, but the airlines always push back and say, this is really about making sure that that person that doesn't care about legroom, doesn't want to bring on a bag, if they want a super cheap fare, they can get it. But then you, as the consumer, who wants a normal flying experience, it does look worse for you in the cart.
