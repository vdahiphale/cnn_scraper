Michael Cohen's cross-examination, Donald Trump's lawyer and his former fixer clash over a key phone call in the hush money trial. Market moment. The Dow briefly tops 40,000 for the first time ever.

But first, the Russian president is in Northeastern China as he begins his second day of a state visit. On Thursday, Vladimir Putin met with the Chinese leader, the two vowing to deepen their relationship, issuing a joint statement saying, \"Russian Chinese relations stand the test of rapid changes in the world, demonstrating strength and stability, and are experiencing the best period in history.\" This is President Putin's first foreign trip since he secured a fifth term in office. Ivan Watson joins us live in Hong Kong with the latest. So, China certainly rolling out the red carpet for the Russian leader in what is his first overseas trip since securing another term in office.

And they stood side by side and they decried what they described as a Cold War mentality, a unilateral hegemony. What they're calling for is what they say would be a more just multipolar world. And that's something that they repeated over and over again as they insisted that what they're enjoying right now between Russia and China is kind of the best period ever in their bilateral relations.

Cohen, who is the prosecution's key witness, testified earlier this week that on October 24, 2016 he made a phone call to Trump's bodyguard, Keith Schiller. He said he used Schiller as a conduit to speak with Trump, to say the Daniels' deal was resolved and he was moving forward. But an intense exchange inside the courtroom that could undermine his testimony, Blanche showed records that moments before the brief one-minute and 30-second call, Cohen sent a text to Schiller for help with prank calls he was receiving from a 14-year-old. There was no mention of Daniels in the text. Blanche showed the text messages. Cohen said, who can I speak to regarding harassing calls to my cell and office? The dope forgot to block his number. Schiller responded, call me. Cohen told the defense attorney today he didn't remember the harassing phone calls, but after confronted with them, maintained he spoke to Schiller and also Trump. Blanche, pacing the courtroom, his arms flailing, and his voice rising, said to Cohen, that was a lie. You did not talk to President Trump on that night. You talked to Keith Schiller about what we just went through. Admit it. Cohen calmly replied, no, sir. I don't know that it's accurate. Blanche moved to show the jury text between Cohen and the teen. Cohen, writing, this number has just been sent to Secret Service for your ongoing and continuous harassing calls over the past three days. If you are a minor, I suggest you notify your parent or guardian. The prankster replied, I didn't do it. I'm 14. Please don't. Cohen responded, please have your parent or guardian contact me before Secret Service reaches out to them. Before getting to the phone call, Blanche spent the morning trying to paint Cohen as a vengeful liar. Cohen confirmed he has insulted Trump countless times, including on his \"Mea Culpa\" podcast.

And in May of 1965, Muhammad Ali knocked out Sonny Liston with one punch in the first minute. This was not a knockout blow. Was it a left jab to the jaw? Of course. But here's what it -- here's what they got out. In a minute and 36 seconds, he may have talked about a 14-year-old alleged who was harassing him, but it's perfectly possible in that one-minute 36-call that he could also have talked to Trump. But here's where Mr. Todd Blanche stepped in a certain piece of evidence, if you will. He brought out from Michael Cohen that in 2017, Michael Cohen under oath lied to Congress. But what did Michael Cohen lie about? He lied about Donald Trump's seeking a Moscow hotel project, the extent of it, and when it was occurring. He was lying for Trump. But here's where Mr. Blanche made a mistake. Michael Cohen was able to say that when he made that statement, he cleared it with Trump's lawyer. So, you are now hearing possible subordination of perjury on behalf of either Donald Trump and or his lawyer. So, Mr. Blanche scored a jab with the 1024 phone call. But then later on, he lost 10 steps by bringing out that Donald Trump or his lawyer suborned perjury. So, my punchline is this, at the end of the day, Michael Cohen is still a witness flawed, but he has presented a narrative that is consistent with the other documents and the testimony of other witnesses.",

But when you look at the strong earnings that we have for many big companies, that does imply that consumers are still spending. Yes, retail sales for last month were a little bit softer than expected, but the American consumer continues to power along even though they are not happy about inflation. So, I'd be careful to say that what's happening with consumer dissatisfaction that's showing up in the polls is a sign that the economy is weakening because you're not really seeing too many people predicting a recession.
