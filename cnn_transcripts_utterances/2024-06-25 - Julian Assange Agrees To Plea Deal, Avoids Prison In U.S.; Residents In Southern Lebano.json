To others, he was a hacker with an agenda who endanger the lives of U.S. servicemen. But now Julian Assange, founder of WikiLeaks will soon be a free man. Nearly filed court documents reveal Assange will not face extradition back to the U.S. under a deal reached with the U.S. Justice Department. Assange was seen leaving in a black van from London to Belmarsh Prison, his home for the past five years.From there, he boarded a flight and left the U.K. Assange is scheduled to appear at a U.S. court in the northern Marina Islands on Wednesday. And as part of his deal with U.S. prosecutors, he'll plead guilty to one felony count for his role in publishing hundreds of thousands of leaked U.S. military documents and diplomatic cables in 2010, revealing sensitive data on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. After the hearing, Assange is then expected to return to the country of his birth, Australia. His mother says she's grateful her son's ordeal is finally coming to an end. She went on to say, many have used my son's situation to push their own agendas, so I'm grateful to those unseen, hardworking people who put Julian's welfare first. CNN's senior international correspondent Ivan Watson following developments live for us from Hong Kong. So just play this out. So he's got this deal, which came as kind of a surprise. He will land shortly -- he appears shortly rather in what 9:00 a.m. on a Wednesday on the Northern Mariana Islands. So what happens between now and then, and what happens once he gets there?",

And the letter goes on to say that both parties that Assange and the prosecutors are requesting for the plea, the guilty plea and the sentencing to be conducted in a single day, in light of the defendant's opposition to traveling to the continental U.S. So that is what Assange has been fighting against for years, extradition to the U.S. and it is presumed that he would then after this be allowed to return to Australia. The prosecutors, we understand, are requesting more than five years jail sentence for Assange. He just happens to have completed more than five years at a Belmarsh Prison in London. So presumably he would get credit for that time incarcerated and he would become a free man and that is exactly what WikiLeaks is now saying they're trumpeting Julian Assange is free, as his wife, Stella Assange, who issued this statement on camera.

We've had other statements from world leaders celebrating his release the Colombian President, the Mexican president, the former President of Ecuador. Recall that Ecuador provided asylum to Assange for some six years in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, and then it rescinded that asylum status. And that's when he was dragged from the embassy and taken to prison in London. The Committee to Protect Journalists has also welcomed this they say, quote, the U.S.'s pursuit of Assange has set a harmful legal precedent. On the other side of the argument are those that say that accused him of dumping classified documents that endangered U.S. Armed Forces personnel and endangered sources as well. There were -- there was no kind of -- these were huge document dumps and names were released in these dumps. So that sources to the U.S. government to the U.S. military, were released and could put them in harm's way. And that's been at the heart of this disagreement that has gone on now for more than a decade, a disagreement that appears to be nearing its end. John?",

And after a vetting process of candidates, there are six who remain in the race, and there are a couple of who could be considered frontrunners in all of this. On the conservative side, there are two. One of them is called Mohammad Ghalibaf. He is the current speaker of Iran's parliament and the other one is a gentleman named Saeed Jalili. Now people in the West might remember him as having once been Iran's chief nuclear negotiator. On the moderate side, there is a candidate who many believe could have possible chances as what people would call a dark horse in this race. His name is Masoud Pezeshkian. He is the former health minister of Iran and also a heart surgeon by training. Several things that the Iranians are going to be looking for, one of them is of course, turnout at presidential elections -- always a big factor here in this country. The main issues are going to be of course, the economy, which is once again suffering under those massive sanctions imposed by the U.S. and its allies.
