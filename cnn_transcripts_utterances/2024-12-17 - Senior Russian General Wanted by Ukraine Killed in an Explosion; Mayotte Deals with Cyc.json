Many thanks for that live report.Well hundreds, if not thousands, are feared dead in the French territory of Mayotte off the coast of Mozambique after the worst cyclone to hit the region in at least 90 years. French President Emmanuel Macron says he will visit the island in the coming days where the damage is so widespread, some are comparing it to the aftermath of a nuclear war. CNN's Larry Madowo has more now on the destruction and the long road to recovery. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LARRY MADOWO, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Catastrophic. That's how residents of Mayotte are describing the damage from Cyclone Chido, the worst to hit the French archipelago in nearly a century. The Category 4 storm killed at least 14 people as it tore through the Indian Ocean over the weekend. But government officials fear hundreds or even thousands could be dead, according to the Associated Press. Torrential rain and winds of more than 220 kilometers per hour wiped out entire neighborhoods, knocked out electrical grids and the water supply, leaving Mayotte almost entirely offline for over 36 hours, according to the website NetBlocks. JOHN BALLOZ, MAYOTTE RESIDENT (through translator): It smashed right into us here. And to be honest, it was complicated. It was a complete disaster. Lots of houses and even towns are wiped out. CAMILLE COZON ABDOURAZAK, MAYOTTE RESIDENT (through translator): It really is a war landscape. Around me, I don't recognize anything anymore. MADOWO (voice-over): Mayotte's prefect says the most devastating damage was to the island's shacks, where roughly 100,000 undocumented migrants live in a population of just over 300,000. That is making search and rescue efforts even more difficult and nearly impossible to account for all the victims. French relief efforts are underway, and the country's interior minister was briefed on the hurricane's impact as he began an official visit to their territory on Monday. BRUNO RETAILLEAU, FRENCH INTERIOR MINISTER (through translator): If we want things to go smoothly, we're going to pull out all the stops. We're going to mobilize everything we can in terms of civil and military resources. MADOWO (voice-over): With 75 percent of the population living below the national poverty line, Mayotte is heavily dependent on financial assistance from France. Speaking from Brussels, the foreign minister pledged to help rebuild the archipelago. The island nation of Comoros, north of Mayotte, was also battered by the cyclone, which then went on to make landfall in Mozambique, where it continued to cause damage. The storm has now weakened, but for the residents of Mayotte, the nightmare is only just beginning. Larry Madowo, CNN, Nairobi. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

I've had meetings with some of the ambassadors to some of those countries talking to them about, okay, like, how do you handle guns in your country? And they talk about how frustrating it is that oftentimes they're used as a talking point by the NRA to say, well, the X country doesn't have school shootings, but they do have firearms.When they say, well, the reason why we don't have those school shootings is because we have a strong system of laws in place to protect people. And what we need to realize is we need to stop treating this as an either or problem. We need to stop saying that, oh, we just need to focus on how does somebody get the gun? Obviously, we need to focus on that. But we also need to simultaneously focus on why does somebody want to kill somebody else in the first place. That means addressing joblessness. That means addressing homelessness and hopelessness that many people have that caused them to pick up a gun, even if it's here in D.C. And it doesn't make it on the news because it's a shooting that happens, you know, there are shootings that happen all the time in this city, unfortunately. Or if it's in the instance of a school shooter like the one in Parkland, Florida, who obviously had a mental illness, but at the same time was a self-declared white supremacist that drew a swastika on his AR-15. We need to realize that hatred is not a mental illness, but realize as well. I know I'm saying realize a lot, but truly we need to realize this is not an either or problem. We need to address both the demand side and the capability. How does somebody get an AR-15 to murder people or any gun in this case or, and at the same time, why do they pull the trigger?

He lost that vote by 394 votes against him versus the 207 votes in favor of him.What that means is that Germany is now almost certainly headed towards a federal election, the date most likely to be the 23rd of February. Now the vote today came about because Olaf Scholz's bickering government collapsed back in November when he fired his finance minister Christian Lindner. The two had been bickering for some time over a financial mechanism and Germany's economy. But what resulted in this was Scholz leading a minority government. That meant he had very few other options left to him apart from calling this confidence vote. What the opposition party saw though in Scholz's weakness was the ability to force him to make the call on having the confidence vote and the election earlier than he had originally wished. That animosity was very clear to see on the floor of the Bundestag today with all parties levelling accusations at one another. Scholz took another opportunity to remind the German people that the reason this government collapsed in his mind was because the liberal partners in his coalition were not prepared to agree with his policies and timetables. The CDU, the former party of Angela Merkel, now led by Friedrich Merz and one of the frontrunners to be the next chancellor, also took his opportunity to blame Olaf Scholz.

FOREMAN (voice-over): That's not true, say top medical researchers. But vaccines aren't the only issue he faces with Republican senators he must win over. Kennedy has insisted on Inauguration Day the Trump White House will advise all U.S. water systems to remove fluoride from public water, which Trump said sounds OK, despite decades of evidence showing fluoride radically lowers tooth decay. Kennedy has made false claims about the ingredients in Froot Loops and calls a lot of American foods poisonous. And many abortion rights opponents simply don't trust him, including former Vice President Mike Pence, who says Kennedy's nomination is an abrupt departure from the pro-life record of our administration and should be deeply concerning. But the Kennedy pedigree still has power. And even with all the concerns about the nominee, some of his complaints about the quality of food and the policies behind food safety standards are resonating with Democrats. SEN.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The federal government now preparing to deploy drone detecting and tracking systems to two military facilities in New Jersey, where mysterious drone sightings began four weeks ago. That's in addition to what's already, according to the Pentagon today, a very robust intelligence network. But the time of the deployment, not yet clear, sources tell CNN.

The FBI, which briefed New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy Sunday night, insists many of the reported sightings are actually manned aircraft. DHS maintains the unexplained sightings don't pose a public safety threat and stated unequivocally that not all of them are airplanes. ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS, U.S. HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY: There's no question that people are seeing drones. And I want to assure the American public that we in the federal government have deployed additional resources, personnel, technology to assist the New Jersey State Police in addressing the drone sightings. SANDOVAL (voice-over): That does little to assure elected officials on both sides of the aisle. They've been trying to discredit these sightings from the very beginning. SANDOVAL (voice-over): Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut told CNN that assurances from the government quote, \"fall flat.\" SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D-CT): My fear is that the federal government knows little or nothing about most of these sightings. SANDOVAL (voice-over): Two weekend incidents demonstrated the disruptive potential from drones in civilian and military airspace. Two men in Boston were arrested for trespassing after flying dangerously close to Logan Airport.

In fact, he says it's not even possible that Jay-Z was there.Now if we go back to Jane Doe's initial complaint, she alleges that she was raped by both Jay-Z and Sean Diddy Combs at an after party for the MTV Video Music Awards in the year 2000. Now this after party, she said, was held at a White House that was outside of the city. Well, Jay-Z's attorney actually showed photos of Jay-Z that night at an after party, but it was in New York City. So he says, if you look at the timeline, it's not possible that Jay-Z was in the suburbs at this alleged after party because he was photographed being somewhere else. Now in her initial complaint, Jane Doe also said that she got to this alleged after party by getting into a limo from a driver outside of the MTV VMA's who said that they worked for Sean Combs. Well today, Jay-Z's attorney is saying that's not possible because the limousine line was barricaded by the police and fans were not able to access it. Now I reached out to Jane Doe's attorney. His name is Tony Buzby. He says that he is representing over 120 accusers of Sean Diddy Combs. This is the first accuser to come forward and name Jay-Z, but he tells me that he stands by his client. He says that they are still vetting her. But when I asked about the vetting process, here's what he told me. He said that four individuals at his firm interviewed the client and checked details. He says that a background check was run on Jane Doe and that his firm actually engaged a seasoned investigator to vet some details she disclosed to us. And he said, quote, \"those results were consistent with what the client had told us.\" He also says that she assigned two separate affidavits. And he tells me, quote, \"courts exist to resolve factual disputes. Our client remains adamant about her claim.\" Back to you. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Since then, its financial performance has been poor, to say the least. Now Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky is buying it for the princely sum of $4.5 billion. Now he made his money in energy, but he has a few U.K. interests already. He owns a 27 percent stake in the West Ham United Football Club and a 10 percent stake in the British supermarket chain Sainsbury's. His mysterious personality and reluctance to talk about business dealings earned him the nickname of the Czech Sphinx in 2019. Now he won't be able to do anything he likes with Royal Mail. This takeover comes with strings attached. Royal Mail will still have to deliver letters six days a week, Monday through Saturday, and parcels Monday through Friday. And the U.K. government will hold a so-called golden share in the company, because this is vital British infrastructure. So they'll get final approval on things like a change in ownership of the company, a change in headquarter location or tax residency. This takeover is expected to complete next year.
