What you're looking at here is what happened just a short time ago, Zelenskyy walking into a meeting of senators with the Democrat and Republican leaders of the Senate, very important. Before that, he sat down with the leaders of the House, including with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, though there was no meeting with all House members, specifically no meeting with all House Republicans, which is critical, because Zelenskyy is urgently requesting more aid and funding from Congress, as some hard-line Republicans are pushing back and essentially saying there is no money here for you right now. This is as Russia is launching a new wave of attacks on Ukraine. Five major Ukrainian cities were targeted overnight. The new images of utter devastation are coming in, which is a grim reminder of Zelenskyy's urgent and desperate pleas for assistance for his people ahead of his meeting later today with President Biden. CNN's Oren Liebermann is live at the Pentagon. As I mentioned, Zelenskyy will be heading there this hour. What is going to -- what are the meetings expected to be like there?

      "sentences": "Well, John, President Biden is hoping to hear a battlefield perspective from Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, according to White House officials, as they're trying to still assess what additional needs Zelenskyy needs as this war against Russia is now well into its second year.Now, in addition to their meeting today, President Biden will be announcing a new aid package to Ukraine. This is all aid that has already been approved and allocated before. But this will include additional artillery, anti-armor systems, anti-aircraft systems, as well as air defense capabilities. What this does not include is those ATACMS. That's something that's Zelenskyy has been asking for, for a long time, those long-range army tactical missile systems that have a longer-range and larger firepower. The White House has said it's not off the table that they could provide those at some point, but they're not expected to be part of that aid package today, even as Zelenskyy had told our colleague Wolf Blitzer he would be disappointed if that was not included. But this all comes as Zelenskyy is here in Washington to try to convince the American public and lawmakers of the need for continued and sustained support for his country. And it comes at a time where there's not just a debate up on Capitol Hill about that aid, but also among the American public. If you take a look at recent polling, there's a real weariness in the idea of providing additional aid to Ukraine. A little more than the majority of the country feels that the U.S. should not. And if you break that down amongst Republicans, that no number is even higher. But as the president has been making this forceful case for Congress to pass $24 billion in additional aid to Ukraine, that is something that, up in the House of Representatives, at least with Republicans, is facing some real opposition, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy suggesting that he's not even sure he would bring up Ukraine aid for a vote before the end of the year. Which speaks to some of the complicated dynamics for Zelenskyy and for President Biden, as they are trying to convince people that they do need additional funding to go towards Ukraine, not just thinking about their war, but the long-term consequences that Russia's war on such a country could have for the -- for around the world.",

And so now he is stepping down from this position really at a pivotal time, a pivotal time in media, as there is this huge shift from linear television to streaming, and also at a pivotal time for politics, where the 2024 presidential election is heating up. Murdoch is responsible, really, largely for a lot of the right-wing rhetoric that has saturated the public discourse. Of course, his network peddled false information about vaccines, the 2020 election. He just settled a $787.5 million settlement with Dominion Voting Systems over election lies, and now he is stepping down. If you think that FOX News, though, is going to temper its right-wing rhetoric, I would just warn you that, in his note here, he's suggesting that Lachlan shares his ideological perspective, saying that there is a battle for free speech, a battle for the freedom at FOX, and that Lachlan is a firm believer in freedom.

I mean, with Rupert stepping away, I mean, he even indicates in the note to staff that he will still be around for advice. So I don't know how much is really going to materially change with the companies, if we will -- as Oliver said, probably not going to notice a difference in programming on FOX News or on FOX Business. But I think it's a moment that people will really be looking at what Lachlan does actually believe.

I think the big thing to look at here is that, as Katie said, Rupert's still going to be there for advice. He's still going to be, in his words, that he's going to be involved every day in the contest of ideas.
