Obama is clearly the Harris campaign's top Democratic surrogate. Its top Republican surrogate, Liz Cheney says she believes millions of Republicans will vote for Harris on November 5th and not tell a soul. And breaking just moments ago, we learned that Eminem, who rarely makes public appearances these days, let alone political endorsements, will introduce Barack Obama in Detroit tonight.

Some people may be not paying attention to politics, but Eminem fans, Usher fans, Lizzo fans will start to tune into this contest is the hope.And also clear core of the strategy here is using the former president's own words and actions against him and to get under Trump's skin in a way that the vice president can steer this contest back to the issues where she is most strong. It's a mix of this and doing these big events aim to get attention, the CNN town hall tomorrow, talking about reproductive rights on the campaign trail, as well as trying to reach disaffected Republicans through these country over party events with Liz Cheney.

He's in a part of the state of Florida where he was successfully able to convince many Latino voters to back him four years ago in Florida.

The last time Congress voted to increase the minimum wage, Patrick Mahomes was just 11 years old, Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, they still existed, and Kamala Harris was the D.A. in San Francisco.So, that was in 2000 and seven and that lifted the minimum wage from $5.15 an hour eventually up to $7.25 in 2000, and it has stayed there ever since. Now, remember that equates to about $15,000 a year. Now, some states they have raised their minimum wage, but a lot of them, they're still only requiring that $7.25. Now, that includes some of the more rural states that you might expect, like Idaho and Wyoming, North Dakota, but also some battleground states, like North Carolina, Wisconsin, and even Pennsylvania, where Trump was at the McDonald. During that trip, during that cameo McDonald's, he was asked whether he supports lifting the minimum wage. Take a listen to what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
