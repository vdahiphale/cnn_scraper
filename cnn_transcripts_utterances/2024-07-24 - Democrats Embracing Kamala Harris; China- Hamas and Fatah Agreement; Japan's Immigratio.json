There is a long history of bitterness between Hamas and Fatah, which dominates both the PLO and the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank.

It's another thing to say who's going to govern the space.

Notably, come Friday comes a meeting with the former president Donald Trump.But why that meeting and how much pressure is Netanyahu under to sign the ceasefire deal and free about a hundred Israeli and American hostages being held by Hamas? SANGER: John, he was under huge pressure to get the ceasefire deal together before he gave the speech. Clearly, that hasn't happened and isn't happening. And the primary reason, I suspect, is Hamas. But the prime minister himself has gone back and forth about whether he really supports a ceasefire, suggesting that he's still got to go after the leadership of Hamas after this is signed. Now, he hasn't said how. So we don't know how much he's invested in this deal. We don't know how quickly the deal could come together. And it's entirely possible, depending on what he says, that the deal could get scuttled. I think the White House has been working pretty closely with the Israelis to try tone down what they fear would be the sharpest edges of that speech. But then he'll go on to see President Biden and obviously congratulate him on his time. The fact that Biden is leaving might ease some of the tension between the two men. It'll be interesting to see what happens with vice president -- with the vice president as she is now the leading candidate. As you know, she's not had extensive experience in the Mideast, but she has been involved in some of the conversations with Netanyahu. And then he'll go to Mar-a-Lago.

Japan is revising its immigration laws, allowing deportation of most asylum seekers who have applied for refugee status three times or more. The move is part of an effort to reduce the number of asylum seekers in detention centers and to remove those with fraudulent cases, that's according to the Immigration Services Agency. But critics say this new law denies asylum seekers a fair judicial process and is a breach of the UN's 1951 Refugee Convention, which Japan has ratified.
