What kind of medical aid did they render Tyre Nichols as he lay there, and what steps did they take after that? Was he brought to the hospital when he was brought to the hospital?

We're told that some of the classified documents were likely used to prepare Pence for foreign meetings and that they actually may have been overlooked during the packing process because they were found tucked into old trip binders. Sort of interspersed with other papers. Perhaps they would not have been visible unless the packers went through these binders page by page. Just for context, it's not unusual for presidents and vice presidents to be given these travel briefing binders that include background memos on people they're meeting with in foreign countries. Our sources say that sometimes they just include basic biographical information on foreign leaders, government officials but sometimes they also include more sensitive information. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

We're still getting information on what's been hit but it seems it was across the country.We do have information just coming into us now that one person at least has been killed and two others wounded in Kyiv. We also know that there was attacks on the eastern parts of the country, of course across the front lines. Ukraine is going to see this potentially as a response maybe to the tank announcement, the announcement that the United States, Germany, other European partners are going to provide just over 100 tanks to Ukraine, a major announcement. But also let's put aside the details of the actual weaponry. A really huge shift. The message behind this announcement I think from the United States and its partners is we are stepping up our support for Ukraine and we are much less threatened by Russia. I mean, it was unimaginable a year ago that Western allies will provide these tanks to Ukraine. Now they see Moscow as much less of a threat. This is a weakened country in the eyes of the West. That's been weakened by this conflict. And it comes at a very critical time. Ukraine is preparing for the spring counteroffensive and these case could be critical. Take a look at how John Kirby, a senior U.S. official, described the strategy here. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN KIRBY, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL COORDINATOR FOR STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS: As the weather conditions improve, you can expect that the Russians are going to pick up the tempo. We have to be ready for that and I know the Ukrainians feel they have to be ready for that. So, it's about helping Ukraine defend itself. But also, as you heard the president say, helping Ukraine be able to go on the offense when the weather conditions and the operational conditions are permissive. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The Abrams are going to take much longer. Months just to arrive in Europe. Months more for training and this is not all the weapons that President Zelenskyy needs. It's not even all the tanks he needs. He wants a lot more. So, we do have to take a bit of caution when we think about the impact that we're going to see on the battlefield.
