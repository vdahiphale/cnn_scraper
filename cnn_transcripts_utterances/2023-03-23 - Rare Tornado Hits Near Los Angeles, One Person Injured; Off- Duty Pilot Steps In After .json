You know, a pretty amazing coincidence here after a lot of pretty bad headlines for the airlines.Think about this. The Southwest flight 6013 just took off from Las Vegas yesterday morning and was bound for Columbus, Ohio when only about 27 minutes in it turned back for Las Vegas. The pilot of this plane had an apparent medical emergency, according to Southwest Airlines, leaving only one pilot in the flight deck. That is when this passenger who was an off-duty pilot from a completely different airline was pressed into service and into the flight deck. This is the statement from Southwest Airlines. It says, \"A credentialed pilot from another airline, who was on board, entered the flight deck and assisted with radio communication while our Southwest pilot flew the aircraft. We greatly appreciate their support and assistance.\" You have to think about this. This is so rare for something like this to happen and it is a really serious incident. I want you to listen now to the air traffic control audio from LiveATC.net where one of the members of the crew -- we're not totally sure if it was a Southwest pilot or the pilot pressed into service -- communicated with air traffic control about the severity of this incident -- listen.
