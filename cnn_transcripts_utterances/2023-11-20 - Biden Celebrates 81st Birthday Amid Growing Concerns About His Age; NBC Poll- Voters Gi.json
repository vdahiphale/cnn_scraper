Most recently if you remember in our CNN New Hampshire poll last week.Look at this. Among Democratic primary voters, likely Democratic primary voters, we asked, what is your biggest concern about Biden as a presidential candidate? Overwhelmingly, 56 percent, a majority of his own fellow partisans, say his age. Nothing else even close there. And if you look at a brand-new NBC poll that came out yesterday, you see in the Trump-Biden matchup, a hypothetical matchup here, among voters 18 to 34, 46 percent Trump, 42 percent Biden. That's within the margin of error. So no clear leader among that group. But the fact that that's even close and within the margin of error is a real problem for Joe Biden since that's a group that overwhelmingly voted for him three years ago.",

People are concerned about his ability to do the job so he has a problem with young people.Well, it is also the Israel-Hamas war that's creating a problem with young people. And as you know, Boris, with his fellow Democrats. So if you look at the NBC poll, they asked, are Israeli actions, military actions, justified in Gaza against Hamas right now? Among 18 to 34-year-olds, a plurality, 42 percent, say, no, Israel's actions are not justified. If you look at it by party, you will see a majority of Democrats, if you go to that Democrat line on the bottom, 51 percent of Democrats say no. Now, Independents, a plurality, 47 percent, say yes, Israeli military actions are justified. Overwhelmingly, two-thirds of Republicans say they're justified. But this is a political problem for Biden because, obviously, he's aligned himself with saying Israel has the right to defend itself as it sees fit. He's offered lines of caution. But it's a political problem within his own house. It's Democrats. It's young voters. These are key parts of the folks he needs, where he's a little bit out of step with on this major foreign policy issue.",

And, Boris and Alex, many people have been very moved by that very heartfelt and personal message that the president issued shortly after the confirmation of his wife's passing on Sunday afternoon. Among the things that the president said was that she was his equal partner in everything he ever accomplished. He said also that she always gave him guidance and encouragement. And that as long as she was in the world, he knew somebody loved and supported him. Earlier today, I had an opportunity to talk to the CEO of The Carter Center, Paige Alexander, and we spoke specifically about what the president had said about the passing of his wife.

They went to the Peanut Festival in Plains, Georgia, their hometown. Many people were glad to see them together, especially after, as you may remember, back in February, the president was put in hospice care at home. And so former Presidents Clinton, Bush, Obama, Trump have also praised Rosalynn Carter specifically. They were honoring her exemplary role as champion for people suffering mental illness and also an advocate for women's rights. As to the plans to honor the life and legacy of former first lady, Rosalynn Carter, next Monday, November 27th, there will be a wreath- laying ceremony here at The Carter Center where people will be able to pay their respects. Then a couple days later, the funeral service will be held in Plains. And that's going to happen at the Maranatha Baptist Church that was the home church for the presidential couple.

What Ukraine needs is long-term commitment for all those things I listed beforehand to fight Russia. At the moment, this is a war of attrition on the eastern and the southern front. The counteroffensive that has taken place over the last four months has not achieved the results, has not delivered the breakthrough that everyone had hoped Ukraine could deliver. So it is at a stalemate. And we heard from the general here in Ukraine a couple weeks back saying, you know, the Ukrainians need arms and technology that are going to move the needle on the battlefield. At the moment, they do not have that. President Zelenskyy's appeal to Congress is that if he does not get that $61 billion, then Ukraine could very well not be here. It will not stay in the fight. You know, from the experts, Boris and Alex, that I've spoken to, if this funding is secured for 2024, Ukraine will be OK.",

We've shattered every record imaginable in 2023. And here we are. Now this doesn't mean we're staying there obviously.
