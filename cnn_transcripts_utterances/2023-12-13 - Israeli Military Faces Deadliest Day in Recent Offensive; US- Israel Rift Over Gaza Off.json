Seven soldiers, including a battalion commander, killed in northern Gaza. From as long as it takes to as long as we can. The U.S. president walks back a rock-solid commitment to Ukraine as Republicans in Congress block billions in wartime funding. And at COP28, the only phasing out of fossil fuels seems to be in the wording of the summit's final agreement.We begin this out with breaking news from northern Gaza, one of the deadliest days for the Israeli military since the beginning of the war. Since ground operations began more than six weeks ago. According to the IDF, seven soldiers, including a battalion commander, were killed in a single incident in northern Gaza. Overall, 113 Israeli troops have been killed in this ground offensive, which continues to expand across Gaza in hunt for Hamas leadership and Hamas infrastructure. Elliot Gotkine is following developments. He joins us live from London. So, Elliot, the IDF is usually very cautious, very guarded about releasing precise details of how and where and when soldiers are killed. So, with that in mind, what is known at this point about the incident?",

But as you say, the headline there is that seven Israeli soldiers, all from the same Golani Brigade, this is a commando unit, being killed in a single incident. Another Israeli soldier was killed in another incident inside Gaza. And this makes it one of the deadliest days for the IDF since ground operations began towards the end of October.And as you say, that takes the total death toll for IDF soldiers to 113 inside the Gaza Strip, since those ground operations began in earnest. And I suppose as Israel focuses its attention on Khan Younis, the second biggest city in the Gaza Strip in the south, where it believes leaders like Yahya Sinwar and other masterminds of the October the 7th massacre are hiding in tunnels underground, it shows that the job still isn't done in the northern part. Now, we heard the defense minister, Yoav Galan, just the other day talking about Israel having encircled Jabalia and also Shajaya, where we believe this incident took place. It's just east of Gaza City. And it just shows that the job is not done and that it's not going to be easy either, despite Israel's presumed superiority when it comes to equipment and the like. And there are dangers still there. And I suppose Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu underlined that when he went to speak to soldiers at an Air Force base yesterday. And he talked about four out of five Hasmoneans falling in their battle with the Greeks during the festival, which is what Jews around the world are celebrating in the festival of Hanukkah, relating back to that story, four out of five Hasmoneans falling. In other words, Israel very much expecting, not wanting, but clearly expecting, that this incident, as grave as it is, will not be the last and that the fighting is still incredibly bitter and fierce in the northern part of the Gaza Strip and will no doubt be the same in the southern part and that those casualty figures will go up, John.",

The idea that the Israelis, you know, would have difficulty in these areas is, of course, something we all talked about. The fact that the death toll seems to be so low is, you know, clearly a sign that the Israelis knew to expect this and that they've also moved their forces in a way that allows them to perhaps, you know, look at what Hamas is doing, learn from it, and then also lay in wait for them.There have been some incidents where the IDF has confronted Hamas fighters as they've exited or entered tunnels. And those firefights have been fairly consistent throughout the northern part of Gaza and also in parts of the central areas, especially in Gaza City. So we know that there's a lot of fighting going on in these areas.

And it's taking us some time to work to try and get that registration, which requires us to build partnerships with organizations that are registered in Egypt.

President Xi so far has met with Vietnam's prime minister. He's expected to meet with his -- with the president later in the day. So, that obviously is going to be very symbolic. We are also monitoring reporting on this visit from Chinese state media. And I think you alluded to some of that earlier, John. But this is a chance for -- for Xi to show that China has support from its neighbor. In fact, Xinhua, which is one of the news agencies here in China, reported that Xi said that he believes Vietnam will continue to support China in opposing external interference and firmly advancing the cause of national reunification and, in many ways, this is a veiled reference to Washington and the West. This is a big deal for Xi to be here, because it's been a while since he has been there. John, marks his first visit to Vietnam in six years. A lot of these agreements we talked about, a lot of them not a surprise, a lot of it is symbolic, but it is certainly generating headlines not only in Vietnam but here in China, where Xi Jinping is definitely trying to establish this idea of a second world order, an alternative, John, to the West.",

Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro says he'll sit down with the president of neighboring Guyana on Thursday to discuss a growing territorial dispute. Venezuela has proposed creating its own state on a massive oil-rich stretch of land inside Guyana, raising fears of conflict. It's a dispute that goes back more than a century, as CNN's Isa Soares reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ISA SOARES, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It's an outlandish attempt at a land grab that has the world on edge. \"Long live the full map of Venezuela.\" This is President Nicolas Maduro, revealing his new vision: a larger, a more powerful Venezuela, which includes Essequibo, a lush and vast patch of land that makes up two-thirds of neighboring Guyana. Maduro is now threatening to invade Guyana, after an incendiary referendum at home backed his bid to claim sovereignty over the territory. \"Let's publish and take to all the schools, high schools and universities of the country the new map of Venezuela,\" he says.
