      "sentences": "This leads us to pursue an agenda that is focused on the middle class. We started with an economic recovery that is remarkable for both its speed and fairness.The recovery is so strong and so widely shared because Bidenomics is not just about a post-pandemic rebound in demand, we've also focused on un-stalling supply chains and bringing more Americans into the labor force, which increases supply. We are now doubling down on that strategy with massive investments to position middle-class families to benefit from and to drive our country's growth. I called this approach Modern Supply Side Economics. Overall, the Biden administration has put in place the most extensive set of policies and investments to benefit the middle class and grow the economy that our country has seen in my lifetime. Our economic plan is improving lives and laying the foundation for a new future for middle-class families and communities across the country. And this is what I will discuss today. Let me start with some personal experience. I grew up in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, in the 1950s and 1960s. It was a middle-class neighborhood, at a good time for the middle class in America. My father was a doctor, and he would tell me about the workers who came to him for treatment. I learned about how much their jobs mattered to them, and also about the consequences of losing them. From the 1970s on, the American economy made great strides, from the huge increases in high school graduation rates, to dramatic improvements in workplace safety. But the challenges I heard about when I was a kid became trends, and my own special concerns as an adult, and as a practicing economist. Real median wages stagnated over decades. They grew only 8 percent between 1979 and 2019. At the age of 30, 90 percent of my generation were earning more than their parents at the same age. In contrast, only half of children born in the mid-1980s earned more. Incomes became more volatile, especially for people without college degrees.",

And soon, at about 2:00, President Biden is going to be in Superior, Wisconsin, at a brewery touting Bidenomics and this investment in the revitalization of a bridge that is going to be built there. So there is a strong positive message to sell, especially when it comes to GDP numbers. Walk us through those.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Boris, these GDP numbers that came out this morning, they really stood out to me. First of all, I was thinking, wow, because it was just so much better than what we expected.The other thought that comes to mind is, what recession? Remember, for so long, we heard the U.S. economy would be in recession right about now. Instead, it looks like that soft landing that so many people thought was basically impossible is actually happening. The economy growing at 3.3 percent, that is very impressive. One economist describing that as boomy. The other one calling this the recession that wasn't. One of the big drivers here is Americans continue to shop. They went on a shopping spree this holiday season and that is continuing to keep this economy afloat. But none of this is to suggest that the economy is perfect. It's not. There are real affordability challenges out there. And we know that Janet Yellen is addressing that in the speech right now, talking about how it is too hard to be a working parent in America, how they need to do more to help people deal with housing and childcare. Housing is a big one. The fact that mortgage rates are so high, home prices have spiked to record highs, means it's very unaffordable. This chart shows how the median monthly payment to get a mortgage right now is swallowing up a bigger and bigger portion of paychecks, and that is a problem. That is something that this administration, Janet Yellen and the president have to address. Because, Boris and Brianna, as you know, when people think about the economy, that's what they're thinking about. They're thinking about housing and childcare and the price of gasoline. They're not thinking about GDP.",

      "sentences": "It is very unlikely that overall price levels are going to come back down. You'll see something go up a little bit, some things will go down a little bit because of supply issues.For example, if you of a bird flu that causes egg prices to go up and then they'll go back down. But the overall price level throughout economic history generally trends upwards. And that's what economists want, in fact. They don't want to see overall prices going down, which is not super intuitive to the usual consumer, to the standard person. So I think part of the reason why you see so much frustration among Americans, even as inflation has cooled, is that inflation cooling just means there's slower price growth, not that there is price declines. And as more time passes, as you have that slow price growth, I think you'll see more consumers get kind of acclimated to the price increases that we've already seen, what has already been baked in. They stop expecting prices to fall. They just start assuming that, four bucks a gallon for milk, as is the roughly current national average for a gallon of milk, that's the new normal. They're not looking for it to go back to what it was in 2019. And it's not as painful, if, in fact, their wages continue to rise, as they have been in recent months.",

They reached out to several witnesses, including that woman who was still 17 when she allegedly had sex with the congressman.They also reached out to the Justice Department, seeking materials from its years-long criminal investigation into the congressman. Now, that investigation began in late 2020, under Trump appointed Attorney General Bill Barr. It started with allegations about sex with a minor, but then expanded to look into potential sex trafficking, obstruction of justice, and lobbying violations. I want to emphasize, the congressman has always denied any wrongdoing and he was never charged by the Justice Department. That case was closed last year with no charges brought against Gaetz. However, his longtime friend and associate, Joel Greenberg, he did plead guilty to several crimes, including soliciting and having sex with a minor. In response to our new reporting, the congressman issued a statement saying, \"Those allegations were not true, have never been true, and the people who spread those lies have been exposed, indicted, and imprisoned.\" Likely, a reference to Joel Greenberg.",

McCarthy has said publicly that he believes Gaetz's frustration with the ethics probe was behind Gaetz's effort to oust McCarthy from the speakership.
