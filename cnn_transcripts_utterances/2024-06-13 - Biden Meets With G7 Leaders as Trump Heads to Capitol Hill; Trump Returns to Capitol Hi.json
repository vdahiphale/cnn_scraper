It's good to see you, Colonel.This move, this loan, the move to loan money to Ukraine, backed by the profits from frozen Russian assets, what do you think this could mean for Ukraine's efforts? LT. COL. ALEXANDER VINDMAN (RET.), FORMER DIRECTOR FOR EUROPEAN AFFAIRS, NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL:  Well, it's a long time coming. This has been part of the discussion since even the days before the war started. There was an idea of levying some sort of sanctions on Russia to warn Russia off. And then for the subsequent 2.5 years, there's been a push to take a look at these frozen assets, some $300 billion across different countries in the west and shifting those over to Ukraine, either in the reconstruction phase or currently in Russia's in -- in Ukraine's war phase to be able to build out its industries. So, this is a welcome move. This is a welcome move in conjunction with a press of a flurry of bilateral engagements between Ukrainian top leadership and the U.S. bolstering support, demonstrating that the U.S. isn't going anywhere on the heels of passing the $60 billion Ukraine aid supplemental. It's another good sign. The provision of military aid has already had an effect on the battlefield, stalling Russia's summer offensive. All this is building towards another series of meetings in the coming weeks, the 75th anniversary of NATO, which will be critical. There'll be a series of pledges not going far enough in terms of bringing Ukraine into NATO, but at least moving the needle, moving things in the right direction. I'm sure that's going to be a topic of the discussion at this G7 because Ukraine is not going to get everything that it wants, neither are the Eastern European nations that want to bring Ukraine into kind of start to wind down this war. But this is a -- it's a move in the right direction.",

To me, that was a pretty big statement.",

      "sentences": "But if you think about the way arm sales go around the world, you know, when the Russians sold arms to the North Koreans or provided arms to the Vietnamese, they didn't really constrain how those weapons are used. That's not the way international arm sales work. Once they're sold to a sovereign independent state, it's up to that sovereign independent state how do they employ these weapons.The only reason that there have been constraints on Ukraine is because we in the U.S. have treated Russia as a special case. We've basically restricted the Ukrainians use of these weapons. And we're finally coming around to kind of a more normal approach to security assistance and security cooperation. So, I think that's well within Ukraine's right to take weapons that have been given to it to employ for national defense. It meets all the obligations of U.N. charters and international agreements. It's the right thing to do. We're just kind of going back finally to some sort of normalcy. You know, it's a strange thing to say, but that's the way things are played out in foreign affairs and in wars. So, it's a welcome move, I think.",

At times, you find yourself in these diplomatic dialogues managing crises. And in crises, you, you take the kind of the most important issue, which is Ukraine's survival and put that at the forefront.With Ukraine having a little bit more breathing room, you could have some hard discussions on things like Ukraine making investments into its own industrial base, into its own defense, including this recruitment issue. I think the fact is the Ukrainians probably need somewhere in the ballpark of 150 -- correction, 300,000 troops to replace the losses that they've had to fill up depleted units, to rotate units off the frontline, but also to build offensive capacity over the course of the next year to be able to take back and liberate territory. But right now, it's hard to see how they get there. They've not quite done all the things that they need to do. There's some lack of will by the president of Ukraine, President Zelenskyy, to take these unpopular steps to advance conscription and drafts. But that's an essential -- it's an essential function Zelenskyy to undertake in order to liberate Ukrainian territory. So, I think it's how they get there. They could probably reduce the draft age from 25 down to 18, like we do and we have a draft age of 18. I think they probably need to make sure that they reduce the evasions. They're taking some steps there. These are not easy things to do, but the Ukrainians can do it if they show the will and resolve to do so.",

But this meeting today, just off campus, is going to be a critical moment for Donald Trump to get the party on the same page, to unify the message and to try to make the case to some of those colleagues in the room as to what his strategy is, to not just win the presidency for himself but also take back the House and the Senate for Republicans in Congress.We do expect that Mitch McConnell, who has had a very icy relationship with Donald Trump over the last several years, the two of them famously had not spoken since the certification of the election on January 6th. He will be in the room today with Donald Trump as he addresses many Republican senators. The first meeting on Capitol Hill will be with House members just off campus, then later this afternoon, he will meet with Republican senators just off campus. But I just want to give you a sense of what McConnell is expecting from this meeting. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY):  You know, I said three years ago, right after the Capitol was attacked, that I would support him our nominee, regardless of who it was, including him. I've said earlier this year I support him. He's earned the nomination by the voters all across the country. And, of course, I'll be at the meeting tomorrow. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Here's a little bit of that.Representative Matt Gaetz said, I think it's going to be a pep rally environment for the former and future president. Senator Tom Thillis joked, to think we are going to talk a whole lot about a governing agenda on Thursday seems a little naive to me. That's like measuring the curtains. And then Chuck Grassley said to me yesterday, what do I expect? You have no idea what Trump is going to talk about. It's just totally unpredictable. So, despite the fact that all these lawmakers have expectations for this meeting today, I think the underlying reality is Donald Trump is going to talk about exactly what is on his mind in the moment. John? BERMAN:  House Speaker Mike Johnson was even doing a Donald Trump impression apparently yesterday. It will be interesting to see if he does that with Trump himself there.
