Video shows investigators at the scene inspecting a Nazi flag with a swastika, a black backpack, a roll of duct tape, a notebook and other items the suspect currently had with him.

So, this fits very neatly within that warning that we've heard again and again.And I think you have to draw a line from this apparent attack on the White House by someone bearing a Nazi flag to at least some of the people -- it's hard to say how many, but some of the people involved in the January 6th attack on the Capitol. How do we know that? Because some of those folks were carrying the same sort of symbols, Nazi flags, confederate flags, things like, that show you a commonality of ideology. It doesn't mean they know each other or planning it together but it shows you a thread of extremism and particularly racially- motivated extremism in this country that is also now directed at institutions of government.

The biggest sticking point that remains between these two party leaders is the reality that they are just very far apart when it comes to how much they believe we should be spending in terms of federal government appropriations.Right now, House Republicans are arguing they want to stick to those F.Y. '22 levels with just 1 percent increases for about six years. Meanwhile, the offer that the White House gave Republicans over the weekend was to freeze spending at the levels we are spending right now in F.Y. 2023 and then move that forward for another two years. That gives you just a sense of how far those sides are apart. That's about $131 billion right now. Are they going to be able to work through that issue and then deal with some of the ancillary issues that we talked about, things like work requirements, things like clawing back some of those COVID funds.

New this morning, the U.S. general surgeon is issuing a rare advisory on social media use and its impact on children's mental health, warning of profound risk of harm.CNN Medical Correspondent Meg Tirrell is with us in the studio. Meg, you ended up speaking with the attorney general about this. I think anyone who is a parent, anyone who is around kids can see this harm happening on a day-to-day basis. MEG TIRRELL, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes. This is something that the surgeon general is really worried about both as a parent and as the doctor for the country. And, of course, we know that use of social media among kids is almost universal. If you look at kids 13 to 17, 95 percent report to use social media. And though the minimum age is typically 13 to join these platforms, they found that 40 percent of kids ages 8 to 12 are on these platforms as well. And so while they found there is some benefit to using social media, like creating community, especially for marginalized groups, they found the risk of harm is potentially much greater here, including things like depression and anxiety, going on social media instead of sleeping, online harassment and, of course, low self-esteem, where we have seen a lot of studies here. So, they're calling on policymakers. They're calling on technology companies to be more transparent with data and try to put more safety controls into place.",

But they've put these family guides into place, TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, guidance for parents about how their kids can use this safely. But one of the things the surgeon general told us is that independent researchers say these companies are not sharing enough data. They need to be more transparent, and that is something they're really calling for.",

And so the surgeon general is saying, create a family media plan, really talk about this, figure out what you're going to do. Create tech free zones particularly around bedtime, maybe around meal times. Encourage your kids to have in-person friendships and really foster those for that important sort of brain and social development.And also model responsible social media behavior. We all have to get off our phones when we're around our kids. I only have a four-year-old and I need to do that better. Teaching your kids about technology, reporting when there's cyber bullying, either to school or even to law enforcement, and working with other parents. The surgeon general told us that's something they're trying to do even with young kids five and six, banding together because there's strength in numbers and find like-minded people who are trying to do the same thing.",

He wants to go as far as he can in that direction to secure to the extent he has got a path to victory, he thinks that that's how he going to sort of start and maybe pull some other people in. That is a very tricky proposition, frankly, I mean, when you're talking about the most conservative thing that can get to his desk.I think Nikki Haley may have sense what had we just saw in the last midterms, which is that if you want to awaken the Democratic base, start talking about, you know, taking away the abortion healthcare rights and see where it takes you. I don't know if Tim Scott wants to do much more than win that evangelical base, win Iowa, which has happened before, you know, but it has not worked for Republican nominees. I mean, it -- and it was Ted Cruz in 2016. I mean, there are evangelical candidates who win Iowa and get sort of a head of steam but they don't get the nomination. The last one to do that was George Bush, and that was in the year 2000. I mean, that's a generation ago.",
