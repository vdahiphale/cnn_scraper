Here are some of today's top stories.U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris will be on the campaign trail in Michigan today before being joined by President Joe Biden for a stop in Pennsylvania. The Trump campaign in Michigan is set to hold a video call with union workers in the coming hours before former President Trump himself campaigns in Wisconsin on Saturday. These are all swing states that are likely to decide the election. The helicopter that killed Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi in May was caused by what's being described as challenging climatic and atmospheric conditions. That's according to the Associated Press, citing Iranian state media. In an official report that found sudden dense fog appeared, causing the helicopter to collide with a mountain in northwestern Iran. Now protests as part of a general strike are going on right now in Israel. It's an effort to put more pressure on the government to secure the release of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan says the next few days will be critical in the push to free the remaining hostages in Gaza. In the coming hours, U.S. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are set to meet with the U.S. negotiating team as efforts to reach a ceasefire deal take on a new sense of urgency. The families of hostages say those still being held need to be the priority now. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MOSHE LAVI, BROTHER-IN-LAW KIDNAPPED BY HAMAS: I don't know if the deal would have succeeded. Hamas is not a good faith partner to any negotiated treaty. It's a terrorist organization that needs to be destroyed both materially and ideologically, just like the Nazis were destroyed and just like other vicious ideologies were destroyed in the past. But we need to prioritize the hostages now. And we already achieved so many military achievements in dismantling the Hamas military capabilities. So what we want to see is that we prioritize them.

The U.N.'s main humanitarian agency in the enclave says its first official day, the vaccination campaign reached about 87,000 children.Joining me here with more CNN is Nada Bashir. Nada, we'll talk about the vaccination program in just a second. But first, I want to get to the ceasefire deal. We heard the Biden and Harris meeting with the negotiating team today. How much more complicated has this now become in the wake of those six bodies being recovered this weekend?",

So that is a significant feat, a significant success.But of course, a small fraction of the total number of children they are hoping to vaccinate over the course of 12 days, they are aiming to vaccinate 640,000 children. So that's more than 90 percent of children under the age of 10 in Gaza. We've been hearing from aid workers on the ground describing the successful rollout yesterday. But again, there are still significant challenges ahead. Yesterday's rollout focused on central Gaza in the Deir al-Balah region. There are three phases. So the first phase is central Gaza. Second phase would be moving to southern Gaza. And that third and final phase would be focused on northern Gaza. And there would be three day periods in which this vaccine rollout can take place. And they are, of course, calling for these pauses to take place in these particular areas, pauses in fighting from both sides. And, of course, we've been hearing from medical workers describing these pauses as critical because, of course, we need to be able to see an insurance of, of course, the safety and security of these medical workers on the ground and, of course, the families who are taking their children to be vaccinated. We saw yesterday queues and queues of families lining up to have their children vaccinated. And, of course, what's important to note is while yesterday the vaccination process was taking place in an area designated as a humanitarian zone, not all of these areas will be safe zones necessarily. So it's essential that these pauses in fighting are, in fact, respected and maintained by both sides to ensure that they can safely carry out these vaccines.",

The strikes targeted Kyiv, Kharkiv and Sumy regions, according to Ukraine's air force, and included dozens of missiles and drones. At least two people were injured in Kyiv and one more in Kharkiv. This comes the day after 47 people, including seven children, were wounded by Russian missiles in Kharkiv. Ukraine's president says it's Moscow's latest effort to target civilian infrastructure and terrorize residents. On Sunday, Russia's defense ministry said they destroyed more than 158 Ukrainian drones, including over Moscow. One of the downed drones started a fire at an oil refinery, according to Moscow's mayor. Now, tensions are high between China and the Philippines after a series of incidents in the South China Sea. The most recent one took place on Saturday when the Coast Guard vessels from both countries collided. Both China and the Philippines are blaming each other, saying the collision was deliberate. The U.S. and European Union have condemned China's actions. But Beijing is pushing back against the EU, saying the bloc has, quote, no right to point fingers on the issue. China claims it has sovereignty over nearly all of the South China Sea, despite an international ruling that there's no legal basis for it. Six other countries also claim at least some part of the region. Thousands of hotel workers went on strike on Labor Day in the U.S., saying hotels are making record profits but aren't sharing the wealth. CNN's Gloria Pazmino has this story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Many of the hotel workers that are on strike have worked at the hotel for 10, 20, 30 years. And she points out that it's a physical work and just how important their health care benefits are to her.Now, we did hear back from one of the hotel chains. We heard back from Hyatt, who told us that while they were disappointed that the workers had voted to go on strike, they look forward to continuing to negotiate fair contracts and recognize the contributions of Hyatt employees. In the meantime, hotels are expected to remain open, although they will be having to decrease and cut back on some of their services. And they will be operating with smaller staffs. In New York.

If you're traveling on this Labor Day, you could see from Dallas to New Orleans some stormy skies, maybe some lightning and heavy rain could cause some problems. Some places like Atlanta and Miami as well, even going into late Monday into Tuesday if you're traveling home.The problem is, is we have a front that stalled there. It's been tapping into some tropical moisture as well. So some of that rain has been on the heavy side. But for the rest of us, we've got this area of high pressure in control. It's bringing sunshine, quiet skies and so much cooler temperatures. We've got temperatures in the 70s with sunshine for places like New York City and Boston, Minneapolis and Chicago as well. All of this much welcomed after some excessive heat that we had in these locations last week. You could see we keep things a little bit on the muggy side from Atlanta and Miami again with that stalled front and those storm chances. The cooler temperatures hang around the northeast as we go into the work week. Temperatures are still in the 70s through Tuesday and Wednesday from Boston to New York. D.C., you're looking at temperatures in the upper 70s, well below your average of 85 degrees, and much cooler than your temperatures that were over 100 last week. Even some highs in the upper 60s in Cleveland on Monday. So there's that cooler air on Labor Day, again, from the northeast stretching towards Texas. But then as that front continues to try to shimmy south by Tuesday and Wednesday, more of us are getting in on some of that cooler, more fall-like feeling air. Temperatures 5 to 10 degrees below average across the Carolinas down to Atlanta, even Dallas. Temperatures will be in the middle 80s in New Orleans by Wednesday, some lower 80s in Atlanta by Wednesday as well. So, again, feeling much cooler than average for this time of year.

He's scheduled to arrive in Jakarta on Tuesday, and will spend 12 days traveling across Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, East Timor, and Singapore, making this the longest trip yet for the 87-year-old pontiff.For more on the trip, Christopher Lamb joins us live. So, Christopher, tell us more about what you're learning about the itinerary for this trip, and also why he's focusing on Asia. CHRISTOPHER LAMB, CNN VATICAN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Christina, this isn't just the longest trip of Francis's pontificate. It's the longest trip that any pope has embarked upon. Francis will be traveling 33,000 kilometers across four countries in 12 days. Now, a key theme of this visit is interfaith dialogue, building bridges with the Islamic world. When the pope is in Indonesia, he, of course, is in the world's most populous Muslim country. And while there, he'll have an important interfaith dialogue meeting at the Istiqlal Mosque, the largest mosque in Southeast Asia, which is actually connected to the Catholic Cathedral next door, a symbol of the interfaith harmony that Pope Francis has consistently sought to emphasize throughout his pontificate. While in Southeast Asia and the Pacific, he will also be emphasizing the importance of protecting the environment, of course, being in countries that are on the front line of rising sea levels and climate change. And also he'll be able to support Catholic communities in these countries, which is important for Francis because he always likes to go out to the peripheries to leave Rome, to leave the Vatican and visit those parts of the church and far flung corners of the world. Now, some are asking how Pope Francis will manage this trip, given he's 87 years old. He uses a wheelchair. He's had some health problems in the past. But Francis has signaled his determination to carry out this trip. One of his advisers said that the pope didn't take up the pontificate to rest. So he is determined to keep going and I think send a message to those who might be doubting him that he still has gas left in the tank -- Christina",
