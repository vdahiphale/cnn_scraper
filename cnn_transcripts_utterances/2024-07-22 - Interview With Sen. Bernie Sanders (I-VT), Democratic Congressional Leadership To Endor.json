Also tonight, everything we're learning about who might share Harris' ticket and which big names have already said no. Plus, the Secret Service director gets grilled in Congress on Trump's assassination attempts and members on both sides of the aisle say she has got to go. Good evening. Thanks for joining us. Just a short time ago and barely a night and day into a run for the White House, Vice President Harris made her first appearance in a strictly campaign capacity, visiting her headquarters, formerly Biden- Harris headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware. She spoke and so did the president who joined by phone. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA): It is so good to hear our president's voice. Joe, I know you're still on the call and we've been talking every day. You probably -- you guys heard it from Doug's voice. We love Joe and Jill, we really do. They truly are like family to us.",

Is this just the beginning of what to expect in the next couple of months?ASHLEY ETIENNE, FORMER SENIOR ADVISER TO THE 2020 BIDEN-HARRIS CAMPAIGN: Absolutely, it's only the beginning and unfortunately, it's only the beginning. But the good thing is that Kamala Harris has been the first at every job in position she's ever had from the AG to the Senate. So, she's very accustomed to this incoming paying, these attacks. I worked with her as her communications director. The first year was crazy onslaught from conservative media, Republicans and Fox News, and she became very fortified in that, and herself, and who she is. And it created this armor. And so now, I look at the vice president now and to David Axelrod's point, you can see where this is all that stuff is starting to roll off of her in a way that it's sort of stuck in the first year or so. So, you can tell she's just become accustomed to this, but I will make this point. I do believe where the Republicans are going to make their biggest mistake is they're going to attack her on two fronts. One, is her being a woman and her being a woman of color. And both of those are actually some of her biggest advantages going into this election. I don't know any other election that is more right for a woman to win, especially with the GOP's assault on women. Secondly, her candidacy has clearly energized young people, people of color. Black folks are just energized about her. I was on a call last night; 50,000 women were on the call in a matter of hours with $7 million raised. So, you know, the Republicans are going to continue to go down this path to their peril. It's going to turn off that one to two percent that's going to make the decision in this election.",

As it was, the Biden campaign had a very, very small window to get to 270 and it ran through Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, and one district in Nebraska that elects by districts. That is sort of where she is right now and it's not clear yet how she will play in those states.

No doubt about it, but to take this energy and this moment and this excitement that people are feeling, the campaign's challenge is to translate that into people out in their communities, getting people to the polls. One of the challenges that we saw on the Democratic side, and frankly, I think they see it on the Republican side too, but that we've seen across the course of this campaign before President Biden stepped down is an overall lack of enthusiasm from voters, a sense that up until yesterday this was going to be a rematch of two candidates they weren't excited about, who didn't have positive favorables that had a lot of negatives. And there was just a lot of apathy from voters about this choice in front of them.

THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, NEW YORK TIMES FOREIGN AFFAIRS COLUMNIST: Yes, I was impressed, actually, Anderson. I've actually never spoken to the Vice President since she's been in office. So -- and covering Biden, I just never attended any of her speeches either. I was really impressed at how well she spoke. There seemed to be a lot of growth there. And most importantly, I'm impressed by the incredible energy she unlocked from the base of the party, which was clearly starved all these months for a leader, you know, to express their passion and to take on Donald Trump. And you've just seen this explosion of energy and money. And that I think is a really good sign as well. I think the real question is, is as someone who maybe would define his own politics as somewhere between a conservative Democrat and an Independent, a pro-business Democrat, as it were, I'm interested in how she's going to be able to appeal to that segment of the population. Because that's really, I think, where the future of this election is going to reside in places like Pennsylvania and Michigan with those Independents and more Conservative voters.
