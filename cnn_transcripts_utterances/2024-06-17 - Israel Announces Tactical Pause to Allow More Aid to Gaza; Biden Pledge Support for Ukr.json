Just ahead, Israel's plans to pause daytime fighting along an aid route in Gaza is drawing backlash from some of Benjamin Netanyahu's far-right allies. We're live from Tel Aviv with the latest.Ukraine says the tide is turning near its northern border as Kyiv soldiers appear to be holding their ground against Russian troops trying to take a key border town. And shocking allegations against British soldiers stationed in Kenya are investigated after being overlooked for decades. We are receiving new information about what went on behind the scenes as the Israeli military announced a tactical pause on Sunday. It apparently created confusion at the highest levels of government. An Israeli official tells CNN that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was unhappy when he heard about the announcement. That source says Netanyahu was assured that the fighting in Rafah will continue. And Israel's right-wing national security minister posted this to social media, \"Whoever decided on a tactical pause for the purpose of a humanitarian transition, especially at a time when the best of our soldiers are falling in battle, is an evil and a fool.\" The Israeli military says the pause is designed to allow aid to get from the Kerem Shalom crossing into central Gaza. Here's the map of the route the IDF posted. Kerem Shalom is in the lower left corner of your screen. The red line marks the route that aid trucks will take, free of fighting, to reach the European hospital. Meanwhile, there was little for Palestinian Muslims to celebrate on Sunday. Eid al-Adha is normally a joyous celebration. These ambulances were carrying victims of an Israeli airstrike in central Gaza. Elsewhere, there were prayers amid the rubble, like this event in Khan Younis. But with many Palestinians hungry and tens of thousands dead, there wasn't much of a feast or a celebration. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WISSAM AL-AJRAMI, PALESTINIAN IN JABALIYA CAMP (through translation): We were hoping to celebrate Eid in our homes, like other families, but the occupation has deprived us of that. The scenes that you see now, the shelling of homes, burning of homes, we were hoping to embrace our children to celebrate them this Eid, but they are now lying in cemeteries as dismembered body parts.

Of course, it didn't go into effect until Saturday morning. So just two days ago here in Israel. But the fact is, as I say, with the main crossing for humanitarian aid, i.e. Rafah still closed and Kerem Shalom being sporadically opened over the last few weeks.And that pier, which was only really just kind of topping up some of the aid because the most efficient way to get aid in is over land rather than by sea or by those airdrops that we've see. Given that situation, it's hard to see quite how this humanitarian aid is going to get to where it needs to get to. Certainly, the U.N. agency saying that the law and order situation is such that they still can't guarantee the safety of drivers and the like when they go through to try to deliver that aid. And as a result, distributing that aid remains incredibly challenging, even if physically getting aid into the Gaza Strip seems to, you know, have been happening. Indeed, it's been kind of a bit of a backlog. That doesn't seem to be the main problem. The main problem seems to be getting it to where it is needed most. And it simply isn't happening yet. And we'll have to, I guess, wait and see if this tactical pause from 7:00 a.m. local time, sorry, from 8:00 a.m. local time till 7:00 p.m. local time improves the situation. Anna?",

As Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky wraps his peace summit inSwitzerland, military bloggers say there's fierce fighting in a Ukrainian town in Kharkiv region. Ukrainian troops are trying to push back Russian advances near the border after losing control of several villages. A Ukrainian squad commander describes the situation as difficult but controlled, saying Russian troops are surrounded. The Kremlin claims its forces are trying to create a buffer zone at the border that could help protect Russian cities like Belgorod. Russia's Ministry of Defence says its troops have improved the situation along the front line. In one of the biggest shifts in Russia's war on Ukraine, the U.S. is permitting Ukraine to use some American weapons to strike targets inside Russian territory. It indicates how the Biden White House continues to support Ukraine, especially compared to Mr. Biden's opponent in this year's election, Donald Trump.

From the beginning, there was little chance of making meaningful headway. Russia was not invited; China did not attend. Still, it was a show of continued support from Ukraine's Western allies, although Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky did offer one way for peace talks to begin. ZELENSKY (through translation):  Regarding negotiations with Russia, I think I've said it in a detailed manner. Russia can start negotiations with us tomorrow, not waiting for anything if it retreats from our lawful territory. HOLMES (voice-over):  Russia has dismissed the summit, and on Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin laid out his terms for peace talks, namely the withdrawal of Ukrainian forces from four provinces that Moscow only partially controls and claims to have annexed, and Ukraine abandon its bid to join NATO. Proposals neither side will accept. Even at the summit, there were some divisions on a final statement, which most delegations signed, reaffirming the importance of Ukraine's territorial integrity and political independence, and calling for Ukraine to once again control the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. But there were key holdouts who did not sign the communique, including India, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and the United Arab Emirates, who have trade relations with Russia. Attendees say a follow-up summit is possible and the joint statement cited the need for dialogue between all parties in order to reach peace, though just how and when to engage with Russia was left unanswered, and some leaders left skeptical.",

Ukraine has stabilized the front lines, but is not in the position to push forward with a new offensive.It is seeing skepticism in many Western countries. It's hoping for a particular outcome in the American elections in November, again, as your reporters have mentioned.

I think it's going to be very difficult for him to pivot away from it, even if he wants to. He's found it to be politically very profitable, even if economically it's been damaging, and certainly it's been damaging to the lives of hundreds of thousands of Russians who fought and died or have been injured in this war. I think to a certain extent, there's a hope that this might send a message to others in Russia that there is a pathway out of this, if they were able to maneuver Putin out of power.

The reality, however, is that Russia will adapt to that as it has adapted to further rounds of sanctions. I think there's a little bit of a danger that Western governments keep looking for a silver bullet for the one sanction that will really bring Russia to its knees. It's not going to work that way.
