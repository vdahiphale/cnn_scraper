They did not give an explanation as to exactly what happened, but we do know he was a student there. And look, it was really other students, members of the community that essentially helped police arrest him and led them to the suspect.What authorities here say is that they received about 15 phone calls on Wednesday from members of the community who had been on edge after all of these stabbings, and they essentially followed him, saw that he matched a description of the suspect. And one of them following him to the point where authorities were able to finally find him and arrest him. Here is the chief of police and what he said happened after that initial arrest.

KATE BOLDUAN, CNN NEWS CENTRAL CO-ANCHOR:  In North Carolina, the Republican front-runner in the race for governor is facing scrutiny right now for including mocking school shooting survivors like David Hogg and the other children who lived through the tragedy at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. This is new reporting coming from CNN's KFILE that uncovered these postings by current lieutenant governor of North Carolina, Mark Robinson. KFILE Senior Editor Andrew Kaczynski, he joins me now for more on this. Andrew, can you just lay out for us what you found?",

Calling them spoiled little bastards and prostitots (sp?) for their advocacy for gun control. Now, many of these attacks on the students were deeply, deeply personal.And I want to show our viewers just a few of them. First, take a look at this, I guess meme that he shared, and this is just coming two weeks after the shooting. In a post, he said that the students rode a river of blood to 15 minutes of fame. We should also note, by the way, that Robinson is -- was 50 at the time he made these posts. The students were 16, 17, 18. That one coming less than a week after the shooting. In this other post that we'll see here, Robinson refers to the students as communists for their advocacy for gun control. Talking to, you know, people in his mentions on Facebook who said that -- was referring them to Nazis. He said actually they were communists. And then take a look at this last post here where there was quite a harsh response to people who were mocking these students at the time. Robinson actually makes light of it, tweeting the crying laughing emoji to people who said that they shouldn't be making fun of these students. He was saying that they were children who should know their place.",

Now, does this mean that there's no more concern about COVID? There is still concern. There is a concern that it should still be followed because you don't know what mutations are out there, you don't know what waves there might be. So, it's an acknowledgment, really, that the crisis is for sure over, but there are still reasons we should be following it. Let's take a listen to the Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove of WHO.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. MARIA VAN KERKHOVE, COVID-19 TECHNICAL LEAD, WORLD HEATH ORGANIZATION:  Epidemiologically, this virus will continue to cause waves. What we are hopeful of is that we have the tools in place to ensure that the future waves do not result in more severe disease, don't result in waves of death, and we can do that with the tools at hand. We just need to make sure that we are tracking the virus because it will continue to evolve. (END VIDEO CLIP) COHEN:  Dr. Van Kerkhove also mentioned that we need to be looking out for new viruses. If this pandemic taught us anything, is that new viruses evolve all the time and we need to be on the watch for them. John.",

An attorney for Johnson &amp; Johnson maintains that the company investigated all scientific or suspected findings to the best of their abilities and that the product does not cause cancer.Joining us now for more on her exclusive report is CNN's Pam Brown. Pam, how did you get interested in looking deeply into this story? And what do you think your biggest discovery is? P. BROWN:  Well, I have to say, that was an eye opener talking to Scott Faber, who you just played there. Saying look, you took a little risk here if your powder that you put on your face contains talc. I know we're going to talk about the FDA's regulation or lack thereof of cosmetics in a bit, but you know -- look, Johnson &amp; Johnson talc-based baby powder is an iconic product, right? Just the Johnson &amp; Johnson brand is cemented in American culture. It is such a big part of our daily lives. It is woven in our lives. I grew up with the baby powder. And so, I was wondering as I embarked on this story and this investigation how can there be so many people, now 40,000 plaintiffs suing Johnson &amp; Johnson who say, look, that baby powder contained asbestos which caused my cancer. And how can Johnson &amp; Johnson say flat out, there was never any asbestos in our baby powder. We've done the testing, the science shows this, and our product is safe. And so, we followed the journey of these three women who are bringing suit against this multi-billion-dollar company. And we look at the claims that they are making, what they are using to back up their claims, and then we sit down with the lawyer for Johnson &amp; Johnson, Allison Brown, who says flat out, the product is safe. Here's what she had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) P. BROWN:  So, I mean, Johnson &amp; Johnson is at the center of this. And so, it is essential to hear from this lawyer who has been defending Johnson &amp; Johnson in court. ALLISON BROWN, OUTSIDE COUNSEL FOR JOHNSON &amp; JOHNSON:  The first thing that is most important for me, that people know about these cases, is that they are doing an enormous disservice to a very important issue of women's health. What we can say with 100 percent certainty is that we have never confirmed a finding of asbestos in any product that has been sold and that decades of scientific testing and study have shown that our talc is safe and does not cause cancer. (END VIDEO CLIP) P. BROWN:  And it's really interesting, Sara, because I asked her about the FDA finding in 2019. The FDA found one sample, asbestos in Johnson &amp; Johnson talc-based baby powder, and she said the FDA was wrong, that actually the lab where it was tested was contaminated and they did more than 150 tests outside of that, independently, it showed no asbestos. So, it's really interesting to go deep here and to look at all sides of this unfolding legal drama that continues to this day.",
