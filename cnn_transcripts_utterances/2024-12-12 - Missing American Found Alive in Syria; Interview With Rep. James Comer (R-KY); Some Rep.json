We're learning some new details about drones spotted over New Jersey. I will speak to a state lawmaker who says a meeting with police left him even more alarmed. And then later, new evidence in the case against the alleged CEO killer. An NYPD deputy commissioner will join us. Hello, everyone, I'm Pamela Brown in Washington, and you're in the CNN NEWSROOM. And we begin this hour with brand-new CNN reporting that I have with my colleague Annie Grayer about Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy's new Department of Government Efficiency known as DOGE. We're told the concern is growing among senior House Republicans that plans to cut $2 trillion from the federal government by 2026 just isn't realistic. Some have even raised those concerns with GOP leadership. I want to bring in the other person the byline with this story, Capitol Hill reporter Annie Grayer. So, Annie, tell us more about the worry among these Republicans we have been speaking to.",

      "sentences": "Well, the worry is, how are they going to do this? I think broadly Republicans and even some Democrats really supportthis effort of cutting spending and excess government waste. There's really just a concern of how to do it. I mean, this bold price tag of $2 trillion to cut is one that has many Republicans scratching their heads, because discretionary spending, all of discretionary spending, which includes defense spending, is less than $2 trillion. And then you have mandatory spending, which includes the popular programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. That is a very politically tricky issue, even Donald Trump has said he doesn't want to touch. So that has left Republicans wondering, well, OK, how are we going to do this? There are a lot of ideas floating around. They just want to emphasize, Pam, that it's very much in the idea incubator stage. But one of those ideas includes firing all federal workers who were hired in the government in the last year, but that's getting some pushback internally and was told to take all of these things with a grain of salt. But looking at the ideas that are floating around, Republicans and people on the Appropriations Committee say that this -- these are really just small ideas that are not going to make a big dent in that $2 trillion price tag. But despite all of the concern here, Republicans are making the case directly to Musk and Ramaswamy and Trump that they need to work with Congress to make this happen and not around Congress. This was the case that lawmakers made in their private meeting with Musk and Ramaswamy last week. So we will just have to see how Donald Trump, when he gets into office, how he approaches all of this.",

My committee, the House Oversight Committee, has legislative jurisdiction over a big percentage of what they're wanting to do legislatively. So we're working with Musk and Ramaswamy and their staffers. They're creating this commission to have an expiration date. The expiration date's going to be July 4, 2026. So they're going to try to make these recommendations over the first year-and-a-half of the Trump administration and then walk away. And that's kind of setting an example as to how you can create something in the government, but then have a sunset clause to where it ends. The problem now in government, it's been the problem for decades, Pam, is that you create a government program or create a government agency. It never goes away, even when it becomes obsolete or inefficient. If anything, it grows every year and they have a cost of living adjustment and all of that. So what DOGE is trying to do is just have a sincere effort to try to ensure that government is more efficient and tax dollars are better spent.",

      "sentences": "So let's talk a little bit more about that, because our reporting indicates House Republicans plan to put a lot of DOGE's goals into the reconciliation bill.What's the plan to do there? As you heard Annie, one of the -- from Annie, one of the ideas being tossed around is firing every federal employee from the last year. What about getting rid of DEI programs, getting rid of climate change programs? Help us understand what's actually being looked at to put into that bill. COMER:  Well, if you look at a lot of the big spending packages that have passed Congress over the past four years from the end of COVID through today, there have been enormous grant funds created in the Department of Energy and the Department of Agriculture and all of these different agencies, the EPA, that deal with the specific what we would call Green New Deal-type initiatives. These grant funds were supposed to be created over a five-to-10-year time period. There's serious interest in looking at these grants to see if they're efficient, if they're being spent wisely, if all this solar money, if all of these E.V. hookups that have been paid for that really we haven't seen a lot of results from, if that money is being spent wisely. If not, they're going to claw it back. And I think what the average person can't imagine is how many grant pools, grant funds and pools of money there are around the federal government. Obviously, you mentioned the federal work force. The number of federal employees have skyrocketed over the past four years, especially the number that are working from home and not even coming to work. Government efficiency has gone down. There's a correlation with working from home and being efficient with the government. It may be different in the private sector, but in the government it's not working out. So everything's on the table. Every big expenditure over the past four years is on the table. There's money in the infrastructure bill. There's money in COVID bills that haven't been spent yet. We're going to look at that. And then you look at improper payments. That's a big issue, where the government sends money to people fraudulently in Medicare, in Medicaid, where they send money fraudulently in unemployment insurance, fraudulent IRS tax refunds. All of these improper payments are also on the table. And I think Musk and Ramaswamy have a good idea on how to prevent so much fraud and so many fraudulent payments in the federal government.",

But I will tell you this, Pam. I'm excited. I have had several meetings of Ramaswamy. My staff is communicating with their staff. And I think that a lot of their goals and objectives can be achieved. We're going to certainly try to do that. There are members of Congress, there are a few in my own party that are going to be obstructionists. They have they have been obstructionists since about the time I was born. But, at the end of the day, we have got a job to do. I think the American people made it loud and clear they're not happy with the direction Congress is going, they're not happy with how their tax dollars are being spent. And we're going to try.

I tell the press when they ask about the race for a ranking member, the Democrats have nowhere to go but up after having Jamie Raskin for the last four years. So I think AOC would be great. Gerry Connolly would be great. I know Raja Krishnamoorthi, Ro Khanna, they have all -- their names have been thrown in the hat. But I certainly look forward to working with the next ranking member.
