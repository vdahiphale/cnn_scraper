I'm Christine Romans.We begin this morning with the raucous face-off last night between Ron DeSantis and Charlie Crist in the first and only debate of the Florida governor's race. Crist, the Democrat, is behind in the polls, nearly out of campaign cash so he charged at the Republican governor like a candidate with very little to lose. DeSantis mostly stuck to his talking points as the two tangled over a range of talking points like abortion and whether DeSantis will run for president. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS) GOV. RON DESANTIS (R), FLORIDA:  I would like to see everybody have a shot. I'm proud of the 15 weeks that we did. I know Charlie Crist opposes that even though the baby is fully formed, has a heartbeat, can feel pain and can suck their thumb. REP. CHARLIE CRIST (D-FL):  I don't want to ban abortion. I want to make sure we keep a woman's right to choose available to the women of the state of Florida. I want to make sure we don't have a governor who wouldn't allow exceptions for rape or incest. Yes or no, Ron, will you serve a full four-year term? It's a fair question. He won't tell you.",

And if you listen to the rest of the debate performance, there were a lot of these national cultural issues, these issues that brought him to the national forefront that he focused on. He talked about a number of different areas that are flash points in our culture, whether it's transgender rights, or whether it's critical race theory in schools, he really tried to focus on these things that he believes will allow him to get that national platform, even immigration.He spent so much time talking about President Biden and what happening at the White House and trying to link Charlie Crist, his opponent, with the Biden administration. It's clear that DeSantis has his eyes on the White House. He's thinking about these national politics and he was able to win over some supporter last night in part because he did focus on these national flash point issues. Now, obviously, he is someone who has a lot of people who disagree with him. And Charlie was able to bring out some of that negativity, some of the disappointment that people feel in DeSantis in part because he leads a state that is the third largest in the country. It was a clash of two ideologies last night and it is clear that not only Florida was on the mind of both candidates but also the national political scene as well.",

Now, Florida continues to suffer from a number of issues, when it comes to hurricane insurance, when it comes to the price of housing, there are a number of issues that are unique to Florida that Charlie Crist hammered Governor DeSantis, saying that he's the governor of the state. He's responsible for the cost of living crisis in Florida. But Governor DeSantis turned it right on Charlie Crist and said that the Biden administration is the reason why the prices are so high, the reason why gas prices have been up. And so, there's this fight between what's happening locally Florida and what's happening on the national scene and the economy was one year where we saw that flight play out as well. [05:05:04] ROMANS:  Sure. All right. Toluse, stay with us. We have a lot more to discuss in the political world. I want to get to this. One of the most highly anticipated debates of the midterm season, between Pennsylvania Senate candidates John Fetterman and Mehmet Oz, a critical debate in a critical state. It is the first and only debate of the contest. Oz, the Republican, is trailing in the polls and had been pushing for more debates, but Fetterman who was sidelined most of the summer after having a stroke, he declined, something Oz is making an issue of now. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MEHMET OZ (R), PENNSYLVANIA SENATE CANDIDATE:  Political leaders like me need to be able to speak to voters, which I do. Town halls continually and I'll continue to do that. John Fetterman does neither of those things, doesn't speak to the voters on this campaign trail, doesn't speak to the press while he's campaign and he won't speak to me. JOHN FETTERMAN (D), PENNSYLVANIA SENATE CNADIDATE:  He literally doesn't have a plan other than to talk, and that's been the hallmark of his campaign. Just not any plans, just cheap photo ops or just empty kinds of arguments. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Christine, the debate tonight in the Pennsylvania Senate race certainly will be perhaps one of the most interesting of this entire midterm election season. We've seen races for governors, Senate, House, debates unfold.But this one is so different and this is why. John Fetterman, of course, the Democratic candidate, the lieutenant governor of Pennsylvania, has been between back from a stroke he suffered earlier this year. Dr. Mehmet Oz, of course, a famous TV doctor, has been making suggestions that Fetterman simply is not qualified to be a senator. Well, both of them will be able to make their case to voters, but John Fetterman will be answering questions through closed captioning, the same type of closed captioning you can see on your television screen. But certainly, that will be an interesting way how he communicates, how he's able to answer the questions. But certainly there will be differences between them on crime, on the economy, on inflation, on abortion rights. So, this is without a doubt one of the closest Senate races in the country and this is why. It's to fill the seat of a retiring Senate Senator Pat Toomey. Democrats believe if they can win that seat, it gives them a bit of a breathing room if you will in their effort to hold control of the Senate, which is very much an open question. But, look for both of these men in Harrisburg tonight, the state capitol, to make the case for why they are the best challengers in this. But independent voters are so key to all of this. So, potentially they may turn the heat down tonight to try and appeal to those voters -- Christine. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

We have seen John Fetterman talk about how there are a number of people around the country, especially the state of Pennsylvania, that have family members, that have their own personal experience with health issues and they don't want to have a doctor in their life criticizing them or attacking them over their challenges.And so, that's something that's going to be a sensitive topic and something Oz will have to deal with delicately because it could blow back on him if he's seen as being too aggressive. He's someone who won with the endorsement of the former President Donald Trump, and obviously, we know that Trump was someone who would be aggressive, who would push the envelope, who would do things that were offensive. That's in part why he lost his re-election bid. And so, Oz is going to have to figure out a way to highlight the differences between the two candidates without harping on the issue, without coming across looking too harsh and not having empathy for someone who's going through a health challenge. And so, while Fetterman will have his own challenges and making sure that he can showcase to voters that he's up for the job, Oz faces the challenge of not looking like he is taking advantage of the issue or trying to take advantage of someone with a health issue.",

Democrats are building a better America for everyone, with economy that grows from the bottom up and middle out where everyone does well. Republicans are doubling down on the mega MAGA trickle down economics that benefits the very wealthy, failed the country before and will fail it again. MATTINGLYthat you started the hear the president really kind of hone in on. That is not a referenda on his administration and the Senate and the White House. This is a choice between Democrats and Republicans, what Republicans would do particularly on the economic side of things should they take control of the House or Senate or both. That's a difficult argument to make. Historians show in the last decade or so, they say it doesn't work. The president is talking about the party in power. But the point I hear from White House advisers pretty repetitively is that they believe that on the economy, they will acknowledge sky high inflation, they will acknowledge the problems that that creates. What they say instead is what Republicans would do if they take control, whether on the debt ceiling, whether on entitlement programs, any number of issues that they believe voters will side with them on. That's what they want to highlight now, 15 days out. Couple of things perhaps working on their favor. We got a GDP report as you know quite well, Christine, it's coming out later this week. They believe that's going to be pretty robust, sharply positive, at least compared to the prior two quarters, which were negative growth. They also have gas prices that have continued to tick down, something they believe is strongly correlated with the president's approval and the Democratic Party's prospects for the mid-term elections over the course of the last several months. Will that be enough? History would say no. White House advisers say they need a fighting chance. It seems like the polls in a lot of these close races would underscore that part. How they actually break by the time it's all over? Well, we have to wait a couple of weeks to figure that out -- Christine. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

If you factor in the politics, we know discussions are still ongoing around a potential prisoner swap for Brittney Griner.So, I think, from Russia's point of view, if you reduce the sentence, you reduce the perception of the severity of her crime and that could reduce her value in a prisoner swap. It seems like the likelihood is not high. And according to her lawyers, this is affecting her state of mind. She is said to be very stressed. All hopes will rest on a prisoner swap. What we're hearing this morning, Christine, her legal team did ask to postpone the hearing for two hours. It was supposed to start an hour ago. It's going to start at the top of the next hour. We don't know why. But, meanwhile, of course, as I said, discussions do go on around a potential prisoner swap for her. They say there are active discussions. There is no serious counter offer for Russia as of yet. The next date to watch is mid-November, the G20 summit because President Biden has said he might be willing to consider talking to President Putin if the discussion was around Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan, the U.S. marine veteran detained in Russia.

She quoted the Roman philosopher Seneca saying it is not because things are difficult we do not dare, it's because things are difficult -- because we do not dare -- because we do not dare things are difficult.

Does he keep the current one? Does he go in a different direction? This will all be important in determining the market stability. In terms of the political tumult we've seen over the recent weeks, months and years, that might be one of his biggest issues he has to face immediately.
