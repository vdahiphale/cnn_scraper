Israel saying it was targeting a top Hamas commander, who was quote, \"Pivotal,\" to the planning and execution, of the October 7th terrorist attack, on Israel, someone who was, quote, \"Actively coordinating,\" and leading combat activities against Israeli forces. Israel says dozens of other Hamas terrorists were also killed, at the Jabaliya camp, in northern Gaza, the IDF saying they do not know how many civilians were killed. It says Palestinians were notified, to leave the area, through weeks of leaflets, social media and radio warnings. Here's what a spokesman told my colleague, Wolf Blitzer, earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. COL. RICHARD HECHT, IDF INTERNATIONAL SPOKESMAN: This is the tragedy of war, Wolf. I mean, we, as you know, we've been saying for days, \"Move south.\" We're doing everything we can to minimize, I'll tell -- I'll say again.

The scenes that have been described, the videos that have emerged, from the aftermath, of this attack, of this airstrike, have been horrifying, to say the least. We've heard from one doctor, at the Indonesian Hospital, nearby the Jabaliya refugee camp, who has said that they have had bodies, corpses, being brought to the hospital, dismembered and charred, that children have been brought in, without their parents, wondering where they are. And, of course, at this stage, they are still trying to confirm the extent of the death toll. There are many people, still buried beneath the rubble. It is important to note that authorities have said that at least 20 residential buildings, in the Jabaliya refugee camp were completely destroyed. We've seen the videos, of the destruction, huge craters in the ground, buildings completely destroyed, rescue workers, working alongside civilians, trying to dig through the rubble, hopeful that they will find survivors. But as we know, as we have seen, for more than three weeks now, in these cases, there are fewer survivors. And we have heard, from Doctors Without Borders, they have condemned this airstrike, by the IDF. They have issued a testimony, from one of their nurses, working around the Jabaliya refugee camp, saying \"Young children arrived at the hospital with deep wounds and severe burns. They came without their families. Many were screaming and asking for their parents. I stayed with them until we could find a place, as the hospital was full with patients.\" Now, we have seen, of course, and heard from doctors, that these hospitals are simply at capacity. We've heard the warnings, from the United Nations. The hospitals, across the Gaza Strip, not just in the north, are, in their words, hanging on by a thread. And we have seen those airstrikes, over the last week, edging closer and closer, towards at least four hospitals, in Gaza. So, there is significant concern, around the humanitarian situation, when it comes to Gaza's healthcare sector. They are simply overwhelmed. And following this airstrike, on the Jabaliya refugee camp, we have seen corpses, lined up, shrouded bodies, outside the hospitals, because there is simply no room left, in the morgues. Jake?",

We heard today, they confirmed that they carried out this airstrike.They say they targeted successfully, in their words, a Hamas senior commander, that we heard, from Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Conricus, who spoke earlier, giving a statement, saying that this senior Hamas commander was, according to the IDF, orchestrating, leading planning a active combat, against the IDF, as that airstrike took place. That is the explanation that has been given, with regards to the timing. Of course, as you mentioned there, the IDF has attempted to defend its actions. They say, they are targeting Military position, they are targeting Hamas targets. But as I have seen, for more than three weeks now, the civilian toll is immense, to say the least. The IDF says it has warned civilians, in northern Gaza, to evacuate. We've heard those warnings now, for some time. But as we know, according to people, on the ground, according to rights groups, according to medical staff, at hospitals, in northern Gaza, there are many people, who cannot evacuate southwards, as per the orders, the warnings, of the IDF. And of course, as we know, those airstrikes are also continuing in southern Gaza. The safe spaces that have been designated, including U.N. schools, are simply at capacity.

He oversaw Military operations, in the Middle East. General, thanks so much, for joining us. An IDF spokesperson, told Anderson Cooper, last hour, that the top Hamas commander was under the refugee camp, in his bunker complex, and that he is confirmed to have been killed. Given how specific that information is, what does that tell you about Israel's intelligence capability, below ground? And does that justify, in your view, a strike on a refugee camp? GEN. JOSEPH L. VOTEL (RET.), FORMER COMMANDER OF U.S. CENTRAL COMMAND: Well, thanks. It's great to be with you. I think what it tells us is that Israel, as I think, we've known, has had a very good intelligence capability, over a number of years. And while there was a setback, here, on 7th of October, they seem to have -- they seem to be recovering from that. So clearly, they have a good understanding, of where Hamas is operating from, and are trying to target those locations. Whether or not this is the value of striking this target, was worth the risk, to civilians, I think will be something that will have to be determined, in the hours and days ahead. Certainly, it doesn't look great. It doesn't help messaging for the Israelis. But all the details are not in, all the facts are not known.

Because Hamas does it, quite a bit, to the degree that they actually have, not only according to Israeli intelligence, but U.S. intelligence, command and control centers, embedded in actual hospitals. L. VOTEL: Yes, I think, in this situation, certainly Hamas has had a number of years, or decades, to embed, among the population, in Gaza, intermarrying (ph), and being woven into the threads, of the society, the community, they're doing everything into this. So, they've certainly had a lot of opportunity, to get integrated into the civilian population. We certainly saw this with ISIS. They didn't have as much time to do this. And I wouldn't characterize them, as a government, although they tried to think of themselves as a government. They didn't really represent the people, as I don't think Hamas does either. And our operations were really focused against them, to dislodge them, to destroy their ability, to hold the caliphate that they had declared, and to render them, ineffective, as a Military force. And this is what -- this is what Israel is trying to do as well. And, of course, it's so complex, by this extraordinary environment that we're seeing in Gaza.",

So, I think, the advice that Director Wray and others have given is exactly right. If communities see this, they shouldn't take the risk. They should report it right away. Because being able to actually identify those who, as you said, are in the basement, and just feeling hate, and will act on it? And knowing who will pick up a gun or use a car or explosives, and try to hurt people? That's really, really hard. And that's why we need law enforcement to be ticked off. But we also just need communities, to be very aware, and make -- really take that protection thing on, even if they don't see anything. They have to be ready, for these terrible situations. Because unfortunately, we do know, and there's enough of this speech up there, it will eventually manifest itself into violence.

But if it were to jailbreak, and a bunch of Democrats supported that, I could see that possibly shifting the political dynamic, in the Senate. But I find it unlikely.",

Now, at the same time, I think we saw this, from Secretary Blinken, today, they want to make sure Israel is following international law. They're protecting civilians, as much as possible. So, it is possible. And this is a very important point for, I think, a lot of Democrats, who are feeling queasy about this, to me, that you can go after Hamas, and talk about Hamas. That does not mean that you are against Palestinians. At the same time -- so, Democrats have to begin to sort of make the point, very clearly, about who it is that's being targeted.",

Their only other option though Jake, is they can take the Fifth. They can invoke the Fifth Amendment, and refuse to testify. But if they do that, under New York State law, the judge can consider that against them. The judge can essentially say, \"I'm going to assume the worst about what your testimony would have done.\" So there's risk either way here.",

Now, yes, various prosecutors have looked at this case, and declined to charge it criminally. But the worry, from their point of view, is prosecutors can always revisit that, and hear something perhaps in testimony, and say, \"Wait, let's reopen this.\" And to me, the biggest risk they're facing here is the potential of some sort of criminal liability.",

The A.G.'s office, who are the plaintiffs, are going to allege, \"You, the Trump children, you are in on this. You intentionally overstated the value in order to help your business.\" And I suspect their testimony is going to be \"No, we did not.\" There is some subjectivity in the value of these assets. And there's some sort of inherent value in the brand name here. Now, the judge has already rejected that, in part. He's already found that the inflations here were so vast, that they cannot be justified. But that's going to be the battleground, when the members of the Trump family take the stand.",

The A.G.'s office alleges that Ivanka Trump was involved in a transaction, involving one of Donald Trump's hotels, in Washington, D.C., and they say she has relevant information.
