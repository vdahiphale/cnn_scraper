      "sentences": "Good day, everyone. I'm Jessica Dean to our viewers watching all around the world. Welcome to a specialedition of State of the Race. We are following two major stories this hour. Up first, the world is absorbing the shock of the apparent death of Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny. He was the most high-profile Kremlin critic, and had long been a thorn in the side of President Vladimir Putin. Russia's Prison Service says he died after going for a walk and an Arctic penal colony where he was serving multiple sentences totaling more than three decades on trumped up charges. At this hour, we're also awaiting a ruling in New York that could cripple Donald Trump's business empire. A judge could order hundreds of millions of dollars in fines in a civil fraud case there. But, let's go back to the reported death of Alexey Navalny. Our Chief International Security Correspondent Nick Paton Walsh is now joining us from Munich, Germany, which is hosting its annual security conference. Nick, so many leaders and national security leaders gathered in one place. What are you hearing this morning? NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CHIEF INTL. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, ultimately, a conference which was supposed to be dominated by the concerns over whether NATO would stick together in the event potentially of a Trump presidency, now utterly focused on the barbarity, it seems, of the Putin administration in Russia. And again, I think, focusing minds on what that means for the war in Ukraine, the backdrop here, the real threat, you're struggling by now, Alexey Navalny, according to Russian state media and the Russian Prison Service, dying when he lost consciousness on a walk in the third correctional colony in the Yamalo-Nenets, an autonomous region, that's up near the Arctic Circle where he was being held, you said, for a number of years more. State media reporting that there were attempts to try and resuscitate him. That failed. We haven't had separate independent confirmation of that death. And indeed, when U.S. officials speak of it, they are cautious to point out that they're still trying to make their own assessment. I think it's fair to say, though, the broad feeling globally is that you would not get an announcement like this from Russia's authorities and its state media unless indeed Alexey Navalny had in fact died. Important to point out this mass position in Russia, the most charismatic, the most outspoken opposition figure that Russia has seen in the time of the Putin rule, and a man whose voice has been quietened by this extensive prison sentence he'd been given far away from where he could do damage to Russia's political system up there near the Arctic Circle, occasionally, sending out broadcasts in limited court appearances through trusted intermediaries, but really limited in what he could do. Yet, still, it appears that the most generous assessment we can make of this, the Russian administration felt they didn't really need to try and keep him alive, and so allowed a man in poor frail health to go to these Arctic conditions, hazardous, frankly, for a man of his age even in the best of health, and that appears to have led to his death today. A tearful, I would say, an emotional speech from his likely widow here Yulia Navalnaya, speaking of his courage. I think many were reminded of a statement he had given himself in which he said that, if I do indeed die, that's a sign that we are winning. And U.S. officials here, the most senior Vice President Kamala Harris, reminding people that whatever story Russia sells the world, it is ultimately Putin that is responsible for this, some European politicians going further, the President of Latvia saying that he was indeed murdered by the Putin government. So, a stark moment here for Russia's politics, a reminder of the threat to internal dissidents, but also Europe that Putin presents. But also a question, frankly, being asked, that if indeed the Russian government was somehow responsible for this death, what is it a sign of? Is it a sign of their weakness, their paranoia? Why did they feel that a month ahead of an election that everybody thinks Putin is going to win hands down because he has no real opponents in it, that they needed to silence this already muted opposition voice? A startling moment, certainly, one of great loss for those who knew Navalny, and keen reminder, I think, for those who wish to speak about the war in Ukraine and how NATO and U.S. allies should do more to try and reverse Ukraine's lack of success on the battlefield. Remember, they're waiting for $60 billion to be approved by a Republican-held Congress at this stage. But, Russia remains a very acute threat. Everyone here knew it before the death of Navalny. But, I think that awful piece of news is going to focus minds much more clearly, much more loudly, on exactly what Putin means in 2024.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. Look, I mean, Biden's comments in 2021 were before the U.S. had to roll out pretty much everything it could in terms of sanctionsagainst Russia. So, their armory, I think, is diminished, and what they can potentially do, there may be other moves to make. There are notions of forfeiture potentially of Russian assets. But, that is legally complex. There may be other things they could have to do in the financial sphere as well. But, remember, the U.S. and its NATO allies are already arming Ukraine quite substantially. And we have a pretty much intense conflict now continuing in Ukraine. So, things have changed since those Biden comments. But, I think it's very hard for the White House to allow this death to pass without some sort of Western response. Well, quite a confession is unclear. I think the key impact of this death, though, is as we heard from Ukraine's Foreign Minister really here to put greater accent on exactly the threat Russia faces in Ukraine, and as the Foreign Minister said of Ukraine, perhaps remind people that Putin is not someone you can start negotiating with. Remember, there have been talks in the past about the possibility of talks. So, maybe we could find a peaceful resolution to the Ukraine war. I think many here will be reminded from this -- the news of the awful death of Navalny that Moscow can't be taken at face value. Jessica.",

The other event was the pull out of Afghanistan in 1989, a war that Soviets were losing. Russian history suggests if you lose the war, you're going to be on the wrong end of a firing squad. That happened with the Romanovs in 1917, Gorbachev, the Soviet Union sort of imploded as a result of the Afghan withdrawal. And Putin just wants to restore the KGB state. He wants to restore the Russian Empire. And he wants to play from the Stalin playbook, not from the Gorbachev playbook. And he has an election coming up in mid-March. There was an anti-war candidate running, who pulled out last week. Putin has fixed the Constitution so he can run till 2036, and he plans to rule more like Stalin than Gorbachev.

And I think, to your point, Jessica, there is a broader conversation here that the President and Democrats and some Senate Republicans are trying to have, to your point, that Putin is willing to push the ball even further. And I think that is what Democrats and Senate Republicans who passed this military aid package are trying to say is that it's not just about Ukraine. Yes. They want to support Ukraine in this moment.

And as Colonel Leighton indicated, he is certainly not losing the Ukraine war. It's in a stalemate, which kind of helps him and obviously he knows Trump could win the election. He is doing the math. So, as a practical matter, there is nothing -- he has been charged with war crimes in The Hague. Right? He is not going to go on vacation in the south of France and have an Interpol Red Notice be served on him. He is not going anywhere. So, as a practical matter, we can say whatever we want about what we're going to do, but there is very little we can do. One thing we can do is we can make a big. I would recommend him for the Nobel Peace Prize. It's -- you can't -- it can't be awarded posthumously, but you can change the rules. You think about Solzhenitsyn getting the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1970. That sent a big signal. So, there are things we can do, I think, in a sort of moral sense, but not in a practical sense.",

The facts will not change here. I think this was an effort by the former President and Republicans, generally speaking, to sort of muddy up the waters. Donald Trump lost the state of Georgia about 12,000 13,000 votes, and part because of areas like Cobb County, North Atlanta. These are very suburban, wealthier, educated Republican areas. I know I went to college. I know the state very well. If he can move the needle on some of those numbers, if he can get the very popular Governor Kemp to all of a sudden at some point come out and endorse him, this could potentially be a state that the former President could see back in his corner come November.
