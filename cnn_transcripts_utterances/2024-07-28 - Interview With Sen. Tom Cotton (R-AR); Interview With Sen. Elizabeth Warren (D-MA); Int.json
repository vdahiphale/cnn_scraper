I'm Jake Tapper in Washington, where the state of our union is in a sprint, 100 days out.We're in -- only one week into the brand-new presidential race, leaving Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump just 100 days to readjust to their new reality before Election Day. Vice President Harris has made strides since President Biden dropped out of the race one week ago today. Several polls show her tightening up the race with Trump, especially in those battleground states. And this morning, the Harris campaign announced she has already raised $200 million in the last week. But Republicans are beginning to pick apart her record, largely from her time in California and also her time tacking to the left in the 2020 primary campaign. The next few months will be a trial by fire. Donald Trump, for his part, is trying to find his footing after the big switch. Last night, he was still testing lines of attack against Harris in Minnesota in a joint appearance with his vice presidential pick, J.D. Vance, who's dealing with controversies of his own, as Trump falsely claimed he won Minnesota in 2020, which he did not, and tried to get a handle on his new opponent. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We need the tools in order to have more resources at the border, to have more resources in the states and cities that are supporting migrants. And I believe we need to create a pathway to citizenship. All of that is part of what we need to do for comprehensive immigration reform. Kamala Harris will work with Congress and get that done. Donald Trump, by contrast, recognizes that Democrats and Republicans worked together starting last fall, negotiated a deal. Two days before they were getting ready to vote on that border deal, Donald Trump called on the Republicans who had praised the deal to back away from it because he wanted chaos at the border, because he thought it would help him in this race on November 5. So it's really a question of, who do you trust on the border? Do you trust someone who has actually been a prosecutor, who has been there in a border state, who works with Congress toward a solution? Or do you trust someone who says, you know, chaos is politically helpful to him, so he's just going to go with that?",

I think what President Biden is doing is, think about this moment. Here is a man who's been a transformative president. He's got an enormous amount done. And yet he has stepped away and he has passed the torch to Kamala Harris. Why has he done that? He's done it as an act of patriotism for our nation. And he is saying, we not only have to have a president who is here for the nation and who will heal us and bring us together. We also have to change our Supreme Court, because, right now, we have a Supreme Court that has basically jumped the guardrails and is out there giving power to the president, saying that the president can commit any act that the president wants, saying that Congress cannot authorize agencies to act. So we have got a Supreme Court that is actively undermining our democracy. And I think what Joe Biden will do over the next six months is, he's going to keep drawing that to the attention of the American people and reminding them, when they vote in November, the Supreme Court is on the ballot.

Joining us now, Arkansas Republican Senator Tom Cotton. Senator, thanks so much for joining us. I do want to ask you. Overnight, the Israeli Defense Forces struck targets inside Lebanon focused on Hezbollah, the terrorist group there, in retaliation for a rocket attack that killed 12 children in a Druze community in the Golan Heights in Israel. Hezbollah does appear responsible for that attack. What do you know about the Israeli response? And how worried are you that this could escalate into a larger regional conflict involving not just Lebanon and Hezbollah, but maybe even Iran? SEN. TOM COTTON (R-AR):  Well, Jake, what I'm worried about is Iranian-backed terrorists continuing to blow up in innocent children in Israel. That's what we saw yesterday in this heinous attack. Last October, we saw Iranian-backed terrorists kill more than 1,200 Jews in the worst atrocity against Jews since World War II. This week, Kamala Harris, in her very first statement and still to my knowledge only statement on a matter of great public importance, came out after a meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu and equivocated between Hamas and Israel and effectively blamed Israel for civilian casualties in Gaza or for the lack of food in Gaza that Hamas is diverting from aid stations. That simply makes it harder to get a peace deal. It makes it harder to have stability in the Middle East. And, frankly, it emboldens Iran and terrorist groups like Hezbollah because they believe that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will continue to put more pressure on Israel than it puts on Iran and its terrorists that are encircling Iran -- Israel with the stated objective to destroy Israel. What we should do is back Israel to the hilt, not put pressure on Israel, not scramble behind the scenes to try to stop Israel from retaliating appropriately for this heinous attack that killed more than a dozen people, including children.",

President Trump has acknowledged that reality. Now, he's also said he's not going to allow things like the VA clinics to be converted into abortion clinics, taking away care from our great veterans. But he's also acknowledged that states are going to be, by and large, making these decisions.
