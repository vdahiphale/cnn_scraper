We're following several developments this hour on the Israel-Hamas war in a politically important but largely symbolic move. Spain, Norway, and Ireland have today announced they will formally recognize the state of Palestine beginning next week. They join more than 140 other nations to recognize the Palestinian state, which encompasses Gaza and the West Bank. Israel is now recalling its ambassadors in those three European countries in a sign of protest. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the move will not bring peace. He called it a reward for terror. The White House says a Palestinian state should be recognized, though through negotiations, not through unilateral recognition. Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez says, the move is aimed at accelerating efforts to secure a ceasefire. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Today, the families of seven female IDF soldiers kidnapped by Hamas on October 7th, have released just graphic footage of the moment of their abduction. And it's shocking to see, you can see the woman bloodied, bruised. Their hands tied behind their backs. The families are sharing this, they say, to put further pressure on the Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu to bring all the hostages home. CNN's Jeremy Diamond is in Jerusalem.

And that was evidenced in the response that we saw today, both in terms of rhetoric, but also in terms of policy proposals from the Israeli government to this decision by these three countries to recognize a Palestinian state.And that's because the Israeli prime minister himself not only said that he believed that recognizing a Palestinian state is tantamount to a reward for terror. He also said that he believes that the establishment of a Palestinian state will lead to a terror state, which he said will, quote, attempt to perpetrate the onslaught of October 7th time and again. In addition to all of that, we've heard from the Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, a far-right member of the current Israeli government, who said that he wants to seek the approval of tens of thousands of housing units and Israeli settlements in the West Bank, new Israeli settlements and also withholding money from the Palestinian Authority, all steps that he says are intended as retribution for the recognition of a Palestinian state by these three countries.",

Back here in the U.S., as one Trump trial nears its end, another is barely beginning, maybe may not begin. Right now, a Florida courtroom inside Judge Aileen Cannon is hearing the second of two separate bids to throw out charges against former President Trump and his aid and co-defendant, Walt Nauta, over their handling of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago. This is the first public hearing in more than a month and what's been a notably slow-moving case. Judge Cannon indefinitely delayed the start of the trial, which was actually originally scheduled to begin this week. Questions about her pace have only magnified with newly unsealed filings, such as these images showing Walt Nauta moving boxes before Trump's attorney had reviewed them. Let's go now to CNN's Jessica Schneider for more. What's interesting about what's going on in the courtroom today -- of course, there's long than criticism of the speed or lack of speed with which is judges is dealing with this but as that happens, were seeing really new evidence here in these court filings about efforts allegedly made by Trump himself to avoid the security cameras as these boxes were being moved.

It's sort of regarded whether Trumps attorney at the time could be forced to testify handover evidence.Turns out he could because of possible violations of the crime-fraud exception, some concerns that maybe he was involved in the crime. And like you said, coming out from that, two notable people pieces of evidence. First of all, you have that June 2022 surveillance video that came out showing Walt Nauta moving the boxes and insignificant because this was in the weeks after Trump was subpoenaed for classified documents.

There's nothing wrong with that part.The issue that we've had with how this case is procedurally concerns that have been identified is how slowly she's moved on resolving other pretrial motions that are rather straightforward.

He has said essentially that every sort of Biden policy on energy that has moved since he took office is on the table to be eliminated and he would roll back to some of the regulations that were in place when he was president, he would make sure that the companies can drill, that some of these pipeline products that have been put on hold can advance.And so that is what that stake for these oil companies and these elections and Trump as he undergoes this fundraising blitz, has not one, not two, but three fundraisers in this state today with energy executives and oil executives trying to catch up to Joe Biden in the fundraising race. And for these oil executives, when you look -- when you look at the or -- excuse me, when you look at the invites for these fundraisers, it's a who's who of the oil and energy industry. Some of the wealthiest people in Texas are there for Trump trying to raise money for his campaign. And you're also seeing this become a talking point for the Biden campaign and for Democrats who are campaigning for reelection by standing by the former president, or excuse me, the President Biden's actions on climate change.

Meg Whitman, the former CEO of many technology companies, now the ambassador to Kenya, sort of helped spearhead that. The two countries will also focus on issues of national security, shared goals of defeating terrorist organizations in the region, as well as financial stability with President Ruto expected to speak out against predatory lending to Africa by other countries. And that brings us, Jim, to the big picture. There's also going to be a very clear message that is going to be sent by this visit to not only Russia, as you mentioned, but perhaps more specific typically to China -- the message that China cannot co-opt an entire continent and leave its countries indebted. That is one reason why the White House has been so strategic in making some infrastructure investments to some countries on the continent, specifically to counter China's belt and road program. There have been many officials from the administration who have visited Africa specifically to send that specific message that I just mentioned. And President Biden himself in 2023, pledged but he would be visiting the continent as well. And today, national security adviser Jake Sullivan was asked, since the president has not delivered on that commitment to make that trip to Africa is that a failed promise to countries like Kenya.

And is it possible to find forgiveness for the worst crimes of humanity?Those are some of the questions explored a new film that captures a powerful and haunting meeting between the descendants of Auschwitz's top commandant and a survivor of what is the most infamous and deadly concentration camp of the Holocaust. The story of Rudolf Hoss, the German officer who oversaw the murders of more than 1 million Jews at Auschwitz, was fictionalized in the Academy Award-winning film, \"Zone of Interest\". Now, the documentary, \"The Commandant's Shadow\" tells the real story. Here's some of the trailer. We should note, the film is being released by our parent company, Warner Bros. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So it was very moving really to see how gracious and generous she was. And I think it also meant a lot to him because, you know, he did kind of in a way realize his hereditary burden was enormous, you know, once he had been to the death camp that Anita had survived.
