Also Anderson, you could see Alex Murdaugh -- oh, we have this presser that's just about to start here. But that would be -- that's the that's the South Carolina Attorney General, Anderson, Alan Wilson at the podium. He actually questioned one of the last witnesses, Anderson, because that was a very important witness, a key witness. He was speaking to how the crime scene, how it all happened. He was a crime scene expert on recreation of the crime scene and was really able to help the jury understand how the defense's theory just could not have worked.

I'd like to start real briefly by thanking our team. First, excuse me, let me put my glasses on. Our chief prosecutor, I tell you, I appointed Creighton Waters to be the chief prosecutor of this case nearly a year-and-a-half ago and I want to say I'm pretty brilliant because I picked the right guy and I want to say thank you to Creighton Waters. Creighton, you did a fantastic job. I don't think there is another attorney in the State of South Carolina that could have led this Herculean effort, but Creighton will be the first to tell you he didn't do it alone because he had a team of people. I want to first thank Don Zelenka who was actually Creighton's boss, he is the Deputy Attorney General. He had been in the Attorney General's Office for over 40 years, sitting here to my immediate left, Don Zelenka, thank you so much. John Meadors, many of you got to see him do the closing argument today. John, thank you. You've done -- you've been a phenomenal add to our team. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]",

I don't know if I mentioned the bailiffs, but I want to thank them. And there's another group of people who you don't know who they are, but that's the jurors. And not just the jurors, but the alternates, the ones who didn't even get to serve to the very end, but people who were taken away from their families. I want to thank the families of our jurors who sat here every single day for what seemed like long amounts of tedious monotonous information and evidence. Sometimes people didn't know what it meant. They didn't understand it and they had to sit there and process it and hear it over and over and over again. And I want to thank these nameless jurors whose identities had been protected.

And we had no doubt that if we had a chance to present our case, in a Court of law, that they would see through the one last con that Alex Murdaugh was trying to pull and they did, and we're so grateful for that. I get to lead the State Grand Jury section in the Attorney General's Office. This particular case is not a State Grand Jury case. There are other indictments in our State Grand Jury. But the one thing about that is, is that I have an amazing team and I want to be clear, this was a team effort. You all saw all of these folks behind me doing amazing work. And I can't be prouder of a team in my life. We called this our Super Bowl, and not because of the media attention, but just because of the effort that we knew that we would have to put into this, and we didn't really get to watch much of the Super Bowl that went on because when we arrived, I think it was winter, and it feels like spring now. But every single member of this team, every single member of the State Grand Jury staff, what we do well is work together as a team in complex investigations and who we work with is my partners at SLED, and I can't thank them enough as well because we're used to working on these complex cases and working together. And I'm not leaving out Sheriff Hill and the Colleton County Sheriff's Office, and our Federal partners in Orangeburg and Charleston Sheriff's Office, and all the other agencies that have worked on this case. I also want to thank Miss Becky, if she's still up there, because she has been amazing. The clerk staff has been amazing. The Court staff has been amazing. The bailiffs have been amazing. And again, I also want to thank this community who really has embraced us, and has been so great to us and made us able to survive this process that has been long and arduous, and I have been sleeping, I had and I have been eating more than Kind bars every now and then. But -- and I'm sure that's a nice plug for Kind. But anyway, it really has been a great process. We will have sentencing tomorrow, obviously we're not going to comment on sentencing, because that's still pending. But justice was done today. It doesn't matter who your family is. It doesn't matter how much money you have or people think you have. It doesn't matter what you think how prominent you are, if you do wrong, if you break the law, if you murder, then justice will be done in South Carolina and I think South Carolina has shown the nation and the world how a process can work and work well.

And so therefore, I think that's what they had to clarify. Obviously, that wasn't enough.I think last thing, you know, Anderson, I think it came down to the credibility and the lack of trust.

Now, a Freudian slip confession, possibly, but I don't think that they should have really focused on that as being some massive confession of him because quite honestly, there is a couple of interpretations of it. And with a circumstantial evidence case, you have to be a little bit careful with the jury going beyond, and in fact, the permission they give you. They put together a very good case.
