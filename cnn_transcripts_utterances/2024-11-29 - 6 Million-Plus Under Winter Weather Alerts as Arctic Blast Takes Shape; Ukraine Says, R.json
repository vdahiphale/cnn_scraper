      "sentences": "Good morning. You were live in the scene of newsroom. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.This morning, more than 6 million people are under winter weather alerts. A surge of frigid air is expected to blanket much of the country, bringing the season's coldest temperatures to millions across the Northern and Central U.S. This is a live look over the Adirondack Mountains from Earth Cam (ph). That is absolutely beautiful. In the Great Lakes, the National Weather Service warns some areas could get paralyzing amounts of snow, heads up for that, potentially causing headaches for travelers trying to get home after Thanksgiving. Allison Chinchar joins us now. Allison, I could look at that picture of the Adirondacks all day. That was just absolutely breathtaking. But my goodness, it is frigid out there. I mean, it's cold all over.",

      "sentences": "You know what, Jim, I know you've got all those holiday, ugly Christmas sweaters tucked in your closet. You're just going to have to bring them all out this week. It's fine, perfect timing.Yes. I mean, you see scenes like that, and that wasn't the only place that had snow. Look at just these totals from the last 24 hours, portions of New York, Vermont and Maine, all picking up at least a foot of snow. But some areas this weekend could be measuring it in several feet. We're talking three to more than five feet of snow could fall in some of these areas through the end of the weekend. You're starting to see some of these lake effect bands already beginning to take place, not just in the Midwest, but also into the northeast. And its Lakes Ontario and Erie, that's where the biggest concern is for some of those extremely high amounts of snow that we've been talking about. You've got alerts out in place in several states here, but it's the lake effect warnings that are of greatest concern. In fact, the National Weather Service Buffalo office saying that for some of these areas around Watertown and the southern suburbs of Buffalo, yes, they could be looking at three to five feet of snow before it's all said and done. Again, that's likely going to cause major travel concerns along the roadways for a lot of these states going forward. And the reason for that lake effect is the combination. Those lakes are still very warm, but the air above them is about to get really cold. Now, that cold air is in place already across the Northern Plains, Fargo, the current temperature, zero. That feels like with that wind chill, minus 16. Minneapolis, it feels like it's minus two right now. But that cold air is going to continue to spread eastward and even pretty far south in the coming days. When I say south, I mean, all the way down to the Gulf Coast. That's where you several of these freeze alerts in place. Yes, as far south as Northern Florida going to be looking at those bitter cold temperatures. In fact, 70 percent of the U.S. population is expecting temperatures at or below next several days. And the unfortunate part too is it's not going to go away any time soon. Take Atlanta, for example, this is the next seven days. Every single one of those days, Jim, is going to have a temperature below normal. So, again, even though you get maybe a little bit warmer, you're still not going to get back to where you should be this time of year.",

So, this recall is impacting five states, like you said, involving more than 10,000 cartons of eggs. The supplier, Handsome Brook Farms, issued this recall of its organic pasture-raised 24-count eggs sold under the Kirkland Signature brand. And these eggs were distributed to Costco stores in Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee.What shoppers should look for, the recalled a cartons contain the best by date of January 5th. They also have that UPC number that you see there on the screen. So, that's what you want to look out for. And, Jim, the supplier said that these cartons were not supposed to be sent out to retailers. So, this does seem to have been a mistake. The concern here again is the possibility of salmonella contamination. That's why this recall is happening. If you do have these eggs at home, take them back to the store. Do not consume them. Jim?",

These latest strikes come after Russia again pounded Ukraine's power grid yesterday. A million homes were plunged into darkness, and rolling blackouts covered much of the country as the war grinds into its third winter.President-elect Trump has named his choice to serve as special envoy to Russia and Ukraine, retired General Keith Kellogg, a national security adviser in the first Trump administration. Months ago, Kellogg laid out his peace plan for the war, which may now become the diplomatic road map ahead. And joining me to talk about this, CNN Political and National Security Analyst David Sanger, who is also the White House national security correspondent for The New York Times and the author of New Cold Wars. China's Rise, Russia's Invasion and America's Struggle to Defend the West. First, David, what do you think of General Kellogg in that selection there?",

Like many Democrats and Republicans, but mostly Republicans, he's now moved to a, we need an armistice or some kind of cessation of fighting on the way to a bigger peace plan.Now, I actually think this makes sense but what they're going to have to get over Jim is the thought that, at the end of the day, the Russians will have gained maybe 20 percent of Ukraine, because you can have an armistice, but if it's like the one in between North and South Korea from 1953, you know, the North gained territory from it.",

The fact of the matter is that the president has indicated pretty clearly here that what he's interested in is a deal. He's not interested in sharp lines around what were the territorial boundaries of Ukraine. And that's a difference.And, you know, in many ways, Jim, it's a deep ideological difference, because President Biden, and he repeated this in a statement yesterday after the pounding attacks on the Ukrainian grid that you were describing, basically said, we're with Ukraine all the way and Russia cannot emerge from this a winner. And in an armistice, Russia may well end up getting, you know, a good bit of territory, not what they wanted, which was the whole country. And the fear, of course, that's what comes later.",

Thousands of people who fled the south are trying to get back home despite warnings from both the Israeli and Lebanese militaries that it may just be too soon.As for Gaza, no let up there. A photojournalist captured the moment when an Israeli airstrike hit a building in Nuseirat, an area of the enclave where several refugee camps are located. Reuters reports at least 40 Palestinians died in Gaza following airstrikes overnight, most of them in Nuserat. On Israeli television today, when asked if he's ready to end the war in Gaza, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he was not ready for that. CNN's Jeremy Diamond joins me now from Tel Aviv. Jeremy, let's start with those pictures from Nuseirat. What can you tell us about that attack?",

And this is notable for a couple of reasons, first of which is that the main fighting in Gaza over the last several weeks now has concentrated in Northern Gaza.This Nuseirat refugee camp is in Central Gaza. And yesterday, it appears that Israeli tanks entered a part of that city. Today, they withdrew from at least a portion of that city, according to local officials, but the fighting, still appears to be ongoing. According to Al-Awda Hospital, at least 31 people were killed and brought to that hospital, 127 others were indeed injured. And it just shows that, you know, 14 months into this war, the fighting is still very much continuing and so is, of course, the dying, not only by bombs and bullets but also as we are seeing the humanitarian crisis in Gaza continuing to worsen. In the northern part of the Gaza Strip, UNRWA has said that 82 of 91 U.N. trucks that they have tried to send to Northern Gaza have been denied entry by the Israeli military. In Central Gaza, we are also watching as the humanitarian situation is worsening due to a lack of supplies that are getting into the Gaza Strip, bakeries shutting down now in Central Gaza. But before they did, long lines at those bakeries triggered stampede several times this week. Today, there were two women who were killed in a stampede in Central Gaza, just showing the absolute desperation that is playing out in the Gaza Strip. Jim?",
