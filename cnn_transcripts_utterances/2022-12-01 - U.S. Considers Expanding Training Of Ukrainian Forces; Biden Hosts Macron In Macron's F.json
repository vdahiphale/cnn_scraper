Tonight, the U.S. considers dramaticallyexpanding its training of Ukrainian forces, as Russia's brutal assault on Ukraine's energy infrastructure continues. Then, President Biden hosts Emmanuel Macron in his first state visit. We'll have all the details on that for you. Plus, a race scandal threatens to overshadow the Prince and Princess of Wales trip to the U.S. I will be speaking to Ngozi Fulani; the charity worker questioned about her heritage at Buckingham Palace. That is happening later in the show. But first tonight, Russia is pushing ahead with its brutal war on Ukraine's critical energy infrastructure. Heavy shelling knocked out power for the already-battered, of course, city of Kherson. Ukrainian officials are restoring electricity for residents, but the attacks there killed at least one person. Further north, in Zaporizhzhia, to be exact, Ukraine's state energy company has imposed more emergency power outages until there's basically enough supply. And the mayor of Kyiv is telling residents to stock up -- stock up on water as well as food and warm clothing in case Russian attacks do cause a total blackout. Well, the White House, meanwhile, is considering a dramatic expansion in the training of the U.S. forces give to Ukrainian troops. It would be, of course, a significant boost, not simply in the number of Ukrainians that the U.S. military will train, but in the type of training they will receive. Natasha Bertrand joins me from Washington. So Natasha, talk me through this training program. It's a signi -- a significant move -- pardon me, by the United States. But what more can you tell us and how soon, Natasha, will this start?",

Still waiting a final sign off by certain senior officials. But essentially, what this proposal would see is the U.S. training as many as 2,500 Ukrainian troops in Germany per month. And that is a big expansion of the amount of troops that we've seen to date being trained by the Americans in Europe. About a couple thousand only to date since the conflict began, have been trained by the Americans there. So, this would be a big expansion of the training that they're doing. And it would also be a training in more sophisticated battlefield tactics. So, to date, again, the U.S. really has only been training Ukrainians really primarily on specific weapons systems. Training that, of course, they need in order to use all these new systems that they're getting from the U.S. and the West, right? But now, this would include more sophisticated kind of battlefield tactics, including combined arms training. So things like combining, you know, infantry maneuvers with artillery support.

That press conference just wrapped up, and what you heard from the twopresidents, particularly on the issue of Ukraine, which there's no question that, that was obviously the central focus of  this meeting between the two presidents. You're seeing more alignment, frankly, than we've seen over the last couple of months. There was a sense that perhaps there was a bit of a divergence between the French president, who is eager to -- you know, who has maintained this back channel with the Russian president, who has been eager to push Ukraine towards the negotiated solution. And the United States, which has made very clear from the beginning that it was not going to pressure Ukraine to rush to the negotiating table before they were ready. What has happened in the last few weeks before this meeting is that you've heard Ukraine express more willingness, including a 12-point plan for the conditions and the types of negotiations that they would be willing to engage in. And what you heard from the French president today was an acknowledgment of that. And saying, essentially, the same thing that the U.S. has been saying, which is that, you know, we are not going to pressure Ukraine to accept conditions that are unacceptable for themselves. And President Biden, for his part, he said that, look, he has no plans to speak with the Russian president at this time. He doesn't see the value of that, given the way that Putin has been conducting his brutal campaign in Ukraine. But he did say that if the time came, where Vladimir Putin comes to his senses and essentially is looking for a way to end this war, that he would be willing to sit down with him. But he would do so not alone, but in consultation with the French president and with the United States' NATO allies. There was also some discussion, of course, of this one issue that has been a point of contention between the two on the Inflation Reduction Act. These electric vehicle subsidies that benefit only vehicles that are made in North America. President Biden tried to defuse the tension there a little bit, saying that it was never the intention to hurt Europe, and that there's going to be these ongoing discussions with the European Union to try and find a way to minimize any detrimental impact that, that might have on industry in Europe. But overall, obviously, this was a moment for the two leaders to celebrate the historic alliance between these two countries, and also this partnership that I am told by both French and American officials has really grown a lot closer, in particular, through the coordination that they have had in confronting this war in Ukraine. And, of course, that partnership, that (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) as we say will be on display, certainly this evening as well, as they sit down together for the state dinner.",

Everything from defense coordination, the economy, space, cyberspace, all of these -- and so, today was about reaffirming that they plan to continue to coordinate their approaches on all of these issues. And of course, the China issue is certainly one that it didn't come up in this press conference, but I am told that it was going to be a major point of discussion between the two leaders. President Biden had only just recently met with Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the G20 in Bali. And President Macron, he's expected to make his first visit to Beijing sometime early next year.

And in an increasing number of cities, local Chinese health officials arelifting lockdown restrictions, seeming to respond to widespread protests and public demands to end zero COVID policies. CNN's Ivan Watson is following developments for us from Hong Kong. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) IVAN WATSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera):  We're seeing a shift in tone from the Chinese government when it comes to its strict zero COVID policy. And this comes after the biggest wave of protests that this country has seen, really, in a generation, with ordinary Chinese people pushing back at the strict lockdowns, the restrictions, the mass testing of the zero COVID policy. Here is a statement coming from China's Vice Premier Sun Chunlan, who says, quote, \"with the decreasing toxicity of the Omicron variant, the increasing vaccination rate and the accumulating experience of outbreak, control and prevention, China's pandemic containment faces a new stage and mission.\" So, let's look at the city of Guangzhou. Tuesday night, some pretty fierce confrontations between angry residents and riot police in white hazmat suits. The very next day, the city government issues this video, showing people celebrating the removal of barricades that had been imposed as part of the lockdown, trying to send a message that things may be getting better. But it does appear to be piecemeal. For example, another city in the northeast, Jinzhou, its leaders saying that they will not be easing restrictions. They think that they can completely snuff out the COVID virus. There have been no images of the protests that have gone on throughout the week in different cities across the country, on Chinese state media. Instead, we've seen somber crowds lining the streets of Shanghai, bidding farewell to former Chinese leader, Jiang Zemin, who was flown, afforded all honors to the Chinese capital, met by the current Chinese leader, Xi Jinping. This is a moment of mourning for the entire country, and it will also be important to see how the authorities will respond to people who may want to gather together to hold vigils for their former leader. We're seeing a wave of nostalgia on the heavily-censored Chinese internet, with some people pointing out that they felt more free during Jiang Zemin's time in office than they do now in zero-COVID China.

They say they've arrested several suspects. But we have been here before. I mean, several protesters, young women, young men, have been killed over the past couple of months of these protests. Every time we hear the authorities denying any involvement and saying they're investigating, we also heard from the United Nations, saying that these investigations lack credibility. Really so, it is very difficult for anyone to take them seriously when they are not independent and impartial, as we've heard from U.N. officials in recent weeks as well. What we do know, Isa, from human rights monitor based in Norway, Iran Human Rights, as well as activists, they say the 27-year-old Samak was out, like many other Iranians, on the streets, early hours on Wednesday, celebrating their national team's defeat at the World Cup because, you know, as we've discussed before, for many Iranians who are opposed to the regime, that defeat is the regime's defeat. They felt that the Iranian government had taken away football from them, had hijacked this team for its own propaganda purposes. So we saw these surreal scenes of people celebrating the defeat. You know, Isa, we've been trying to get more information about the details of what happened. There are some reports he was out in the car with his fiancee when he was shot in the head. He was honking his horn when he was shot. Very difficult for us to get this information because the Iranian regime, as we've discussed so many times over the past two months, has made it very, very difficult to get information from people on the ground. It's very dangerous for anyone to speak with the international media and of course, we're not allowed to report from inside Iran. But we are continuing to try and get more details, Isa. So many Iranians are heartbroken over the news of his tragic death. They believe that Mehran Samak is the latest in a list of victims of this crackdown that seems to be increasing by the day.",
