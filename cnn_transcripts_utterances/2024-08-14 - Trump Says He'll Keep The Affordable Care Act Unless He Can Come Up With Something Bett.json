A top Harris ally, Senator Mark Kelly, is here. And with just days to go before that convention, Vice President Harris is still rising in the polls, tonight. Our favorite CNN data guru says it looks like it's for real. And this story that has so many people talking tonight, a grieving husband suing Disney, over his wife's death, but the theme park says he can't, because he once signed up for a Disney+ free trial. We have new reaction from Disney, tonight. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. It was supposed to be a big speech on the economy. At least that's how it was touted anyway. But Donald Trump pulled a Donald Trump, for the third time in a week, veering off message, this time, in North Carolina, a state that I should note, he won by a single percentage point in 2020. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Now they are putting her on the covers of Time Magazine. Her running mate, he wants tampons in boys' bathrooms. What happened to her laugh? That's the laugh of a crazy person. This incompetent socialist lunatic. The worst vice president in history. Kamala.

The news conference that happened at Mar-a-Lago, last Thursday. And now we are told we are expecting another press conference, tomorrow. Perhaps the former President will talk about what we saw him do earlier today. This is worth noting. He voted early, in his home state of Florida. That comes after Donald Trump recently likened early voting to stealing the vote, and has had mixed messages on it throughout his campaign. Our lead source, tonight, is Arizona senator, Mark Kelly, who was on Harris' vice presidential shortlist, and is a close ally of her campaign. And Senator, it's great to have you here tonight. Because this was obviously and apparently meant to be a kind of a prebuttal to the economic speech that Harris is going to be giving, in North Carolina, on Friday. And given today, Trump claimed that she was going to copy his economic plan. How specific do you want her to be on Friday? SEN. MARK KELLY (D-AZ): Well, I expect her to be rather specific and focus on the issues that matter to the American people. I mean, we don't get that from Donald Trump, like ever. I mean, he is focused on name-calling, saying things that people don't understand. His speech is now sometimes slurred, and he's very hard to follow. And the amount of excitement that's behind the Harris-Walz campaign is just off the charts. Gabby and I were in Glendale, just on Friday, and got to experience that. And there's a tremendous amount of energy. But I listened very closely to what she had to say. And Kamala Harris is about taking this country forward.

It has had a dramatic and negative effect on health care for women, here. I've got two daughters and a granddaughter, who now have fewer rights than my mother or grandmother did. So what's -- this is an opportunity to restore those rights. Now, is it going to affect who shows up and votes? I hope so. I mean, I think Democrats are probably going to show up at a higher rate. But statewide elections, in Arizona, and this is a statewide election, just like my Senate race, governor's race, the presidential, they tend to be very close. So, we have a lot of work to do.

That's why she was behind the Inflation Reduction Act that helped bring down the price of prescription drugs for seniors. Insulin at $35 a month. Insulin used to cost American families hundreds and hundreds of dollars a month. And it's because of her leadership that the American people have more affordable prescription drugs, especially seniors. Out-of-pocket expenses are coming down to $2,000 a year. Donald Trump wants to take that away from the American people. Not only is he -- talks specifically about the Inflation Reduction Act, and why he wants to repeal it.

This is what he did during COVID, in 2020, when he would repeatedly talk about how great the economy it was, how great it was, how great it was, how unfair this all is. OK. Well, but now you have a different future in front of you, and you have to deal with that. And they are wasting time. He is wasting time, I should say.

Vance has been actually performing, not just the way that they had hoped that he would, in terms of being an attack dog, which is what the VP nominee is supposed to do, historically. But he's actually delivering a more coherent message than Trump is, about Harris, and about returning to the days of Trump, which polls generally show that voters liked aspects of, liked the economic message.

The reason I raise that poll is for her to be winning now, on the economy? That was what Trump had as his like major, major advantage, over Biden, the pocketbook, the kitchen table.

You'll recall, a few years ago, there's a 2-year-old child that died because they were attacked -- eaten by an alligator. Bob Iger put out a statement, immediately. He called the family, immediately. They were very public about it. What can we do? This happened within Disney Springs, which is obviously a resort that's owned by Disney. And so, Disney's thinking about this in a way that's a little bit separate. OK, this isn't our exact park. This is a restaurant that gets to exist on our park, but we don't own, and we don't operate it. And I think that's why they think that they can have this level of separation. Problem, Kaitlan, though, is that from a PR perspective, the average person doesn't really know or care about that distinction, right? All the headlines right now, all they say is that this woman died in Disney, and Disney is giving their family a hard time, about $50,000.",

It applied, right -- because the lawsuit is technically being brought by the wife's estate. So, how does a spouse waive the wife's estate's right to pursue this?And by the way, these arbitration clauses generally are enforced by courts. But they will ask, is this completely unfair? This is what the lawyers call unconscionable. Is it ambiguous? Is it clear? And I think there's a pretty good argument.

The reason why Disney is arguing that the Disney+ agreement should apply to this situation is because the plaintiff is arguing that Disney is responsible, in part, because they list this restaurant vendor on one of their websites. So, they're arguing that if you're going to come to us, and allege that the website relationship is the problem, we're going to hand it right back at you, and our website and app T&amp;A is what you're agreeing to here. Now, where I think it's fuzzy is to say website and app. I mean, signing up for Disney+, to me, feels very different than the website itself.",
