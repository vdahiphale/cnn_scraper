And his team argued that he was referring to an economic bloodbath, that this was about the auto industry. Take a listen to how Donald Trump put it.

He referred to those convicted on January 6th or for their role January 6th, as hostages, something we have heard him do before. But given both of those comments, he did receive a lot of criticism, not just from Democrats and the Biden campaign who did jump on those remarks and that rhetoric, but also from past allies, people like his former vice president, Mike Pence, who very much took issue with how Donald Trump was characterizing his use of the term \"hostages,\" referring to what he argued was not appropriate language given there are American hostages still in Gaza.

They've been very vague about what he would do regarding an abortion ban or if he would institute one at all because they recognize it's not -- it doesn't play it politically well, particularly with Republicans.And throughout the primary and over last year, Donald Trump, unlike his other Republican primary challengers, really refused to weigh in. He's been towing this line of saying, yes, I was the one who installed the three very conservative Supreme Court justices who ultimately helped overturn Roe versus Wade. And that's kind of throwing red meat to the pro-life wing of the party. But he's also been very careful in saying that he wants exceptions, that he thinks the issue is a political loser. And so it's interesting to see whether or not he will actually come out with a potential ban or a more clear policy on abortion given he is now in general election campaign mode. And he, as well as his team, recognizes that this is an issue that could really alienate a lot of the key voting blocs that he's going for, particularly suburban women and women across the country who see this issue as not something that they want to support.

Look now, Joe Biden is still leads, but these margins have shrunk significantly, been cut by more than half in Arizona, 11 points, being cut by a third of where the lead was back in 2020, it's just an eight-point advantage for Joe Biden.And this is what we have seen as well nationally. Joe Biden's polling numbers among blacks and Hispanics have dropped significantly, and that is a big reason why in these two states Arizona and Nevada, his poll numbers have become significantly worse.",

Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, make up less than 10 percent of the vote. So that dropped that you've seen with Biden among Hispanic voters, if they're going to be felt anywhere, it's going to be a Nevada and Arizona.

So if Biden and loses Arizona and Nevada, he likely must win at least three of these four, again, those six closest swing states -- Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Now, Biden could do it if he won Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, he barely get to 270.Here's the issue right now. Biden seems to trailing not just in Georgia, but in Michigan as well. And if he loses these two John, I can't find a map that would work for him. So it's simple math at this point. Biden is behind an Arizona. He's behind in Nevada. He's behind and Georgia. He's behind in Michigan. And if that map holds, ballgame over. Most likely Donald Trump wins.",

There had been at least five in-flight incidents involving United Airlines this past month. And in this new message, United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby says, while all these incidents are unrelated, that these incidents have the airline's attention and have sharpened our focus.The latest incident was on Friday. United Boeing 737 800 landed in Medford, Oregon, with a belly panel missing. This was first discovered by somebody on the ground when the plane pulled up to the gate. United said this did not affect the flying characteristics of the plane, so this was not known by the pilots, and they did not declare an emergency. United says all of the incidents this month are under review now. A hydraulic fluid incident trailing one of its 777s leaving Sydney, a United 777 losing that wheel takeoff from San Francisco, a 737 Max-8 skidding off the runway in Houston. Here's what the airline is doing. It's adding an extra day of pilot training starting in May. It's also redesigning training for new hire mechanics. United says it will so put more resources into managing its parts supplier network because the question investigators will want to know is whether or not some of these incidents are maintenance induced. Kirby says the incidents are reminders of the importance of safety, but no doubt that customers have taken note. The good news here, Sara, nobody was hurt in any of these incidents.",
