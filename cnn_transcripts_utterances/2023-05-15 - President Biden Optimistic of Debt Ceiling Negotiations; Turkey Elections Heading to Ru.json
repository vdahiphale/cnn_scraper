We're live in Ankara with the latest details. Plus, the U.S. border crisis, you will meet a Venezuelan mother separated from her family after crossing into Texas and hear her agonizing quest to find them. And thanks for joining us. It is a new week in Washington, which means we are another day closer to the U.S. defaulting on trillions of dollars of debt. Talks between the White House and Congress have caused tempers to flare, but now sources tell CNN the temperature could be just right for bargaining. U.S. President Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy have been mostly at odds during the process. The president is set to meet with congressional leaders on Tuesday to discuss the discussion or continue the discussion, I should say, and he thinks a deal is within reach. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The markets I think still believe that in the end, political leadership on both sides of the aisle will not drive the U.S., and potentially the global economy, off a cliff in a completely, you know, self-forced error. But compared to 2011, the Republican caucus in the House that is driving this confrontation is further to the right, the majority is smaller, and the speaker is even weaker.

You can obviously pummel it with television. You can meet a surprising number of voters. So, Iowa does give you a chance to get off the mat.I mean, the challenge is, if you can think about who doesn't like Trump in the Republican Party? It's heavily tilted towards voters with a college degree who find his cultural grievance and his belligerent persona excessive. DeSantis's problem is that he based his whole candidacy really so far on being Trump-ism without Trump, and by signing a six-week abortion ban, by being so absolutist on the permit- less carry a gun, and by having this sustained war with Disney in Florida is where (inaudible) goes to die and all of that. It's not clear that he is really much more acceptable to those college educated Republicans who are more economic conservative voters than Trumpist.

But he also argued there is still much more work to do.And that includes Congress acting on Comprehensive Immigration Reform. Something that we have not seen any tangible of movement towards in recent months. But what you've heard from the administration today is them really defending their policies and also arguing that the policies and plans that they've put in place for months and the warnings that they've been sending out to migrants that that has led to these lower encounters at the border. Take a listen to what the Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said on CNN. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS, U.S. HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY: We have communicated very clearly a vitally important message to the individuals who are thinking of arriving at our southern border. There is a lawful, safe and orderly way to arrive in the United States. That is through the pathways that President Biden has expanded in an unprecedented way. And then there's a consequence if one does not use those lawful pathways. (END VIDEO CLIP) SANEZL Now, Mayorkas also said it's too early to say whether there has been a peak yet in the surge of migrants. But, of course, there are other challenges facing this administration amid the lifting of Title 42 including capacity issues at those CBP facilities. Arlette Saenz, CNN, the White House.",
