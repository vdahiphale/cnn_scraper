It's a very large Walmart, and police officials say they couldn't really give us information even on the number of people dead and injured for several hours, because they had to go through this store, you know, row by row of rows of merchandise, counters, things like that to see if anyone was hiding so that they could make sure that they accounted for everyone.

Police say that one person was killed, a 16-year-old, at this location. And more than 19 others have been injured. Now Israeli police are calling this a coordinated terrorist attack. They said the bags were placed here, and then they were detonated remotely. We have been here all morning. We've seen police collecting evidence. They've already cleared the scene, but part of the evidence we saw them collecting was what looked like nails and screws and ball bearings. And I want to show you just some of the damage to the bus station sign. You can see the impact of this blast. I'll show you right here. This is one of the signs for the bus station. You can just see all of those impact markings. Now, police do believe that there were nails, ball bearings, and screws. And that is what EMTs have told us are part of the injuries that they are seeing. Now, this has already been a very deadly and violent year for both Israelis and Palestinians. But an attack like this, bombs like this have not been seen in Jerusalem, or in Israel, for years. And for many people, it's bringing back memories of the Intifadas. And there is a big fear that these types of bombs, that we may be seeing more of them coming forward and that there may be more copycat explosions. So far, no militant group has taken credit. Hamas, though, the militant group that runs the Gaza Strip, has praised the attack. What we know also is that the Israeli police are still searching for the suspect.
