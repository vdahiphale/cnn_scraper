We are standing by for that decision. And later skyrocketing influence, how the richest man on earth is using his leverage to impact the second Trump presidency. Good morning. You are live in the CNN Newsroom. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington. We begin the hour with President-elect Donald Trump adding four more loyalists to his list of expected cabinet and administration position. CNN's Alayna Treene joins us now. Alayna, we're expecting Florida Congressman and former Green Beret Mike Waltz to be national security adviser, Senator Marco Rubio to be tapped as secretary of state. Some surprises out there. Take us through these picks.",

      "sentences": "That's right. We have seen a flurry of new announcements over the last 24 hours. Jim, it's very clear that Donald Trump is trying to move swiftly to fill out the top roles of his administration. Now, one thing that is very clear throughout all of these hires from what we saw last week with Susie Wiles being named chief of staff to Stephen Miller, now deputy chief of staff, and now these newest roles with Mike Waltz's national security adviser, Marco Rubio, secretary of state, and Kristi Noem as DHS Secretary. All of them have one thing in common, and that is their loyalty to Donald Trump.And the one thing I consistently continue to hear in my conversations, with those involved in the transition process, and those who are talking to Donald Trump about this regularly, is that his number one priority is filling out these top roles with people who will be yes men, who will not hold him back and who are likeminded on his agenda. Now, interesting, I want to start with Marco Rubio, because not long ago we remember those days of him mocking him as a Little Rubio or a Little Marco, I should say. That is very much changed though. They have patched up their relationship. Remember, Rubio was on the short list for Donald Trump's V.P. And they really have become close allies over the last several months and throughout his campaign. Now, I think one thing that's very clear when you take into account Rubio and Waltz and their roles in this kind of national security space is that they are both going to be very tough on China. And some other areas where Rubio and Donald Trump align as well are they're tough on Iran, they have very similar views on funding for Ukraine. And so this is really a role that Donald Trump wanted, someone who was going to carry out his top policy goals. Now, one thing to note as well for the secretary of state pick is that, first of all, it's not clear that Donald Trump has offered Rubio this role as of now. However, we can say that, you know, yesterday morning, Donald Trump was kind of toying between Rubio and Rick Grenell, his former ambassador to Germany, as well as intelligence adviser in the first administration. We're told that, you know, starting off the day, he was actually leaning toward Grenell. But then after having many conversations with allies and other people who were meeting with him yesterday, he decided to go with Rubio. Now, I do want to talk about Noem as well, because she's another person who was on a shortlist for V.P. that changed after there was that scandal over her book when she detailed killing her 14-month-old dog Cricket, but she is also someone who is going to be very loyal to Trump. Trump wanted someone at the top of DHS to be someone who would have his back and would not hold him back from carrying out his immigration agenda. And keep in mind as well with Miller now as deputy chief of staff for policy, Tom Homan as the border czar, a lot of these decisions on immigration policy are actually going to be coming from the White House. So, the three of them will be working together on his immigration agenda. Jim?",

      "sentences": "Well, Jim, we'll be waiting another week, at least, for this answer from Judge Juan Merchan, who oversaw Trump's criminal trial earlier this year, where he was of course convicted on 34 counts of falsifying business records. The judge had given himself until today to decide.The Supreme Court's decision earlier this year, granting Trump immunity for actions he took in office, whether that applied to this conviction, because there were pieces of evidence that could be construed as official acts, including conversations that he had with some of his staffers that were introduced as evidence. So, the judge said, look, I'm giving myself until today to decide whether the Supreme Court's decision means that this conviction should be tossed. But while we were waiting for that decision, we learned that, in fact, they are giving it another week before the judge decides on this issue. Now, sources tell me that prosecutors and defense attorneys have been discussing this over the past few days and they mutually agreed to wait delay this deadline so that Trump's lawyers will have additional time to make new arguments based on the fact that their client is now the president-elect. Sources tell me that they will argue that as president-elect, Trump is entitled to constitutional protection from state actors, that would include state judges, a sentencing in this case. They have tried successfully twice now to get this sentencing delayed, but here they want it completely canceled based on his status as president-elect and prosecutors agreed to give them time to make those arguments. Now, prosecutors will also have a response to that. So, based on these documents that we have obtained, the conversations went back and forth for several days and they agreed and the judge granted this request. So, it will be at least another week until we get a decision from Judge Juan Merchan about whether he may toss this conviction based on the Supreme Court's immunity ruling or potentially just nicks the sentencing altogether because Trump is now the president-elect. So, again, all eyes are on Judge Juan Merchan a week from now to determine if President-elect Trump will be sentenced on this conviction.",

What are youy thoughts on this, Kara? I mean, I guess we're going to have to wait one more week. That's ultimately what we're talking about right now. But, I mean, this is a big decision for Judge Merchan, and I suppose that's perhaps why he wants some more time.",

      "sentences": "Yes, it is a big decision. It's also going to be very critical to see what position the district attorney's office takes.As Trump's team has alluded to, they're going to make arguments that the state judge should not have anything to do with a president-elect. And the deadline here is really something to watch because we've now pushed this out one more week, but that gets us one more week to inauguration day. So, the calendar is shrinking as far as what kinds of decisions can be made here. Now, the state is, you know, possible that they will agree that the former president cannot be sentenced in this case until he's out of office. It's possible they may take another position that the judge should still move forward with this ruling on immunity and that the president-elect can continue to appeal that while he's in office because an appeal is largely work that's left to the attorneys. It doesn't take too much of the president's attention. But this is certainly a big decision for this judge there. You can see they're being very methodical and how they're doing this. He's giving them just one week to come back and reassess and tell him what they want them to do. The judge is behaving in the way that he is not being an activist here. He's letting the parties tell them what that they think he should do in this case, what they want to agree to in this case. Certainly, a big decision here and, you know, a big question again for the D.A.'s office of are they willing to be satisfied with a conviction looming in the air? So, taking that as a win as it stands right now and not having the judge rule on whether this case stands as it is, or if he does set aside the conviction in light of the Supreme Court's decision, you know, or will they try to move forward? Given the tight timetable here, though, it seems very unlikely that the president-elect will be sentenced before he gets into the White House, but the judge here asking both sides for guidance on how they want to move forward with this in light of the election results and the timetable that we have here after Trump's team has successfully pushed off this sentencing twice and now this being the third time, Jim.",

Well, his lawyers have argued that some of the evidence that was introduced during this trial would constitute an official act, specifically conversations that he had with some of his staffers, specifically Hope Hicks. So, they argue that that evidence should not have come in a trial and the whole conviction should be tossed.But prosecutors say, look, that was a very tiny part of the case. The case did not rest on the testimony of Hope Hicks or other junior staffers. So, this conviction should hold. And sources, you know, familiar with the Trump legal strategy tell me they always knew this was a long shot, but it is a fair argument to make, Jim. Just it's a Supreme Court case, it doesn't mean that it doesn't apply to state cases, especially when we're talking about the executive branch. But last week, we broke the story that the Trump team was going to try a completely new avenue in the Manhattan criminal case to try to get this sentencing not just delayed but canceled, that they would make these new constitutional arguments, and that's exactly what we're seeing happening here. They had conversations with prosecutors over the weekend, and they mutually agreed to give the Trump team and the prosecutors a little bit of additional time to address this new issue of the fact that the conviction applies to someone who is now the president-elect and there may be legal considerations that mean he cannot be sentenced.",

But it's actually removals over the course of many months and many years.

So, you could probably utilize and repurpose some of those to detain these individuals. As I think another guest mentioned, when you detain someone, you've got to put them in order to remove them.So, there is going to be some logistical challenges to doing this, but over time you can scale up and you can utilize existing facilities around the country to do this too.",

And even if you look at those populations alone, that's a historic number of deportations or removals.I think when you look at children, President Trump in 2018 and 2019, signed an executive order saying keeping families together is his priority, and I assume it will be in the second term as well. So, I think there's some innovative solutions that you can implement here. But I think the important part is that you're not going to exempt any individual or class of individuals, which we have seen over the last three to four years, which has caused this crisis. When you exempt families or you exempt children from removal or repatriation, that just encourages more and more to come. So, you have to prioritize.
