They say, officials say, that energy facilities are one of the primary targets in this wave of strikes.We understand, as you mentioned, that in the capital Kyiv, there the mayor saying around 15 percent of the city is without power. We have seen this before, right, Rosemary, continuation of that strategy from the Kremlin to really attack energy facilities, and leave the people of Kyiv, and other areas far from the front lines without basic necessities, without power or running water. So were seeing that play out now on the ground, you also pointed out the attack on Lviv, that's significant by our count, it seems there hasn't been any deaths in Lviv since April of last year. That's very much a place that has been considered a safe haven. But today, a residential area in that city of Lviv struck at least five people killed so far, officials still working at the scene of the site, that residential area, to try and recover people, try to help people who have been impacted by that attack. And then separately, of course, in this wave of attacks, I have to mention the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. Ukrainian officials say it has been disconnected from Ukraine's power grid, now in blackout mode, that nuclear power plant, this is the sixth time that has happened in this conflict. There is always a huge amount of concern, of course, when we are talking about the nuclear power plant that's very much on the front lines of this conflict. So, for now, the country officials' families all scrambling, some taking shelter, and we're still getting more and more updates by the hour when it comes to what is impacted by this barrage of Russian missiles this morning, again.",
