Former President Donald Trump taking the spotlight last night to formally accept his party's nomination for the third time. In a marathon, 90-plus minutes speech, Trump recounted the assassination attempts simultaneously calling for unity and airing out many familiar grievances. But while energetic Trump's supporters chanted \"fight, fight, fight\", for their nominee, President Joe Biden's allies are pushing him to lay down his arms and pass the torch. By the hour, the list of lawmakers calling for Biden to in his camp campaign gets longer adding from both the House and the Senate, including two senators facing tough reelections, Montana's Jon Tester and New Mexico's Martin Heinrich. And in a new op-ed in \"The Boston Globe\", Congressman Seth Moulton, who's already called for Biden's exit added an alarming detail on why. He wrote, quote, I saw him in a small group at Normandy for the 80th anniversary of D-Day. For the first time, he did not seem to recognize me. I have to admit that what I saw in Normandy was part of a deeper problem. Now publicly, the Biden campaign is charging ahead, but behind the scenes, is he listening to those calls? Camila DeChalus joining us now from the White House with more. Camila, is there any sense that Biden is moving toward a different decision than he's already proclaimed. Publicly, which is that he's staying in this race?",

Now, just even today, he put out a statement saying that he looksforward to hitting the campaign trail again next week as he spends this week in Rehoboth recovering from COVID. And even you had his campaign advisors and his campaign team putting out statements and just really reiterating that last night RNC's convention has just reiterated and restraints then and re-energized Biden's commitment to moving forward in this race. Now I want to play, take a quick listen to one of his campaign chair, who really reiterated this message about why Biden is committed to staying in this race. Take a listen.

And so, what you're going to see in the next upcoming days is the Biden's campaign team is really going to be making these calls to elected officials to lawmakers, to governments and governors and really reiterating this message about why they should stand behind Biden at this time, and why they should support his efforts to be reelected for a second term.",

Just a reminder, it wasn't just Donald Trump talking about committee or giving some clues that he wanted to talk about God and divine intervention. The campaign really doubled down on this idea that Donald Trump was a changed man, that this assassination attempt had changed the entire way he thought, that he tore up his previous speech, and so that he could focus on unity. And instead, what we saw was that, that was correct.But for about 15 minutes of a nearly 90-plus minutes speech and what we heard after those 15 minutes was really just Donald Trump. It was exactly what I here every single time I go to a campaign rally and those around him who were hoping for this message, message of unity, did not get it. Now, in terms of what that actually means, moving and forward, I don't think it shifts the needle all that much because the truth is, the Republican Party has completely coalesce around the former president. If they wanted to hear something about unity, if they thought this could help them with these middle of the road voters, that's not going to change the fact that Republicans in general are 100 percent all-in for Donald Trump. But when you talk to his campaign a lot of what they're doing is deflecting because they see what's happening right now in the Democratic Party. And they feel like they're not really the story right now, and they're doing well and they're just waiting to see what happens with Joe Biden before they move forward with their campaign.",

And part of it is because they are quite pleased with the record that he's had as president, there was a lot of suspicion, obviously, of what kind of presidency he would have. And Bernie Sanders was one of his opponents, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez endorsed Bernie Sanders against him, but they have by and large been pretty pleased with what Biden has gotten done.

The question that Democrats have is they think about that speech and all the things that Donald Trump said in it, talking about mass deportations, talking about Hannibal Lecter, the election conspiracies, calling COVID the China virus again, a lot of it -- the real red meat for his rally crowds, but not the unification message that we were told that he was going to be coming out is whether Democrats look at that and say, okay, Joe Biden is the way to go and take that on or that -- that guy its so vulnerable politically in the minds of some Democrats and so dangerous in the minds of many Democrats that they need to have someone other than Joe Biden be the one to take him on.",

And it's a pretty remarkable shift within the Republican Party that has made that such a key issue for so many years. What does that say to you that that wasn't even brought up?BARRON-LOPEZ:  It's not really surprising that it wasn't brought up because of the fact that Republicans have struggled since the fall of Roe v. Wade to, essentially, unify behind one message on abortion. You know, some Republicans will admit they're like the dog that caught the car and they -- yes, Donald Trump has said that he doesn't necessarily support a national abortion ban, but there are a lot of Republicans across his party that do, and Donald Trump has also said that he'd leave it up to the states to decide what to do when it comes to abortion, no matter how restrictive those states might pursue, a policy when it comes to abortion access. And so, that also in addition to Project 2025 and the extremism, that Isaac was talking about, abortion is something that at the end of this week, Biden's campaign really feels like they can go hard on against Donald Trump and against his vice presidential pick, J.D. Vance, because J.D. Vance in the past has questioned whether or not there should even be exceptions for rape or incest for a woman who might seek an abortion.

      "sentences": "Yeah, Jessica, we're seeing investigators tried to build a profile of the shooter as they struggled to pin down a motive for why he fired shots at Donald Trump at that rally on Saturday.And look, they're having to rely a lot on whether finding in the shooter cell phone in his web history and that's because unlike other mass shooters that we've seen in the past, who have left a manifesto that are clearly explained, left something behind the explained why they did what they did. The shooter in this case is largely left nothing forcing investigators to really piece together what they can about his mindset based on some of the evidence and the circumstantial evidence on his cell phone and on his web history. And one of the things that were learning that investigators have found is that prior to the shooting, the shooter was researching Evan Crumbley. You might remember Evan Crumbley. He was the mass shooter who killed several of his classmates back in 2021 in Michigan the shooter in this case, the Trump shooter, was also researching Crumbley's parents. Crumbley's parents were all so indicted and convicted in relation to their son's shooting. It's an interesting sort of example for the shooter in this Trump rally case to be researching. It's also consistent with what we have seen from mass shooter types in the past, sort of shooters researching other shooters. But look, other pieces of evidence are raising questions about what a potential motive could have been. We know that the shooter was researching not just Trump, prior to the rally, but was also researching things like the date and location of the Democratic National Convention, which is obviously going to be an August, researching that Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, and then also future Trump rallies as well. So, you know, really demonstrating that he wasn't picky when it came to his interest in a variety of different political figures. And that is why there's this emerging theory amongst law enforcement based on what our sources are telling us that this shooter was maybe more concerned with just carrying out a mass shooting and that the Trump rally in Pennsylvania was more of a an event of convenience rather than a targeted killing of Donald Trump himself or political or ideological reasons. But the same time, law enforcement sources I talked to say that and obviously there were other digital killed at the rally as well. But in some ways, despite the security failures, the response in the ability of the officers and agents on the scene to neutralize the shooter when they did, may have prevented more casualties than occurred already.",

If a presidential campaign is a fight, Donald Trump certainly wants voters watching his convention to know he's in the ring, skirting tradition that a family member typically introduces the presidential nominee Trump instead selected Dana White, CEO of the ultimate fighting championship to warm up the crowd.

And you know, the people who -- the young men who usually watch these videos, who know these, you know, professional -- professional wrestlers, you know, these -- these men who have UFC, who are part of this culture, they aren't always please following politics.So this was an effort to try and get those folks who -- those young men who aren't always following politics, who aren't following the day-to-day, kind of into the RNC and then maybe they'll stick around to see Trump-speak and get what he his message and hopefully try and expand that lead that he already had as among male voters.",

He's the first American journalists arrested on espionage charges in Russia since the Cold War. And he, along with the U.S. government and \"The Wall Street Journal\", continued to deny all of the spying charges.CNN's Matthew Chance has the latest. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN CHIEF GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Ahead of the verdict in the Russian court, cameras jostled for a glimpse of the U.S. journalist in his glass cage. After finding him guilty of espionage, the judge asked Evan Gershkovich if he had any questions about the 16-year prison sentence he'd been handed. Looking thin and tired, \"The Wall Street Journal\" reporter answered \"no\". But critics say his guilty verdict was inevitable and underlines how politicized Russia's judicial system has become. The strongly worded statement from Gershkovich's employers called it a disgraceful and sham conviction that comes after his 478 days in prison, wrong fully detained, and away from his family. You can see Evan Gershkovich is in there. Hi, Matthew from CNN. Is that -- you holding up all right? It's been a saga which has seen Evan Gershkovich now 32 to make several tightly controlled court appearances since being detained and accused of gathering secret information on a Russian tank factory for the CIA, allegations denied by Gershkovich and the U.S. government. There are other us citizens held in Russia, like Paul Whelan, a former marine, sentenced in 2020 to 16 years for spying, and also designated by Washington, has wrongly detained. Dual citizens Ksenia Karelina and amateur ballerina from L.A., and journalist Alsu Kurmasheva are also in custody. As are Gordon Black, a staff sergeant in the U.S., and U.S. school teacher Marc Fogel. Critics suspect the Kremlin has been collecting us citizens as bargaining chips for a future deal. But even now, that deal could still be months or perhaps years away. Matthew Chance, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
