The vice president visited campaign staff in Delaware for the first time in the top slot, and she delivered a preview of how she'll attack her opponent Donald Trump. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HARRIS:  In those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds. Predators will abuse women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain.

Joining me now to discuss all this, Stef Kight, politics reporter at \"Axios\", and Mariana Alfaro, she's politics reporter at \"The Washington Post\". Good morning to both of you. Thanks so much for being here. Harris, of course, heading to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, which was the site of the Republican National Convention. And, Stef, I mean, the bottom line here is that there certainly were concerns about whether Harris is capable of beating Trump. I'm not going to say those concerns have entirely gone away, but everything with Biden got so bad that the risk that Harris presented became a much more or preferable choice. And you have sort of felt this palpable sense of relief and excitement around Harris his campaign in these opening hours.",

So there's clear excitement there. It's been pretty remarkable for all of us.

I think that that might be the reason why we haven't really heard of he's gotten these materials.But these other folks, Shapiro, Cooper, Mark Kelly, you know, they are relatively newest faces in the Democratic Party nationally. They're not as well known as Harris was when she was chosen as VP, and so now the test is to see how they play out in the national field if people really connect to them and they bring this balance to the ticket that Democrats are seeking in order to get those purple-ish votes across the country.",

They're ready to go on the attack. They recognize that she is a stronger for candidate than they had initially. Republicans were very eager to keep Joe Biden at the top of the ticket. And now they're trying to pivot and you I've been reported that Republican senators, the NRSC, is also including a category in their memo of just weird, just going after Kamala Harris for some of her maybe more awkward moments, things that don't necessarily matter when it comes to policy and politics for a lot of voters, but they're trying to hit her in any way possible and they're trying to see what sticks.",

Max, good morning to you. What a massive shift in dynamics in just such a short period of time? And of course, now we're going to be talking about how a Vice President Harris might be interacting with a -- a future President Harris, I should say, might be interacting with Benjamin Netanyahu as opposed to Biden, we have a pretty good sense of where he stands here, right? And the longstanding relationship those two men have had over many years in public service. So, back in December, Vice President Harris said this about Israel's offensive in Gaza. And now, of course, we should underscore these remarks are all made in the context of her being Biden's vice president. So they do sound similar. Let's watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I mean, it's going to be fascinating to see, obviously she cant move to offline with Biden on such a key important relationship, you know, the U.S.-Israeli relations. But she will now be thinking about how she may differentiate from now to express herself more freely, I guess, on that issue. Biden is seen as someone who wasn't necessarily as tough on Israel as it should be in the context of what Kamala Harris is speaking to there, which is the massive amount of civilian casualties in Gaza. Will she be tougher on that? If you look back on some of the language -- I mean, there are certain researchers who do feel that Kamala Harris has expressed more sympathy for Palestinians than perhaps Joe Biden. So, will she be more balanced on that? Because certainly, if you look back on all the presidencies in the U.S., Joe Biden is one of the most pro-Israel we presence there has been, certainly in terms of his language and his actions and some would say the lack of pushback that he's given the Israelis on some of the things he didn't approve of going on in Gaza. So it'll be fascinating to be a fly on the wall in that meeting. But I'm sure she's not going to rock the boat whilst obviously Joe Biden is president because it would undermine that central relationship to the world, not just the U.S. and Israel.",
