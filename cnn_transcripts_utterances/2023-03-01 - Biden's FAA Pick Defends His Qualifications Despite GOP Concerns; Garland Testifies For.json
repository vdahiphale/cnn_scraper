They said that between the media pooler and another person who was there, 12 steps from one another, Jake.

While I am not bought into the motive issue with respect to this financial motivation and the world closing in and him feeling that, Mr. Murdaugh, he needed to kill his family, let's remember that motive is not something the prosecution must prove. Prosecutors like to talk about motive because it lets the jury know and identify with the purpose, the basis, the reason why a person may act in the way that they do.So even if the jury does not buy this motivation as to the financial incentive and the world closing in, the prosecution was strong, to your question, on the issue of moneys and opportunity. They boxed him in. What am I speaking about briefly? The timeline. There's a very specified timeline as to when this crime would be committed. Initially the defendant said \"i wasn't there.\" guess what, the cell phone data that puts you there, there's car data that puts you there, there's a videotape that you're not seen on, but you're heard on that puts you there -- what do you do? You change the story. So I think the prosecution is boxing eliminate with regard to that timeline, eliminating that it could have been anyone but him, especially when they're talking about his cell phone and how the activity heightened on Alex Murdaugh's cell phone after the murder. So, that's what the prosecution is focusing in on. I think it's significant that they are. Why? Because it lowers the specter of there being someone else who could have done it and lessens the reasonable doubt.

Obviously, they did it actually bringing them there, but in a normal circumstance you bring a jury there with photographs, with surveillance, you bring them there with everything but going to the actual scene.

But this week in Geneva, we did just that with the Iranian foreign minister. And, of course, he said that there were no extrajudicial killings, and he blamed a lot of the actual violence on foreign-based infiltrators, foreign-backed infiltrators.This is part of our discussion on some specific cases I put to him.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) AMIR-ABDOLLAHIAN:  We have a roadmap with the IAEA. And on two occasions, Mr. Aparo, Mr. Grossi's deputy came to Iran in the past few weeks, and we had constructive and productive negotiations. We have always invited Mr. Grossi to come and visit Iran soon. Therefore, our relationship with the IAEA is on its correct and natural path. We have said this to the U.S. side, through mediators, that we are on the path to reach an accord. If the Iranian parliament adopts a new law, then we'll have to abide by the parliamentary act. So the window for an accord is still open. This window will not remain open forever. The U.S. party has been sending us positive messages through diplomatic channels. But in its media remarks, they make deceptive remarks that are totally different. And really, as an Iranian foreign minister, sometimes I have serious doubts. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And that's when the alarms sounded, indicating that there might be some explosives.According to the FBI, they examined, X-rayed the compounds that were in this device that were put on this -- on this luggage, and they found that it contained the compounds that you find in fireworks. Again, this is something that is commonly used to make homemade explosives. It's not clear what exactly he was planning to do with this. Right now, Marc Muffley who, again, is from the town of lance ford, Pennsylvania, is facing two charges. One of them is possession of an explosive at an airport, possessing or attempting to place an explosive or an incendiary device in an aircraft. According to the FBI, as part of the arrest record here, after they discovered the device on the -- in the luggage, they paged the man to try to get him to come talk to the security officers.

In this case, though, we know it was a checked bag which is even maybe more egregious because the TSA was able to pick this up as this bag went through security screening behind the scenes at Lehigh Valley International Airport and that is critical.You've seen at airports even here at Reagan national airport, when you check your bag you have to walk it over to get screened by the TSA. Some airports have that system in line, although the TSA is telling us this was done during a routine check, then they were able to page this man. They brought over a person to inspect the bag, they also brought over dogs, a TSA spokesperson tells me. So, this is very, very serious. The issue now in 2023 is that the TSA simply finds so many guns and weapons in bags because they say that people simply forget. So now we really need to know what the motivation was here. Many times it's an accident. Although in this case, the big question is was it an accident, or was it intentional? And that is something, of course, the TSA will be asking, the FBI will be asking. We know that the port authority at the airport is involved, as well. So many, many agencies and many, many layers here looking at this just trying to figure out exactly how this happened and really what went wrong. As John points out, the good news is the system really worked. The layers of security that were put in place after 9/11 really were up to snuff here, and they were able to find these explosives in this checked bag and were able to get them out. Had is so key, and it really shows that the system worked here by the transportation security administration. TAPPER:  All right. Pete Muntean, Evan Perez, John Miller, thanks to all of you. Turning to our world lead, violent scenes in Israel today as thousands of demonstrators took to the streets to protest Prime Minister Netanyahu's moves to weaken the country's independent judicial system, according to critics. Israeli police lobbed stun grenades and fired water cannons at protesters who were attempting to block traffic in central Tel Aviv to oppose Netanyahu's plan which has even come under criticism even from the pro-Netanyahu former ambassador to Israel, David Friedman. CNN's Hadas Gold is live in Jerusalem for us. And, Hadas, some of the protesters surrounded a hair salon where Sara Netanyahu was inside, prime minister's wife. Tell us more about that.",

Protesters found out where it was and surrounded it.They mostly seemed peaceful, most were just yelling, blowing horns, making a bunch of noise. But it required a massive police presence to get her out, including helicopters, several dozen seemed like border police officers running into the street, dramatic scenes to get her out. Many of the protesters were shouting \"shame\" at the police officers and also shouting at them, where were you in Huwara? That's a reference to that Palestinian village where those two Israeli brothers were killed. Then there was a rampage settler -- Israeli settler revenge attacks. This, of course, following the other dramatic scenes we saw earlier today in central Tel Aviv. More of these protesters, we've seen these protests for eight weeks now against these judicial reforms, some of which would allow the Israeli parliament to overturn Supreme Court decisions.

But there does seem to be a work around, entering a pass code to allow kids to keep scrolling past that one-hour limit.Let's bring in CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta. Sanjay, this is timely for you, because a sixth season of your great podcast \"Chasing Life\" explores how scrolling affects our brains and our health. Tell us more about that. DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, I've been fascinating with this topic for some of the same reasons you would be. I have three teenage daughters, as you know, you have teenage kids, Alice, as well. It's such a big part of their lives. I interviewed my girls for this podcast, which I got to tell you is magic. I mean, we're close. We talk about all the time. Having a two-hour conversation is a magical thing. All of this is sort of, in part, driven by what would have been some tragic trends with regard to mental health. We talked about 60 percent of teen girls say they feel hopeless at one time. One in four crafted a plan for suicide. At the same time, these trends have been developing over the last decade and a half. There's been more social media. That's what's driving a lot of these concerns. That's correlation, not causation, but I think that's what is driving a lot of these concerns. We know some things. For example, the average person will pick up their phone some 300 times a day, they'll just pick it up, look at it within the first ten minutes. About half the people say they will text people in the same room with them instead of a face-to-face conversation. So we know that there's a problem and the people who use social media the most are the most affected negatively. There's a lot of people now saying here's what you can do about it. And one of the things that's driving this TikTok legislation is the idea of bringing the brain back online for a second. Maybe in a code punching -- a code won't work, but maybe some people will say, I don't need to keep scrolling and just brings back online. Other things experts recommend, they say, when you do pick up your phone, again, most people mindlessly ask three questions, ask what for? Why am I picking it up? Why now? And what else could I be doing instead? Sounds simple, Jake, but it could make a difference.",
