And the judge overseeing it has already delivered this line. \"Presidents are not kings.\" Plus, could it be the most important case, in U.S. history? One of the nation's top election experts says that democracy is on the line, in the United States versus Donald Trump. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Donald Trump will be arraigned, in less than 24 hours, from now, right here, in Washington, D.C., the first time, for crimes that he allegedly committed, as President, against his country. He's expected to appear in court, at 4 PM Eastern, in person, we are told. And today, his former Vice President, and now, 2024 challenger, and a critical witness, in this case, had a lot more to say, about the January 6th indictment, and his former boss's role. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MIKE PENCE, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Anyone who puts themselves over the Constitution should never be President of the United States. It wasn't just that they asked for a pause. The President specifically asked me, and his gaggle of crackpot lawyers, asked me, to literally reject votes, essentially, to overturn the election. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He would search for a lawyer, who would give him the advice he wanted. But I'm not even sure you would characterize what Eastman said as advice. I mean, it'd be interesting to see.

Rick, I mean, this was a fascinating article. And it's not a subtle headline that you have there. And, I think, obviously, if you were trying to get people's attention, with your words, it clearly worked. And there have been a lot of monumental cases. But what is it that stands out? Why do you think this is the biggest one and the most important one? PROF. RICK HASEN, UCLA SCHOOL OF LAW, DIRECTOR, SAFEGUARDING DEMOCRACY PROJECT: Well, if you contrast it with the other cases, against Trump, one about hush money payments, and one about classified documents? Neither of those implicate American democracy. The fact is that Trump tried to steal the election, based on everything we know. And he's not been held accountable. He wasn't convicted, in the Senate, or disqualified, by the Senate, from holding office. He's faced no civil liability. This is really the chance. And if this doesn't work, then what's going to stop Trump, from trying to stay in office, if he's reelected? Or the next person, who wants to try to steal the election? We need to have accountability, for what happened in 2020.",
