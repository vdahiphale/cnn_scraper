And we have new reporting on both candidates' tactics on this crucial night.Plus, change the way you speak about women. Nikki Haley is offering some blunt advice for the Republican ticket that needs to narrow the gender gap. But will Donald Trump fall into familiar habits on that tonight? And the most important audience of all, CNN is asking undecided voters in must win Pennsylvania what they want to hear on the debate stage. One person's tip, tell us what you're going to do, not what the other person has done wrong. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines and \"Inside Politics.\" After months of talking about one another, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are about to actually talk to one another. And it's all happening tonight on this debate stage at 09:00 p.m. Eastern inside the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia. Tonight is each candidates chance to directly appeal to millions of voters before ballots go out. They likely won't have an audience this big again. CNN's new poll of polls show why both nominees have so much riding on tonight. It's essentially a tied race nationally and probably matters the most, which is these big battleground states. It is an especially high risk, high reward moment for Kamala Harris as she's had only been at the top of the ticket now for 51 days and many Americans are still learning about her. CNN is on the ground in Philadelphia covering this massive day in politics from all angles. Priscilla Alvarez is following the Harris campaign and Kristen Holmes is talking to the Trump campaign and both have some new reporting for us. Priscilla, I want to start with you. What are you hearing from your sources?",

But this is also an attempt by her and her team to capitalize on an edge that we've been seeing in the polls. CNN polling recently showing that she has built on former -- President Joe Biden's lead on this very issue with an average of 27 percentage points, preferring her, women, over former President Donald Trump. And so the Vice President here is again trying to capitalize on this issue against the former President tonight. Now, CNN is also learning that the Vice President is looking for advice elsewhere, and that includes from Hillary Clinton, who also debated former President Donald Trump. And so this has all been part of what sources have described to me as a robust debate prep over the last few days that is going to culminate in this first face to face encounter tonight, Dana.",

These are the people who may have tuned in for the Democratic National Convention, maybe liked parts of what they saw, but are still undecided.The other thing, I think, and this so goes without saying, it's very obvious, but I do think we should say it. They want to make sure that she can avoid a Rick Perry oops moment and frankly, a Joe Biden debate day. Right? The fact that this debate that CNN hosted weeks ago ended up completely changing the trajectory was, obviously, because President Biden unexpectedly had a completely disastrous debate against Donald Trump.

Right?And yet they keep coming up in focus groups, they keep coming up in polls. But both campaigns have really tried to use this last, say, five, six weeks to define Harris. You're seeing that a little bit in the polls. But this is her chance on a stage with Donald Trump to, I don't want to say introduce or reintroduce, but really make her case. And it's really the contrast that they want to focus on. This isn't just about Harris talking about her agenda, it's her agenda compared to Trump's. And it's in the future tense.

People might know a little bit about her but don't know a whole lot. They may have seen her speeches but haven't seen, for instance, your interview with her. I do think also, though, that Donald Trump has a lot at stake in this debate as well because Kamala Harris is a popular politician right now. It's kind of rare that we see popular politicians right now. She's got a favorable rating that's generally a little bit higher than her unfavorable rating. And so he needs to bring her back down. It's not just the policy stuff. It's also the personal stuff. And so I think that creates a dilemma for Trump where he wants to bring her down personally and kind of take a bite out of those vibes that she's gotten over the last several weeks.

That's a word that he has used this time around to describe Kamala Harris.The campaign is preparing for all kinds of insults, derogatory comments, name calling, because they're going up against Donald Trump. As Kristen was saying earlier, he's the only person that knows exactly which version is going to show up. I do know that Clinton and Harris, over the weekend in their conversation, did talk about debate prep. I don't know exactly what was said. But one thing that I was told is that when Hillary Clinton sort of looks back on those debates from eight years ago, she does think that the Vice President has a real opportunity tonight when she is going up against Donald Trump to allow him to self-destruct, according to one person I spoke with. And that's basically this idea that less could be more when you're confronting Donald Trump. That if he is going off on a tangent or he seems to be unraveling, sort of letting him go down that road.

In 1876, this very debate happened because several states who were completely, genuinely corrupt and full of fraud sent multiple slates of electors to Washington. And there was a debate back then, just like in 2021, about what to do.And the question was, who would count the electoral votes? Republicans -- remember, these are Republicans who were the party of Lincoln. They insisted, Article II, Section 1, Clause 3 of the Constitution stated clearly, \"The president of the Senate shall open all certificates and the votes shall then be counted.\" Democrats countered that the Vice President's role was largely ceremonial, that it was constitutionally limited to opening the return certifications -- easy for me to say.
