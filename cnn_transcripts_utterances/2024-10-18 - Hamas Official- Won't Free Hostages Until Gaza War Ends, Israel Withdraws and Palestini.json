      "sentences": "Well, it's 05hour show and happening over the next two hours, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu now discussing a quote, significant window of opportunity after announcing that Yahya Sinwar was killed in Gaza. But many questions remain about the ongoing war, the release of hostages and the future of Hamas. Meanwhile, President Joe Biden is in Europe meeting with his European counterparts on the wars in the Middle East and in Ukraine. And the stock market in New York will open about 30 minutes from now. It's 09:00 a.m. of course, in New York, let's take a look at the futures markets, indicating a mixed open back there 30 minutes from now. Well, the task before ours is not yet complete. That from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at what could be a turning point in Israel's war against Hamas. The group confirming its Leader Yahya Sinwar is dead, killed, apparently by Israel in Gaza on Wednesday. Yahya Sinwar was known as the mastermind of the October 7th attacks, and word of this death sparked celebrations in Israel. It is a big step towards Mr. Netanyahu's stated goal of wiping out Hamas leadership. But is it enough to actually end the war? CNN Global Affairs Correspondent Matthew Chance is in Tel Aviv. And the proverbial ball, it does seem, in Benjamin Netanyahu's court, what indications if any, is he giving about what he intends to do next?",

      "sentences": "Look, I mean, at the moment, everyone in Israel and many of Israel's allies as well Beckyare talking about how this represents a window of opportunity. Joe Biden U.S. President has said it. His Defense Secretary has said it. Netanyahu has said it. Because the death of Yahya Sinwar is seen as a potentially pivotal moment that could sort of lead to Hamas as an organization, deciding to surrender, and, crucially, to give up the hostages, more than 100 of whom are still, of course, being held inside Gaza. In fact, there's been a direct appeal from Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli Prime Minister, calling on Hamas fighters to surrender hostages. And to sort of put up the white flag and surrender, essentially. Now, and in exchange for that, he said he would offer them some kind of leniency. He would allow them to live. And it may well prove to be that this is such a pivotal moment that results in some kind of deal being done, some kind of capitulation on the part of Hamas that sees the eventual release of Israeli hostages. The trouble is, we're not seeing any sign of that from the other side as it were, from Hamas, there's been an acknowledgement in the past few hours from the main Hamas political officials that are left surviving, acknowledging that Yahya Sinwar has indeed been killed by Israel. That's something they waited a couple of days before they actually confirmed officially. But the same statements have said that they are confident that Hamas will ultimately be victorious. No sign that they are willing to compromise another Hamas statement saying that the hostages from Israel won't be released until such time as Israel's aggression against Gaza has come to an end. And so, look, there is potentially a window of opportunity to coin the phrase that many Israelis and Israeli allies have been using to characterize this moment. A window of opportunity that could see a negotiation appear that would result in the -- in the releases hostages. But you know, we'll have to wait and see what the coming days, what the coming weeks will bring of any sort of restarted negotiations between these two sides Becky?",

On the one hand, it's certainly true that Yahya Sinwar was a hardline figure, obviously, and was not prepared to make the kind of compromises that Israel wanted Hamas to make in order for a deal to be done, a ceasefire or cessation of hostilities to be done. And he is now out of the picture. But we don't really know the kind of leader who's going to take over Hamas, whether that person is going to be able to enforce discipline, whether that person is also going to be a hardliner as well. That's one issue. I think the other issue is that it wasn't just the failure of the negotiations so far was not just about it was also about the reluctance of Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli Prime Minister, to make the kind of compromises as he would see it, that were acceptable to Hamas. And there's very little sign that Benjamin Netanyahu, all key supporters in his right-wing coalition, are prepared at this point to stop the fighting, to sit down at the negotiating table with Hamas and sort of offer the kind of ceasefire terms that may be acceptable to members of that organization, leaders of that organization, who are still surviving.

And in fact, when you hear from Israeli officials, they say it was something of a surprise that they ran across him where they did. American officials had long believed that Sinwar was far underground, surrounded by hostages as human shields. That isn't necessarily the circumstances that they found him in this week. And so, it was something of a surprise, both to the Israelis and to the Americans, that they found him in the manner that they did. Those special operators that President Biden mentioned in his statement yesterday were sent to Israel mostly to help with the hostage recovery efforts. They weren't necessarily on the ground searching for Hamas leaders on a day-to- day basis. What American officials say is that they helped in an operational front, helping the Israelis learn and determine how to operate in the tunnels, going after Hamas leaders themselves. They weren't necessarily on the ground, doing that on their own. When President Biden says yesterday that the special operators were helpful in this effort, I think that is what he was talking about.

So, we didn't hear from the president for some hours in response to the Sinwar death we have now. You are -- you were just in Iran.

However, of course, the killing of Yahya Sinwar definitely very high up on the agenda, and you're absolutely right. President Biden heard about all this as he was on Air Force One enroute to Berlin here, and we already know that he spoke to the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, while he was still in the air, congratulated him on the killing of Sinwar. But then at the same time, also said that he wanted this to be an inflection point, a turning point in all this, ostensibly on the way to some sort of cease fire in Gaza. Because, of course, that is something that has weighed very heavily on the Biden Administration, definitely also weighed very heavily on the government of those three nations here in Europe. There have been some protests here about the way that that war is being conducted here in Europe as well. Definitely something where all of them now say they hope that there's going to be a path forward to at least have a better situation there in that part of the Middle East, and possibly even a ceasefire going on as well. So definitely, it is something where the Middle East now, I wouldn't say, dominates the agenda, but certainly is very high up on the agenda and has been elevated on the agenda. In fact, we heard that in a statement by the president earlier today, where he said that the killing of Yahya Sinwar was a moment of justice, as he put it. At the same time also, if you look at the readout coming from the U.S. side, and that bilateral meeting between Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, and President Biden the Middle East, was definitely on the very high on the agenda as well. So right now, it seems as though all of these leaders will definitely be talking about all this and seeing how it changes the entire equation here, as far as the Middle East is concerned, and the prospect for moving things forward to a better situation, of course, also for all the people who are suffering so much in Gaza, Becky.",

The Hamas Senior Commander saying today, no return of hostages until there is a ceasefire, until Israel leaves the Enclave, and until the Palestinian prisoners are returned.

But it continues to operate. They have a very decentralized system in terms of at least operational capacity at the local level. In terms of combat, it's clear that there are different units that are working despite the loss of its the upper level of command and control. But it's also -- what's also very significant. So, two things. One is that an Iran has stepped in very quickly, and is, you know, more or less has taken control over support for Hezbollah, even to the level of some of the decision making. Today, there's a big outcry in Lebanon because the head of the parliament came out and said, we can negotiate with the French for 1701 on behalf of the Lebanese. And the Lebanese Prime Minister said, no, you have no right to negotiate. We know negotiate on our own. So, there is a lot of concern around the role Iran is playing in Lebanon, and in terms of directly being involved in the decision-making vis-a-vis Hezbollah, and what happens in the country? And it did that partly -- to shore up -- but also partly because the leadership was gone. But at the same time, the level of destruction we're seeing in Lebanon is absolutely horrific. This is no more about targeting Hezbollah. This is a collective punishment. They're turning and they've already turned very large parts of the south into absolute wasteland. They've normalized the targeting, taking out large numbers of civilians in order to get at some mid-level operative that no one has really heard of.",
