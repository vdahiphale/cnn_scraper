An attack that President Volodymyr Zelenskyy calls a manifestation of terror. At least 11 people were killed when two Russian missiles slammed into Kramatorsk on Tuesday evening. One hitting a popular pizza restaurant, another a village nearby. Among the victims, a baby and these teenage twin sisters who had just graduated from the eighth grade. More than 60 people are injured. The Russian Defense Ministry claims it hit a temporary command post of a Ukrainian army unit. Ukraine says it detained a man who allegedly scouted the pizzeria and sent a video to Russian armed forces. CNN's Ben Wedeman is at the scene of the latest tragedy.",

Now, right behind me was a very popular restaurant, and given the time of the strike, there were probably many people inside. A witness inside the restaurant says it was crammed with people when the missile struck. He saw rescuers pulling dozens of people out. Slabs of concrete collapsing at the center of the restaurant. Medics and firefighters continuing to pull people out hours after the strike. And removing damaged cars from surrounding streets, clearing the way for more rescue work. Air raid sirens warning of another strike, pausing the search and rescue. And moving along crowds looking for loved ones. The blast knocking this woman off her feet.

And this news just coming in to CNN, pieces of that Titan submersible wreckage have just been retrieved from the ocean floor. The vessel imploded, killing all five people on board in the North Atlantic during a trip to view the Titanic wreckage. Paula Newton is joining me now live from Ottawa, Canada. Paula, what are you learning? It has been remarkable, I have to say, to Christina, to see these images, these stills in this video coming in from St. John's Harbor. And the reason is that the pieces of debris are actually quite significant. Given the U.S. Coast Guard had described the environment there as unforgiving and described what was likely a violent implosion, what that remote operated vehicle was able to retrieve from more than, you know, practically four kilometers in the seabed is actually extraordinary. We do have a comment as well from Pelagic Research which operated the remote operated vehicle at those depths. They're saying that they successfully completed their offshore operations that were involved in salvaging the submersible Titan, and they say that they will continue their operations there in St. John's and will do their best to try and continue with that aid that they're giving to significant investigation. They say it will take several days and we'll have more information when they can release it. Just a reminder, Christina, as fascinating as these photos may be, they're obviously chilling as well. Five people lost their lives on the submersible Titan and I can imagine that when the family and friends see these pieces of debris they will be left with obviously more grief but also many more questions. I also spoke to the Transportation Safety Board here in Canada, they refused to comment any further but saying that they have investigators that remain on the ground there. I also do want to bring up the issue though of whether or not there was any criminal negligence involved here. When you look at those pieces of debris, the RCMP, the National Police here, are just starting what they call an examination. They've not launched a full-blown investigation, but no doubt, Christina, that given the significant pieces of debris that we can see with our own eyes, that will be a good head start in determining whether or not they need to begin that criminal investigation.

So, those are big open questions for voters to consider. And I think you still see a Republican base that is pretty much still beholden to Donald I mean, a good example of this was House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who went out in an interview and said that Donald Trump may not be the strongest candidate in 2024, and then immediately had to go on a damage control tour. I mean, he called Donald Trump, he apologized, he did another interview where he walked all of this back, and I think that really is reflective of where the Republican base is.

And then by the time we get into tomorrow morning, you can see things start to dissipate just a little bit. The blue smoke still indicates some smoke in the atmosphere, but most likely upper levels.

So, when we look at other chronic diseases like high blood pressure or diabetes, we don't bat an eye when weadd a medication to help treat those conditions. It's the same with obesity medicine. It is a chronic disease. There are multiple reasons why people gain weight. It's not just because of the fact that they're eating too much or not exercising enough. Sometimes it's because it's genetic, it's in their genes or hereditary. Sometimes it's due to conditions that people have like PCOS or thyroid disease. And sometimes it can be medications that are causing us to gain weight. And so, we need to look at these anti-obesity medications as a way for us to be able to help people who are struggling with obesity, to be able to lose the weight and live a healthier life.",
