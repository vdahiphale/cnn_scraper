We got rid of these hangers on, that we could have a really serious, substantive debate between what -- you know, we could consider to be Trump's two main rivals. I mean, they're not really that competitive with Trump yet. But I think everyone, sort of, thought fewer candidates would give us a better debate. And to be honest with you, I actually think it was a worse debate.And look, I think the big missed opportunity, because I was rooting for Nikki Haley, you know, cards on the table. but I think that she is somebody who has the potential to come across as likable and charismatic. And yes, she has to fight. She has to throw elbows, but she has the potential to also be Reagan-esque or whatever. And she did not do that. This was a childish, petty back and forth.",

Jeff, why can't they do these two things at the same time?JEFF DUNCAN, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, (R) FORMER GEORGIA LT. GOVERNOR:  Yes, on the surface, last night's debate seemed a little bit different, right? There were only two candidates there, and it seemed a little more focused, but at the end of the day, this was just a game of small ball. Most of the time it felt like a high school debate going on. And I think they continue to both be Pennywise and pound foolish. Just because Donald Trump doesn't show up to the debate doesn't mean you don't talk about him. At the end of the day, he's the weakest Republican in this race. He's the one who's raised the national debt $8 trillion. He's the one who mismanaged COVID. He's the one who lied about the 2020 election. He still supports the narrative around January 6th. And the list goes on and on and on. These are governors of two very conservative, very successful states that have a great track record and at the end of the day they were just splitting hairs. And there's no way to the White House unless you go right through Donald Trump. And I continue to encourage as many folks around these campaigns as possible to don't be afraid of Donald Trump, take him on. It is worth it. He is a train wreck for the Republican Party. And by the way, this should be a layup for Republicans, right? I mean, we -- it took 44 minutes to mention Joe Biden's name in the debate. according to my clock last night. BOLDUAN:  I want to play something for you both that John Berman -- John Berman flagged this for me, and it's about what Donald Trump did during his counter programming town hall last night. It's a moment where Trump is talking about New Hampshire, and it's how he is talking about New Hampshire that you will want to listen to. Listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  But New Hampshire is interesting. It's a great place, a great state, unbelievable people, but they allow independents and Democrats to vote in the Republican primary. You say, what's that all about? So, it's a little bit false in that regard, but even with that, I think we'll win substantially. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But we've got to find ourselves in a different position than just infighting amongst each other.And, you know, yesterday was a tough day for Chris Christie. I certainly was a fan of his approach and his honesty through the process. He got out because he was at for the good of the Republican party. But we've got to get behind a candidate here.

And that was maybe the most polite way for him to start sowing seeds of doubt. If he loses New Hampshire or gets, you know, one point ahead of Nikki Haley.But then it's going to be -- you know, if that doesn't work, then it's going to be that it was rigged. And it just continues and continues and continues. And look, the Republican Party is so starved for a genuine leader right now. It is so ripe for somebody to stand up and say, you know what, Donald Trump's wrong. He's a liar. He has misguided us for far too long.

And it was over whether Former President Trump is truly an industry expert. Because Kise reminded the court, as part of his closing argument -- and I'm reading notes from our colleagues who are inside that Trump is a, \"Industry expert.\"He said, Trump has been part of the fabric of commercial real estate in this community, in this state, and frankly, all over the world for nearly 50 years. And there, the judge stopped him and said, Trump has not been qualified as an expert in this trial. Now, this is a bit of a technicality. When you bring in an expert in a trial, they do need to be qualified. It's a process that you go through, but the judge, again, he was upset by this, so he stopped him. He corrected him. But things like this, John, get under Trump's skin and Trump is sitting in there because this case is so personal. This is not just about his expertise in his career, this is about everything he has sold himself to be, right? A titan of industry, of commercial real estate. So, it's likely that this exchange did not please Kise's client.",
