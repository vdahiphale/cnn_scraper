The campaign is trying to build anticipation for this decision and also, control the release of it as they would like to do. And that is through a video announcement that we are expecting that later today.We do know that Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, as you said, are the final leading contenders. She met with both of them at the Naval Observatory, her residence in Washington, just on Sunday. There has been an extraordinary campaign behind the scenes among Democrats across varying sectors of the Democratic Party, who she should pick, is an electoral pick for Josh Shapiro, of course, Pennsylvania central to the road to the White House, 19 electoral votes, or is she more comfortable with Tim Walz from Minnesota, not a swing state, but certainly important part of the Midwest. So those are her decisions. But this is going to tell us a lot about what she sees as their path going forward here, as she begins to really confront the toughest campaign of her lifetime. But we know that she will be here in Philadelphia tonight at that rally and then heading off to battleground states. They were expected to go to seven battleground states, but their plans have already been upended by the storm going through the south.

He chose to announce his running mate in the state of Virginia. So a lot of speculation was going on at the time that Governor Bob McDonald, then the Republican governor of Virginia surely must be the pick. As it turned out, it was Wisconsin Congressman Paul Ryan.

They stormed the outsides of the hotel. They damaged the windows. We were there yesterday, many of the windows are now boarded up after they had been smashed.

I mean, this has really been such an extraordinary presidential election year, and all this excitement and hype around who Harris will choose its as her running mate, just talk to me about this phenomenon that we are seeing because we haven't seen this before in recent decades, have we?

This one has been on fast forward. You know, it is like we sitting there trying to take everything in and it is difficult to do it. But you know what? It has worked better, no matter who she picks.

But neither one is going to be the focus of the campaign, outside their home states or home regions.
