Senior Russian officials say a counterterrorism operation has killed more than 70 militants who attack towns and villages in the Belgorod region. One of the militant groups made up of pro-Ukrainian anti-Putin Russian dissidents say the fighting is ongoing and they still control some Russian territory. Neither claim has been independently verified, but two days of fighting forced Moscow to order the evacuation of some towns close to the border. Kremlin's officials blame Ukraine for the cross border incursions and allegation.We have CNN's Fred Pleitgen put directly to Ukraine's national security adviser during an exclusive interview. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): The Russian military allegedly fighting back, the Defense Ministry showing video of what it says are strikes against fighters who allegedly crossed the border from Ukraine. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): The remaining nationalists were thrown out to the territory of Ukraine where they were shelled until they were fully liquidated. PLEITGEN (voice over): The fighters are anti-Putin Russians, calling themselves the Russian Volunteer Corps and the Freedom for Russia Legion. Still, the Kremlin says it holds Ukraine responsible for the incursion. But in an exclusive interview with CNN, Ukraine's national security adviser brushed off those claims. OLEKSIY DANILOV, UKRAINIAN NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER (through translator): There is a part of Russians who are on the side of light and who went to deal with the darkness that exists in Russia now. What are the questions to us? I don't understand at all. PLEITGEN (voice over): Russia claims Ukraine ordered the raid to distract from the situation in Bakhmut where Moscow now claims its forces controlled all of the city that has essentially been reduced to rubble as these aerial views show. The National Security Adviser insists Ukrainian forces still hold part of the town and that the decision to stand and fight despite overwhelming numbers of Russians was right. DANILOV (through translator): It was our strategic defense operation which was successful for us, given that we held the territory for 10 months where we were destroying them every day.",

Russian court has extended pretrial detention for Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich until August 30. The American journalist was detained by authorities in March charged with spying.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Evan Gershkovich's pretrial detention period was extended for at least three more months until the end of August. Now this was -- this was a request from domestic intelligence officers in Russia who are essentially building the case investigating Gershkovich's case, we know he is facing charges of espionage. Those are charges that he, his family, the Wall Street Journal, where he was working as a reporter vehemently denied. Journalists were not allowed into the courtroom today, so we don't know of any specifics about how everything went down, but his parents did arrive at the courtroom with his Russian lawyer. His parents fled the Soviet Union in 1979, came to the United States, raised their family here. And of course, State Department spokesperson Matt Miller did say that the United States didn't help to arrange their travel over there. Noting of course, that there is a travel advisory for all Americans not to be traveling to Russia right now, but said he's not going to criticize parents who want to see their son. Particularly a son who was wrongfully detained in Russia. The U.S. embassy in Moscow said, \"That they are deeply concerned by the court's decision today\" and also reiterated that U.S. officials have asked multiple times over the past few weeks to receive access -- consular access to Gershkovich in jail, and those requests had been denied by Russian officials.

VIVEK MURTHY, U.S. SURGEON GENERAL: On average, teens are spending 3-1/2 hours a day on social media, that's on average, that means many kids are spending much longer than that. But the key point is that the data also shows when kids are spending more than three hours on average, that they face nearly double the risk, increased risk of depression and anxiety symptoms.

It -- it's not a big deal from the point of view of overall emissions, but it's a step. And what countries need to do in general is to have plans or pathways to actually get to zero emissions.

Amtrak on the East Coast is about half the average speed of these fast trains in -- in France.The fact of the matter is, actually, there are probably going to be battery-operated electric flights soon enough for these short-haul flights. And so there will be other ways around even on plane flights for short-haul. The bigger problem for aviation is the longer flights for which there is not right now any effective substitute to the aviation fuel. So that's still an unsolved problem, more generally. So this is a small step. France has fast rail. Good for them. I wish we did in the United States, and most other places in the world are still longing for this kind of fast rail. More generally, though, the key right now is that every country needs a strategy to get to net-zero emissions across the range of uses of energy and technologies. We're still far from that goal being met by almost any country in the world.",

Officials insist there was no high-speed police chase. The deadly accident, they said, happened long before officers arrived on the scene. Multiple arrests have been made, and more are expected. A police watchdog group is now investigating. While security clearly a major issue for Prince Harry in the United States, there's been a legal blow for him in London.

So losing this legal challenge will sting.According to the prince, private security firms cannot match the services of the U.K. police, and he thinks this protection is badly needed for when he and his family visit the U.K. It's been a big issue for the duke and duchess of Sussex, ever since they left the U.K. And Prince Harry actually wrote about the discussions that were had back then with the royal family and their future roles at the so-called Sandringham summit in 2020. This from his memoir, \"Spare.\" \"I didn't bloody care which option we adopted, so long as security remained in place. I pleaded for continuation of the same armed police protection I'd had and needed since birth.\" He says he offered to pay for police protection out of his own pocket, but this was denied. It's not quite the end of the story, though. Prince Harry is also challenging the lawfulness of the decision at the home office to pull the taxpayer-funded police protection in the first place. The home office has said that the decision made by the protection of royalty and public figures -- it's known as ROBAF (ph) -- considered it inappropriate for wealthy individuals to buy police protection when the committee decided it wasn't in the public interest. Tuesday's ruling comes on the heels of Prince Harry and his wife, the Duchess of Sussex, alleging they were chased by paparazzi in New York last week, which their spokesperson alleged could have resulted in a catastrophic outcome.
