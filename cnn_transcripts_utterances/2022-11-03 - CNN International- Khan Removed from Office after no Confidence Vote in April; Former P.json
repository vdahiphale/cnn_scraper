It happened when according to officials, as well as the authority members who were with Imran Khan have told us that shots are fired at the container, this massive truck that he was moving in.And you have to understand that he was surrounded by he's been surrounded by hundreds and thousands of people at these rallies. We know that there have been injuries. We've also received a confirmation that Imran Khan itself has been injured however; we've seen rituals of him being moved from one vehicle to the other. We know some asset owners and senior PCI leader that Imran Khan has been shot in the foot. And he's being escorted immediately to the nearby city of Lahore, to be sanded. We also know that there have been other senior PCI leaders who have been injured. This again was caught all on live TV that's been a live stream throughout of Imran Khan's rallies. He has said in the past few days, while he started his journey that we've been afraid that he would be assassinated and that there was a threat to his life. This is of course, an ongoing story moving story, we're still waiting to have more information about who fired the shots. What, what has happened to the person who fired the shots and what is going to happen?

He's been saying that I want a free and fair election if he does not believe that the vote of no confidence that took place against him that led him to be ousted was democratic.We consistently called for early elections early general election. He has also said, he said that's the main goal of this march. He said that the reason he's taken out this march is for it to be a peaceful protest. With people from all across the country from the north to the south, much more towards the north of Pakistan, there have been rallies being taken out from the south and Karachi. There have been rallies that have been led by Imran Khan himself from Lahore, now that he's been in Gujranwallah, there's also been rallies coming in - from the province that borders Afghanistan into the Capital. This was supposed to culminate at some point next week; we think thousands of people come out. It's been an extraordinary week here in Pakistan, there have been journalists, and this was a high. There was a journalist who's critical of the military establishment very pro-Imran Khan was recently murdered in Kenya. We had an extraordinary press conference by the Director General of Pakistan, very Secretive Intelligence Services, the ISI this come out, I criticized Imran Khan. This is completely never - this is the past, and in fact, some mystery that that happened. So like I said, it's been an extraordinary time. And yes, there have been shots fired up his convoys. Again, we can't really confirm whether there are any deaths, we do know that there have been injuries. But aside from that, because of everything that's been happening in the country in the past couple of months, as well as just in the past week, it's a very charged atmosphere.

There have been many cases filed against Imran Khan. There's always been a lot of pushback from Imran Khan to the current government itself. There is an economy which is suffering.

      "sentences": "They are and with this failed launch of what's believed to be North Korea's most powerful known missile that was on 17. In many ways, Max, the North Koreans actually learn more from failure than they do from success.But one thing if I know the North Koreans and I've been to that country many times, they will try again. Now whether that next ICBM launch in tab happens in the coming days in the coming weeks or months, they will certainly try to learn from whatever went wrong with this was on 17 launch, and they will try another launch. So let's take a look at the trajectory of today's launch versus the successful test launch with the Hwasong-17 back on March 24th. Back in March, it was the highest altitude and longest duration of any North Korean missile ever launched. It went up more than 6200 kilometers it traveled a distance of more than 1000 kilometers although it could have gone much further had the trajectory been different. You know, they do a higher altitude and shorter distance so that it can splashdown in the waters closer to North Korea and not splashdown in the waters near the Mainland U.S. even though this missile was designed to hit the Mainland U.S. Back on March 24 it was in the air for 68 minutes. This time it was in the air for much shorter and it only reached about less than a third of the altitude record that was set back in March. According to CNN's report - this is North Korea's 38th launch event this year. But if you add up the number of missiles that they've launched in total, it's well over double that number. Most of the missiles have been ballistic missiles. Also in this barrage that we saw yesterday it was cruise missiles as well. So let's show you the difference between ballistic missiles and cruise missiles ballistics they traveled many times the speed of sound, they are powered by a rocket or multiple rockets. They go up into space before coming down for reentry. And then they use gravity to actually pull them towards the surface. They travel at the speed many, many times the speed of sound. And in the case of these hypersonic glide vehicles that North Korea claims they've been testing. Sometimes these can actually change direction on their way down. So they're going very fast multiple times the speed of sound and it's almost difficult if not impossible to shoot down there, shoot them down if you don't know exactly what their trajectory is. Now cruise missiles, they operate basically like a jet engine. They have airplane controls or at least similar to airplane controls. They are maneuverable but they stay inside the Earth's atmosphere and they are much easier to shoot down. Cruise missiles are not banned under UN Security Council resolutions. Ballistic missiles are banned. So when North Korea launches a ballistic like this ICBM that is a major violation of UN Security Council resolutions. And that's one of the reasons why the United States and South Korea say they are going to extend indefinitely. These are incredibly a large scale training exercises that have been underway since the beginning of the week. You're talking about 240 war planes and thousands of troops from the U.S. and South Korea in this operation vigilant storm. Let me read you a quote from the South Korean Air Force a statement on this. They said it was necessary to demonstrate a solid combined defense posture of a bilateral alliance under the current security crisis heightened by North Korea's provocations. So if they keep on the exercises Max, North Korea likely keep on with their own provocations and anyone's guess where this is going right now.",

And this compound can actually reduce depression if combined with therapy according to this study. CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta joins us now from New York to explain exactly how this works. It sounds remarkable Sanjay.DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: It does Max and there's been sort of this crescendo of studies in this area of psychedelics for some time, MDMA and ecstasy and ketamine. But as you point out psilocybin, this was a synthetic version of magic mushrooms was what was really being studied here trying to look at people who have what is known as refractory depression, meaning they have depression, they've tried things to try and treat their depression didn't work. The United States for example, 9 million people have depression, 3 million are treatment resistant. So that's what they really focused on here, Max. And let me show you the results of the study here. They basically give a single dose of the psilocybin 25 milligrams, which is a high dose, a micro dose is one milligram to give you some context there. And what they found is that three weeks when they studied this, again, they found that 37 percent of people saw their depression scores drop off by 50 percent or more. Again keep in mind; these were people who are not responding to conventional medications. 29 percent roughly were in remission at three weeks, at 12 weeks that dropped off, but you still had about 20 percent of people in remission at that point. This is what's getting people's attention, Max. In this study, you had 79 people with that highest dose. But there were some 230 people around the world in 22 countries who were trialed on different doses. And these are the sorts of results that are seeing.",
