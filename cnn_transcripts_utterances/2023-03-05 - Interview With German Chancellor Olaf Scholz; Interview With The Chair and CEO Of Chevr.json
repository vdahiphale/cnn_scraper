So we delivered what -- in this case. And the second is that we made us independent from the supply of gas, coal and oil from Russia. No one really expected one year ago that we would easily economically survive a situation where there is no gas supply to Germany and many parts of Europe from Russia any more. But we did. And increasing the capacity of L&amp;G imports from the western ports of Europe and also building new ports in the norther shores of Germany using for a longer time as we planned coal plants, also using nuclear plants which were running out but we increased the possibility for them to produce electricity.

But it is not that we're going to go shopping more and saying I want to buy this or this, and it is even different as if we would buy some cars or trucks which you can ask companies to do and you will have them ride the next day or in two or three or six months' time.In many cases, we have to make the industry starting their production and delivering this to us. And this is the idea behind $600 billion fund which was agreed by the parliament with a two-third majority. That we can take now the decisions that are necessary for the long- term supply of our army, and this will be about tanks and it will be about air defense, and it will be about munition. And my idea is that we have to change the way how we are dealing with the defense industry. So we need -- and this is also a lesson we learned now from Ukraine and the war the Russians started against Ukraine. We need a permanent supply. So the main weapons we use should be produced permanently. This is also for all the necessary maintenance and this is also for munition. If we do so, this will increase our capability, but it will increase also the security because as we see in the difficult situation, we must be able to increase the production, so it is easier to increase the production that is already ongoing as to start newly because this will happen two or three years later. And this is also the answer. When we in this year will make all the agreements with the defense industry about the things they will deliver to us, we will not get them the next day. It will sometimes take some years. Even the F-35 we are buying in the United States will not be coming to Germany just the next day. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And if you hear all of the words about nuclear weapons before and afterwards it is really a change. So, we have to be very clear with our position in this case and we are altogether. And we have to work intensely that we have a lot of countries supporting a world which is not revisionist, which is not -- which is accepting borders. This is the real change coming from the Russian war. It is not just the European question, it is a question for the whole world, that Russia is not accepting agreements that had been made with the -- with the United Nations, had been made in the conference on security and peace in Europe and others, other activities we had in the past, that there should be no change of borders by force.And when I discussed to countries in Asia or Africa or the south of America, I think that many agree to that. And we see it in the decisions of the general assembly. Many agreed to this view even if they do not vote in favor of this voting of the assembly. But they understand that this is a threat also to them.

And we've seen when coal came into the system to go from one percent of demand to 10 percent it took 60 years. And it was a much smaller energy system in those days. Both oil and gas took four decades to go from one percent to 10 percent. We've seen $4.5 trillion invested in wind and solar just over just the last decade. And it has moved from one percent of global energy supply to three percent. So, the scale governs the speed. The speed will be different in different parts of the world.

      "sentences": "That is right. And that is what the intelligence communities have found, that is also what virologists, scientists have found as well. And so, we're looking at two possibilities. One is that there was some kind of lab mishap. And that is possible because lab mishaps have happened before. It is happened here in the U.S. where, for example, in 2014 federal health officials found that there were unlabelled vials in an unsecured storage area that turned out to be smallpox. The CDC, in fact, has made mistakes when it comes to the anthrax bacterium or pandemic influenza. And so, we've had lab mishaps.Just last year in the Netherlands there was also a lab mishap involving polio and a lab worker accidently gotten infected with polio there. And so this is something that certainly can happen. But at the same time, you're right, Fareed, that three out of four new or emerging diseases come from the zoonotic origins. And so, we also need to look at the effect of climate change, deforestation, these wildlife wet markets and what the contribution there is. And so, I guess, my point here is that we need to shift the question, we may never definitively know the answer of what exactly caused COVID-19. And so, if we think that there are these two possibilities, both of which are likely, then why are we not working to prevent both of these things from happening in the future?",

And, you know, there is a question that people have which is, should there be accountability for the fact that the Chinese government really has not been very forthcoming from day one, from the origins of the virus and that may have contributed to its faster spread? What do you say about that?",

Because on the one hand, of course, you're totally right that the obfuscation on the part of the Chinese Communist Party has been totally unacceptable. I mean, the Chinese government didn't allow a WHO, World Health Organization, expert team to enter the country.We're now more than three years into the beginning of COVID. It is like trying to investigate a murder after three years and the initial evidence may be gone And so, what they did then -- and also the lack of containment initially was really wrong. But at the same time, if we're threatening sanctions and reparations and even criminal liability as some politicians in the U.S. have suggested, that is not going to make China cooperate more. We don't want to worsen the prospect of global collaboration which is honestly what we really need to tackle future pandemics too.",

We definitely have recognized the importance of surveillance and I think we're seeing more early surveillance including using wastewater. I think that is a very good thing.We've also seen the impact of global collaboration. And how we as the world of scientists have come together to, for example, create these vaccines and deliver on treatments in record time. I think those are all very positive things. But what I really worry about is that public trust is really eroded in public health. And that is everything. And I really worry that in the discussion about the origin of COVID, that people have hitched on to various theories as part of their political identity which is really not how science is supposed to work.",
