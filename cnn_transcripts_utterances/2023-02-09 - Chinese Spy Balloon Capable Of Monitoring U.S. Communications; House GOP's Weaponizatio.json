      "sentences": "Yes, Victor. So we are learning more about the balloon's actual capabilities here.According to a senior State Department official who briefed lawmakers earlier today, that balloon that was shot down on Saturday was actually capable of collecting signals intelligence, which essentially means that it was potentially able to collect intelligence about conversations. And also that these balloons were actually part of a fleet that were flown over more than 40 countries across five continents. So learning more there about the actual capabilities that the balloon had and just how large this fleet actually was. In briefings today, U.S. officials did emphasize that, ultimately, the U.S. has protocols to protect its sensitive information. And we are told by a senior administration official that the balloon actually was not very sophisticated in terms of what it could pick up, and that the U.S. tried to avoid unencrypted communications in the vicinity of the balloon. Also, the balloon did not necessarily transmit information back to Beijing, because, once it realized that the U.S. knew that it was in U.S. air space, it apparently stopped those transmissions. There are still a lot of questions here about why the U.S. did not shoot it down a lot earlier, particularly when it entered U.S. air space over Alaska. And what a senior Pentagon official told lawmakers today is that, essentially, the U.S. just wanted to wait and see what the balloon was going to do, and potentially gather intelligence on it. Here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. GENERAL DOUGLAS SIMS, DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS, JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF: There was no hostile act or hostile intent. That would be the first. There was no impact to aviation routes, which would be another piece of that. The other would be, there was no -- at the time, there was no suspected impact to critical intelligence gathering ability, in terms of infrastructure. That changed as the balloon made -- as it path continued. And as we reconstruct the path, we are not correspondent with intelligence gathering in Alaska. And based on that, the assessment continued from NORAD and NORTHCOM to continue to observe and report. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And they wanted to wait to see where it would go and if they could collect intel on it. The balloon did end up making a sharp turn southward towards Montana and that's when U.S. officials became increasingly concerned and the president was then briefed.",

It's a gift from the Chinese, Now that we will have it in our hands, we will be able to explain to everybody exactly what this is.

One is that the relationship the China is essentially at an all-time low.We had a big -- a little bump, a positive bump coming out of the President Biden/President Xi meeting in Bali in November. And that kind of prevented a continuing downward spiral. But things are pretty bad. So, I guess I disagree in that I do think that there was a path to resuming dialogue with China, which I actually believe is very important to have open communications. That's how you prevent the wheels from coming off the bus. And now we have done that. So I would say, we've taken another hit, but things were already strategically very low.",

And in this particular case, it's an ingenious way of collecting intelligence information, has a lot of potential capabilities, a lot of possibilities for them from a collection standpoint.
