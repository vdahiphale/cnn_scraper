In the filings, Smith cited this social media post from Trump earlierin the day that reads, \"If you go after me, I'm coming after you.\" Trump's campaign defended the post as the definition of free speech and said it had nothing to do with the case. Smith wants the judge to bar Trump from receiving copies of sensitive evidence from his attorneys for fear that Trump may publicly disclose that information as he's done before. The judge has not yet made a decision. Trump's three indictments don't appear to have slowed his campaign. Here he is speaking Friday at a Republican event in Alabama, and he will be in South Carolina later tonight. Take a listen to how he describes the mounting legal cases against him.

So Donald Trump -- to respond to the Florida charges, he just filled out a paper because he had appeared in court once before to be arrested and arraigned. But he filled out a paper, saying I received a copy of the indictment, and the plea is not guilty, signing with that thick, black ink signature that's so recognizable of Donald Trump. That not guilty pleading in Florida's federal court, the expanded charges there are about obstructing justice, where the Justice Department says he was part of a group of people who wanted to essentially get rid of parts of surveillance tapes that captured the movement of boxes that may have had classified records in them after he left the presidency. Also, there was an additional accusation that he retained in his possession illegally a document from the Pentagon about an Iranian -- a plan to attack Iran, a document he was caught on audiotape speaking about to people who didn't have security clearances.

And my colleagues in the field who do this work really, really hope that this medication is accessible to the women who need it. As you said, prior to this, we know that very few women received adequate treatment. The majority seek care very late after, you know, bearing the illness for many months. And we're not even fully detecting it when it happens, either with the onset in pregnancy or after delivery. So we end up with only treating about 10 percent of women with postpartum depression adequately. And that's not acceptable. And so really we've got to fill the gaps by better screening and detection and better referral to mental health treatment in the community and providing women more options. And I think this is a really special tool because it can bring down depressive symptoms quickly, over a short period of time, and really get women feeling back to feeling themselves and get them back into their lives as they wish to be.
