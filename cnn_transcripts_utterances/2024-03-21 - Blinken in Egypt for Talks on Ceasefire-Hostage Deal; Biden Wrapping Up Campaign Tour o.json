      "sentences": "Good morning or good evening, depending on where you're watching. I'm Rahel Solomon live in New York.Right now, in Cairo, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is set to meet with representatives of numerous Arab countries. We're going to have a live report on the status of ceasefire talks straight ahead. Also, President Biden is wrapping up a major campaign tour of key western states today. We are live in Texas, and we'll take you there. Plus, the U.S. Department of Justice has just filed a lawsuit against Apple, accusing the tech giant of breaking antitrust laws. Attorney General Merrick Garland about to speak any moment now, and when that happens, we will bring it to you live. And while we continue to watch, the DOJ press are happening right now, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is in Egypt for high-level talks to try to secure a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of Israeli hostages. Blinken is meeting with representatives from a number of countries in the region, including Saudi Arabia and Qatar, as well as the Palestinian Authority. He's been traveling across the Middle East this week and says that negotiations are \"getting closer to a ceasefire and hostage deal,\" along with more aid for civilians in Gaza. Earlier, he discussed those issues with top Egyptian officials. He's also scheduled to make a stop in Israel tomorrow. Now, if Secretary Blinken speaks in Cairo, we will also bring you those remarks live just as soon as they happen. But for now, let's bring in CNN's Kiley Atwood. She is at the U.S. State Department. So, Kiley, give us a sense of sort of what the objectives here are and what we can expect from his trip to Israel tomorrow. KILEY ATWOOD, CNN U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT:  Yes. Well, listen, the Secretary, as you said, is in Egypt right now going to meet with his counterparts from a number of Arab countries to discuss essentially what happens the day after this conflict concludes, how to secure, how to govern Gaza. And those conversations are happening as the backdrop is the fact that all parties are trying to work on this agreement to secure the release of those hostages that are held by Hamas and also to put into place a ceasefire. As you said, the secretary of state said yesterday when he was in Saudi Arabia that those talks are getting closer. He said that the gaps have narrowed. But what he wasn't specific on is exactly how those gaps have narrowed. And we'll have to watch and see what happens over the course of the next few days if there are follow-up meetings that come to the fore. We do know that those negotiations that were ongoing in Doha, with Egypt, with Qatar, with Israel and Hamas and the United States, those concluded this week. So, we're watching to see what the follow-on is. Now, when the secretary is in Israel tomorrow, of course, he has been there a number of times throughout this conflict. He's going to be talking about the humanitarian aid that needs to get into Gaza, going to be pushing the Israelis to open more places for that humanitarian aid to actually enter into Gaza. He's also going to be talking to them about a possible operation in Rafah, that southernmost area of Gaza, where the Prime Minister Netanyahu has said there needs to be a ground operation in order to eliminate Hamas. We know that the U.S. has said that they do not believe a ground operation would be a good thing there because of the 1.5 million civilians that are there. And so, they're going to be discussing, you know, how to move ahead with that challenge, with the two sides, really on opposite ends of the spectrum here. And of course, there's going to be further talks on that topic here in Washington next week, when Prime Minister Netanyahu, President Biden, discussed earlier this week, a delegation from Israel is going to be coming to Washington specifically to discuss Rafah. The United States is going to be presenting some options for how an operation could be carried out that could, of course, keep those civilians safe.",

You saw him take aim at, you know, how smartwatches from rival manufacturers don't work as well with iPhones, or that when you try to use tap-to-pay digital wallets, you can only use Apple's digital wallet on an iPhone and you can't use those that maybe -- you know, other software developers would want to bring to the iPhone. And so, all of these go into a bigger, broader lawsuit against Apple that really threatens its business model, its entire walled garden ecosystem that has been the basis for more than a decade of economic success, turning it into a more than $2 trillion company. And so, this is really just an enormous blockbuster lawsuit that could really undercut Apple's business and position as the most dominant tech player on the planet. Rahel.",

This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets. If successful, it would hinder our ability to create the kind of technology people expect from Apple, where hardware, software, and services intersect.So, you see Apple here really pushing back hard on what they see as an unwarranted attack on its successful business model, and that has really benefited consumers by making a seamless, secure product that everyone really likes.

It's also good for borrowers because interest rates are very, very high, right, 23-year high for interest rate.So, when you think about anyone who has credit card debt, mortgages, they're trying to get a car loan, we all are hoping for an interest- rate cuts. But as you know, Rahel, inflation has not been completely tamed yet, right? I mean, there's been a lot of progress, but Jerome Powell says that he wants to see a bit more progress or at least get more confidence about inflation before they're ready to finally lower interest rates, but just the fact that they are still penciling in those three rate cuts, that was enough to send U.S. stocks surging yesterday and higher again today.

When you're looking at the prices of daily commodities and how everyday Americans are, again, feeling about their daily tabulations, going out and getting eggs and milk and produce, they are not looking at the stock market and saying, this is making sense to me. Now, of course, many Americans are invested in there and they have their 401(k)s in there too for tax perks. But the reality is this, is that this is the place where the Biden administration has just not been able to tackle these inflation problems. And that is -- again, the challenge. as we grow closer to November and the president has to continue to answer for why, again, you've got a booming economy stock market yet the price and the cost of daily living to Americans does not feel good.",

You got 60 percent roughly of the American people that are investing the stock market, they're going to feel better about their 401(k)s, about their future, that's all positive. On the flip side, and this is, I think, the challenge, right, you know, the average person is going to be very focused on price and inflation. And so, it's going to be a battle between this kind of two dynamics over the coming months. If people start feeling better about the economy and they feel better about their retirement and they feel better about how much money they're earning, you know, maybe the inflationary concerns or the concerns about price will start to diminish.

I think everyone up here admits that the system right now of passing these piecemeal appropriations bills are not working. And maybe they need to pass this to get up the last hurdle as they have passed a series of these recently. This would fund these parts of the government to the end of the fiscal year. So, a lot of lawmakers shaking their heads up here, Rahel, saying this is the reality of the situation on Capitol Hill, that they're forced in many instances to take these last-minute votes often on very needy pieces of legislation in order to keep the government running.",

Well, that interpreter has been fired. He's accused by Ohtani's lawyers of massive theft, reportedly tied to an alleged illegal gambling operation. The interpreter told ESPN that Ohtani had no involvement in betting. He also said that he did not know that his betting was illegal and also promised to never do it again.

So, this is a very tightly knit duo, who now are going to be forced to spend time apart with the firing.The explanation, Rahel, of how things all went down changed so quickly. Shohei Ohtani's spokesman originally telling an investigative reporter at ESPN that Ohtani was covering the gambling debts of his longtime interpreter and friend Ippei Mizuhara. But then Ohtani's lawyers contradicted that on Wednesday, saying Ohtani was the victim of massive theft. This all came to light because federal investigators are looking into an illegal California gambling operation as first reported by the L.A. Times. According to ESPN, Ohtani sent millions of dollars in wire transfers from his bank account to an alleged bookmaking operation with Mizuhara, originally telling ESPN on Tuesday that the transfers were to cover his losses, but that Ohtani had \"zero involvement in the betting.\" And Mizuhara said he didn't know gambling was illegal in California. ESPN says he also said that Ohtani wasn't happy about his debts but decided to pay it off for him. Well, as ESPN was getting ready to publish their story, Rahel, on Wednesday, Ohtani's lawyers sent out this statement saying, in the course of responding to recent media inquiries, we discovered that Ohtani has been the victim of a massive theft and we are turning the matter over to the authorities. Now, on Wednesday, Mizuhara walked back much of what he originally told ESPN, saying that Ohtani had no knowledge of his gambling activities, his debts, or any efforts to repay them. CNN is attempting to contact Mizuhara. We've reached out to local authorities and Major League Baseball who will not comment at the moment. Mizuhara was in the dugout for Wednesday's MLB season opener against the Padres. He was seen smiling and talking to Ohtani, but Mizuhara was fired by the Dodgers after that story came out. So, this is a very, obviously, quickly moving and changing situation that will continue to monitor with one of the biggest stars in all of American sports, if not the world in Shohei Ohtani.",

He was Ohtani at his workouts, at promotions. And so, losing a guy like that, who's been your confidant, your constant, since moving to the U.S. is certainly not going to be an easy adjustment for Ohtani moving forward.",
