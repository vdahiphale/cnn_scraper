Good evening.We begin this hour with President Biden in London kicking off a week- long visit to Europe with some very big foreign policy challenges on his plate. He'll be making stops in Great Britain and Finland but also on the itinerary is the centerpiece of this trip, the NATO summit in Lithuania. It will take place as the war in Ukraine grinds on past the 500-day mark with no end in sight and amid calls for Kyiv to be granted membership in the NATO alliance. CNN's Arlette Saenz joins us now from London. Arlette, there's a lot riding on this trip, isn't there?",

But really the hallmark moment of this, the week-long trip to Europe will be that NATO summit in Vilnius, Lithuania. President Biden is heading into that summit hoping to once again shore up support and assistance for Ukraine as it faces this long slog of a war against Russia.Now the president recently approved sending over cluster munitions to Ukraine. A controversial piece of ammunition that many countries have been firmly opposed to, but the president said was necessary given the current counteroffensive that Ukraine is encountering with Russia. But also at the top of the agenda at this NATO summit will be the discussion of a possible pathway forward for Ukraine to join the NATO alliance at some point down the road. There are some allies who want to see a more concrete timetable for when that joining of Ukraine to NATO might happen. But President Biden said in an interview with our colleague Fareed Zakaria that right now is not the moment for Ukraine to join NATO, citing the ongoing war with Russia, and also further reforms that Ukraine will need to make in order to join the alliance. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I spent, as you know, a great deal of time trying to hold NATO together because I believe Putin has had an overwhelming objective from the time he launched 185,000 troops into Ukraine, and that was to break NATO. He was confident, in my view and many in the intelligence community, he was confident he could break NATO.So holding NATO together is really critical. I don't think there is unanimity in NATO about whether or not to bring Ukraine into the NATO family now at this moment in the middle of a war. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

National Security adviser Jake Sullivan said that they not only discussed that Sweden desire to join NATO, but they also discussed the prospect of selling F-16 fighter jets to Turkey. That is something that Turkey has been wanting for some time but there are lawmakers up on Capitol Hill on both sides of the aisle who have said that they would block any plan to sell F-16 fighter jets to Turkey unless Turkey were to agree to allow Sweden into the alliance. So these are all issues that will be discussed, both Ukraine's future in NATO and Sweden's future in NATO as the president head to Vilnius on Tuesday.",

It will be continued by Russia and if Russia doesn't want Ukraine in NATO, and that's what they said, that's the reason they went to war, then as long as they keep fighting Ukraine will never have been in NATO.So I would have reversed it. I would have said that what we need to do is set a date in the future, say 2024, where Ukraine will be admitted to NATO, get the conditions right for it, and then put the onus on Russia. If Russia doesn't want Ukraine in NATO then let's pull those troops out and let's work out a different security arrangement. But I think we have the -- we could have the upper hand on the leverage if we play it right. I was just in Europe. Most of the European countries that I visited, I talked to leaders, people close to those leaders with the exception of Germany, they're looking for U.S. leadership to have a positive stance on bringing Ukraine into the alliance, and at the very least setting a firm date for NATO to produce the conditions under which Ukraine would join. If that condition is the end of conflict, that's a sly way of telling the Ukrainians to sort of give up on your aim of kicking Russia out because as of now the United States and NATO are not providing Ukraine what it really needs to conduct this offensive. We certainly wouldn't conduct the offensive without air power, without long-range missiles and without very sophisticated electronic warfare to kill the Soviet jamming, but that's not happening. Ukraine doesn't have those. We haven't provided it. So we've got Ukraine fighting a sort of 1970s war on their side against some very sophisticated Russian EW, and against a pretty solid-looking Russian defense and especially miles of minefields to go through. You can't get through that unless you win the counterpart battle, you can't win that battle unless you have overwhelming power. And, Jim, just a historical -- when we landed in Normandy in 1944 we were stuck, we couldn't break out of the bridgehead until late July. We amassed 2,000 bombers. 2,000 bombers to bomb a tiny slice of the road at a place called Saint-Lo. Took two days to deliver all the ordnance, another three days of fighting, and then the German defense fell apart in France. But that's what it took.",

This happened on June 28th and all of this is according to a statement from the Marine Corps. And I want to read part of that statement. Here is what they're saying.\"This command takes this matter and all allegations very seriously. The incident is under investigation and we will continue to cooperate with NCIS and appropriate authorities.\" Now the NCIS is the Naval Criminal Investigative Service and they declined to comment on this case saying that it was because of respect of the investigative process. But we did reach out to the San Diego County Sheriff's Department and what they're saying is that the 14-year-old girl was reported missing on June 13th, and they say it was her grandma who reported her missing and she told authorities that the girl had run away on June 9th. She said this wasn't the first time that she ran away, but she usually came back home quickly. So the deputies put in the information into many of the missing persons databases. And it was on June 28th that the girl was found by military police at the base, and so after she was found, she was interviewed by detectives and she was offered resources. She was reunited with her grandmother but again this is now all in the hands of NCIS, so we are waiting for the results of that investigation.

Two IRS whistleblowers have claimed that the Justice Department slow- walked the criminal probe, blocked their efforts to get search warrants and subpoenas, and blocked prosecutors from filing felony charges. Joining us with more on this is former Republican congressman Denver Riggleman, who is working with Hunter Biden's legal team. Congressman, welcome. Appreciate it. You're well known for your work on the January 6th Committee. We've talked about that in the past, talking about something different this time around. Why did you decide to take on this case and work with the Hunter Biden legal team and what's your role here? DENVER RIGGLEMAN, ADVISING HUNTER BIDEN'S LEGAL TEAM: It's been interesting. My role is really the same as it was with the committee. It was really technical and analytical support based on computer forensics and phone forensics. And by the way, I've been doing this since late last year so we've been tracking data on what everybody has been saying over the past two years, which has been really interesting. But why did I really take this? It's because, you know, I do hate bullies, but I also found out, you know, as the Hunter Biden legal team reached out to me, that a lot of the people that have been pushing this are the same people that pushed the J-6 conspiracy theories. And once I saw that some of the same techniques were being used, you know, and that you had the Steve Bannon, Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell, you know, and Peter Navarro's, you know, staff all involved in pushing the Hunter Biden laptop data, I got very curious. I love 1's and zeros, I love forensics, and I think we have the best team in the world. When we saw that the Hunter Biden laptop data dissemination was so similar to what was happening on January 6th, and it's the same people, I needed to jump in and so I came in late last year.",

And there are some things I can't talk about because unlike the grifters out there pushing data, I actually have to have transparency and verification, right, and data to stand up in a court of law, but I can tell you this. What we want to look at first is the data that's out that's purported to be Hunter Biden's laptop. We wanted to see if there was any forensic format or any forensic validity to it, and there was none.Jim, I think what surprised that, if you're looking at data from 4Chan or from a site like Marco Polo, you have to have forensic validity. And I am shocked that anybody in Congress would use that data or any journalist would even use those sources because what we found out, and we do have the data, we have the 1's and zeroes. We have the facts based, you know, analysis based on the 1's and zeroes that we have, we found these are very same folks. We have videos. We have them self-identifying. They're manipulating the data. We have people using words like Steve Bannon, like editorial creativity, and we have specific instances of fabrication manipulation of the data. So what I would warn Congress and warn any journalist out there is that the data that's in the public sphere right now has no relation to any forensic copy that's attached to a Hunter Biden laptop. And it looks like to us that most of the data is curated. It is almost like mixed tape, multiple data sources that's gone through the hands of 30 or 40 people. And so, again, you know, if the two main teams are Rudy Giuliani running the Russian-Ukrainian data and Steve Bannon under Lao, you know, a Chinese -- you know, an individual Chinese national that's been arrested, I don't think you should be actually looking at those sources because you have felons and people that have been disbarred that are really running this Hunter Biden fiasco. And, you know, that's really why I was drawn to the case because I just wanted to see what the data was and for us, you know, for us it's the 1's and zeroes. We can just go right in and we can plow through it and we can see what's true and what's Memorex. And what we found out is that a lot of the things that they say aren't validated or ridiculous, and we've even found cases of fabricating data.",

We're looking at July of 2023, we're now two and a half years removed from January 6th and I think that he believes that there is going to be no accountability at this point for what happened on January 6th. I know we have the classified docs, but it goes to the fact that we're in a new world, right? And I think that everybody has to look at the sourcing and the people that are saying these things and I think that Trump really is maybe the presumptive nominee. I think he knows that, and I think a lot of individuals out there who thought that maybe this would just go away, it's not. We need to nip this in the bud and we need to look at January 6th for what it is, we need to look at disinformation for what it is, and we need to get back to truth.

I'm not a special operator, I'm just a woman and a mother that served overseas and have a different perspective like so many. And I was tired of hearing all of these stories just about men and husbands and drinking and alcoholism and abuse and PTSD and trauma, and I wanted to show that there are mothers and wives and women out there that are fighting on these front lines doing the same types of things.And I wanted to show others that you can go through this journey, but it doesn't have to be everything. It doesn't have to be the thing that happened to you. You can overcome it. You can get better, you can heal and you can grow, and when you use tools like journalling and art therapy and CBT and other forms of psychedelics and those types, you can heal. You can truly get better. And it is important and imperative for us to share our stories or we're going to end up like the rest of the veterans of our generation where nobody knows our stories and we don't learn from our own history. We have to put them on paper. And it helps me heal and I'm hoping that this book will not only be a tool for me to continue to heal but for people who don't -- who have family members who don't understand what others are going through, who are struggling with PTSD and can't understand why they react the way they react, or struggle with certain things they do, this is the book for you.
