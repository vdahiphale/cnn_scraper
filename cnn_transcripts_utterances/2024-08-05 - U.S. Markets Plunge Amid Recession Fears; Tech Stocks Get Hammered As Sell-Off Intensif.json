Oh, give him the gavel. Oh, there we go. One, two, three. Thank goodness. The day is over. You see, excuse me, you see the Dow off two-and-a-half percent. The triple stack is equally unpleasant, if not worse for the NASDAQ where we are down three-and-a-half percent. But all in all, those are the markets and the markets are the main events of the day. A wave of fear: That`s global markets from Tokyo to New York and all points in between. Tech stocks including the darling NVIDIA take the bulk of the pain. Another news that we`re watching tonight, in Bangladesh, the prime minister resigns after 15 years in office after mass government protesters and unrest. Live in New York on Monday, it is August the 5th. I am Richard Quest and yes, I mean business. Good evening. We begin tonight as Wall Street suffers its worst day in two years. The Dow falling more than a thousand points, you saw the close a second or two ago? The S&amp;P and the NASDAQ, broader markets and tech stocks down three percent, and take a look. Just look. Intel off another seven. Every stock in the Dow is lower and it is tech -- Amazon, Cisco, Apple, Intel -- that are bearing the brunt. Even the value stocks -- PNG, Caterpillar, Walmart, Home Depot -- the top of the market, they are still falling, but by no means as much. It is anxiety. The selling started in Asia. Japan -- good grief, 12.5 percent off. Seoul`s Kospi down nearly nine percent and in Europe, much more modest losses, but still sizable nonetheless. I0nvestors are worried that the Fed has waited too long to cut interest rates. Quincy Krosby is the chief global strategist at LPL Financial. Now, Quincy, let`s accept that markets like pendulums tend to overreact one way and then the other. So there is an equilibrium that will be found in time. So if we take away the initial knee jerk, do you think it is justified that markets are falling?",

One is the potential growthscare that began last week with a package of data that worried the market to see whether the Fed was perhaps behind the curve, then you have on top of that concerns about the individual stocks with Berkshire Hathaway, for example, selling another major tranche of Apple, despite the fact that Apple actually did quite well in the earnings call. And the question then is, what are they seeing about the markets? Where are they seeing about the economy. And then on top of all of that, you have other questions about big tech as we`ve heard about the integration of generative AI despite all of the money that they are spending in terms of capital expenditures. And then as you pointed out, Richard, the NVIDIA today coming out early in the morning, suggesting that they are going to delay a major shipment of their chips because of a problem. So all of this combined and then as you know, then on top of that, you get the margin calls. On top of that, you get the carry trade out of the yen, you know, spooking the market. And you have then the Bank of Japan suddenly over the last week becoming much more hawkish, again helping to push down the yen vis-a-vis the dollar.",

We could see a range of potential remedies from the court, but if the court comes after these core -- these exclusive deals that Google comes to with search engine, with web browsers, with device makers could take a real aim at Google`s core business. And of course, this all gets back to the story that we`re talking about with AI here where investors are going to want to see these big tech companies focusing on their core businesses rather than the future potential of AI gains.

Thank you, Clare Duffy.Japan`s Nikkei fell sharply, indeed, down at 12 percent with the volatility in the country Yen is up 10 percent over the last month, the highest since the start of the year. We are talking about the yen carry trade. It is where investors leverage low interest rates in Japan, invest the money elsewhere, and the carry trade -- Julia is with me. Julia, we all -- the carry trade is a very dangerous prickly animal, which when done properly reaps great rewards. But if you`re on the wrong side of the carry trade as some are, then its game over. JULIA CHATTERLEY, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR, \"FIRST MOVE\": Yes, ripples of the financial crisis, Richard, where we saw an unwind like this happen and it causes what can be described as chaos elsewhere. Gold star to whoever wrote that introduction, by the way, because this is a missing piece, I think today of the jigsaw puzzle. What we`ve seen is a lot of investors borrowing money in a country like Japan where interest rates have been low for forever, let`s be clear, and then they get U.S. dollars and they invest in U.S. or other assets around the world. But the problem is, if the Japanese yen started strengthening, they then have to buy those yen back and they have to sell the dollars, which means they have to sell the assets that they have bought elsewhere around the world that`s fed into the fear that we`ve seen today. So that`s just one of the components that are going on. The big question is, do we continue to see the yen rise? Because that cycle will continue. There are a lot of funds out there, Richard, that remain long -- the Japanese, sorry-- short the Japanese yen and if the Japanese yen continues to rise, they will have to continue to sell other assets around the world and this has nothing to do with the U.S. recession fears by the way, but it feeds into it.",

But Richard, it reminds me that we never know what elections will be about at the end there often about different things than they were at the beginning. In 2008, Barack Obama likely would not have been the Democratic nominee, have the election started out as a big economic election.

President Biden is holding crisis talks with his National Security team amidst fear of all-out war in the Middle East. The U.S. is tightening defense cooperation with Israel as it braces for a threatened attack by Iran. The head of the U.S. Central Command is in Israel right now assessing the security situation. You`ll hear from the U.S. secretary of state in a moment. The U.S. Secretary of State has been speaking about the unrest in the Middle East and the measures that the United States is taking. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  We are engaged in intense diplomacy pretty much around the clock, with a very simple message. All parties must refrain from escalation. All parties must take steps to ease tensions. Escalation is not in anyone`s interests. It will only lead to more conflict, more violence, more insecurity. It`s also critical that we break this cycle by reaching a ceasefire in Gaza. That in turn will unlock possibilities for more enduring calm, not only in Gaza itself, but in other areas where the conflict could spread. So, for the United States, for many other countries, both in the region and beyond this is our focus. And What it comes down to really is all parties finding ways to come to an agreement, not look for reasons to delay or to say no. It is urgent that all parties make the right choices in the hours and days ahead. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And then, of course, you`ve got the sovereign debt crisis and you have the pandemic crisis. In all of those cases, there were absolutely extraneous and exogenous events that were going to push things even worse than you`d expect. That does not exist now. What you have is a Fed that has raised interest rates, if you will, given the patient 11 doses of medicine in a short period of time, and the patient has responded exactly as we intended. Inflation came down dramatically, but the corollary to that on the other side is that the slowdown that was created has raised unemployment and made it more difficult to hire workers. Again, all as predicted. And now, the Fed has the tricky task of deciding, do they cut by a quarter or a half? Do they take a risk with inflation and undo, or is the downside too much? I don`t know what the answer is. And neither do you. And maybe the Fed doesn`t either. But the reality is, yes, what`s happened today is nasty, but, B, it`s not a crisis.
