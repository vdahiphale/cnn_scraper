Also Ukraine's President visits the flooded region of Kherson after the breach earlier this week of a critical dam.And 75 million people in the U.S. are under air quality alerts because of wildfires in Canada. We'll ask CNN's Chief Climate Correspondent if it's a sign of the times. At least six people have been wounded in France after a man with a knife attacks them. It happened at a park in the city of Annecy earlier on Thursday four children are amongst the victims. Police have arrested one person who has not released his name or a motive.

What we understand has happened this morning.And there is some pretty troubling video footage taken by bystanders that is beginning to emerge of what appears to show this young man now taken in custody. We know that he survived which is unusual because of course at this point, you would expect police to have neutralized him Tuesday, the French expression that tends to get used to these times. And he went on a fairly frenzied rampage with a knife and targeted specifically, Max. And this is what the video images that are just almost too shocking to watch show that he pushes adults out of the way to target these very young children now. It's very hard in France right now. There would have been a lot of people at this park, which is right next to the Annecy Lake, very picturesque part of France. These young children as we understand we're talking about pre-school age, so very young children who are in that park. And then he appears as he went on that rampage going very deliberately from target to target rather slowly as well. Really looking for the small children and stabbing them. What we now know at this hour, Max, is that there are four children, two adults are understood to be in critical condition with a few of those now between life and death. That's what the French President has tweeted just a short while ago. But again, an entire country shaken by what's happened this morning, on the edges of the Annecy Lakers about 9:45 French time, extremely unusual that children should be targeted for the time being, Max, the anti-terror, prosecutors haven't been seized of the case. This is something that we're told they're watching. But a lot more to be uncovered about the precise identity of this young man and what his motive may have been. But for the time being, the police do not look like they're looking at some grand terror plot. Rather one man who went on the rampage this morning, tragically, next to this lake in Southeastern France, Max.",

So in the Ukraine, where a military commander says at least 600 square kilometers of the Kherson region are underwater following Tuesday's dam collapse. And a humanitarian organization is warning that floating land mines and are posing a huge safety risk.Moscow and Kyiv are both accusing each other of shelling the flood stricken area during evacuation efforts. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, meanwhile, visited the region earlier and called for a clear and quick global response to the disaster. Clare Sebastian joins me now.

He has been somewhat critical of the response from the west.And we're hearing that from a number of Ukrainian voices that there's too much what they call both sides is in Ukraine thinks this is a very clear cut incident that Russia did this. Of course, we don't have any proof as of yet. But as you say, we are getting more of a sense of the damage here. The Ukrainians as of 6 o'clock this morning said that just say of 2000 people had been evacuated. There warning as you say aid agencies warning about landmines floating that had been dislodged by the flooding. There are hundreds of thousands of people without drinking water, according to President Zelenskyy. And now we're hearing of millions of tons of crops that might have been damaged, not to mention the long term damage of the destruction of that agricultural land. [08:05:00] We're also getting the first reports, Max, of deaths as a result of the flooding three in Alaska which is Russian controlled that's according to the Ukrainian Mayor of that city. He says more could be coming. A lot of the people left in that town on the frontline are pensioners and people who might not have had the kind of mobility needed to get out of the way. At least five in Nova Kakhovka, according to the Russian Mayor there that's the town adjacent to that and we're now hearing of one man who died in Mykolaiv. This is a Ukrainian held region north of the river itself north of the Kherson region. So I think this is really just sort of the beginning of getting a sense of the impact here.",

The Kremlin says the discussion is centered around, ensuring the stability of the global energy market, along with measures for strengthening trade and economic ties between Moscow and Riyadh.America's top diplomat, meanwhile, is in the Saudi Arabia on a diplomatic mission aimed at setting relations between both countries a short while ago. At a conference in Riyadh, Antony Blinken announced the U.S. would provide nearly $150 million the areas in Syria and Iraq that were liberated from ISIS. Blinken's visit comes after years of deepening disagreements between Washington and Riyadh on a range of issues including oil prices and human rights, certainly to North America where raging wildfires in Canada have created a health hazard for some 75 million people in the U.S. These are live pictures from New York City which has been blanketed in haze for days now.

      "sentences": "Yes, Max, we're starting to get some indication that the wildfire conditions are improving across central Quebec, the boreal forest that continues to burn that has produced the smoke that's blanketed the East Coast those conditions are improving. And that's good news.And the reason we're noticing this is because a significant improvement in the quality of the air and the visibility of the air too, across some of the areas that yesterday were so hardest hit, we're talking about Ottawa and Montreal. Now that doesn't help much for the East Coast cities, of course, New York to D.C. and Philadelphia, still shrouded in very thick smoke, hazardous levels of air quality currently reported there. But it is so interesting to note what is happening across southern sections of Quebec, even into Northern New England, we're starting to receive a good report that's the green dot on the air quality index, when yesterday there were significant reports of degrading air quality throughout this region. So we look upstream to see what's actually coming for the East Coast cities. And we can track that with what is called a near surface smoke forecast. So there are the wildfires in central Quebec. There's the plume of smoke emanating all the way to the east coast. But we advanced this, and you start to see some clearing taking place from north to south. Now, this is all dependent on the wind direction. And of course, what's bad for someone today and maybe worse for somebody else tomorrow. But the long standing trend here is a general improvement in the weather patterns as we head into the early weekend, across the East Coast cities New York, Boston, the nation's capital Baltimore as well. But while it has been bad, and in fact, currently, right now, both Detroit and New York City top the world's most polluted cities in terms of major metropolitans. And late Wednesday evening, we had hazardous air for some of these larger population densities, including Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, off the charts hazardous in fact. The weather pattern has been very stagnant. But this upper level low pattern has been responsible now for producing cloud cover, and even some rain. So what that does is it actually helps suppress some of the pollution levels. And that's what we're forecasting to continue. And then by the early parts of next week, a proper cold front will move through the eastern half of North America and help clear out the weather conditions completely. But you can see the rainfall forecast here, Max, at least a glimmer of hope here for people along the east coast and into Quebec as well with wildfires burned.",

Trump's Former Vice President had one message during Wednesday's Town Hall on CNN, he and Trump are very different. Just hours after announcing a Presidential bid, Mike Pence laid out all the differences between him, Trump and the other Republican contenders. Pence criticized his Former Boss for urging him to overturn some states Electoral College votes in the 2020 election. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MIKE PENCE, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We say what I said today was that anyone who puts themselves above the constitution should never be President in the first place. And anyone who asks anyone else to put them over the constitution should never be President again.

He spent four days here but he also keeps a very busy schedule.So there's a tight balance here and whether or not they can allow him to keep the schedule he wants to keep and keep him healthy. And so they're telling us it could be up to 10 days around more or less 10 days that he'll be in the hospital here recovering. His people say he's still working. He was working yesterday cracking jokes yesterday right out of surgery. This surgery lasted about three hours. He was lucid, they told us right after and you know, it's we don't know if we're going to hear from him directly at any point or we'll see him the last time he was in the hospital. He was making the rounds visiting sick children and things like that.

According to end data, this is the Chinese Box Office tracker. In Mainland China, the film made only $2.7 million in its first five days. And compare that to Spider Man across the Spider Verse, which brought in nearly $20 million in the first five days of opening. Now some in Mainland China have shared their objections online one that is in on mall yet. It's a Chinese Box Office platform, said that \"the fairy tale that I grew up with has changed beyond recognition\". And Chinese state media has encouraged such reactions. In fact, an op- ed published right before the film's debut in China, in the Global Times said this \"The controversy surrounding Disney's forced inclusion of minorities in classic films is not about racism, but its lazy and irresponsible storytelling strategy\". Disney declined to comment. Similar reactions we found online in South Korea, with one user saying the movie had been \"ruined, along with the hash tag not my Ariel\". According to the Korean Film Council in South Korea, The Little Mermaid attracted some 472,000 viewers in its first week and compare that to the near 643,000 fans have showed up for the latest Fast and Furious sequel over the same period.
