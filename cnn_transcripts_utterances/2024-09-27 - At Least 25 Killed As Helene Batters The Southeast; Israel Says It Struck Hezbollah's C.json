I'm Jake Tapper.And we are following our breaking news on Helene, a monstrous deadly storm that is leaving large parts of the southeastern United States in shambles. Life-threatening conditions continuing across multiple states in the U.S., as at least 25 (VIDEO GAP), including a 4-year-old girl killed in a car wreck in Claremont, North Carolina. Right now, hundreds of miles, hundreds of miles north of where Helene made landfall as a category four hurricane in Florida, emergency situations are still unfolding more than 50 people are stranded on the roof of a hospital in Irwin, Tennessee, right now, that complex surrounded by many feet of water. Nearby in the western mountainous region of North Carolina, Helene is compounding a rainstorm from Wednesday together more than 30 inches if rain fell in 48 hours. We're learning that a dam failure in Lake Lore is, quote, imminent. The state's transportation department says all roads in western North Carolina should be considered closed. On to Georgia, where more than 11 people have been killed and multiple people are still trapped inside buildings, flash flood emergencies have led to at least 100 water rescues including in the major metropolitan city of Atlanta. And, of course, there's ground zero, in Florida's big bend region where the panhandle meets the peninsula. Search and rescue efforts are underway in areas hit by significant in storm surge there. The Pinellas County sheriff compared barrier island roadways to a war zone. We're going to take you live to those areas in a moment. But we are following another major breaking story in the Middle East. Several huge explosions earlier in the Lebanese capital of Beirut, Israel's Defense Forces say they've struck Hezbollah's headquarters and Israeli official tells CNN that Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was the target. His fate is currently unknown. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is speaking now after Israel says it targeted the leader of Hezbollah. Let's listen in.",

Hezbollah has fired some 65 rockets in just the last hour since this strike in Beirut and we anticipate that more are likely soon to follow.At the same time, the Israeli military has also been continuing to strike targets inside of Lebanon. And so this situation is only continuing to escalate. However, what we have yet to see, Jake, from Hezbollah is what Israeli officials have been telling me for months now, they anticipated in the event of a major escalation and that is Hezbollah firing not just hundreds of rockets a day, but hundreds of rockets simultaneously to try to overwhelm Israeli -- Israel's air defense systems. And as of now, we have yet to see Hezbollah use that kind of firepower, used that kind of synchronized attack against Israel. Part of that may be due to the fact that Israeli attacks over the course of the last week-and-a-half have significantly -- have dealt a significant blow to Hezbollah, a part of it may also be that they were have been calculating what could potentially lead to that Israeli ground invasion. That multiple Israeli generals have now said the Israeli military is preparing for. And certainly Jake, that is on the minds of many tonight in this region, whether or not Israeli ground forces could soon move into Lebanon. I was driving up in northern Israel today, we actually did see multiple groupings of tanks in certain areas, although it's not clear whether Israel has amassed the kind of manpower and resources yet to carry out such a ground operation.

Why is that so important? At the end of the Trump administration, Iran had about $4 billion in foreign reserves. That's not a lot. Their economy was in a freefall. When those sanctions were essentially not enforced by the Biden administration, Iran's exporting about 7 -- almost 3 million barrels a day they now, and they've got about $80 billion in foreign reserves. And we know what they're doing with that, Jake, they are funding equipping, and training Hezbollah, the Houthis and Hamas.

We just heard a few words from Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, who with characteristic, laconicness and also bluntness, said the U.S. had nothing to do with you Israeli strikes against Hezbollah in Lebanon and the United States did not have advanced warning.CNN's national security correspondent Kylie Atwood is with me. Kylie, very interesting words there. I don't want to read too much into it, but it seemed to be an expression of displeasure.",

And if you contrast what you heard from Secretary Austin with what we heard from Republican Senator Dan Sullivan of Alaska, I mean, there's a real contrast in how much one is hugging the ally Israel versus some distance.Definitely, Secretary Austin seemed to be putting at least some distance between the United States and Israel when it comes to the strike, which no doubt took a huge civilian toll based on the fact that several buildings were flattened in the middle of downtown Beirut. CNN's Oren Liebermann is also joining us now from the Pentagon. Oren, the secretary of defense does not usually make these kinds of statements getting off a plane and talking to reporters. The fact that we did just getting off the plane is significant and what he said and did not say also significant.",

      "sentences": "Absolutely. And, crucially, the Pentagon here as well as Defense Secretary LloydAustin made it clear that they were looking for more information from the Israelis and were keen to repeatedly point out that they do not think the notification they got from the Israelis, which is just a few minutes heads-up with airplanes in the air qualifies as true advanced notification. And I think you've got a sense of that frustration not only from the Pentagon here in a briefing earlier today, but from Austin's words and it's worth pointing out, this isn't the first time we have heard this level of frustration over the course of the last several days right before Israel carried out an operation that exploded Hezbollah pagers in Lebanon ten days ago, Israelis were saying, yes, we gave notification the Americans were saying, look whatever you call that notification, we got no details on what was about to happen, especially because of the range of Israeli operations in Lebanon we have seen since Hezbollah started firing rockets on October 8. So there's clearly an effort here to get on the same page and there will be clearly be more discussions between Austin and his Israeli counterpart, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. Of course this happens with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in New York here for the U.N. general assembly. He's now rushing back to Israel, flying on the Sabbath, which is not something you see the Israeli prime minister generally do here. And you also see the picture released of him ordering the strike while he was in New York. It's also worth noting that the call between Gallant and Austin, this call were the Israelis are claiming they gave lets sort of early notification that happened while Austin was on the flight back from London. So clearly this situation here, moving very rapidly, rapidly here, the U.S. trying to not only stay on top of it, but trying to see if there's some daylight here to get back to the diplomacy that seems so desperately far away at this point.",

He had a group that the United States considers to be a terrorist group. And before 911, Hezbollah had killed more Americans than any other terrorist group in the world, the issue would the civilian casualties and the bombing of downtown Beirut and several apartment buildings where if the Israelis are correct and we still do not know if they were correct, there were many members of Hezbollah, this terrorist group, but also in all certainty, there had to have been civilians.Now, there will be the argument made by defenders of Israel that this is what happens when terrorist groups embed themselves within civilian population. But still, this would be the issue, I believe.",

You're absolutely right to point out that Hassan Nasrallah is the leader of an organization that the U.S. has considered a terrorist organization since 1997. I just looked this up on the State Department website a short time ago. So, four years before 9/11.The issue of whether Nasrallah is alive or dead, of course, that's a critical intelligence issue. But this is somebody who the U.S. absolutely considers the leaders of not only one of the largest terrorist organizations in the world, but one of the most powerful non-state actors in the world. Clearly though, after nearly a year of war in Gaza and risks of inflaming the region that we have heard repeatedly, the U.S. concern is as you point out, not only the civilian death toll already and the potential for that to skyrocket in a wider war. But it is exactly the effort to try to avoid that wider war. The question now isn't just Israel and Hezbollah, its does Iran feel the need to get involved at this point? And that's not just a question of they never responded to the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. They now have potentially the leader of their most powerful proxy in the world who the Israelis were going after. So does that necessitate something above and beyond what we saw back in April, which in and of itself was a massive barrage from the Iranians. That's what the U.S. will be watching for right now, and certainly in the coming days.",
