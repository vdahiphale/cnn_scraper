Good evening once more. And tonight, former US President Jimmy Carter's state funeral is set for January the 9th. President Biden declaring it a National Day of Mourning. And the nation is reflecting on Carter's life and legacy. He died in his hometown of Plains, Georgia on Sunday at the age of 100. His presidency from 1977 to 1981 was beset by crises at home and abroad, but the work he did after leaving the White House, however, has been widely praised. Biden highlighted that legacy in his remarks over the weekend. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He worked to eradicate disease, not just at home, but around the world.He forged peace, advanced civil rights, human rights. He promoted free and fair elections around the world. He built housing and homes for the homeless with his own hands and his compassion and moral clarity lifted people up and changed lives and saved lives all over the globe. Stephen Collinson is with me. Stephen, a presidency remembered, perhaps for deep blows to the American economy, to her standing abroad during that time as well.

Before he came along, presidents generally were not active or key global figures, but he was a statesman. He won the Nobel Prize after leaving the White House. I think you can credibly argue that in 1994, he was instrumental as a presidential envoy in preventing a war between North Korea and the United States, or at least the serious threat of one. He helped forestall a US invasion of Haiti. He went to the developing world scores of times, even into his 90s, to moderate elections, to further the cause of democracy. So I think although he did some pretty significant things during his presidency, not least the Camp David Peace Accords between Israel and Egypt, without which the violence of recent years in the Middle East would no doubt have been much worse. He will be remembered for that post-presidential service, which showed that presidents can still be a force after they leave office.",

But at the same time, this is an exclusive group of people who knew what it was like to sit in the Oval Office. Trump, the president-elect made that point specifically in his tribute to Carter. One of the most poignant things, I think, in the coming days is that a one-term Democratic president who had a difficult presidency on the economy will be eulogized in one of his last acts as president by President Joe Biden, who has very much a similar experience. And just because he is leaving office at the age of 82, he will not have the years and the decades that Carter had to refashion his legacy and the way that Americans see him. And I think it is going to be quite poignant to see Biden, who was one of the first key politicians in Washington to endorse Carter in 1976. Closing this chapter, after all, Carter and Biden are probably the only active politicians and political figures who are still around from the late 1970s.

This video appears to show Dr. Hussam Abu Safia, walking towards an Israeli tank on Friday. He is apparently being held at a military base that doubles as a detention facility, that's according to recently released detainees. The Israeli military suspects the doctor of being a \"Hamas terrorist operative.\" They also claimed the hospital was being used by Hamas. An Israeli raid severely damaged the hospital on Friday. It was the last functioning hospital in Northern Gaza, and it has since been evacuated and shut down. Medecins Sans Frontieres or Doctors Without Borders accuses Israel of destroying the health system in Gaza. In a recent report, the humanitarian group says attacks on civilians, the dismantling of the health care system, the deprivation of food, water, and supplies are a form of collective punishment inflicted by the Israeli authorities on the people of Gaza. Christopher Lockyear is the secretary general of MSF and he joins us now. Christopher, good to have you with us. This report is devastating in detail, and it is terribly bleak about the future, too even if the conflict ends today. Just describe the level of suffering that you and your people are seeing there, and what you describe as a situation being worsened by \"shameful, deliberate attempts to limit humanitarian aid.\" CHRISTOPHER LOCKYEAR IS THE SECRETARY GENERAL OF MEDECINS SANS FRONTIERES: Well, what our teams are witnessing is almost impossible to describe, which is why we've gone into the detail that we have in this report and in this report, what we are really saying is, I mean, with the release of this report, we are really saying two things in a nutshell. What we are saying is in the north of Gaza, as you were just referencing then, we are seeing a population which is being forcibly displaced, trapped, and bombed, and we are therefore seeing clear signs of ethnic cleansing in the north of Gaza. And what we are saying more broadly than that in the Gaza strip as a whole, and what we've been illustrating with this report, is that what our medical teams are seeing on the ground is consistent with what a growing number of legal experts and organizations are saying is indicative of genocide happening in the Gaza Strip. Now, as a medical humanitarian organization, we have teams on the ground, but we are not legal in the sense of being able to determine intent, which is a clear pillar of genocide being carried out. However, looking at the forced displacement, looking at the mass and often indiscriminate killing of people, looking at the harm, the physical and mental harm to tens of thousands of people, not even speaking of the excess deaths which are going to be caused by the attacks on healthcare, the forced displacement and the consequences of a restriction of aid, which has been going on for months.

Admirers from around the world would visit the former president every week and to this day, Plains has a population of just 600 people. Carter's term in office was marked by World shifting events. His crowning achievement was the peace treaty he brokered between Israel and Egypt, but the Iranian hostage crisis and a tough economic situation with high inflation at home doomed his reelection bid.

And by that, I mean, he was astonishingly skilled at an incredible number of things. He was a patriot who served as an officer in the nuclear submarine force.He was an engineer, a farmer, a poet. He was an author of 32 books. He was a world class wood maker. He was a fly fisherman, and he was a great -- a great -- really expert on music. He once told me that even when he was in the Naval Academy, he could listen to different records of the same symphony being recorded and tell who was actually the soloist. And his passion went not only from classical music, but it went to country and western. And it served a very important political purpose. When he was running as an unknown in 1976 the Almond Brothers, Willie Nelson, Bob Dylan, all flocked to him, and they were very useful in terms of raising money. Andy Warhol did a wonderful painting that was sold. So, he had this eclectic capacity across lines. Now that's just on the personal side. In terms of being president, I think it's one of the most underrated presidents that we've had in American history. And that he was indeed one of the most consequential that we've had in one term. And I say that for the following reasons. First, at home, the energy security we enjoy in the United States today, as the number one producer of oil and natural gas came from his energy bills. All the ethics legislation that we have was his. The Department of Education, he created. He was a great environmentalist, I think, the greatest since Theodore Roosevelt. Doubling the size of the national park system through the Alaska lands bill. And you mentioned in your intro even Senator Graham, conservative senator from Texas, said at his 100th birthday in the op ed on Wall Street Journal, what I have said for many years, which is his deregulation was transformative for the entire American economy. He deregulated airlines and made air travel affordable for the middle class.

Number one, I call it the three I's. Inner party warfare with the liberal wing of the party. Ted Kennedy ran against him, divided the party and never reconciled. Inflation. Just as Joe Biden has been a victim, we were the victim with much higher inflation.Largely due to the fact of the Iranian cut off of oil from the revolution. But here's an important story and it shows how courageous he was, and how he viewed politics as secondary to doing the right thing, as he could say. July 1979, inflation is roaring and he decides he's going to appoint, over everyone's objection, Paul Volcker, the head the Fed. And Volcker said to him in the Oval Office, Mr. President, I want you to understand, if I take this job, I'm going to have to choke inflation out of the economy. And they have to do things that would be very painful politically. And you're going into a reelection year and the President said, I don't want my legacy to be high inflation. I want you to do what you need to do on the economy. I'll take care of the politics. Well, the fact is, inflation did drop like a rock because of the high interest rates, but only in the first two years of Reagan, well after we had lost the election. CHATTERLEY: It's fascinating that they even had that discussion, Stuart, to your point, but it was policies, I guess, and people before politics because you know that doing that perhaps is going to bring inflation down, but it's certainly not going to win you votes which I think is your point.",

The S&amp;P 100 is set to end the year up 20 percent that's after it ended up 23 percent last year. And those back-to-back 20 percent gains are really rare. The last time that happened was in 1997 and 98. And look, I think this is all, as you said, thanks to the really strong economic fundamentals that we've seen this year.We saw inflation cooling, the Fed starting to cut rates. We saw really strong consumer spending. A solid job market, as you said, the stock market, of course, also reacted positively to the reelection of Donald Trump and this expectation that we would see a more business-friendly administration taking the White House next year. And then, of course, we have the stunning gains that we saw for tech stocks on the back of all of this hype around artificial intelligence. That really largely drove markets this year. There are some risks, I think, heading into 2025 especially as you look at the market's reliance on those tech stocks. But largely, analysts are expecting this to -- this rally is going to continue into next year, because that economic picture continues to look pretty bright heading into 2025.",

They made up about 50 percent of the S&amp;P 500 gains this year. Together, they're worth $18 trillion. I mean, that's just massive.And I think the expectation is that these things are going to the stocks are going to continue to grow. Investors continue to be really optimistic about their investments in artificial intelligence, and the idea that these are the companies that are really going to be the leaders in this tech revolution that is expected to change almost everything about the ways that we live and work. You also mentioned crypto. We've seen Bitcoin really rally this year. Just a few weeks ago, passed $100,000. It has since come back a little bit, but that is so far ahead of where it was at its lower point just two years ago around $16,000. And that, again, is because crypto investors are expecting the Trump White House to be really crypto friendly. Perhaps we're going to see more policies that are going to normalize this as less of a speculative investment. And again, I do think there are some risks around the concentration of the power of these tech stocks, but for now, expectations continue to be really high into the new year.",
