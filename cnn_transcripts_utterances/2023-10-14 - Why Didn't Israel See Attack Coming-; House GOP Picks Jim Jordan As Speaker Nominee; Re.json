I'm Michael Smerconish in Philadelphia.We're one week removed now from the unprovoked brutal attack by Hamas on Israel. And now Israel's military has warned 1.1 million people living in northern Gaza to evacuate their homes. Gaza's humanitarian crisis is deepening. America's top national security officials are putting up a united front in their visits to the Middle East. But behind the scenes, a difficult diplomatic challenge is brewing about public messaging on the Israel war. A source tells CNN that the State Department sent an e-mail to a small group of officials who work on that messaging, instructing them not to use phrases like de-escalation, ceasefire and restoring calm.

Normally, in situations like this, we would see the administration coming out to urge calm, to urge the parties, to de- escalate, we have not seen any of that in the past week. We have seen full throated support for Israel to respond to those Hamas attacks from last weekend.Secretary Blinken has been traveling in the region, and every one of his public events he has spoken about Israel's right to respond. Yesterday, he said these were not retaliatory operations that have been carried out. These would not be retaliatory if Israel chose -- was to launch a ground incursion. In fact, he said these would be defensive in order to ensure that something like this does not happen again. And he said that if something happened like this in America, America would respond in the same way. And so behind the scenes, we have also seen this reflected in that e- mail that you reference that went out to this small group of officials who work on the public messaging, urging them to reflect the messaging we have heard from Secretary Blinken from President Biden to not use those phrases like de-escalation, like ceasefire, like urgent, calm, they want this to be a united front on all fronts when it comes to how the administration is talking about this war in Israel. I should note that this was a small group, I'm told, this was not a diplomatic cable that went out to a lot of embassies or anything like that. But it is notable that they are trying to put up such a unified front as this incursion seems imminent. Michael?",

We do know that the Israelis have saturated that border with Gaza with 300,000 troops mobilized there. And they have been in the last 24 hours conducting what they describe as raids into Gaza to try and discover and collect evidence of hostages, so 100, 250 hostages we know, a number of them, Americans being held by Hamas, and also these raids to try and sort of denigrate or destroy any Hamas infrastructure. So, the short answer to your question is we don't know when this wider conflict will start. We don't know when this wider military assault will begin. And we don't know what the scope of it will be. So what we do know is that the U.N. is telling us it is almost impossible to get everybody evacuated out of Northern Gaza.

Friday, Ohio GOP Congressman Jim Jordan was nominated to be speaker after garnering support from both deposed speaker Kevin McCarthy and from Fox anchor Sean Hannity. Without a leader the GOP has frozen the chamber during several looming crises from Israel's war against Hamas to a potential government shutdown now just 34 days away. It's unclear if Jordan can win enough support from the entire House to get the requisite 217 votes.In a secret ballot on Friday, he still had 55 Republicans opposed. Joining me now is the person who started this whole chain of events by pushing for McCarthy's ouster Florida Representative Matt Gaetz. Congressman, do you regret ousting Kevin McCarthy given that Israel is now at war with Hamas and we don't have a speaker? REP. MATT GAETZ (R-FL): Absolutely not. The United States stands with Israel, Israel has a right to defend itself. And there is no need expressed by Israel that the United States has not been able to meet. That's because we have an Israel essentially on auto pay. As a consequence of legislation that was passed by Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, the administration is preauthorized to meet any need that Israel could possibly express in this particular phase of the crisis. My expectation is that we will elect speaker designate Jim Jordan as House Speaker next week, and will be prepared to move forward with resolutions of support.

It's quite a different thing to stand on the floor of the House of Representatives and vote against the second most popular living Republican in America. I know how hard it is to stand on the floor and vote against the party's choice. I did it to extract concessions that I thought were meaningful that unfortunately, the former speaker did not live up to. But my expectation is that next week, we will elect Jim Jordan. Frankly, Michael, I think we probably could have done it last night, and I would have preferred that path.

In fact, when we had our defense bill, our $896 billion defense bill, Marjorie Taylor Greene was successful in getting a separate vote on the 300 million for Ukraine because of those single subject concessions we got in January. That 300 million for Ukraine still passed, but it passed with a majority of Republicans voting against it.So now we have -- for anyone to move legislation to support Ukraine, they would have to roll a majority of the Republicans who now believe we should be less involved in that conflict but that in no way diminishes our support for Israel, which is very strong in a bipartisan fashion.",

Israel has never dealt with a hostage operation on this scale before. The hostages are believed to be kept underground to hide them from efforts to locate and extract them.

It was the first time we ever did that. The United States, of course, the embassy was there. The U.S. ambassador of Qatar kicked it off. And the bottom line is they are very capable.They're enthusiastic. They want to be brokers in the region and they are very effective as interlocutors. We have seen that with the relationships that they have with the Taliban. So, I think you can't shut off any avenues you have to possible negotiations down the line.",

I'm going to put on the screen and read to you and everybody else the statement that he released.He said, I will not tiptoe around this simple fact. What Hamas did is evil and there is no defense for terrorism. This shouldn't be hard. Sadly, too many people in elite academia have been so weakened by their moral confusion that when they see videos of raped women, hear of beheaded babies, or learn of a grandmother murdered in her home, the first reaction of some is to provide context and try to blame the raped women, beheaded baby, or the murdered grandmother. In other grotesque cases, they express simple support for the terrorists. This thinking isn't just wrong, it's sickening. It's dehumanizing. It is beneath people called to educate our next generation of Americans. I am thankful to say I haven't seen examples of that here at U.F., either from the faculty or our student body. Your take on what Ben Sasse had to say?",

I mean, our personal position -- our position at FIRE is that we think universities should express more political neutrality on big issues of the world.But, for example, the University of Virginia came out and said, we're concerned about our students in Israel. We're concerned about our students who are there and their families. And I thought that was perfect. I think that -- actually in many schools they comment on too many political issues. But I think Ben Sasse was clearly within his rights to say that. And I'm pretty sure he also came out with a pretty good statement defending the free speech rights of his faculty and students at the same time.",
