This was in a wrongful death lawsuit from a couple that sued after a doctor, they said, dropped their frozen embryos. But it has caused one of the leading hospital systems in the state to already stop actually performing certain IVF procedures for fear of being held criminally liable for wrongful death or to receive punitive damages. Nikki Haley was asked about this -- whether she considers a frozen embryo to be a baby -- and this is how she answered. She was also then pressed on CNN last night to explain further. Watch this.

She's tried to take a softer tone on abortion than some of her Republican rivals did in the primary, although her critics will point out that she still has said that she supports restrictions on abortion that don't -- that mean that tone doesn't necessarily line up with what she would do. But she did talk about how she went through IVF with her -- with her son. And as this debate plays out there is going to be this tension between what Haley seemed to be trying to say there, which is that for parents trying to conceive -- for them, that frozen embryo is possibly a child. On the other hand, if it's defined that way in the law, it actually is going to make it likely impossible to actually pursue IVF at all. So there's real tension there in exploring this really deeply nuanced issue that I think is going to be something that is going to be central as the presidential campaign continues. All right, let's go now to this legal news. Arizona prosecutors refusing to extradite the suspect in the brutal murder of a woman in a New York City hotel.

They also cite the decrease in murders and shootings in New York City. The suspect is being held without bail in Arizona where police say he stabbed two women and also told them that he was wanted for a homicide in New York. Let's bring in CNN legal analyst, Joey Jackson. Joey, it's good to see you. Like, can you talk us through the actual, like, what's allowed under the law here? And then I want to ask you -- I mean, this has obviously got a lot of politics in it, but is Arizona allowed to do this, and why? JOEY JACKSON, CNN LEGAL ANALYST, CRIMINAL ATTORNEY (via Webex by Cisco):  Oh, the law, Kasie -- right, mixed in with the politics for sure. Look, the reality is that whether she does not want or feel comfortable or want to play politics with the issue, legally speaking, you're required to extra -- to extradite. Now, extraditing -- what does that mean? It means that one state makes a request because that state -- in this instance, New York -- based upon a murder committed and alleged that he committed it -- the defendant that you showed earlier -- the extradition requires the person to be sent by the requesting jurisdiction. That's just the law. And you can have hearings about it. You can make a big show about it. But the reality is that man, right there -- in the event there's probable cause to believe that there was criminality, you're coming back to New York regardless or irrespective of what you want to argue about the policies of the sitting district attorney. The further good news here, however -- if there could be any good news around his conduct -- alleged conduct -- is that because he's committed crimes -- alleged crimes in Arizona, there's a vested interest in Arizona prosecuting him. So it's just a matter of the timing issue with respect to when he comes back because he is, in fact, accused of carjacking and stabbing, right, women there. But the reality is regardless of what she wants to dress it up in or what embarrassment in -- and it smacks of there's an actual prosecution happening in New York on March 25 of a former president -- it smacks of a lot of politics. But legally speaking, there's a firm request to him back and at some point, he will be back.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, it's an interesting dynamic, to be sure, and already, we're seeing that play out here. In fact, what the reports are is that Manhattan prosecutors flew to Arizona to make this request and so there was discussions as it relates to that extradition. There's already the spokesperson of Manhattan making clear that hey, New York -- we have half the crime rate that Phoenix, Arizona does.So you're going to see this going back and forth with respect to, right, which state is the safer and which city within the state is the safer. Who can prosecute and who can prosecute more effectively? And that's just, at the end of the day, unfortunate. This is about someone who is alleged to have committed a murder. Murder obviously is very significant. New York and particularly, New York County -- that is Manhattan -- has a viable jurisdiction over that and certainly has an interest with regard to its citizens of holding this particular defendant and accused accountable. As a result of that, that's what the focus needs to be on. Now, at the same time, to be clear, there is a competing request in Arizona because he's alleged to have committed crimes there. But I think at the end of the day, it should be about the accountability of the defendant for the specific crimes and not about wrapping this up in a political issue of red state, blue state, we prosecute better than you do. He has a carjacking here. It's a murder there. We can do it better. He'll be in custody here. You'll let him free there. That's simply political and shouldn't happen. The people of whatever state deserve justice and I think that's what the people of New York State will get ultimately -- even if it is not, Kasie, immediately.",

      "sentences": "Welcome back.President Biden's 2024 strategy is coming under sharper focus with new plans for the border and student loan relief, as well as more aggressive attacks against the Republican frontrunner, Donald Trump. During a fundraiser in San Francisco yesterday, among other things, President Biden called Vladimir Putin a, quote, \"crazy S.O.B.\" while hammering Trump on comments that he had made likening his legal troubles to the death of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. Biden told attendees, quote, \"If I stood here 10 to 15 years ago and said all this, you'd think I should be committed.\" Here to talk about all this is CNN's Stephen Collinson, our big- picture painter extraordinaire. Stephen, always love to have you. Thank you very much for being here. Let's -- I want to read something else that the president said during a fundraiser yesterday. He told attendees this. Quote, \"As I walk out of meetings, a head of state will find an excuse to come up close and say, 'You've got to win.' Not because I'm so special. 'You've got to win because my democracy is at stake if the other guy wins.'\" He says, \"Nine heads of state have done that with me.\" It's a remarkable situation and it sort of plays into this broader question. I mean, Biden clearly thinks he's the one to beat Donald Trump. But there are a lot of Democrats who question whether that's actually the case -- at least they do in private, not in public. STEPHEN COLLINSON, CNN POLITICS WHITE HOUSE REPORTER (via Webex by Cisco):  That's right. And I think if you go back, say, six or eight weeks ago, there was a lot of hammering by Democrats not just because of the vulnerabilities of the Biden reelection campaign but because it didn't really seem to be getting going. There wasn't a great deal of evidence of a proactive campaign against Trump even though it was becoming clear that he was obviously going to be the Republican nominee. So this week, for instance -- just this week you've seen a coordinate and a sharp attempt to define the campaign for Biden. Yesterday, we got notice that the president is considering some tough measures on executive orders on immigration. That would take aim at a perceived weakness about his handling of the border among many swing voters. You mentioned student loans -- more news of student loans relief. We're seeing more coordinated attacks against Trump. Almost every day the president goes after the likely Republican nominee. The vice president has been talking a lot about abortion -- another issue where Democrats think they can do well. So there is, I think, a sense of defining this campaign running into the State of the Union address next month. We don't know whether it's going to work yet, of course. There are big issues like age and the economy. Whether the president has vulnerabilities. But I think we're seeing evidence that Biden is making a much clearer argument to voters.",

He was betting on the fact that Republican voters, in his mind, would be more interested in a president who got a lot of things done on a conservative agenda -- the MAGA agenda -- somewhat like he has been doing in Florida, using his power to push forward that kind of policy.But voters didn't really want that. They're still wedded almost to the idea of Trump as a personality. His outlandishness, his anti- establishment creed is really what binds Republican voters to the former president. They want to send someone to Washington to create a storm and they don't necessarily appear to be doing so for ideological reasons. So, DeSantis clearly is still trying to work his way through that. I think he's right that the conservative media -- and we're going to see that during the CPAC conference in Washington over this weekend -- is going to support Trump whatever he does as a media industrial complex on the right that is propping up Trump. I think the question is when the former president has to move out of that bubble, if you like, in a general election, whether he's going to be able to appeal to a broader coalition of voters. Can you just rely on concerns about the economy among people who voted for Biden and are thinking about doing so -- voting for him this time around? It's going to be very interesting to see. And I think that's why these attempts by Biden to chip away at various issues and get a few voters here, a few voters there could be crucial. Because --",
