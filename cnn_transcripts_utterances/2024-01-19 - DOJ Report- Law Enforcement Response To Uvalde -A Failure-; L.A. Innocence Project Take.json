The final report, 575 pages long, detailing how law enforcement failed to respond to the immediate threat, and continued to fail the victims and their families in the hours and days after.77 minutes. That is how long it took law enforcement to stop the massacre after the first call to 911. 77 minutes that left 19 children and two teachers dead. Now, earlier in the show, Sara spoke to the uncle of 9-year-old Jackie Cazarez, one of the students killed that day. And he said this report will help fuel their fight for justice.

It's something that these poor families will have to relive for the rest of their lives.These children were -- or just mutilated. And these police did absolutely nothing. Nothing because they were afraid of this gun. They were afraid of this rifle. This AR-15. Over and over, they said that they were hamstrung by their fear. Politicians need to stop being cowards. They need to see the videos that I've seen. They need to see what this gun does. Politicians like Ted Cruz and others need to fully and finally pass an assault weapons ban in this country so that we do not see this happen again to another child.",

There was no bus.So, the trauma and the pain wasn't just in what happened in the school itself but it continued on for hours and in fact days later.

For 77 minutes, those kids waited. Five children, five bodies, including one, who was Eva Mireles, came out with a pulse. Four of them succumbed. Eva Mireles sat there in an ambulance because they couldn't get that ambulance out of the parking lot because the arterial streets were covered with cop cars. The bus that they took had to jump curbs in sidewalks, go through a playground, to finally be able to access the street to make it to the hospital. The errors that occurred were many. It wasn't just against the local cops, the local police chief, and the sheriff.

And December 24, Scott said that at 9:30 in the morning, that was about the last time he saw her, he left. She was going to walk the dog. No one ever saw her walking the dog that at least testified at trial. But he decided he was going to go fishing on December 24. So, he got his boat. He went out into the San Francisco Bay. Wasn't there very long, according to the forensics at trial. Came back. Went to the house. She wasn't there. So, he then reported her in time to -- that she was missing. Well, months later, in April, her body -- her remains washed up on the San Francisco Bay. A day later, Conner's remains, of her unborn child, washed up. And it was two miles away from where Scott Peterson had gone fishing. I got to mention an important witness, Amber Frey.

They'll provide updates just in a bit. Let's get to CNN's Kristin Fisher. It appears the moon sniper did land but not in the Sea of Tranquility, somewhere else.KRISTIN FISHER, CNN SPACE &amp; DEFENSE CORRESPONDENT: Correct. It's called the Sea of Nectar, Sara. And what we know is that this spacecraft called SLIM, which is short for the smart lander for investigating the moon. It has touched down on the surface of the moon. But the big question is, what kind of condition is it in? The spacecraft is communicating with the ground specifically Japan Space Agency or JAXA. But did the spacecraft perhaps tip over, rollover, or worst-case scenario, did it completely crash into the surface of the moon? We just don't know yet. And we're awaiting a press conference from JAXA, the Japanese Space Agency any minute now where hopefully we will get some answers. And so, it's really too soon to say -- excuse me if this was a success or a failure. Because you know, what is the success? If you land on the moon, that is a pretty big feat in and of itself. But then if you tip over and you can't perform some of the scientific observations that you were hoping for it to perform, does that still constitute a success? So, a lot of questions here. But, Sara, if successful, this will be such a huge deal for Japan and its space agency because it will become only the fifth country in the history of the world to land on the surface of the Moon successfully. And only the third country this century. Only China and India have done it. It's been more than 50 years since the U.S. has done it which was back in 1972 at the end of the Apollo program. So, really a momentous moment for Japan Space Agency. Everybody's really holding their breath, waiting to see what is going to happen. And you know, in addition to these historic firsts potentially, this rover called the Moon Sniper is demonstrating this really cool pinpoint technology, trying to land in an area just the size of a football field. You compare that to previous landers, their target landing site was several kilometers, even miles long. So, if successful, not just a historic first for Japan, but also a really impressive step forward in terms of the types of technology for these kinds of lunar landers, guys.",
