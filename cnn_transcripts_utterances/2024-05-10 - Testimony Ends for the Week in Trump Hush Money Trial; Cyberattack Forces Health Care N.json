      "sentences": "Welcome back to our special coverage of former President Trump's hush money trial. Testimony is done for the day with the prosecution saying it could rest its case by the end of the week. And it's a week that could start with a bang.On Monday, former President Trump's former fixer, Michael Cohen, is expected to take the stand. Let's discuss with former Trump attorney Jim Trusty. And Jim, we will talk about Cohen here in just a second. First, though, I do want to ask you that if you were still Trump's lawyer, if there was anything different that you would have done on cross-examination of Stormy Daniels. And I ask specifically because there were a lot of questions about whether Susan Necheles went overboard on cross the second day was Stormy Daniels because Trump may have wanted her to. What would you have done if you had a client demanding you do something you don't think is the best strategy?",

      "sentences": "Well, you got to stick to your guns and, you know, and get an apology later rather than permission on the front end. But look, here's the bottom line. I think that the overall strategy for the defense has made sense.And she -- and Stormy became the flashpoint of the strategy. And I'll explain in a sec. Basically, make it all about Michael Cohen. You know, through all of your cross-examinations, you want to get in, you want to get out, you want concessions. You don't want it to seem like it's a big battle because none of this other stuff has really hurt you. It's not really the primary focus of the case. The more you make this trial a referendum on the credibility of failed cooperator, perjurer, hateful Michael Cohen, the better you have a chance as a defense. Now, Stormy created a problem because I think they started off that way thinking they're not going to dignify her too much, they're not going to cross too much on that first day where they started to cross. The mischief was when they had a day off to think about it. And so they sat back. They didn't object a whole lot. She got in some gratuitous stuff. And that opened a door where they felt they had to start going out with guns blazing, which opened another door on redirect for her to say more scurrilous stuff. So the strategy kind of got off kilter a little bit this week by, again, dignifying her as a witness a little too much. But I'll say this. I mean, she's a little bit of a target-rich environment. When you're cross-examining a witness about how they made money talking to dead people, you know, you got some stuff to play with that might resonate with the New York jury. I just think it was a little long, but not crazy long. And it will be forgotten because, you know, we're right now it's the calm before the storm. When we get to Monday, it's a whole new trial.",

All I did was because this, you know, this mystical President Trump guy forced me to do it. You know, the direct, we just have to kind of listen and take it with a grain of salt.The cross is just, you know, the best drama in town. I mean, the case has all sorts of circus elements to it. But cross-examining Cohen is, you know, if you're a lawyer, if you've ever been a litigator, you're like, my God, can I please be the one to cross this guy? He's got convictions for crimes of falsehoods. He's said that he lied to a federal judge when he pled guilty. He goes on air hundreds of times saying how much he hates President Trump, so he's biased. I mean, look, if he's the star witness, there's a reason SDNY walked away from the federal case. And, you know, Alvin Bragg may learn the hard way that that was the right call.",

      "sentences": "Jim, the jail threat from the judge, of course, has to do with the gag order, which is to stop former President Trump from talking about witnesses or talking about family members of the judge or talking about prosecutors, aside from Alvin Bragg. Trump has two days, and he's got a rally this weekend before Cohen's expected testimony Monday.How important is it for Trump to adhere to his gag order, even if Cohen, who is now facing a warning from the judge, takes jabs at him?",

      "sentences": "Yes, I mean, look, it's just a difficult challenge for anybody, much less somebody running for president, to keep taking blows. Even Stormy had to talk to the press and taunt him after her testimony. So, you know, it's a real challenge.I'm sure he's going to say something, but whether it really rises to the level of being contemptible for the court I think is a different issue. I mean, look, I've got a lot of problems with a gag order for a defendant in a criminal trial. If he says something that's obstructionist, if he says, like, go kill this witness or go, you know, attack these juries or here's where they live, you know, that's all subject to contempt and to other penalties already. So it's not really -- a gag order right now is really kind of an egotistical challenge where the judge is just trying to show you can control the court. I don't think the judge wants to put him in jail. I don't think President Trump really wants to be in jail, and I don't think it's going to result that way. But it'll be an interesting weekend just to see how loose the tongue gets in terms of talking about people like Cohen.",

      "sentences": "Yes, I mean, to be clear, he has mentioned family members, for instance, of the judge. And you don't have to say where someone lives. That's easy to figure out if you put a target on their back, just to be clear there.But I do wonder, Jim, if you were a betting man, what would the odds be, in your view at this point, that Trump will take the stand in his own defense?",

      "speaker": "TRUSTY",
      "sentences": "I'm terrible at betting, but I would say slim or none. And look, there's a couple of reasons. Number one is they had a standard kind of preliminary determination of what could be used for cross- examination, and it went all the government's way.So, you know if he takes the stand, it's not just about Stormy and the NDA. It's going to be about E. Jean Carroll and all sorts of stuff that I think is really pretty collateral to this case but, you know, could reflect on credibility, so it's fair game, according to Judge Merchan. So that's one thing. The other thing is, look, the strategy is all about Cohen. Like, why distract? You really don't want to put anybody else in play for a credibility battle. Leave it Cohen and turn around and tell the jury, you know, if you couldn't buy a car from this guy, you sure can't convict based on his word. So I think the smart strategy that I think even hopefully President Trump will understand when they talk about it is, you know, no chance. Sometimes when I was a prosecutor, which I was for 27 years, every now and then I would laugh about how a weak defense bailed me out. I had a fairly tough case. I had problems with maybe a witness or two or somebody doesn't show up, and the defense put on some sort of case that ultimately helped me. They would have been better off just resting and going right to argument. So I think right here that the best move is look at it, scoff, and say we're not putting anything on in light of that stuff, and then go to closing arguments.",

      "sentences": "Well, Brianna, consumer sentiment plunging by the most in almost three years. Three big concerns that stood out here. Jobs, interest rates and, of course, inflation.Now, this was a surprise. Economists thought that consumer sentiment was going to hold steady. Instead, it plunged. Now we know that consumer sentiment, the reading right now, 67.4. For some context, we need to look where things were right before covid in May of 2019. This was at 100. Sentiment had been moving in the right direction more recently. But now you can see on that chart it's taken a bit of a drop here. Now, this is moving in the wrong direction and it does likely reflect frustrations with inflation, which is also moving in the wrong direction. Prices are no longer skyrocketing like they were two years ago. But inflation is higher than what is considered healthy. The big problems, of course, food, housing, car insurance, the cost to repair your car, all of those things have gotten more expensive. And consumers are worried that this trend is going to continue. The University of Michigan survey found that consumer inflation expectations went higher. Now, that is exactly the opposite of what the Fed wants to see. They monitor inflation expectations very closely and they've been trying to reassure the public that inflation is going to go back down. And clearly, Americans are skeptical. As you mentioned, Brianna, this is another indicator that has got to alarm officials in the White House because it really does capture the mood of Americans. And clearly that mood has started to sour again. And that is never a good recipe for the party in power.",

Very interesting.This purchase of five 747s from Korean Air, which will be retrofitted to become the doomsday planes. What are they? They're designed to be command and control centers for U.S. military during national emergency. Essentially a pentagon in the sky. It will have the president on board, secretary of defense, the joint chiefs, and about 100 other people who would then operate military operations around the world in the event of Armageddon, essentially. It's built to withstand the effects of an electromagnetic pulse. You may have seen that in movies, wiping out other electronics. And at least one is on alert 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, at a U.S. military base somewhere in the world. So these jets will be brought in. They're a little bigger than the ones that were used before. They will be retrofitted, built out in Dayton, Ohio, by this company called Sierra Nevada out of Colorado.
