Happening now, former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker is on the stand and Donald Trump's hush money criminal trial and wins back from lunch, the former president in the room, the lawyers, the jury, they are all there and that cross -- that direct examination is continuing.Joining us now is an attorney who at one time represented Trump Tim Parlatore. So, you've been in these situations of course, Tim, you know, you've worked with him. I just want to take -- take stock of where we are, he's back in that room. We do know that the judge is moving ahead with at least four of those alleged violations of the gag order that the prosecution had put forth to move to censure on that, but not a broader ruling yet. So that's -- that context is now on top of the fact that he's in the room right now with David Packer on the stand. Give us a sense of what you think his mindset is right now. And it seems like Tim cannot hear me. All right. So, we'll see if we can -- OK, while we're working on that, I'll just give everyone a sense of what we know what's happening in the room. Our reporters are in there and basically filing, typing as I -- telling us getting shoulder (ph). Feel like they're getting shoulder injuries. But what's actually happening and right now 2:31, text messages between Dylan Howard and Keith Davidson, Karen McDougal's attorney are on the screen. And some of these have been important. There's been a significant back and forth between attorneys on whether some of these text messages can be submitted. The screens in the courtroom are now showing a photo of Dylan Howard at the White House. Dylan Howard was the editor-in-chief of the National Enquirer worked under David Pecker. And they're talking about this meeting at the White House, which David Pecker is just testifying to was, according to him, a Thank You Dinner that Trump was hosting for the team of the National Enquirer for what -- what Packer has made clear was the help that they gave Trump during the election in some of these catch and kill schemes, including the Karen McDougal scheme that we have with a lot of question -- questions earlier today. And also now of course, the Stormy Daniels, one text on July 12, 2017 from Keith Davidson to Dylan Howard reads, how goes it. And there was another one I know, Wolf that they have been -- there's debate -- debate or whether -- over whether it will be allowed between those two, one of the attorneys and Dylan Howard, the former editor-in- chief, a sort of one of them saying what have we done on election night when Trump actually won the White House, Wolf?",

If he said, I'm not a bank, I'm not going to pay for Stormy. So that takes you out of his bank account into Donald Trump's organization, into Michael Cohen, into Michael Cohen laying out the money and trying to get reimbursed and not really being successful at that.So, I think what, you know, what Pecker does is he kind of sets it up and says, well, that was a bridge too far.

This is candidate Donald Trump. And when Pecker was on the stand, and asked about whether he knew that this was in violation of campaign finance laws, he said he did understand that this was as a part of his -- I mean he understood later, perhaps, I don't know if he knew at the time, but as a part of his agreement with prosecutors that this non-prosecution agreement understood at this point that he's testifying today that what he was conducting was in violation of campaign (INAUDIBLE).",

But right now, the defense raise an objection. So, it's unclear whether this text will be allowed to be shown to the jury. The discussion about it happened when the jury was not in the room. But the text is very significant perhaps Tim. Dylan Howard texts, this family member quote of Trump, at least if he wins, I'll be pardoned for election fraud. Again, Dylan Howard, the editor-in-chief of the National Enquirer who was leading up so many of these catch and kill payoffs. And then Pecker is now testifying to himself and Dylan Howard being at the White House for what Pecker recalls was a Thank You Dinner from Trump for the work that they did to help him get elected. What is the significance of this and a text like that, if they are able to get it admitted for the jury? What could it mean?",

And, you know, I heard about how Pecker also said that he didn't know at the time that this was a campaign finance violation. The problem is that neither one of those two individuals are lawyers, and they don't know for a fact whether it is a campaign finance violation. You know, this, this type of activity is something that, you know, the Supreme Court's decision in Citizens United, it kind of -- it's an open question as to whether it is even is illegal.So, I think that that's one of the things is that they have to have the court rule on, you know, is this something that actually has probative value that they know that they're committing a crime? Or is it more of a joke? Or is it something that you know, that he's saying that's just simply not true? So, I think that, you know, we really need the judge to weigh in and make a clear ruling on, you know, whether there was illegality in this in light of the Citizens United decision.",

But then it becomes a question of OK, well, how much accountability does a president have when it comes to the criminal justice system?And there was a really important exchange between justice Amy Coney Barrett, of course, appointed by Trump and Trump's lawyers, where she got them really for one of the first times to concede that some of the acts that are detailed in a special counsel's indictment really weren't part of Trump's official job when he was in the White House.

What was he doing in his private capacity?So, Wolf, it seems like where we're going here is that the court will likely set up some kind of test or parameters, where the court will lay out how you figure that out. But then it sends the entire case back to the lower courts to be re-litigated, possibly making its way up to the Supreme Court. But this is why even if Trump doesn't win here, legally, it's still a strategic win for him, because the whole point has been to delay. And if he is reelected, he can make this entire case go away.
