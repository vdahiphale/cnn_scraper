After three years, millions of dollars, special counsel John Durham finally releases his report into whether the FBI had a legitimate reason to investigate Trump in 2016. So what did he conclude? Plus, a congressman's staffer and intern on her first day both attacked today by a man with a metal baseball bat. Details we're just getting in from police. And the Florida culture wars continue. This time a fifth grade teacher says she's being investigated for showing her class a 2022 animated Disney movie rated PG-13. The alleged offender is Ethan, an animated gay teen character. (MUSIC) Welcome to THE LEAD. I'm Jake Tapper. And we start today with breaking news. The year's long investigation is over. And John Durham, the special counsel investigating whether there was any misconduct by the FBI in the Trump-Russia investigation just released his findings. For years Donald Trump and his supporters pinned their hopes on the investigation by the former U.S. attorney for Connecticut. John Durham named special counsel by Attorney General Bill Barr, Trump and his allies arguing it would exonerate him from any hint of improper behavior regarding the Russian government's attempts to interfere in the 2016 election. Durham is coming, was the slogan and meme tweeted by Republican lawmakers and the president's family, hinting that Durham would lead to bombshell indictments of those who investigated Trump. Now, the bombshell indictments did not happen. Durham did get one minor court victory, two court losses. But President Trump appeared so confident of what Durham would find, he openly pressured the special counsel to release the findings before the 2020 election. Regardless, the report is here, it has dropped. And it might have not produced everything of what some Republicans hope for, it is regardless devastating to the FBI, and to a degree it does exonerate Donald Trump. Let's bring in CNN senior justice correspondent Evan Perez. Evan, what exactly did Durham find in this report?",

First of all, we should note that when President Biden took office, there were two special counsels -- one U.S. attorney and one special counsel that he let continue doing their jobs. One was John Durham doing this case, and the other was the U.S. attorney in Delaware investigating Hunter. So that is why this was allowed to proceed.A couple quotes here from Durham's report. One, based on the review of Crossfire Hurricane, that's the investigation into Trump and Russia, and related intelligence activities, we concluded the Justice Department and FBI failed to uphold their important mission of strict fidelity to the law in connection with certain events and activities described in the report. He says about, quote, certain -- about regarding certain personnel intimately involved in the matter there was a, quote, predisposition to open an investigation into Trump. He is basically saying -- these are not criminal allegations, but he's saying that these were unprofessional and failed to meet the standards of the Justice Department and the FBI.",

The inspector general, the Justice Department did a 500-page report that came out in late 2019, and that one told us a lot of these findings that Durham is now confirming, frankly. One of the reasons why Durham was brought on board was supposedly to go beyond what the inspector general of the Justice Department found in their investigation.One of the things they were supposed to do was to tell us a lot about what the intelligence community was doing. It turns out they didn't find much there in the intelligence community, and certainly not to support the suspicions that they had that there was a cabal of people from the FBI and the intelligence community who were out to get Donald Trump. That appears to have fallen flat as part of this investigation. And so, look, there's a lot in here that should make the FBI have to come back and answer some more questions including some of the changes that they said they've made to make sure something like this never happens again. But the bottom line from what we see here at the end of a four-year investigation really doesn't tell us a hell of a lot more than what we knew a couple years ago when the inspector general took a look at many of these things and came away with 17 troubled -- very big, troubling findings they said the FBI needed to fix, Jake.",

In the middle of 2019 when Mueller concluded his investigation, Donald Trump was taking to Twitter regularly saying, all caps, investigate the investigators. Shortly thereafter, Bill Barr appointed John Durham to do this investigation. And there was a really important and I think revealing moment. In December of 2019, DOJ's own inspector general came out with the point that there were missteps, however, there was ample ground to open an investigation. And right away. John Durham came out with a public statement and said I disagree with that. That was three-and-change years ago.

So, they're going to use this to fit into their narrative. Frankly, they've also gone out of their way to make the argument that Donald Trump has been unfairly persecuted. I mean, they talked about that when it comes to the search of Mar-a-Lago, when it comes to Trump's retention of documents. So, this is more ammunition for them to make the argument that conservatives, that the former president are treated differently under the eyes of justice in this country.

There's a moment in the episode where ATN calls the state even though there's not going to be a clear winner in that state that night, and then they stick with the decision. It seemed very similar to what we saw in 2020. According to the book \"The Divider,\" written by Peter Baker and Susan Glasser, Fox anchor Bret Baier wrote in an email to Fox president Jay Wallace about the call Fox made for Arizona for Biden. He said, quote, it's hurting us, the sooner we pull it, even if it guess us major egg and we put it back in his column, the better we are in my opinion, unquote. We should note that Arizona was never in Trump's column. So putting it back in Trump's column makes no sense. And according to \"The Daily Beast\", there was a different exchange better Tucker Carlson and Bret Baier, and where Baier wrote, I pressed them, about the decision desk, to slow. I think they will slow-walk Nevada. Just to be clear, Eric, you didn't know of any of this when you and the writers at \"Succession\" were talking -- were doing this episode about political pressure on the decision desk?",

The writers are always looking for real life analogs to sort of play off of. Obviously, Fox's call for Arizona in 2020 put them out on a ledge. A lot of the other networks were not willing to go there at that point. What that did, that boxed them in from calling other states because they would have been the first network to have announced President- elect Joe Biden. And so, the writers I think in this show determined on its head and sort of play with, if they weren't willing to go out and, in fact, reverse their motives, what that would look like.",
