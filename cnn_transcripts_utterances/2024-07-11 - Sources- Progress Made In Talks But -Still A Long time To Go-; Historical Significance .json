CIA Director Bill Burns has been among those representing the negotiating countries in search of a ceasefire. At least a temporary ceasefire and a hostage swap.CNN's Jeremy Diamond is joining us from Jerusalem right now. What can you tell us, Jeremy, about the progress supposedly that's ongoing?",

And keep in mind, we are now at the stage of detailed negotiations over the implementation of this framework agreement that Israel and Hamas both seem to be tentatively on board with. And so, there's a lot of thorny issues to work out here, including the specific implementation of this deal, but also the identities of the Palestinian prisoners who would be released in exchange for the hostages, for example.All of these are very difficult issues. And any one of these issues could potentially blow up the negotiating process entirely. But for now, at least, what we've seen is that the negotiating team was in Doha, Qatar yesterday. All key parties were in attendance. The Israeli negotiating team returned. They met with the Israeli prime minister this morning. And today, the prime minister has now dispatched his -- the chief of the Shin Bet, Israel's internal security service, to head to Cairo to continue negotiations. And it does seem like there are kind of two tracks that the kind of details of the hostage negotiations and then the security components that go along with that, issues like for example, what to do with the Egypt-Gaza border, that strategic Philadelphi Corridor, which we know that Israel has since taken control of. As all of this is happening, the Israeli prime minister, though is continuing to emphasize total victory in Gaza. Saying at a graduation ceremony this evening that he believes complete victory is at hand as long as it may take. Wolf?",

Jeremy, thank you very much.Meanwhile, NATO members now say Ukraine is on an irreversible path to membership as it fights off the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The Alliance also promised more than $43 billion in additional new aid for Ukraine, including F-16 fighter jets -- fighter jets and air defense support. For more on all of this, I want to bring in CNN military analyst, retired U.S. Air Force Colonel Cedric Leighton. Colonel Leighton, thanks so much for joining us. Walk us through the balance that the NATO alliance is trying to strike right now of, on the one hand, committing itself to what they call an irreversible path to Ukraine's full membership in NATO without necessarily provoking Russia.",

      "sentences": "Yes, that's one of the most difficult tight ropes said to the Alliance and the U.S. especially have had to walk since the Russian invasion back in February of 2022, Wolf. So, the issue that they have is how much escalation can we basically take? How much will the Russians be able to deal with this escalation without responding with a massive unconventional strike on Ukraine or a NATO country?So, what the NATO alliance has decided to do was basically a step ladder of escalations that included at first some very minimal weapons systems that went to Ukraine. But now, what you're looking at is the delivery of F-16s. Now, the F-16s are not fifth-generation fighters. They are fourth-generation fighters, which is the generation previous. And they are designed, of course, to be a very capable aircraft. And they're far better than anything that the Ukrainians have had in their Air Force inventory up until this point. But the number of F-16s, about 65 that have been caused to Ukraine in this first delivery, those -- that is a large number. But it is not really sufficient for the Ukrainians to conduct all the kinds of missions that they would need to conduct in order to achieve air superiority and even allow their forces to really get out of this static war that they're in right now.",

In fact, one of the key indicators is the fact that Chinese troops are engaged in exercise as we speak with Belarusian forces. And they are conducting that exercise about less than 10 miles from the Polish border.And Poland, of course, being a NATO country -- a NATO frontline state. The Chinese and the Belarusians are conducting a joint exercise, which will allow them to practice things like interoperability and the ability to deploy their forces in a quick manner. So, that's the kind of thing that we can expect to see from the Chinese. In spite of their declarations, they are heavily involved in this war. Not just from a material standpoint, but also potentially from a much more direct military standpoint.",

But even beyond that, we just had -- just a few moments ago, another member of Congress, a frontline member from Michigan, Hillary Scholten came out and said She also believes Biden should step aside. So, the question is, how many more will there be if more, by tonight at 6:30? So, even a strong press conference, will that cool some of these doubts? It's an open question.",

TIM NAFTALI, CNN PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIANHaving to juggle that with challenges abroad and a resurgent imperialist Russia, presidents face crises all the time, which is one reason why Presidential fitness is so important. They faced crises they'd never anticipated when they were running for office. So, the fact that we've got a split screen event that's not unprecedented in history.

That it is essentially frozen in time despite all of these monumental changes going on. However, the battleground map tells a different story. If we talk to the Biden campaign advisors and other Democrats, they are worried about erosion in states like Wisconsin, in Michigan, in Pennsylvania. But there's also another number in that new Washington Post-ABC News poll. Let's take a look at this, Wolf.It is asking if Biden should step aside. And nearly seven in 10 Americans, 67 percent say he should. But perhaps the more important number, 62 percent of Democrats or Democratic-leaning voters say he should, as do 54 percent of Biden supporters. That is the bigger challenge here for President Biden. How does he convince those -- really make a decision in the face of that support? He's long said that he has the support of people and the elites are trying to push him out. This poll would suggest that is not the case.",

She found it painful. First Lady Nancy Reagan.And then he bounced back in the second debate. But in that era, 1984, President Reagan was well ahead. How he did in the first debate was not as bad as -- unfortunately, as President Biden did in his debate. And the third debate happened very quickly. And in that era, you didn't have social media. So, eyes were trained on the second debate, and the president re-shored or shored up his support. It's a lot harder, I think, in this era for people to forget the images that they will -- has still have in their minds of the first debate. I think it's much harder now to change impressions.
