Plus, two brothers who say they helped Jesse Smollett stage an alleged MAGA hate crime hoax, speaking out about his conviction being overturned.What they may say may just surprise you. And Bible-infused curriculum gets the green light in Texas elementary schools. But some are asking, is it even legal? Tonight, on \"Laura Coates Live\". All right, everyone, TGIF, it's a Friday night of rapid fire breaking news. We've got some pretty big developments on Donald Trump's cabinet, by the way. And we're also getting an idea of the wrecking ball that he wants to bring to the agency he seems to despise the most -- the Justice Department. First, Trump is tapping Scott Bessent for his Treasury Secretary. It's the most important post that he had yet to fill. He is a billionaire hedge fund manager who once worked for a long-time GOP bogeyman, George Soros. He is tasked with turning Trump's controversial economic policy promises into a kind of Washington, D.C. reality, including tax cuts and new tariffs. But will he be able to help ease anxieties of a country deeply concerned about the economy -- stupid? We'll get into all of that along with the slew of other picks that Trump has announced tonight. And surprise, surprise, many spent time in the TV world at Fox News. And speaking of controversies, right when you thought the Trump transition team put one to bed after Matt Gaetz bowed out, another one pops right up. This time it's scrutiny over Tulsi Gabbard, his pick to lead, of course, the intelligence community. She has been under fire for her history of siding with America's enemies like Russia and Syria. And now, we're learning she was put on a government watch list earlier this year. It's called Quiet Skies, and it triggers additional screenings before flights. For us to say that she was briefly placed on it because of her overseas travel and her foreign connections. She was removed though, after going public with this message, claiming it was retaliation for criticizing Kamala Harris. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TULSI GABBARD (D) FORMER CONGRESSWOMAN: My own government has placed me on a secret terror watch list, targeting me as a potential domestic terror threat. Why? Political retaliation. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Trump's choice of Gabbard as DNI is in line with his intention to shake up the foreign policy establishment, but his sights may be on the Justice Department more than anything or anywhere else.Tonight, \"The Washington Post\" is reporting that Trump plans to fire the entire team -- the entire team that work with special counsel Jack Smith. And on top of all that, he wants to put together teams within the DOJ to hunt down evidence in battleground states that fraud tainted the 2020 election. One problem, there is no widespread fraud or evidence of that in the 2020 election. Joining me now, senior chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst John Miller. He also served as the assistant deputy director for National Intelligence. Also here, former deputy assistant attorney general, Harry Littman. He's also the host of the \"Talking Feds\" podcast that just launched a \"Substack\". Gentlemen, good to have both of you here. John, look, I was a career prosecutor at DOJ.

Sinister because it's sort of the core kind of feature of an authoritarian government that you put your prosecutorial apparatus at the behest of a president for making trouble for no reason, stupid, because as he said, this is going to cost them millions of dollars. Just look at Andrew McCabe. There, if they can make their lives miserable. But if they try to fire them, they've got to go through hoops. They'll never be able to do it. And they'll wind up as they wound up owing Andrew McCabe nearly a million dollars. That's what it'll be for each of the folks. But make no mistake. You've been there. We've all been there.

Jeff, good to see you. Look, the economy, everyone said, was the number one issue for voters. So, tell me, what does this Treasury secretary pick mean and bring to the table?JEFF STEIN, \"WASHINGTON POST\" WHITE HOUSE ECONOMICS REPORTER: Donald Trump has really struggled to pick this most crucial of cabinet positions really because he wants two things that are in direct conflict. He wants massive tariffs on all U.S. trading partners as high as 10 or 20 percent. And he simultaneously wants someone who has the respect of \"Wall Street\", who the stock market can grow under and who can manage capital markets' difficult situations that could arise in the bond market and do that with respectability and prestige. That seems to fit both criteria as well as possible, but long term, it will be very, very difficult for him to impose these tests out leaving the stock market to suffer serious shocks.",

And that was an approach that the markets really liked and that helps sort of mitigate Trump did many things to crack down on trade with China. But it kept a lid on the extent of those actions and so, Bessent will have this difficult role trying to navigate the trade hawks, the people who want to go more and more aggressive on China and other countries.I think my understanding from sources familiar that he sees himself as likely to play a similar role, effectuating some of Trump's instincts on trade, but preventing things from getting out of control because Trump at some level understands that people want the economy to grow. They may want tariffs, they may think they sound good, they may want a rebalancing of trade. But if consumers are paying much higher costs for Chinese products, that could be a real downside for Trump's popularity.",

Mr. Vought has been committed to very conservative causes for decades and has written about how he sees us now as being in what he calls a post-constitutional era and called for what he himself has called radical constitutionalism to wrench the U.S. government out of where it is currently. And two, a sort of more conservative direction, but one where there's much more power aggregated to the executive branch. And so, I think Russ Vought is a sleeper for one of the most important people in all of government under Trump. The budget chief is responsible for overseeing not just, you know, spending, but sort of the cross-section of agencies, HUD and HHS and all these different other federal agencies, they work through OMB. And so, his ability to sort of oversee that nexus will be absolutely crucial to executing many of the ideas that the conservative movement and that Trump has wanted for a long time.",

Everything that he's talked about from dismantling the deep state, from going after people who work with Jack Smith is focused on hurting American voters. Let's think about that. His priority is not to lower costs. His priority is not to bring down inflation. His priority is to hurt American voters, whether that's implementing his own policies, which economists have said will raise prices and will explode inflation. Or putting in people who have no experience in what they are supposed to be leading, people who have grotesque and disgusting allegations against them, which is just offensive to the country.

Today, the state school board voting to green light what they call Blue Bonnet Learning Curriculum. It infuses the Bible into classes for kids in kindergarten through the fifth grade.This program has been months in the making. It's optional. Supporters say that it will help teach subjects like reading and language arts while introducing kids to religious history. But critics argue it highlights Christianity more than any other. other religion and some of the lessons possibly undermine the separation of Church and State. The 15-member board voted eight to seven to approve it with three Republicans joining Democrats and voting against it. The tie breaking vote was cast by new member, Leslie Racine. Texas governor, Greg Abbott, appointed her to temporarily fill a vacancy after the election. Another member who was elected to that seat will take her place at the end of the year. Joining me now, a member of the state board of education who voted against it, Democrat James Talarico. Thank you so much for joining us. You, you're studying to be a Christian pastor. Why do you believe this curriculum though is preaching, not teaching? JAMES TALARICO (D) TEXAS STATE HOUSE: Well, before I was a legislator, I was a Texas public school teacher. And as you mentioned, I'm a current seminary student studying to become a Presbyterian minister. And so, I know personally that there is a difference between preaching and teaching. Under federal law, schools can teach the Bible as an academic text, but not in a devotional way. In other words, public schools are not Sunday schools. Or as Greg Abbott is fond of saying schools are for education, not indoctrination. And you know, Laura, I'm not the only one who thinks that this curriculum is unconstitutional. The Texas Republicans who crafted this curriculum also think it's unconstitutional because in the bill that created this curriculum, they explicitly grant Republicans who crafted this curriculum also think it's unconstitutional because in the bill that created this curriculum, they explicitly grant immunity for Texas educators who violate the establishment clause of the United States Constitution, otherwise known as the separation of Church and State. So, this curriculum is unconstitutional, it's un-American, and I also believe it's deeply un-Christian.",

And this new Texas curriculum elevates Christianity over the other major world religions.I consider the Hindu student, the Jewish student, the Muslim student, the Buddhist student, the atheist student who sits in a classroom in a Texas public school to be my neighbor. And as a Christian, I am called to love them as myself. And forcing my religion down their throats is not love. I think if Jesus read this new curriculum, he would weep for those students.
