The U.S. is warning North Korea it will pay a price for any arms deal it tries to strike with Russia, as intelligence suggests Kim Jong-un is preparing to travel to Russia. More flooding is expected right across Greece after several months' worth of rain fell in a single day. And billions of dollars are pledged for clean energy at the Africa Climate Summit.So, concerns are growing about North Korea's Kim Jong-un possibly traveling to Russia to seal a weapons deal with President Vladimir Putin. The White House National Security Advisor warned Tuesday that the talks between these two pariahs are quote, \"actively advancing\". And he said Russia seeking arms from North Korea for the Russian war in Ukraine means sanctions are working. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Major events are often used as decoys. Crowds can wait for hours, enduring long security lines, only to find the leader's seat empty.Even Kim's own bodyguards can serve as decoys, best known for donning dark suits, running alongside the leader's limo during the Trump-Kim summits, projecting power and security, riding an armor-reinforced railcar to Russia to meet with President Vladimir Putin, a fellow strongman seen by some as a global pariah. Putin and Kim come with plenty of baggage, both saddled with heavy sanctions. For Kim's nuclear and ballistic missile programs, for Putin's brutal, unprovoked war on Ukraine, and suspiciously timed plane crash, taking out his one-time critic. Now, the Russian leader may meet another shadowy figure, the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un. Kim may not have a reason to fear Putin, but he still does not take any chances when he travels outside North Korea. U.S. government sources believe Kim Jong-un will go to Russia this month as Moscow looks to buy artillery and other wartime supplies from its impoverished authoritarian neighbor. CNN contacted the Russian embassy in Washington for comment. North Korea denied previously supplying Russia with rockets and missiles to use in Ukraine. In July, Putin's defense minister Sergei Shoigu was in Pyongyang as Kim showed off his latest weapons, long-range missiles and military drones. Shoigu said Russia may even be staging joint military drills with the North. National Security Advisor John Kirby says Putin must be embarrassed asking Kim for help.",

      "sentences": "Absolutely, Paula. We actually have some social media video to show you that I just want to pull up here that shows a U.K. Challenger-2 tank near this all-important village over Robotyne where Ukraine is claiming a victory, a moderate victory but still a victory that's allowed it to punch through the first line of Russia's defenses to the south of Zaporizhzhia.Now, that tank has been partially destroyed in the fighting. And according to a source speaking on background to CNN, the crew of that tank were able to survive the initial attack on it. The source adding that that's a demonstration testament to the superiority of the NATO equipment being provided to Ukraine versus the Soviet-era equipment that they were reliant on before. A couple of things, of course, to take away from this video. First of all, as you said, that NATO equipment is being used in the most important battles all along those very long front lines. But you also have to remember that Ukraine has time and time again accused Russia of intentionally targeting Western equipment and this is extremely valuable equipment, Paula. Yes, President Zelenskyy has been grateful for all the tanks that have arrived, for all the help that has arrived, but he's always said, I need more and more and more. So, the loss of a tank, the loss of any equipment on those front lines is significant as well to Ukraine. I do have another piece of footage to show you that paints sort of the opposite story, if you will, for Russia. This is a satellite imagery of two strategic bombers inside Russia. And what you're looking at are tires laid on top of those strategic bombers. Why? Why tires on top of the bombers? Well, officials say and analysts say that this is a very rudimentary, very token attempt by Russia to conceal these planes from Ukrainian drones and reduce the visibility of them at night. Again, I emphasize very rudimentary attempt. It's unclear if putting these tires on top of the planes will really make any impact at all but it does remind us of something we've seen throughout this conflict, Paula, which is that Russia has maintained an air superiority. It absolutely has the power of the skies. This may begin to show that there are holes in that all- important advantage. Newton:  Yeah, and drones have definitely made the difference in that advantage to be sure. And Salma, before I let you go, there's quite an extraordinary story coming from Cuba about the allegations that there is a human trafficking network with Cubans being forced to fight for Russia?",

Now, the Pentagon says it's notified Russia of an inter-continental ballistic missile test, the test of \"The Unmanned Minuteman III\" was planned years ago and was scheduled to launch sometime between Tuesday night and Wednesday morning. U.S. officials described it as a routine test of a key part of the nuclear triad, which includes ballistic missiles, nuclear submarines, and strategic bombers.Greece has been hit by yet another extreme weather event. Torrential rains and deadly flooding have swept the country over the past few days. The flooding has washed away cars, damaged buildings, and forced evacuations from homes and at least one hospital. Now, the storm named Daniel is blamed for at least one death, a man who was crushed by a collapsing wall. All of this comes just as crews have finally managed to contain hundreds of raging wildfires which have devastated parts of the country for weeks now. Daniel has led to red storm warnings across several provinces, especially along the eastern coast. One Greek official calls this the most extreme rainfall within 24 hours since record keeping began in that country. CNN's Katie Polglase joins me now from London with more on all this. I mean, I'm practically breathless with everything we've had to cover from Greece, just the weather.

      "sentences": "Yeah, that's right, Paula. It has been really an incredibly difficult summer and now fall for Greece. The Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsakis has described this as an extreme weather phenomenon. And that really doesn't even do it justice. It seems absolutely devastating, the videos we're seeing of these floods, this torrential downpour of rain falling over Greece. And this is because it is an area of low pressure that is circling over Greece moving into the Mediterranean that is causing this rainfall.Now, it's called Storm Daniel, as you mentioned, by meteorologists. And the fear here is that it develops into what's called a medicane, med meaning Mediterranean Sea, cane meaning hurricane. And that is because it could have the characteristics of a hurricane, similar to a tropical cyclone, similar to a typhoon, this extreme weather, these extreme kinds of rain pouring down and causing devastating floods, similar to the kind of hurricane we've seen in Idalia in the states and the typhoon crossing from China and Taiwan recently in the past few days. These extreme weather phenomena are happening with increasing regularity clearly globally, but Greece in particular has had it particularly bad hit. And it's worth noting that this comes, just as you mentioned, straight after these wildfires. And that is no coincidence. These wildfires have raised to the ground areas that normally would protect areas from certain types of water falling at this speed and this extent. So, you have water coming down from the mountains being normally protected by trees surely and by buildings. All of this has been burnt to the ground. These are the exact same areas that were devastated by these wildfires. Dozens of people killed and now as we're reporting, unfortunately, some fatalities from this flooding, as well. And it's worth noting that as this is going into the Mediterranean, as this is building into what is feared to be this tropical cyclone, this medicane, it has also worsened, potentially strengthened in its power because of the sea surface temperature. So, the sea surface temperature in the Mediterranean Sea is about 27 degrees Celsius. That's about 80 degrees Fahrenheit. And as the weather builds, as the storm builds, this heat is potentially going to give it some more strength. So, a lot more damage potentially to come.",

There's still mitigations stopping the source of the problem, getting off fossil fuels as fast as possible. But yes, five major insurance companies, the United States just reported to regulators that they're going to stop offering coverage for the most common disasters in these areas.
