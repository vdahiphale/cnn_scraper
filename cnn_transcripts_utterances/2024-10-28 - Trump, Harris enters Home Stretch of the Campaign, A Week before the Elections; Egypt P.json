It's a busy week ahead, of course, as the candidates crisscross the handful of battleground states expected to decide the election.Now, on Sunday, thousands of people queued up outside New York's Madison Square Garden for a Trump campaign rally. The gathering featured a slate of Trump loyalists who used racist and profane language to attack Kamala Harris, Hillary Clinton, other Democratic leaders and even the island of Puerto Rico. During his disjointed and at times meandering speech, the former U.S. president used dark rhetoric and made false claims about his political opponent. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Over the past four years, Kamala Harris has orchestrated the most egregious betrayal that any leader in American history has ever inflicted upon our people. She has violated her oath, eradicated our sovereign border, and unleashed an army of migrant gangs who are waging a campaign of violence and terror against our citizens.

And I think, you know, we can very easily look at this and say that biases against women in leadership positions is driving this. We know that in general, there's about a 13 point bias or 13 percent of Americans say they are angry or afraid of the idea of a woman in the White House. And with Kamala Harris being a woman of color, I'm always worried looking at the polls that they're not going to be accurate.

Really, the first time we've seen high-level talks like that for more than two months, showing just how stalled these negotiations have been.Now, they're talking and negotiating towards a three-phase plan. There is a lot of detail in there, and of course, the devil has been in the detail as they are trying to convince both Israel and Hamas to sign on to this deal. It is proved extremely difficult. So what we're seeing here from the Egyptian president, he gave a press conference on Sunday, was really trying to make this deal a lot easier in the short term. So it would be just a two-day ceasefire, he has suggested. There would be just four Israeli hostages being released in return for an unspecified number of Palestinian prisoners. He didn't go into details about what that would look like. But then if those two days hold, he has said, then there could be another 10 days to negotiate a permanent ceasefire and then to allow that significant aid, which is so desperately needed, into the Gaza Strip. Now, we haven't had public acknowledgement or public sign-up of this deal really from any side at this point. So it's unclear how far down the road of signing up to this that the U.S. is, for example Qatar, one of the other key mediators and Israel. We do know though that just last week there was an Egyptian security delegation which met with a Hamas delegation in Cairo. So certainly there have been discussions between the two sides. We don't know if this has been formally proposed to Hamas, but it really does show just how difficult it is proving to be able to finalize the full deal, that three phase plan which would end with a full ceasefire, with all the hostages being released, thousands of Palestinian prisoners and the rebuilding of Gaza. It does appear to just be too much at this point and of course the crucial point is it is so close to the U.S. election. We've heard U.S. officials saying that they believe that the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will wait to see who he will be dealing with after the election has finished and after the results comes through. So there isn't an expectation of any significant breakthrough over the next 10 days at least and we have heard that publicly as well. But there is a desire from the Biden administration to gain some momentum after Yahya Sinwar, the head of Hamas, was killed. Paula?",

Right. And it seems that the intention is to ensure that these people cannot return home anytime soon. And as for the issue of linking Gaza to Lebanon, now this has been a long-standing problem with Hezbollah, which is repeatedly linked or insisted, I should say, on the linkage between ISIS fire in Gaza and ISIS fire in Lebanon. Now, we are starting to see some cracks perhaps in the facade over there, where we are hearing from various Hezbollah figures that there is a chance of them considering the separation of the two issues. But at the same time, it's probably too late for that. I mean even the talk about the issue of using for example 1701, a U.N. resolution that's meant to cause like this engagement, even there we are not entirely sure what the Israelis want at this point. It seems that the intention is for a deeper, more involved incursion that would lead to the destruction of Hezbollah, or at least its disarmament. And that will take a long, long time.

I mean, if you consider the fact that right now you have a political arm of Hezbollah that is basically tied to the military leadership, and military leadership is very hard to reach, I mean, that alone raises issues about the notion of negotiating for a ceasefire. And in terms of the groups, I guess, social and financial and political arms, those appear to be very much targeted and indeed in some ways in shambles. If you think of the bank situation there, there is a banking arm for Hezbollah that has been targeted quite extensively and this banking arm will have a lot of pressure in the coming months when people need to rebuild. I mean that's just one example of the disruption we're seeing in Hezbollah. It's unclear how the group will come out at the end of this. In terms of fighting, I think it will remain able to fire rockets and missiles. That remains to be true and to fight on the ground. Now, in terms of it's actually managing to reconstitute itself into the power it was before September 23rd or indeed even before last year, that's a larger question.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CHRISTOPHER LAMB, CNN VATICAN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Many women impatient for reform, calling on the Pope to take action. KATE MCELWEE, WOMEN'S ORDINATION WORLDWIDE: The time is now to open all ordained ministries to women. LAMB (voice-over): Finding a greater role for women in the Catholic Church has become an urgent issue. The all-male clergy continue to dominate decision-making roles in the Church, even more so in the Vatican. Women are barred from ordination as priests. And like previous popes, Francis has upheld that ruling. But this pope has opened a door to reform, appointing women to senior positions in the Vatican, recognizing the role women are already playing in the church, seeking to give them greater visibility. And for the first time, giving women the right to vote at a Vatican synod assembly, which concluded on Sunday. One of those voter participants is a 23-year-old studying theology and physics in Philadelphia, the youngest woman to take part in such an event. JULIA OSEKA, STUDENT, ST. JOSEPH'S UNIVERSITY, PHILADELPHIA: There is definitely an urgent need to not only realize and accept that women have an equal baptismal dignity to men in the Catholic Church, but also to take action. And our Synod is discussing issues on how to better make women visible, give them leadership roles, give them the same platform of action as men in the Catholic Church. LAMB (voice-over): Nevertheless, Francis has faced criticism for expressing conservative views on women's roles. The Pope also knocking back a proposal for women to become deacons, an ordained church position. But the Vatican assembly insisting this topic must continue to be looked at, and for women to be given leadership roles. Francis accepting their proposals, recognizing the need for more reform.
