      "sentences": "Wherever you are around the world, thank you for joining us. And we begin with the mystery of just where is Russian warlord, Yevgeny Prigozhin.The only certainty, it seems, right now is that we don't know the whereabouts of the head of the Wagner mercenaries, who less than two weeks ago marched on Moscow, in defiance of President Vladimir Putin in a short-lived open rebellion and attempted coup. During a rare media conference, the president of Belarus, Aleksandr Lukashenko told reporters he knows where Prigozhin is not, and that's Belarus, where Prigozhin was exiled in a deal with the Kremlin to avoid prosecution. Lukashenko believes the man once known as Putin's chef is likely in Russia. Possibly St. Petersburg, hometown for both Prigozhin and Putin. Not long after the Belarusian leader made those public remarks, Russian state television aired images of Prigozhin's office and residence in St. Petersburg being raided by police, who say they found wigs and fake passports, piles of gold and cash, as well as firearms. But there has been no official comment from the Kremlin on Prigozhin's whereabouts. This all began with that rare news conference by the Belarusian president, who also said thousands of Prigozhin's mercenaries also meant to be living in Exxon Belarus, as well, have not left their barracks in Russia, as well as in Ukraine. CNN's senior international correspondent, Matthew Chance, was at that news conference in Minsk. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The rare meeting with the Belarusian leaders. And an extraordinary revelation on the whereabouts of Wagner, the Russian mercenaries he's meant to be sheltering. Despite earlier statements, neither its fighters nor its leader, he tells me, have taken up his offer of exile. ALEKSANDR LUKASHENKO, BELARUSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): As far as I am informed, as of this morning, the Wagner fighters are now stationed at their regular camps, where they go for rotation, to rest and recover from the front lines. In terms of Yevgeny Prigozhin, he's in St. Petersburg, or maybe, this morning, he will travel to Moscow or elsewhere. But he's not on the territory of Belarus now. CHANCE (voice-over): It wasn't meant to be this way. Lukashenko's deal was how the Kremlin explained how Wagner's armed uprising last month had been brought to an early end. There was even talk of Prigozhin arriving in Belarus, and of all charges against him being dropped.",

This will depend on the decision made by the Russian government and Wagner PMC. If they deem it necessary to locate a certain number of Wagner fighters in Belarus for rest and preparation, then I will keep my promise. CHANCE (voice-over): But the Kremlin may have other plans. Russian state TV has, for days, been painting Prigozhin as a traitor and a criminal. Now broadcasting these new images of a raid on his St. Petersburg property. The police seizing weapons, cash and gold, even wigs for disguise and multiple passports under aliases. The Kremlin told CNN they won't comment on where Prigozhin is or whether new charges may be filed against him. But Lukashenko raised the disturbing possibility of Prigozhin being assassinated before insisting the Kremlin would never do it. [00:05:04] LUKASHENKO (through translator): What will happen to Prigozhin next? Well, in life, anything can happen. But if you think that Putin is so malicious and vindictive Putin is so malicious and vindictive that he will do him in tomorrow, no. This won't happen. CHANCE (voice-over): But clearly, the fate of Wagner and its leader is now in question. Just last week, these satellite images appeared to show a military base in Belarus being prepared for a possible influx of fighters. Lukashenko may now, himself, have got cold feet.",

This was reached in the process of negotiation. You know what was at stake. I made this decision at that time, and I would stick to it. But I don't think Wagner would rise up and turn its guns against the Belarusian state. CHANCE (voice-over): But for Belarus, Wagner's absence may yet be a blessing in disguise.

You know, they've tried so many different things after he, you know, marched on Moscow.For me, there's just so many questions here that need to be answered. I don't know that we'll ever get to them. First of all, why is Prigozhin still alive? I mean, he sent his troops, and they made it halfway to Moscow after shooting down a bunch of Russia aircraft, killing Russian servicemen. You know, he basically went against Putin by saying the entire reason for invading Ukraine was really not, you know, about getting rid of the Nazis in Kyiv or, you know, the NATO threat. It was all a bunch of rich oligarchs who wanted more money. These are all treasonous remarks, as Putin himself said. So why is -- why is he still alive? It's amazing to me that he is. However, it seems like, as opposed to just killing him outright, they have decided to take sort of a tried and true method, which they use with Navalny, and you know, a longer time ago, Mr. Khodorkovsky (ph), another oligarch who stepped out of line and got himself crosswise with the Kremlin. And so they're saying he's a criminal. He's corrupt. And so we need to do an investigation, which oftentimes leads to lengthy prison sentences in tuberculosis-ridden jails and oftentimes death. So that may be a slower way that they're going about this. But why it's come to this and it's been so ugly for the Kremlin up until now, it's just -- it's mind-boggling.",

I know it's complicated, but here's Lukashenko. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LUKASHENKO (through translator): I don't know everything about the relationship between Putin and Prigozhin. and I don't want to know everything. Putin knows Prigozhin much better than me. I just met him in the buildup to some events. The first time was maybe 20 years ago. Putin has known him for much longer.

That's when three Russian fighter jets approached three U.S. MQ-9 Reaper drones and conducted very similar activity, which the Department of Defense called unsafe and unprofessional.

A year later, an arrest warrant was issued for Russian President Vladimir Putin.For the Rohingya, it's been six years since the genocide that they experienced in Myanmar. So there is a disparity in the timeline here. How soon can, you know, the Rohingya expect some kind of action, like a warrant being issued for a leader who's carried out these crimes?",

Every year, I've been here. I've just come, and I've appointed a senior lawyer to lead the Myanmar team. We're trying to get additional resources. We are under-resourced across all our situations. And my presence here, my presence last year, and the team's almost constant presence here over the last year, a much more regular presence, is evidence of the fact that this is important. They re not forgotten. And if I can say so, John, the world can't look away. It's not just the obligations of my office. I spoke to families yesterday, and until March, children, women, and men were used to three meals a day. There's been cuts to the World Food Program of the United Nations. Now families are being given nine taka. That's the local currency in Bangladesh. Nine taka a day for a meal. And the cost of one single egg it 12 taka. So literally, food should not be taken off the plates of children and diverted elsewhere if we are true to our claim that every human life matters equally.",

You know, suffering seems to never end.I guess, though, one of the biggest questions which hangs over both of your cases here, be it Ukraine or Myanmar, will we ever see Vladimir Putin on trial? Will we ever see General Min Aung Hlaing be held accountable for what he's done?",

And some people would say -- will say we're on a fool's errand.And the best answer that I can come up with is, there were naysayers, there were pessimists, there are those that said it was a fool's errand to start the Yugoslav tribunal or Rwanda or the special court for Sierra Leone. But the evidence, not the conjecture, is that President Charles Taylor is now in Durham Prison. Milosevic, Karadzic and and Mladic were tried by the Yugoslav tribunal. The former prime minister, Jean Kambanda, was tried by the Rwandan tribunal. The list goes on. So one thing is certain. Unless we collect evidence, unless we analyze evidence, unless we check what is incriminating and what is exonerating, there will be no chance of justice. So we have to do our job, and then we'll wait and see about the opportunities for enforcement if judges of the International Criminal Court decide to issue any further warrants or in relation to the warrants already issued.",

That was June 18th. Days later, after a very widespread international search effort, authorities confirmed the sub had suffered a catastrophic implosion. In the wake of disaster, new details have emerged about warnings and safety concerns about the submersible, including an ominous email from a former employee that the Titan could fail and result in deaths. Well, the so-called Twitter killer has arrived, the Meta-owned Threads, with millions signing up every hour. Thirty million within the first 24 hours of Threads going online, to be precise. It looks a lot like Twitter, mostly text-based posts for real-time public conversations. New users sign in via their Instagram account, but that link means any attempt to kill a profile on Threads can only be done by deleting Instagram, as well. Twitter clearly sees Threads as a competition and as a threat, with lawyers from Elon Musk threatening to sue Meta for hiring former Twitter employees -- you know, all the ones that Elon Musk fired -- in order to steal Twitter's trade secrets. Coming up next hour, a lot more on what this was between the microblogs actually means, and could this actually see Twitter's  days being finally numbered? But given Threads is owned by Meta and its controversial past, is that necessarily a good thing? Finally this hour, a familiar sound is going away.
