We're now more than 24 hours into the investigation of what the FBI is calling an apparent assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump. And a profile of the suspect, Ryan Wesley Routh, is now emerging in greater detail. Routh made his first court appearance today. Yesterday afternoon, the Secret Service spotted him pointing a rifle at Trump from the bushes of Trump's Florida golf club. We now know the weapon was the Soviet SKS style rifle with a range as well as the school that put the former president within reach, says law enforcement. New police body cam footage shows Routh's arrest, which is just the latest run-in with police for him. We're now learning he has an extensive rap sheet in North Carolina, including pleading guilty in 2002 to felony possession of a weapon of mass destruction, which we understand to have been a fully automatic machine gun. Trump was unharmed from the incident. It's not clear if the alleged assailant fired any shots. The former president, however, quickly has sought to blame his opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris and what he calls communist political rhetoric. President Biden made clear once again this afternoon as he has repeatedly that he condemns any political violence in this country. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They learned from them mishaps earlier, 63 days prior, and then adjusted and they have security details in the front and behind of the protectee, which is standard what we do. So moving what they did and identifying for security risks of that quickly and engaging without thought and making sure that the protectee is safe, is phenomenal. So actually having that roller permanent perimeter is difficult. Now, if this -- I know there's a lot of communication going back and forth about should they have more protections, should they have different protection because of the threat assessment that's something I think Director Rowe has to look at, where are we on these threat assessment to identify who needs what and understanding the current threat.

No, I think, you know, Direct Rowe, will come out and actually identify maybe it wasn't a direct side. He had to turn around a corner or it wasn't really that big of a threat as we think it is. I think that's that were going to have to find out exactly where he wasn't relation to were the were the former president was to identify should this have been identified earlier? You know, the one thing that does have me raise a little bit of an eyebrow is what you had said earlier about his geolocation, putting him in the vicinity. You know, where was he an emphasis, and you can tell you can hammer it down. Now, that's something id like to find out more to actually decide what the risk was.

He accused Biden and Harris have using highly inflammatory language, which the former president was using such language himself. At the same time, he called Harris the real threat during an interview with Fox News digital. CNN's Kristen Holmes, she covers the Trump campaign. And, Kristen, I mean, listen, this was the worry, right? That Trump would again, and it's not the first time point the finger at his political opponents here. There is, of course, no evidence and we've seen the president and vice president very quickly condemn both this apparent assassination attempt and all political violence.

I mean, one thing I do want to point out here is it's a completely different response than we saw in the aftermath of that first assassination attempt at Butler, Pennsylvania, where we saw Donald Trump come out and say that he was calling for unity. He wanted to unite the country.Now that was short-lived. He then moved onto blaming the Biden administration, but it has been a slow rollout since that not assassination attempt. This was obviously much more immediate blaming not only Joe Biden, his administration, but Kamala Harris as she is now at the top of the Democratic ticket making this incredibly political. You are right. We do not have any answers, but it is also true that the country is incredibly divided and there is divisive language all around and clearly, there is potential for political violence as we've seen, as we've tried to figure out what the motive of the suspect was as the details are starting to come out here. And when it comes to Donald Trump and his political and vile and at times violent or incendiary rhetoric, of course, we don't believe that's going to stop. Donald Trump has does made this a way that he has campaigned since 2015, and it doesn't seem as though at any point it's going to end. So whether or not they acknowledged it, this is clearly another way you to spin this part, this second apparent assassination attempt into politics to create a kind of excuse and saying that it was 100 percent political rhetoric of his opponent on surprising. But, of course, as you said, we still don't have any answers as to why exactly this person chose to show up. Now I will note one thing that has been very interesting to see as the difference in the campaigns reaction to the secret service response. They have been very pleased with the fact that the secret service engaged with this suspect on the golf course because of course, as you will remember in that first assassination attempt, one of the biggest complaints that we were told from Trumps team was why didn't he engage with the shooter? Why didn't Secret Service engage with the shooter? Now, as we speak, we are told that Donald Trump is expected to be meeting with the Secret Service, acting Secret Service head, and they are going to be having a conversation about what transpired yesterday. How this was able to happen and potentially even what needs to happen, security-wise in the future, we are waiting to hear from our sources on that to see if they're going to change any sort of protocol as they move forward right now, I'm told by his staff that they continue to campaign, that he's going to continue to go to all of the events he had planned for this week, in Michigan, in Washington, D.C., and Uniondale, New York, as well.

Routh heard these charges in his first court appearance earlier today, in a courtroom just a few miles from Trump's home at Mar-a-Lago.CNN's Carlos Suarez is in West Palm Beach.

We've seen a couple a few days apart. We saw that actually earlier this year, I believe in February, but for in one week is a number we haven't seen in quite some time.Still as you point out, the Pentagon told us last week that there were Russian exercises and they expected to see more activity, more of these types of flights according to NORAD, at least three of the flights were maritime reconnaissance or surveillance aircraft. But there weren't necessarily intercepts. There was monitoring. The aircraft remained in the ADIZ, the Air Defense Identification Zone. So that's not U.S. airspace. That would be a very different story, they remained in international airspace and the Pentagon as well as NORAD pointed out this is not viewed as a threat to the U.S. homeland. Of course, it is something the U.S. is going to monitor whether it's part of an exercise or not, whether it's publicly announced or not, the U.S. will keep an eye on this to make sure it remains. And the Russians keep it as is that it stays in the realm of an exercise and at least for now, Jim, that's how the U.S. is viewing it. Certainly, you'll see the pictures of these. They are sometimes phenomenal and noteworthy pictures. But the U.S. very much viewing this as a Russian exercise and not crossing what would be a very dangerous and critical line there.",

And they were only given about 15 minutes each to argue their case. But this hearing ended up stretching on for about two hours because of some pretty tough questioning from these judges especially for TikTok talk.Essentially what the judges are going to have to consider here is, first of all, does this law violate the First Amendment rights of TikTok and its users and if it does, is there sufficient justification in terms of these national security concerns to allow that restriction on speech. TikTok is certainly arguing that this is an illegal violation of the First Amendment for the app itself and its 170 million U.S. users. And the attorney for the company really hammered home on that point here. He said that for the government to crack down on the speech of a specific entity like this. It would need to face strict scrutiny and have a really real, real for doing that. And because all we've heard essentially a from the government at this point is hypothetical concerns that the Chinese government could potentially seek to access U.S. user data from TikTok that doesn't meet that ban, that bar that it would need to meet to do that. Now, the judges really sort of pushed back and questioning. They asked, why is this a violation of First Amendment rights? If TikTok app, the app could continue to exist in the U.S. just not under Chinese control. Now, we're awaiting to hear what the judges will decide on this, were expecting this will take a couple of weeks because what these parties are hoping for is a decision that one side or the other could potentially appeal and go to the Supreme Court before this January 19 deadline for TikTok too by their face a ban or sale.",

We will bring you those comments live once it begins. Now the man detained in this attempted assassination or apparent attempted assassination as the FBI is describing it at this stage of these investigation has been identified as among other things, a staunch support of Ukraine. Ryan Routh had visited the country and said in a 2022 video that he was willing to die in the war there. Ralph also criticized Trump and his self-published book on the conflict which he called unwinnable. CNN's Clare Sebastian has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, we're piecing together a picture of an individual with an intense interest, almost an obsession with trying to help Ukraine. But all of his efforts ultimately seemed to have failed. In a self published book released last year called \"Ukraine's Unwinnable War\", Ryan Routh admitted he was turned away from joining the fight himself because at 56, he was too old and had no military experience. After that, he turned his hand to trying to recruit foreign volunteers, setting up a makeshift recruitment center in Ukraine's Maidan Square which police later took down according to his book. He even tried through extensive social media posts to recruit Afghan soldiers fleeing the Taliban, something one American citizen who served in Ukraine's International Legion told CNN, was ill-conceived to the point of being a security risk. Both offices in Ukraine that handle foreign volunteer soldiers have told CNN he had nothing to do with them. The foreign coordination department of the land forces, even telling us he did reach out to them multiple times. But his ideas were, quote, delusional. Now what is clear, though, is that his passion for Ukraine did fuel some of his disappointment with U.S. leadership. This made clear in an interview with \"Newsweek\" Romania, one of many interviews he gave about Ukraine.",
