      "sentences": "A very warm welcome to the show, everyone, I'm Lynda Kinkade in for Isa Soares, good to have you with us.Tonight, a glimmer of hope in Sudan as the two warring factions reportedly agree to peace talks. Then, Russia and the U.S. in a war of words over casualties on Ukraine's frontlines. Plus, the father of artificial intelligence warns about the dangers of his creation. So just how risky is this new technology? Well, there are reports the leaders of the warring factions in Sudan have agreed to a seven-day ceasefire. The Foreign Ministry in neighboring South Sudan says the two sides have agreed in principle to a truce starting Thursday, and will send representatives to future peace talks. This comes after the collapse of several ceasefires, and the U.N. Refugee Agency has said it's bracing for more than 800,000 refugees who may flee to neighboring countries. It's believed more than 100,000 have already left. And complicating the matter, Sudan was already hosting refugees from other conflicts. The U.N. says more than 200,000 people from places like South Sudan may be forced to flee the fighting once more. The Saudi port of Jeddah is central to foreign powers, it's trying to evacuate their citizens from Sudan. CNN's Larry Madowo joins me now from Jeddah with the latest. Good to see you, Larry, thanks for joining us. So, these latest ceasefires we've been discussing have been marred with fighting. What can we expect from this latest ceasefire which is set to take place this Thursday, and talk to us about how potentially promising these peace talks are?",

      "sentences": "Lynda, I think everybody in Sudan is cautiously optimistic that this one will be different. Because they'reagreeing to a seven-day ceasefire in principle, underline that wording because that's some room for these two generals to back out of it if they need to. There's no indication that they will, but they've broken half a dozen ceasefires so far, so why should this be different? The other things we don't know about this ceasefire is, when exactly can they begin negotiating? Because the statement from President Salva Kiir of South Sudan who is leading the regional negotiating team said that he is urging the two leaders to name their negotiating teams and to agree on where that negotiation will happen, this dialogue. One of the places that's been mooted is here in Saudi Arabia, because Saudi Arabia is a key diplomatic player in Sudan, and has been running these ships from Port Sudan to Jeddah. We were on one of these ships over the weekend, made the trip to Port Sudan and back here. The 15th ship just landed, that's the one you see behind me here. So if these two happen, this ceasefire holds, it's a real glimmer of hope for a long-lasting solution in Sudan. But it's still -- we can only hope because there's been 18 days of conflict, so many people are leaving. There's 5,600 people who have just arrived from Port Sudan to Jeddah over the past two-and-half, three weeks. So that's how serious this is. But the people who are leaving, I've been speaking to them since we've been here over the past week, they're heartbroken. They're relieved to be safe, but they can't imagine what their families back home are going through. Listen to Ashraf. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ASHRAF FARAH-SULIMAN, EVACUATED FROM SUDAN:  I feel very sad, it's my hometown, I'm a long-term resident in Sudan, I lived in the United States for 20 years, and I came back home four years ago to support my country, and support my parents and their elder seniors. So, I wanted to like -- they wanted to retire back home, I wanted to see what that is since I left -- I left Sudan at a very young age, like at nine years old. So I really wanted to know, what can I do for Sudan in the future? I'm still young, and I wanted to build something there for our country, for my career, my profession. And I feel just very sad that I wasn't able to do that because of the civil war that's happening right now. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

KhaderAdnan had been on a hunger strike for nearly three months. The Islamic Jihad member was the face of resistance to Israel's policy of detaining some Palestinian suspects indefinitely without charge and without trial. The Palestinian authority is accusing Israel of a deliberate assassination by keeping Adnan in his cell despite his deteriorating condition. Israel says he had refused medical checks in prison. Well, his widow is appealing for calm, saying the family does not want a drop of blood to be spilled. But as CNN's Hadas Gold reports, militants in Gaza answered the news of his death with rocket fire. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) HADAS GOLD, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT (on camera):  At least, 22 rockets were fired from Gaza into Israel on Tuesday by Palestinian militants who said that they were doing this in response to the death of Khader Adnan, a prominent Palestinian prisoner who was found dead in his cell Tuesday morning after a more than 86-day hunger strike. Now, at least three people were injured by this rocket fire, including one 25-year-old man who was seriously injured by shrapnel, that's according to Israeli Emergency Medical authorities. And the militant factions in Gaza directly connecting these dozens of rockets to Khader Adnan's death, saying that these rockets were what they call a preliminary response to what they said was a heinous crime. Now Khader Adnan is a former spokesperson for the militant group Palestinian-Islamic Jihad. He had been arrested at least ten times by the Israeli authorities since 2004. And this was not his first hunger strike, he had been on at least five other hunger strikes in 2004. But this morning, the Israeli prison authority saying that they found Adnan unconscious in his cell this morning, and they said that he had been refusing medical treatment as a result of his hunger strike. Now, the Islamic Jihad group saying that as a result of what they said was Adnan's martyrdom, they had promoted him to be a commander in Islamic Jihad. And aside from the reaction of the rockets that we saw from Gaza, there is also a general strike called across the entire West Bank and Gaza, meaning that everything from shops to schools are closed down as a result of Adnan's death. And he had really just become a symbol, the face of Palestinian resistance, and especially for the thousands of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli prison. Well, what's interesting is, Adnan's wife actually in a statement to the media said that she did not want to see rockets fired as a result of her husband's death. Take a listen. RANDA MUSA, WIDOW OF KHADER ADNAN (through translator):  Not a drop of blood was spilled during the previous prisoner's hunger strikes. And today, we say, with the rise of the martyr and his accomplishment of what he wished for, we do not want a drop of blood to be spilled. We do not want someone to respond to his martyrdom, we do not want rockets to be launched, and then for Gaza to be struck.",

This is often something that Israeli authorities use, they say, for security reasons. There are at least, a 1,000 prisoners who are in this sort of administrative detention, Palestinian prisoners in this administrative detention in Israeli prisons.

      "sentences": "Well, the important point about the statement from John Kirby; the U.S. National SecurityCouncil spokesman yesterday, was that he was suggesting a 100,000 had been wounded or killed since December. Essentially, since Russia's intensive offensive against the city of Bakhmut and other areas in the Donbas region had got underway during the Winter. Now, as you mentioned, 20,000 there are said to have been killed, half of those, he said, were likely to have been in the Wagner Group. Now, that is the mercenary group who have used convicts taken from Russian prisons, and sent them to the frontlines, predominantly around Bakhmut. Just to recap here, Bakhmut has been a city which Russia has fought intensely for, using convicts on the frontlines often as human waves, charging Ukrainian positions and being shot down. Harrowing experience, frankly, even for the Ukrainian soldiers involved in that kind of combat. But the intensity of loss there has been documented on the frontline. The figures we're hearing from the White House, though, are still in themselves utterly extraordinary. I mean, if you do very bad math here, you essentially have to conclude that anyone aged between 15 and 64, according to World Bank figures, who lives in Russia, has at some point been killed or wounded in the area of Ukraine since December. That's extraordinary numbers, and gained apparently from a U.S. Intelligence, which has been downgraded, and then passed towards the media. So, part possibly here, of a U.S. bid to prepare the information space ahead of Ukraine's counteroffensive to remind the world what is clearly a fact that Russia has sustained incredible losses in the fight around Bakhmut. But that will surely play into the narrative we've been hearing over the past two days, after weeks in which Russian military officials had begun to suggest they thought they might be on the ascendant around Bakhmut, potentially able to encircle and cut off the remaining Ukrainian forces inside of it. We heard at the weekend, a key Russian figure, Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of that Wagner Mercenary Group, who has been   fighting for Bakhmut suggesting that if he didn't get enough shells, he might potentially have to think about withdrawing his forces from that city. And just in the last 48 -- 24 hours, Ukrainian officials sounding a lot more bullish about pushing forward and pushing Russians out of position. So whatever really is happening in Bakhmut, hard to get a clear read on it. It certainly, at this point, is not boding in a very simple way, well, for Russia ahead of this long-expected Ukrainian counteroffensive, Lynda.",

So keep putting things in context is always important clearly. But the second thing I'd say is, I'm not for one minute suggesting that we shouldn't educate ourselves more, hold companies to account, and absolutely develop regulation. But I'm saying that a pause in my opinion, doesn't feel like the right tool to create those bits of change, because we're going to be in competition with other countries in the world that are not going to pause. China is certainly not pausing its A.I. technology capability, and it feels to me as though pausing is the wrong way of framing.

But in so many other ways, Lynda, nothing has changed at all. And by that I mean that the White House's position and House Republicans' position simply have not changed. The White House is still insisting that a clean debt ceiling is the only way out of this crisis, meaning raising the debt ceiling without any spending cuts without anything else attached to that legislation, which is the way that, historically, the debt ceiling has been raised, including under former president Trump, with Republicans joining him in that effort. House Republicans, for their part, say they still want to see these deep spending cuts and changes to spending patterns that we saw in the bill that they passed last week.

And with the clock really ticking down to this, we know that the consequences of a potential default on the United States' debt obligations could be really catastrophic. And that's really not hyperbolic. When you look at the potential consequences, talking about millions of jobs being lost. We're talking about the U.S. likely slipping into a recession. The global stock markets are sure to tumble. You would see Social Security payments, veterans' benefits payments, stop most likely. So again there are really enormous consequences for everyday Americans and, as of now, Washington simply does not have a way out of this crisis. We'll see whether or not that meeting, a week from today, between the president and the congressional leaders, can move the ball on that. The White House has said they are willing to talk about budget and spending cuts, simply not linked up with raising the debt ceiling. Lynda.",

      "sentences": "As the sun sets on the Taiwan Strait, the neon lights of Xiamen in Southeastern China dazzle inthe dusk. CNN cameras close enough to read the glowing signs, a glimpse of mainland China on the inside. But you may be surprised to learn, I'm not standing in mainland China. I'm here in Taiwan, on a small island sitting surprisingly close to that bustling metropolis behind me Less than four miles of water, that is all that divides this democracy from Communist China. (voice-over):  Our 200-mile flight from Taipei to the Kinmen Islands takes about an hour. A boat can reach the mainland in minutes. Some islanders feel like sitting ducks, at the mercy of China's People's Liberation Army. The PLA launched massive military drills near Taiwan twice in the last nine months. China calls the drills a response to Taiwan President Tsai Ing- Wen's high-profile meetings with two U.S. House speakers, Nancy Pelosi in Taipei last year, Kevin McCarthy in California last month. Just off the coast of Kinmen, we see Chinese sand dredgers China is reclaiming land to build a new airport, the mainland coast getting closer every day. \"We all hope war doesn't break out here,\" says the chairman of the visitors association. \"We think it's basically impossible for our military to defend Kinmen.\" But they did defend the islands more than 70 years ago. Tens of thousands of nationalist troops from Taiwan repelled the mainland's communist forces. Thins are very different today. Only a few thousand Taiwanese soldiers remain. China now has the world's largest navy. Taiwan's outlying islands are no longer strategically valuable and almost defenseless, if the PLA decides to make a move. Many here are calling for Taiwan's military to pull out completely. \"We don't want Kinmen to become a battlefield again,\" Wu (ph) says. \"If there are no soldiers or military installations, we can become a demilitarized zone and attract more tourists.\" He says the handful of remaining military sites are shockingly vulnerable. Last year, civilian drones from China hover over several island outposts. This video shows startled soldiers throwing rocks, raising questions about the military's readiness. Taiwan says it shot down at least one unidentified civilian drone. In so many ways, the local culture on this side and that side, almost the same. Politics, of course, the big exception. But many who grew up here are calling for closer ties with communist China. They lived with the alternative. Decades of ferocious fighting, right here on the front line. (voice-over):  These battle-scarred outlying islands bore the brunt of damage during the worst decades of the cross-strait conflict. From the late 1940s through the 1970s, relentless artillery attacks left behind mountains of metal. \"We worry history might repeat itself,\" says Mai-Sta Wu (ph), who makes knives from old artillery. \"If that happens, it will change our way of life.\" Bullet-riddled buildings, bomb shelters, beaches lined with anti- landing spikes. Rusty relics, waiting for the waves of change to come crashing in - - Will Ripley, CNN, Kinmen, Taiwan. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
