Just on Saturday and Sunday, he was making these comments that seemed to hit at potential trial witnesses, which is prohibited by a gag order.

They're not going to be asked about their actual political affiliation but they will be asked about where did you get your news source from. Do you look at CNN? Do you look at MSNBC for your news? Do you go to The New York Times?And the crux for the Trump lawyers is to find the one juror they think could be a sleeper. The one juror who could hang the case because they're not particularly convinced by the evidence. And that's the sort of person that the prosecution is trying to avoid seating on the jury because that could upend the entire case.

And his lawyers, from what we understand, have been urging him not to take the stand and to not testify. But at the end of the day, the person who is going to make that decision is Trump alone.And I think there is an interesting thing about Trump here, which is all defendants say before high-profile criminal cases and before high- profile trials that they will testify. They want to clear their own name. With Trump, there is the added bravado, right? Because if it turns out he doesn't testify, by saying ahead of time that he wanted to but maybe his lawyers prevented him so from testifying, that gives him an out with his MAGA base. He always wants to look defiant and he always wants to look bold, and if he ends up not testifying he can always blame it on someone else here and save face, so --",

But somebody that I think would be very interesting to hear from is Hope Hicks, who -- you know, even though you see her around the former president, you see her in Trump's orbit, you don't hear from her that much.

You know, the one person I'm really interested to see testify when we really get into the trial is David Pecker because David Pecker, the head of National Enquirer who facilitated the first round of catch- and-kill payments with Karen McDougal. You know, he had a falling out with Trump. Prosecutors always want trial witnesses who can get on the stand and can represent that they were previously friends with the defendant in the case but had a falling out and can be, therefore, quite credible because they can say look, these people who are otherwise friends. And in David Pecker's case, it's significant because the only reason that David Pecker wasn't involved in the second round of catch-and- kill schemes with Stormy Daniels was that Trump stiffed him on the original $150,000 that he was supposed to pay for the Karen McDougal story.

And so, it's an easy target -- an easy opening for Trump's lawyers to trying and impeach him and his credibility on the witness stand.But here's the problem with that strategy -- which, kind of, Michael alluded to a little bit -- which is when you have all the documents as the Manhattan D.A.'s office does -- if you have all of the receipts and the invoices, which is the underlying charge here -- remember, it's falsification of business records in furtherance of campaign election financial violations. When you have the receipts, it's very difficult to then say well, the witness is lying but the receipts are not. And I think that's the fundamental problem that Trump's going to run into. And his principal strategy is going to be trying to delink the campaign finance violation allegations from the underlying falsification of business charges. They know they probably can't get away with the falsification of business records but they think they might be able to sway the jury on the campaign finance front.",

And when Americans go to the ballot later this year, they may have to base their voting decisions on what they saw in this trial.And if there is any part of this trial where Trump is seen to be victorious, maybe he is able to knock down the felony allegations to misdemeanors if Trump successfully convinces the jury that there is no campaign finance violation, for instance. Then I think that will be treated as a win. It will be treated as a win by Trump's team. And I think that will severely take the sail -- the wind out of the sails for Biden -- the Biden campaign -- which have been trying to make this case the whole part of that campaign. They're trying to compare now Biden to Trump and saying well, Trump, he's mired in all these criminal and legal problems, but Biden is not.

And they also think it's similar enough to come of the civil cases that they can muddied the distinction in the public's eye. You know, the American voter -- the average voter is probably not in the weeds of all of these civil and criminal proceedings. And with Trump having just come out of the New York civil fraud case where that was about inflating his asset values; the E.

Now, he is a Masters champion for the second time in three years. And Scheffler is the first favorite to go into this tournament and then win it since Tiger back in 2005. And he was tied for the lead halfway through that final round and that's when Scheffler just showed why he's the best ball-strike in the game. This shot on nine here nearly rolled in for an eagle. Scheffler had four more birdies on the back nine. He would cruise to a four-shot victory.Now, he had said he would leave the Masters on Sunday if his wife Meredith went into labor. The couple is expecting their first child later this month. And I asked Scheffler if he was worried about that at all with the lead on the back nine. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER, 2-TIME MASTERS CHAMPION:  No, no. You know, I guess that's a -- that's a testament to what good -- how good of a headspace I was in. I wasn't thinking about that much. I was doing my best to stay in the moment and stay calm and execute shots. When it comes to having a kid, every single person says that it changes your life and it's the most special thing in the world. So I cannot -- marriage has been such a tremendous aspect of my life and I cannot even imagine what being a parent is going to be like. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He ended up 16 over for the tournament, which was the worst score ever in his career. But despite a tough weekend, Tiger -- well, he was happy with his performance. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TIGER WOODS, 5-TIME MAJORS CHAMPION:  It was a good week all around. I think that coming in here and having not have played a full tournament in a very long time, it was a -- it was a good fight -- a good fight on Thursday and Friday. Unfortunately, yesterday didn't quite turn out the way I wanted it to. It doesn't take much to get out of position here and unfortunately, I got out of position a lot yesterday and a couple of times today. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
