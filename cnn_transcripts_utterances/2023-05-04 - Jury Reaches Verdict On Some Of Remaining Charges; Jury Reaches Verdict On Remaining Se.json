And there are a - there is a discussion going on, on what is going to be happening.Now, what we do understand from two reporters we have there is that there is additional verdicts, at least one additional verdict on some of those charges that the jury was not able to come to a conclusion on. Although there are other things that the jury is now telling the judge they haven't been able to get a unanimous agreement on and they probably won't. That doesn't mean deliberations are over. The big picture here when you step back, though, when you look at this is that the Justice Department has locked up convictions. They have locked up, the - finding four for leaders of the Proud Boys guilty of seditious conspiracy and others guilty of other serious charges conspiracy, obstruction, rioting on the Capitol, assaulting police, taking a riot shield. Those are all very, very serious counts put together and it is quite a significant moment for the Justice Department to be able to bring this case to this conclusion after so many attempts by this defense team to get this case thrown out, to get a mistrial declared or to get the jury somehow derailed from finding these men guilty.",

Though, in the past, the Justice Department had tried to bring it against militia members. It had not survived in court, was tossed out on the law.But seditious conspiracy was something that the Justice Department decided that they thought they could prove and they have proven with multiple juries now against members of the Oath Keepers, that right- wing group of many former military police who came to the Capitol on January 6 and were led by Stewart Rhodes, the leader there and then now with the Proud Boys, another right-wing group. And they were able to prove with this seditious conspiracy case two things, that there was an agreement among these four men, at least, that they did want to take part in violence, that they wanted to get people interested in politics and then were so angered by the result of the 2020 election that they wanted to then try and overthrow the U.S. government or block or hinder the laws of the U.S. government. A very, very significant accusation. At the end of the day, it carries a similar possibility of prison time to other counts that these men are charged with. But just the decision alone by the Justice Department to bring a seditious conspiracy case here and to be able to secure it, to secure the guilty convictions by this jury. That is a big deal.",

We know that the jury has already found four of the Proud Boys leaders, the people who were in touch well before January 6th talking about civil war, they have found those men guilty of seditious conspiracy. They had not reached a verdict this morning on whether Pezzola also would be guilty or not guilty of that charge. We haven't yet seen the jury come back in to deliver what that verdict is. They were in and then they went out of the courtroom again. There are some other counts that the jury was not able to come to a conclusion on. But those are relatively minor compared to the work that this jury did today and over the last seven days, we will be able to see the result for all five Proud Boys defendants on trial today related to that seditious conspiracy charge levied by the Justice Department.",

Renato, what do you think about this? And obviously, there are so many charges at play here. The jury able to make a lot of progress as we await to hear this fifth verdict when it comes to Dominic Pezzola, but what do you think overall of what's come out so far?   RENATO MARIOTTI, CNN LEGAL ANALYST:   Well, first of all, this really looks like a very careful jury. I think it gives you some newfound faith in the jury system. It's clearly a jury that's very carefully considering the evidence and the charges. I think it's going to actually help, by the way, these verdicts be upheld on appeal even the fact that the jury is careful (inaudible) ...",

You and others have made that point on the air repeatedly four, yes, guilty, as well as other charges. One of the five found not guilty here. Just place this into context here.

Sara, you and I were talking just a little bit ago about consequences here. And Renato just underscored that point by saying this really flies in the face of any argument that this was just a bunch of people that got together and happened to be at the Capitol that day. This is a seditious conspiracy conviction for four of these people. This latest gentleman, not guilty, but guilty of so many other things. Help us understand what this means for this moving forward and kind of zoom out if you can, because we're kind of getting down in the weeds a little bit for people who are just tuning in, what does this mean?",

      "sentences": "All right. So I'll sort of start with the reasons why perhaps the jury did not convict Pezzola, the fifth defendant who faced seditious conspiracy charges. Part of the reason may be because he was not in a leadership position. Enrique Tarrio was then the president, if you will, or the leader of the national organization of Proud Boys at that time.And then the others who were convicted held some kind of a higher up role. And so you had someone who was like the head of the Philadelphia Proud Boys, right, the president of the Philadelphia Proud Boys. So they looked at this and said, in order for this to have been a conspiracy in order for this and plan and plotted the heads of these different Proud Boy groups, were at the forefront of this and they had to show the evidence. Again, this is not - this trial went on for something like 18 weeks. There was a mountain of evidence and there was a large defense as well, which is one of the reasons why this went on so long. A lot of arguing by the attorneys with the judge, with the other attorneys on all sorts of different pieces and parts of this case. But ultimately, a jury of their peers came back and said, you are guilty of seditious conspiracy. You are guilty of going after police officers and taking their equipment and breaking into the Capitol. And it is significant, they took video of themselves out there. And trust me when I say as I watched this group change, and morph, and grow. The group was growing up until this time. And the question now will be is this a warning to those thinking about joining groups like this, who started to become quite radicalized, quite far-right, quite extreme? Is this a warning to those thinking about joining or being attracted to them to see what is happening to these men who were - went to the Capitol, one of whom didn't even go to the Capitol, but was still convicted of seditious conspiracy. You talk to anyone who covers and watches extremist groups in this country and they will tell you, it will definitely be something that may chill the water for anyone thinking of jumping into one of these groups.",

There's what we saw happen to so many police officers who suffered that day.
