That's according to a Pentagon memo obtained by CNN.The object shot down over Alaska was metallic and the size of a small car. The object shot down over Canada was a small metallic balloon. It crossed near sensitive sites in the U.S. before it was shot down. And the object shot down over Lake Huron on Sunday slowly descended into the water after impact. Now, the objects were flying at altitudes between 20,000 to 40,000 feet. The military decided to shoot them down because at those altitudes they could pose a threat to civilian aircraft, which would be really, really serious. Joining us now, White House National Security Council coordinator for Strategic Communications, and that's John Kirby. John Kirby, thank you for joining us this morning -- appreciate it.",

And I -- and I do respect him.But I think what is escalatory is allowing Putin to win this war in Ukraine. And when you are defending yourself from genocide, defending your people, your infrastructure, to me, precision strike capability is not a -- is not an offensive measure. You know, I guess I get his point if he thinks that this -- using this capability could lead to World War 3. But in my experience and being a close student and studier of Russia, spending a lot of time there understanding a lot about I think Putin and his motivation, he's not going to back down. And I think we need to defeat him on the battlefield as quickly as possible or that's where the escalation is going to occur.",

I think U.S. government law allowed him to do it.But now I think we're learning that maybe this should be a capability that the U.S. government or NATO has control over to allow countries that are attacked in this illegal, immoral, genocidal way to defend themselves. And I wish he would -- I really do wish he could reconsider this because again, to me the biggest point is when you are -- I mean, this is on Ukrainian territory. It's not like he's using this capability to attack Russia. He is -- the Ukrainians are using it to defend themselves from tanks, troops, artillery.
