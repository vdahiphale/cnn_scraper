Super Tuesday is just a day away and all eyes will be on Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley to see if she can gain traction against Donald Trump. Fifteen states and one U.S. territory will hold Republican primaries on Tuesday and Democrats will hold contests too. One of those states is Colorado. Trump's name is on the ballot, even though the U.S. Supreme Court is still deciding whether he's eligible to serve. The high court could announce an opinion in the coming hours, but there is no guarantee. Meantime, President Joe Biden is preparing to deliver his State of the Union address on Thursday. It comes at a crucial time as he's seeking to convince Americans to give him a second term. Nikki Haley received a much-needed boost on Sunday. She won the Republican primary in Washington, D.C., her first win so far. But Donald Trump gained more than double her D.C. delegates with wins in Idaho, Missouri and Michigan. Trump supporters heckled Haley at a campaign stop in Maine on Sunday. Two men were removed from the event after briefly interrupting her. During her remarks, Haley slammed Trump for pressuring Republican lawmakers into blocking progress on immigration laws. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIKKI HALEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: -- congress, what they should have done, was gotten in a room, strengthened the bill and then gotten something out. But Donald Trump said don't pass anything until after the general election because it would hurt him. We can't wait one more day to pass a strong border bill. Congress needs to do their job and Trump needs to stay out of it, period. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Three of those four polls had him below 40 percent in approval. There are -- we saw in 2022, there are a substantial number of Americans who will say that I am disappointed in Biden's performance. I am disappointed in the economy, but I still am going to vote for Democrats because I consider the Republican alternative too extreme, a threat to my rights, to my values, to democracy itself. But Rosemary, there's not an infinite pool of those voters. And to go from an approval rating of 36 or 38 percent to a winning coalition in a presidential election requires a very large number of people to say, I don't like the job of the incumbent, but I'm going to vote for him because I like the alternative even less. He needs to begin improving his own standing with the public and certainly laying out a compelling agenda for what a second term might mean, which he's done very little of at this state of the union would be an important step in that direction.",

I mean, there is kind of no council of elders. You know, if there's anybody who is going to convince him that this is not worth doing, it's as someone else has said, it's probably someone with a Biden at the end of their name. Even Obama might not have that influence over him, given that he told him, you know, unceremoniously not to run in 2016. And that didn't turn out so well for Democrats.You know, I think there is a view in the Democratic Party, however, that beyond Biden, the party itself needs to be more aggressive in pushing at the vulnerabilities of Trump, which are still very real, even though they've been kind of overshadowed by the manifest vulnerabilities of Biden. So, you know, I think there is a desire for the groups working on the various issues where Trump might be vulnerable, abortion, some of his immigration responses, which has obviously been an issue that has been hurting Biden, to become more forceful in making a case against him. But there's not that much anyone else can do. It really is Joe Biden who has to meet the dual challenge of convincing people that he is physically and mentally up to another term, and that he has plans that will produce better conditions than voters believe they're experiencing now. Obviously, inflation is just overshadowing a lot of other positive developments in the economy. They can kind of highlight those positive developments in advertising in the key states. But as long as necessities of life are costing 15, 20 percent more than when Biden took office, it's probably going to be the contrast with Trump more than selling Biden's record that it's going to get him over the top if he gets there.",

He's going to be meeting with V.P. Kamala Harris, as you said, with Secretary of State Tony Blinken, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, as well as other lawmakers and pro-Israel lobby groups. And what he's going to be doing is conveying Israeli messages, advocating for Israel's war with Hamas and its war objectives, namely destroying Hamas and getting those 100 or so hostages back home into Israel, and also discussing tensions in the north of Israel between the Iranian proxy Hezbollah and Israel, where things have been simmering, there's tit-for-tat fire on a daily basis, and where the U.S. is very adamant that there shouldn't be an escalation into full- blown war. But there is a bit of a subplot going in here, going on here as well, because Benny Gantz doesn't seem to be going with the blessing of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and only seems to have informed the prime minister on Friday. And there are a number of comments in the Israeli media and also even on X, for example, one of Netanyahu's justice ministers, describing Benny Gantz as something of a Trojan horse on his trip to the United States and perhaps positioning himself for a day when, after elections, which all opinion polls suggest Netanyahu would lose and Benny Gantz would win, that Gantz would then go on to be prime minister. And certainly, although they won't say this in public, Benny Gantz would seem to be someone that the Biden administration would feel that it could do business with on a much more easier basis than it can with Netanyahu. For a start, Gantz's position on a two-state solution, although somewhat undefined, is certainly not as obdurately opposed to a Palestinian state as Prime Minister Netanyahu. So there is a bit of a subplot going on here. Will there be any breakthroughs from this trip or indeed Gantz's subsequent trip to the U.K., which is where he's going to next?

UNKNOWN: That doesn't impact how I feel about it. Crime happens everywhere. I don't think it's going to happen. You're more likely in one place than another, you know. It's just a chance of where you're going to be at that day.",

In fact, they're upset amid allegations that Singapore paid up to three million U.S. dollars a show for this exclusive arrangement for Taylor Swift and her Eras tour. And today, we heard from Singapore's culture minister. He addressed the controversy to Parliament, saying that the grant is not as high as speculated.Now, let's give you the background, what's been happening here. So, last week, we heard from a lawmaker in the Philippines. He called on his country to put the pressure on Singapore to get an explanation. This is what we heard from Joey Salceda. He said, quote, \"this isn't what good neighbors do\". And he goes on to say \"it was at the expense of neighboring countries, which could not attract their own foreign concertgoers and whose fans had to go to Singapore\", unquote. Now, the allegations -- they were made earlier by the Thai prime minister, and he made them at a business forum in Bangkok earlier in February. And he said that Singapore paid Taylor Swift up to three million U.S. dollars per show, allegedly on condition of exclusivity, that this would be only in Singapore and across the entire Southeast Asia region. And Srettha, the prime minister of Thailand, also added this quote to bring it up for you, \"if I had known this, I would have brought the shows to Thailand\", unquote. Now, we did put out word to Taylor Swift's concert promoting, and we are awaiting comment from them. Now, we have heard from the government of Singapore. And Singapore said that it did award Taylor Swift a grant to perform there, but it did not confirm the exclusivity arrangement. And then today, we heard from its culture minister, Edwin Tong, who made new comments about the grant. This is what he said to Parliament. He said, there has been some online speculation as to the size of the grant. I can say that it's not accurate. It's not anywhere as high as speculated. Now, he cited confidentiality reasons. He said he couldn't reveal the size of the grant or the conditions of the grant. Now, this week, Taylor Swift is closing out the Asia leg of her tour. She's playing six solo nights to some 300,000 fans of Singapore. Her only stop in Southeast Asia. And so Singapore is getting a massive economic boost here. In fact, according to an economist at Maybank, a local bank, seven in 10 concertgoers in Singapore are coming in from overseas, and they're spending up to $370 million in Singapore on hotels, on food, and on entertainment. That's a big boost for Singapore. Back to you.",
