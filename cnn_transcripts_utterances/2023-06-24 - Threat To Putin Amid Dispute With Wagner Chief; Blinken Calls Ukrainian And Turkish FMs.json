Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of the Russian mercenary group says he's turning his forces around from a march towards the Russian capital potentially ending an apparent military coup against Putin. But it remains unclear whether the most significant challenge from Vladimir Putin during his more than two decades hold on power is truly over.The Kremlin says that as part of a deal with Prigozhin, Wagner fighters will return to base and not, repeat, not face legal action for taking part in the march. The Wagner chief is also said to be heading to neighboring Belarus. U.S. Intelligence officials tell CNN they believe Prigozhin had been planning a major challenge to Russia's military leadership for quite some time but were surprised by the rapid escalation of the situation. The White House says it's closely monitoring events in Russia and that President Biden is being continually updated by his national security team.

They believed that Prigozhin was making preparations and planning for a major challenge to Russian military leadership in recent days and weeks.They were surprised by the speed of his operation in the last 24 hours, but were not surprised that this challenge had taken place. They'd seen a number of preparations in the leadup to this. The massing of weapons, contacts with regular Russian army units, and then, of course, his very public statements critical of Russian military leadership and right up to Vladimir Putin in recent days and weeks as well. And they saw all of those signals, and saw those as preparations for some serious challenge to Russian military leadership which is what we seem to have seen play out over these tumultuous last 24 hours. I will say that during that time frame another thing they were watching closely as Prigozhin marched his forces first to Rostov-on- Don and then further at least towards Moscow was how much or how many Russian regular army units would join him in that. Early on, as we were discussing earlier in the day, they noticed that many Russian units did not seem to be challenging Prigozhin's advance, though not perhaps joining him but at least not challenging him. Letting him pass by. What isn't clear is that there was a critical mass of other forces joining him in this challenge here. And that could have been an influential factor in what we've seen just in these last couple of hours there. A reversal by Prigozhin and his forces, and now seeing them leave, head back to their camps, to their bases.",

And that's I think one of the possibilities. And the possibility as General Clark of him going to Belarus is something that has to be considered. The possibility that they might be redeploying within Ukraine to some other area that is perhaps weaker now because of some other things. That's also possible. So there are a lot of things that could still happen. He could still be considered a threat by Putin because the language was very strong this morning in Putin's speech, but there's something that is not quite adding up here.",

And I have to say, you know, the forces that moved were substantial. You don't just pull together something like that from ragtag individuals on the front lines and a few hours later roll into Rostov.So does that possibly speak to whether or not this air strike at the camp on Friday, which Yevgeny Prigozhin said was essentially the key inspiration or the driving force behind the decision to move towards Rostov, whether that, indeed, did change a plan or in fact just providing justification for something they'd long-planned before. I hate to disagree with my two esteemed friends here but I don't think we're looking at an arch design or strategy over the past couple days here, masterminded by somebody somewhere to deceive us. This is chaos, frankly. And I don't think we really understand quite why Yevgeny Prigozhin has changed his mind. But Vladimir Putin I don't think would want to entertain some sort of staggering display of weakness like we've seen over the past two days or so. This makes him look exceptionally frail. And the fact he had to turn, it seems, to the Belarusian President Aleksandr Lukashenko, a man frankly who he considers to be a subordinate, who he can order around as a lesser ally, to come in and engineer this sort of compromise that gets Prigozhin to stand down, that in itself, is humiliating. So I think a lot of the time we like to feel that there's some sort of eminence grise behind the chaos in Russia or that the Russian state is somehow in control of all the strings that control a marionette on its stage. I think what we've seen here is a real sign of splits in the elite that we've known around for a while. It spilled into the open. Quite why we didn't see the Wagner group move all the way to the capital, we may never know the answer to that. They may simply not have fancied the idea of driving into a massive metropolis full of police and people who may not want them to be there without adequate support. But there may also be something else, as we said earlier on, that's not in our knowledge at the moment and we may learn down the line. I don't think this crisis is finished and certainly what is not finished is the perception that Putin's grip on power in Russia, I think it's fair to say, is not what it was 48 hours ago, Wolf.",

So you know, you can't always take it at face value. You have to, I agree it looks chaotic, to us it looks like he's weak, but I think we also have to look as deeply as we can at what his motives might be and might actually -- what actually the outcome of this might be.

And that should be no surprise.Earlier today speaking with his counterparts from the G7, also the foreign affairs, the top foreign affairs official for the E.U. and then later today speaking with the foreign minister from Ukraine, also the foreign minister from Turkey. In all of these conversations, the readout from the State Department has been clear. That the U.S. support for Ukraine has not changed. But in terms of an actual response or reaction from the White House or from the State Department to this evolving crisis over the last 24 hours, we really haven't seen a whole lot in terms of responding to every twist and turn that we have been reporting on here. And that's a calculated decision, Wolf. When you talk to U.S. officials, Western officials what they say is that they don't want to weigh in because they don't want President Putin to perceive anything that they could say as potentially escalating this ongoing crisis or trying to influence this ongoing crisis. But behind the scenes, intelligence officials from the United States have actually been tracking what has been Wagner group's build up of its military capabilities, its ammunition, its weapons along the border with Ukraine for some time. And one of the things that they have been, you know, looking at is the possibility that he would actually challenge the Russian ministry of defense. Of course, that is what we have seen evolving here. And it's interesting. One of the things that a U.S. official told our colleague is they think that when Prigozhin was talking about there being a dearth of ammunition, they believe that that was deliberate deception on his part, because he was actually building up ammunition for this potential aggression which has played out over the course of the last 24 hours. Now, of course, what we're watching for now is what the White House, what the State Department, is saying. Now that there appears to be this de-escalation, this agreement that has been brokered by the president of Belarus. We have yet to get a response. But of course, U.S. officials are watching this incredibly closely. President Biden earlier today traveling from the White House to Camp David.

And then, of course, to the extent that you can, and this is tough for Western intelligence, because of how opaque Russia is, it's determining if others may take advantage of this moment of weakness for Putin and push him out. So if, in fact, Prigozhin meant, this is a coup, perhaps others may take advantage of this moment of vulnerability.

Head of the Wagner mercenary group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, says he's turning his forces around from a march towards the Russian capital of Moscow.What does that really mean for the most significant challenge to Vladimir Putin during his 23 years in power? Let's discuss what's going on with the former CNN Moscow bureau chief, Jill Dougherty, along with the former CIA chief of Russian operations, Steve Hall. Jill, let me start with you. The Kremlin says Prigozhin has a guarantee from Putin that he can go to Belarus, neighboring Belarus, which is a close ally of Putin's. What do you expect Putin's next moves will be? JILL DOUGHERTY, ADJUNCT PROFESSOR, GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY &amp; FORMER CNN MOSCOW BUREAU CHIEF: Well, that's the question, isn't it? But I think Putin -- you know, what did Prigozhin want? Prigozhin has said he wants to get rid of the leadership of the military, people like the Defense Minister Shoigu, and General Gerasimov. We don't know whether he got that behind the scenes. So I think we ought to be watching where Shoigu is. Is he still around? Is he still the defense minister? That would be one. Then also, by sticking Yevgeny Prigozhin in Belarus, that doesn't really solve the problem, because Prigozhin, you know, is powerful in the sense that he makes a lot of money solving problems for Putin around the world. Into blood diamonds in Africa. Providing security in conflict zones, et cetera. So I don't think it's as easy to say good-bye go to Belarus and never meet again. He is a threat no matter where he goes. The question that should be asked, I think, and won't be answered, of course, for a while, but does Prigozhin get paid off in some way? Does he get to keep the companies that he's got? Because not only, you know, war with Wagner, it's also these very lucrative things around the world. And then it looks like Wagner is a military group that may begin to disintegrate if they become part of the regular military.

Because in this the tabloids recently, he's been saying the reason he hates the conventional military is because they're all elitists. They're not patriots. He is the patriot. That these guys are ripping off the military. They are deceiving Putin, et cetera. So he's really, you know, kind of playing a populist card, too.

A lot of history going on in the last 48 hours. It was stunning to see violence on Russian soil. And then it's stunning to see how they've come to this, at least, temporary deal. For me, it just reinforces Putin's weakness. This deal just -- it just gives kind of -- gives away the farm, in a way. And it will be interesting to see what Putin does in the next couple of weeks. But I -- I would -- if you would have told me a year ago that we'd have this kind of violence and then in the face of that violence Putin would caught deal, have a head of another country cut a deal on his behalf like this, that doesn't call for big detainment or massive arrests, I compare it to what happened in 2016 when we had an attempted coup in Turkey. Right? Very different situation, but, man, at end of it, whether you like him or not, Erdogan came out stronger. He made his point, pushed back. He awakened the Turkish people to push back in the middle of the coup. He was on-screen talking to people on cell phone videos.
