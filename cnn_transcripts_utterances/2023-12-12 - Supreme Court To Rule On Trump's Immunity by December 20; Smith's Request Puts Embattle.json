      "sentences": "Ukraine's President hoping for a warm welcome on a cold day in Washington, Volodymyr Zelenskyy on CapitolHill, taking his case for aid straight to skeptical lawmakers before meeting with President Joe Biden. We're going to speak to Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley about that. And Mr. Smith goes to the Supreme Court. The Special Counsel asks for an expedited decision about whether Donald Trump has presidential immunity in his election subversion case. How it will play out for the Republican frontrunner in the middle of the GOP primary season? Good day, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt to our viewers watching the United States and around the world. It's 11a.m. here in Washington, Tuesday, December 12, just 34 days until the Iowa caucuses, 328 days until Election Day. This is today's State of the Race. Happening right now, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy here in Washington, speaking with lawmakers on Capitol Hill before he heads to the White House to meet President Biden. His visit comes with U.S. aid to Ukraine stalled in Congress, as he tries to win over American support for Ukraine's war against Russia. We're going to be tracking this news throughout the hour. But first, the Supreme Court considering Special Counsel Jack Smith's request to decide whether Donald Trump has any immunity in his federal election subversion case. Lawyers for Trump have argued that the former President's alleged actions were part of his official duties at the time. I want to bring in CNN Legal Analyst, Joey Jackson, and Senior Supreme Court Analyst, Joan Biskupic. Let's dig right into this. And Joan, I want to come to you in a second in terms of how the Supreme Court is likely to handle this. But, Joey, can you first set the stage for us as to why it is that this question of presidential immunity is one that needs to be determined at all in this case? JOEY JACKSON, CNN LEGAL ANALYST, &amp; CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Yeah, Kasie. It's very important. And the significance of it is that we have an impending trial. Right? There is a trial scheduled for March before Judge Chutkan, and it relates to issues with respect to presidential conduct, right? What did he do in terms of the subversion of the election? And so, as a result of that, before you get to the trial, if the President has immunity, the argument is there should be no trial, and there would be no need for a trial. And so, it's significant because prior, right, to engaging, that is a jury and going forward, you have to have that critical question answered. Now, from the President's perspective, I think there was some thought in filing the papers for immunity to indicate that everything should be dismissed because we have immunity, which means in English, I'm untouchable, is that this could occasion delay. Right? We know that the President had wanted to delay the matter as long as he could. But, Jack Smith, as we see there, has said, look, Supreme Court, I need you to entertain this and entertain it immediately. And it seems as though the Supreme Court is poised to do that. And so, the question will then become when the Supreme Court gets the issue on the question, what will they do with the Judge Chutkan's ruling in which he said, look, we don't represent or do we elect kings or monarchs? We elect a President, and a President is not above the law. The President is subjected to the Constitution and the rule of law, like everyone else, by the way, and there is no support within the Constitution itself for any immunity, in addition to a number of other reasons and bases as to why the judge viewed immunity as a non-starter. So, in light of that, we would and could get to the Supreme Court. I think it's a determination that they could reach quickly, and that the trial should be able to proceed in order in March, if all things fall in place.",

Thank you all for being here. Alice Stewart, this is a -- in many ways -- it's almost a no win situation for the Supreme Court, we're being honest. It seems like half the country is set to potentially turn on them depending on how they handle this. They have been seen as much more political in recent years. If in fact they decide against Donald Trump in this and they decide that he is not immune, how does that play among the Republican base? And I mean, I think we've all been taught that the Supreme Court certainly shouldn't worry about that. But, it doesn't mean that they're not doing it. ALICE STEWART, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, &amp; REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: Right. And look, this will be a great test or a strong test to see how much the Supreme Court can put the blinders on, and focus just on the legal aspect here and not let politics play into their decision. But, we all know that will be extremely difficult. Look, politically speaking for Donald Trump, his base has doubled down. His base believes the nonsense that this was a political witch hunt and Jack Smith and every indictment is going after him because he is a political adversary. But, there are many people, many voters out there who -- six in 10 say I'm going to see where these cases go, and I want to see what kind of legal jeopardy he sends before I cast my ballot. And then, the timeline on this is very important. Jack Smith realizes this case he wants to try would go March 5. That is one -- or March 4, one day before Super Tuesday.",

But, how are aides to President Biden thinking about this period that's looming? SEUNG MIN KIM, WHITE HOUSE REPORTER, ASSOCIATED PRESS, &amp; CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, I think that you're seeing a more aggressive tag as of late coming from Joe Biden. And I think that's a lot of the recognition, obviously, among people close to Biden that Trump, barring some crazy last minute curveball in the Republican primary contest, he is going to be Joe Biden's general election challenger. And I do think just talking to senior Democrats privately, they feel that the insanity of the Trump era and also just the gravity of these 91 criminal charges spaced out in these four criminal indictments, not to mention the civil cases that he is going through right now, that's kind of faded weirdly from public's minds, because they are so focused -- for people following politics, they are looking at what Joe Biden is doing in office, what -- how the President's policies are affecting them. They feel that -- Democrats, some Democrats privately feel that people have kind of forgotten about Trump. So, they are very focused on reminding people what this man is, and in their view, this is someone who is a threat to democracy. President Biden has said that repeatedly, particularly as of late. This is someone -- they've warned about the various policies that he would resurrect should he be back in the White House in 2025. That is a contrast --",

      "sentences": "Well, President Biden has said that he is willing to make significant compromises when it comes tothose border rules, because at the end of the day, they believe that this Ukraine aid will dry up by the end of the year. And they're warning of fairly dire consequences if Congress does not approve the $60 billion that President Biden has requested. But, as Zelenskyy makes his way through Capitol Hill, as he makes his way here later today, I think that the prospects that this is going to break the impasse are pretty low. Republicans do seem dug in on the idea of linking these two things together. And Congress is set to leave by the end of the week. There is no real prospect that they will be able to make that deadline, and I think that that is causing real concern at the White House about what happens going forward. And for Zelenskyy, the problem is that this is not necessarily something that he will be able to unlock with his own appeals. He doesn't have any say over the U.S. southern border. And so, even though the White House believes that he is sort of his own best advocate when it comes to providing Ukraine with more assistance, it is this question of the border that is going to have to be solved before anything can get done on Ukraine, and that is causing some real concern at the White House. And so, you have seen Zelenskyy today meeting with senators, the discussions behind the scene. A lot of Republicans raised their concerns with him about corruption in Ukraine. He tried to alleviate some of those concerns. He is also meeting with the House Speaker Mike Johnson before he comes over here to the White House. And it really is such a different moment than the last time he was here, the last two times he was here, when he was sort of welcomed with this bipartisan show of commitment. There are now real concerns about how strong that commitment can be going forward, Kasie.",

You may need border state members to do it, or people who have cut deals in the past to do this. So, it's unfortunate.

They have not provided us the clarity and the detail that we requested over and over since literally 24 hours after I was handed the gavel as Speaker of the House.

The border is an absolute catastrophe, and this is because of the policies of this White House and this administration. We had 12,000 illegal crossings on one day last week alone, on Wednesday. We have almost now 280 known terrorists that have been apprehended at the border. None of this counts the gotaways. If you add the numbers up, it's almost seven million people who have been encountered at the border, just since President Biden took office, and at least two million gotaways. This is twice the population in my state of Louisiana. Fentanyl is the leading cause of death for Americans aged 18 to 49 in this country, fentanyl poisoning, because it's allowed over the border.

And we needed a transformative change at the border. Thus far, we've gotten neither. The Senate has been MIA on this. The House passed H.R. 2 six months ago, more than six months ago. It's been sitting and collecting dust on Chuck Schumer's desk. I have told him personally.
